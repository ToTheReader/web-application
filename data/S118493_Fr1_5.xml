   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>OVRTEOVS REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I purpose heere to set downe
the admirable &amp; renowned Lyfe
of <hi>S. Francis Xauier:</hi> a man spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
borne for the saluation of <hi>India,</hi> and the
furthest Easterne world. Of all the nine first Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of our Holy Father <hi>S. Ignatius</hi> of <hi>Loyola,</hi> he
most resembled his Mayster: and of the Society was
the first who laboured in <hi>India, Iaponia,</hi> &amp; those
barbarous Countries, opening the way both for the
Indians vnto heauen, &amp; for the Society into <hi>India;</hi>
wherby he brought no lesse renowne, then left exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to his Order. For which cause, the whole Society
not without good reason, desired long since to haue so
fayre a Pourtraicte, beautified with such admirable
vertue, liuely drawne in colours for Ours to behold;
seeing the glorious exploits of Predecessours, do cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
inflame the harts of generous spirits, with a
<pb facs="11"/>
certaine kind of heauenly fire, which hardly can be
quenched, vntill by imitation they become true pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes
of their noble Vertues.</p>
   <p>Now, as on the one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ide I perceaued, that other
Authors in their Histories, had with great honour,
touched <hi>Xauerius</hi> chiefest acts: so was I on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ide not a little grieued, that for the space of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
35. yeares, there had bin none who thought v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the setting forth his life (then shining with so
many and so illustrious vertues) in a proper volume
by it selfe, either by giuing that charge, to some
other, or by vndertaking it themselues. VVherfore
being moued of late, as well through perswasion of
some dearest friends, as (which is more) by the
command of Superiours to vndertake the same, I
was put in some hope to performe, what others had
conceaued of my ability therin; &amp; for my deuotion to
<hi>Xauerius,</hi> I was not only not vnwilling, but very
willing also, as tyme should afford, to set vpon this
taske, to th'end the memory of a man so worthy, yea
euen of immortality it self, &amp; who triumpheth now
in heauen, might be renewed, not only to the minds of
our owne Religious, but to Posterity also.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, it seemeth vnto me, this falleth out, not
so much by humane, as diuine prouidence, that euen
<pb facs="11"/>
at this tyme his most industrious and laborious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of life, should be layd open to the view of Ours,
when as we behould such a glorious haruest of soules
brought in from those far countries, which by him
were first cultiuated &amp; manured. For now the newes
is brought vnto vs, of the conuersion of many great
Princes &amp; Kings of <hi>Iaponia,</hi> with almost all their
people, to the Christian faith; and of a passage also,
through Gods assistance, made into <hi>China</hi> for the
preaching of the Ghospell there, which was hertofore
by the Diuels craft wholy stopped, &amp; euen rāpier'd
vp aswel with walles, as lawes. Both which certainly
next after God, we must attribute to holy <hi>Xauerius</hi>
who not only lead the way to our Society for the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of those Nations, but left that enterprize
also fully ready, and easy to be compassed.</p>
   <p>VVherfore my intention is to set downe heere in
writing the life of this most Blessed man, being full
of all variety of matter. And though my VVill and
Desire be more ready to obey, then either Ability or
Hope to satisfy; yet confiding in <hi>Xauerius</hi> praiers
for whose sake I vndertooke the worke, and also in
the diuine power of Obedience, I trust my Forces wil
in some sort be answerable to my VVill, &amp; my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours
to Expectation. The which, if through my
<pb facs="12"/>
slendernes I be not able to bring to passe; yet shall I
gaine this much at least, that my endeauours, how
poore soeuer, may serue to stirre vp others, more
studious &amp; industrious, to vndertake the same And
howsoeuer it falleth out, I will neuerthelesse reserue
this comfort to my selfe, that I haue bin obedient to
my chiefest Father, and (as much as in me lay) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured
to preserue the memory of so great, and
holy seruant of God. For peraduentnre I may giue
future Ages to vnderstand from what seed so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
a haruest of new Christians, in those desert
places, hath sprunge, whereof that most industrious
and skilfull Husbandman, <hi>who sowed in teares,</hi>
hath <hi>with abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ndant ioy,</hi> brought his handfull
home. And albeit our Predecessours haue studied
more how to expresse the worthy acts of <hi>Francis</hi> in
their deeds, then put them downe in writing; yet
will I gather only that which is either extant in
approued Authors, or els is come vnto my hands frō
those who haue byn present, or haue had them from
eye witnesses of the same.</p>
   <p>First then, concerning his infancy and childhood
I shall set downe some few things, which my selfe
came to know by <hi>Martin Azpilqueta</hi> of <hi>Nauar</hi>
(some few months before his death) a man for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb facs="12"/>
and learning famous, who was both kinsman, &amp;
in former times companion also to <hi>Xauerius.</hi> For
the rest of his life, those who conuersed with him,
when his vertue did not so greatly appeare, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to obserue; but when as afterward it began to
shew it selfe vnto the world, the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>
cōmanded his acts to be more carefully obserued, &amp;
put downe in writing; &amp; for this reason we haue not
all the parts of his life furnished alike with vertues
and worthy deeds. Nor do I thinke that those who
knew the life of our Father <hi>Ignatius,</hi> will take any
great delight in reading the beginnings of <hi>Xaueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
or those first actes of his feruēt vertue, as known
for the most part vnto thē already, but will rather
make hast to those other of his notable Acts in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia:</hi>
yet must they remember, that seing from those
first beginnings <hi>Xauerius</hi> became so noble a souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>r
of Christ (although for iust causes his deeds haue
byn related otherwhere) they ought not therfore
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o be passed ouer with silence in their proper place.
But now let vs come vnto his life it selfe, where
we will first speake of his parentage, which was
very Noble, on either side.</p>
