   <head>TO THE WELL meaning Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hink not euill, if thou meanest well, wee intend not to insult over him that is downe, or to pursue a man that is flying of himselfe: but to lend him a hand that knoweth not well which way to take. M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Iohnson in deed, is rather to bee pitied, then much opposed: wee need but stand still as lookers on: hee falleth willingly on his owne sword but that his fall may bee a rising againe, not onely to himself, but to others also, both armour-bearers &amp; followers of his: it was iudged necessarie, to guide them a litle while their heads are dizzy, &amp; bring them fairly from of the bogge they haue stood on.</p>
   <p>It is not M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Johnson that is dealt with alone
<pb facs="3"/>for change the name onely, and put in M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Ains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, or any such: themselues will not say but the reasons are theirs, and the answer, to them, as well as to him. Jt may bee that they hauing lesse acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with logicall formes of dispute, will looke for large discourse, or heaped quotations out of scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. But reason will tell them, that many words doe rather hide them vntie the knot of a syllogisme: and much quoting may proue some-thing, but ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wereth not directly to any thing. Now the wrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters meaning was, not to gather proofes, but to poynt at the weaknesse of such as these men haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. Read therfore with vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and learn a mean betwixt <hi>All</hi> and <hi>Nothing.</hi>
