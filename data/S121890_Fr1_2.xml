then eloquently, for it is my custome to speake as I

   <p>In plainenesse therefore vnderstand, that in some

      </gap>, as in supposing a Duke of

      </gap>ies families: for
which some may wittily accuse me; but my defence shall be as honest,
as many reproofes vnto me have beene most malicious. Since (I har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
protest) it was my care to write so farre from reasonable offence,
that even strangers, in whose state I laid my Scene, should not from
thence draw any disgrace to any, dead or living. Yet in dispight of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devors,
I vnderstand, some have beene most vnadvisedly over-cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in mis-interpreting me, and with subtilitie (as deepe as hell) have
maliciously spreadill rumors, which springing from themselves, might
to themselves have heavily returned. Surely I desire to satisfie every
firme spirit▪ who in all his actions, proposeth to himselfe no more ends
then God and vertue do, whose intentions are alwaies simple: to such
I protest, that with my free vnderstanding, I have not glanced at dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of any, but of those, whose vnquiet studies labor innovation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of holy policie, reverent com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

for the rest of my supposed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>artnesse, I feare not, but vnto every wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
minde it will be approved so generall and honest, as may modestly
passe with the freedome of a Satyre. I would faine leaue the paper; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one thing afflicts me, to thinke that Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nes invented, meerely to be
spoken, should be inforcively published to be read, and that the least
hurt I can receive, is to do my selfe the wrong. But since others other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
would doe me more, the least inconvenience is to be accepted. I
have my selfe therefore set forth this Comedie; but so, that my infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
absence must much relye vpon the Printers discretion: but I shall
intreate, slight errors in orthographie may bee as slightly over passed;
and that the vnhansome shape which this trifle in reading presents,
may be pardoned, for the pleasure it once afforded you, when it was
presented with the soule of lively action.</p>
