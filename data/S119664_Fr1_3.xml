   <head>TO ALL GENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gentlemen, that fauour the sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Flowres of Artes bodily health, and eternall happinesse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entles, I haue (with your fauours) deciphered a Load-starre, in whose gleames shine good will, &amp; whose glory is made splendent with loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all loues onely grace. Sometime when Eagles haue tried their yong Birds with the Sun-beames, they wil direct their vndazeled eyes to gaze at the bright gleames of Poets, a lesse starre; whose twinkeling sparkelings may encrease their disports. And (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous hearts) if your eyes that haue viewd the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sun-shine of Artes graces, deigne (after the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of those mightie and magnanimous byrds) to beholde the dimme twinckeling of this vnperfect Load-starre; you shall not only hereafter giue life to my labors, but by your gentle acceptance, make me bold to aduenture the archtecture of some worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er worke. The subiect, which serues for the Zodiack to this wandring Starre (which cōtinues the yeerly course of the Day-starre, through the twelue Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall
<pb facs="3"/>
signes) is but meane; and therfore deserues no costly colours to make it seeme splendent: If thē it please any, so much (I account it the better) reckon it you estimable, by how much it can displease none. It may be some <hi>Zoylist</hi> will barke (as doo Wolues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Moone) following against it the humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous phrase of the base backbiter (all whose byrdes seeming to himselfe Swannes, and other winged foules but night Crowes) vomits forth to his owne shame, what hee supposeth should disgrace others credits: and wanting teeth (as dooth the infectious Serpent <hi>Porphyrius</hi>) not being able to bite, is by his suscepted enuious conceit (ingendred of the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of his owne singularitie (himselfe mostly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred. And what maisterdome is it to nip blossomes in their first spring? Can yoong byrdes flie till they proue and trie to plie their winges? Better kill Flies with a flap, than be idle; greater credit, to play small game with his owne charge, than great summes at a cast, to others cost; and more commendable, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish plaine labors, than to be reckoned mongst his acquaintance and friends for a sluggish loyterer. These weake reasons (Gentlemen) builded on a good ground, may not be denide to goe for currant, towards the free passe of this my pilgrim-like Starre, through the clymate of your acceptable eies: whose wandring course when you beholde, if you like it, loue it; if dislike it, I pray, leaue it; It hath tane ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by Astronomicall computation, at the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the gay Springtide, the 9. of March last past, in the 1599. yeare of the worldes redemption
<pb facs="3"/>
(noted by the vertue of an Easterne Starre to three Sages) and from the worldes first creation, and the dayes of olde <hi>Adam,</hi> 5562. when the Sunne tooke his direct entrance (following his accustomed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse) towards the first minute of <hi>Aries:</hi> which signe Astronomers about that tide tearme Equinoctiall, because then (when the Sunne enters therein) the dayes which in length were before shorter than the nightes, become with them checke-mate in equall Longitude. The naturall heate &amp; moisture of which pleasant time, makes euery creature (as well vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable as reasonable) to receiue comfort; and in their kinde, to encrease and multiply. When the chaunting birds eccho in the woods and fields, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a delectable kerelie; when the earth araide in her pride, and deckt with diuers colours, yeelds admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō to those, that cōtemplate on natures ornaments; which farre surpasse the reach of heauen-searching Art: And when, what pleasure may be obtained in Gardens (dyapred with sundry sorts of flourishing Roses and Flowers) or what solace, to see the sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging meades and pastorall Countries; and what health may bee had by following Phisicke rules; is both sought and practised. The worst is, that the coniunction then of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturne</hi> (noting a corruptnesse of the aire) may bee coniectured that many shall bee tormented with a chollericke &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie frenzie; which disease if it chance to breed enmitie mongst the friends of mutuall Louers, may hap to increase their grieuous sorrowes. Thus much
<pb facs="4"/>
I thought most conuenient to haue noted, as a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludium</hi> to the originall and first arising of this Load-starre, whose lustres (Gentles) I doubt not, but your kinde aspects beholding, will indeuour to make it seeme resplendent and rarely bountifull.</p>
