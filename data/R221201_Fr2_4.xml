   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>The day of the grants of the aforesaid order touching benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, was to my best remembrance the 10 of <hi>July,</hi> 1626. at <hi>White-hall,</hi> by the Lords of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s Majesties Privy Councel, being then by them ordered to be paid unto the Masters and Wardens of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, ever from time to time before hand, and upon all services for his Highnesse; and for the better performance thereof, the said Noble Lords were pleased to pray the Lord Treasurer to take knowledge thereof, and to cause the monies accordingly to be forthwith issued as aforesaid, as for a supply for the providing of Physical drugs and medicaments. And further the said Honourable Lords were then pleased to order, that all such other monies as usually had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by way of imprest to any Surgeons in His Majesties service, towards the providing and further fitting of their Surgery-Chests, should together with the former monies be likewise paid into the hands of the said Masters and Wardens, ever for the time being in dew time and before hand; who for the better effecting of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and service aforesaid, were ordered to see the said monies faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and frugally bestowed, and should for the surer performance of it, orderly have the making, ordering, fitting, and compounding of all the medicines, as well physical as chirurgical; as also all other provisions belonging to a Surgeons Chest; or to appoint such others for the effecting the work, as they should at their perils answer for their faithful performances: All which Chests and provisions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever therein so fitted and provided as aforesaid, being ready, the Master and Wardens are by the said order commanded to see every of them to be safely delivered under lock and key, unto His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties officers whom it may concern at <hi>Tower-wharfe;</hi> that all things therein provided and inclosed might the safelier come on board the ships, for which they are designed: All which allowances, Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Priviledges and Commands, were then by the said most Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lords thought fit to be for ever hereafter continued to all ships or Fleets in his Highnesse future services, as is more plainly manifest by the said order; the which no doubt is extant, and unto which if occasion require, relation may be had.</p>
   <p>Thus loving Brethren, having acquainted you with these his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties favours unto our Corporation, it followeth in my duty that I should acquaint the younger sort of Surgeons with the use of the Surgeons Chest, I mean the medicines in this <hi>Viaticum</hi> contained; in some methodical manner, according to the insuing expressions of the following Treatise, were it not that time hastens me to an end, before <hi>I</hi> begin: Yet neverthelesse I have shrained of time to lend the yonger sort a word or two in this <hi>Viaticum,</hi> not to al as a Teacher, but as a loving remembrance to the elder, which I pray you to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruse as you have occasion. And so in Gods name without painting of phrases or collecting of great Authours for my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ouchers; my Method you know by the plainnesse of the stile; the which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is no other then the old beaten Path-way of all Surgeons, wherein each Artist ought to be experienced. And If any Artist
<pb facs="152"/>
by forgetfulnesse erre, desire to informe his memorie: And as for the younger sort, I know it is Charitie to shew them, for they have need, and ought to-desire and seeke knowledge, according to an old Doctrine of that sweet <hi>Lillie,</hi> in his Grammatical instructions, <hi>videlicet.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>
      <l>Qui dubitat, qui saepe rogat, mea dicta tenebit;</l>
      <l>Is qui nil dubitaet, nil capit inde boni.</l>
   </q>
   <p>In English to this effect.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Who doubts, enquires, and knowledge seeks, doth <hi>Lillies</hi> rules make good;</l>
      <l>Whilest he that's wise in his own conceit, puts on the Idiots hood.</l>
   </q>
   <p>And to conclude, I well knowing you could not alwayes have the advice of the grave and learned Artists at hand, in militarie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, I therefore presumed to the utmost of my latchet, hereby to afford you my following helps, which I hope by the friendly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will, if he want better, be taken in friendly part.</p>
