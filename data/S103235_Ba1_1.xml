   <head>The Author to the
Reader.</head>
   <p>GOod Reader, I must heere let thee vnderstand,
that the copie was not of mine owne writing, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
many things were defac't and omitted: and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
not in towne, I could not be alwaies present at the
Presse, so that I confesse many faults haue escaped; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the first sheetes, being begun in my absence, points
displaced, words mistaken, peeces of sentences omitted,
which doe much obscure the sense. As for example, pag.
69. lin. 6. these words are omitted, viz. <hi>For if the horse
knew his owne strength?</hi> then followes, <hi>but God deales
herein with other creatures, &amp;c.</hi> and many such like. I
was very sorrie, to see that, which was so meane in it selfe,
should be made worse: but presently I called to mind, that
the subiect of my booke, was onely to proue a generall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;
which corruption I should in effect seeme to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
and denie, vnlesse it might euery where appeare, and
therefore a necessitie did seeme so to ordaine it, that it
should first begin in the author, then in the pen, then in
the presse, and now I feare nothing so much as the euill
and corrupt exposition of the Reader, for thus there is a
generall corruption. How happie was I to make choice of
such a subiect, which seemes to excuse all the errors of my
Pamphlet? especially (good Reader) if I shall finde thy
louing and kinde acceptance, well hoping that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will be charitable to me, as I am most
charitable to al others, and so I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
thee to the God of
charitie.</p>
