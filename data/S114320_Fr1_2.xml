In the first, against all atheists and epicures: in the second, that Christian Catholic religion is the same in particuler, and more certaine in euery article thereof, then any humane or experimented knowledge, against Iewes, Mahumetans, Pagans, and other external enemies of Christ. Manifestly convincing all their sects and professions, of intollerable errors, and irreligious abuses</title>

   <head>THE EPISTLE OF THE AVTHOR TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S amonge all dutyes, and offices of Man, (deare Reader) there is none by infinite inequality, either so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent or deserued, as that Reuerence and Homage hee oweth to God, his moste Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raygne and Omnipotent Prince, in whom all pre-eminences and dignities are contemed, and from whom all benefittes and created prerogatiues are deriued: So among all other sciences and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of this worlde, none can bee in any degree so certayne and vndoubted, as that worshippe taught and reuealed of the same infinite wisedome and goodnesse which can neyther bee deceaued in him selfe, or bring others into error. Yet the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt malice and vngratitude of man hath growen great, that at this present our meanest Function and Obligation is not more neglected, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="3"/>
base, and contemptible things of this life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before that Supreame Honour, to which wee are bounde by so manie Titles. And the wilfull blindnes of prophane people reiecting the infallible Rule of Religious causes, and measuring secret &amp; supernaturall misteries by their owne shallow and depraued Iudgments, doe esteeme that moste cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vnchaungeable veritie of diuine Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, more doubtfull and vncertaine then recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted conceits of humane affairs. Thus hath Man by negligence and malice shewed vndutifull diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Creator, and abused his owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and will, so excellent powers of his intellectuall and immortall Soule, feeding the first with errors, and making vnlawfull appetites the obiect of the other: in such order that no sentence is so certayne, but one or other hath called it into question, no paradoxe so incredulous, but some em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, nothing so good, but it hath beene refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed nothing so lewd &amp; impious but some men haue approued it. The manyfold euen hundreds of false Religions, that haue inuaded, and now beare do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in the world, and the irreuerent and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liues of men and practise of al offences, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme, and Epicurisme them selues wil beare me witnes. Some wauering and staggering in fayth, others by this number of errors vncertayne what
<pb facs="3"/>
to beleeue, and those which make aduantage of such times, to procure excuse to their own impieties either in opinion the dutie of Religion, or in desire wish there were none at all, no God, no Heauen, no Hell, no Immortallitie after death, no pleasure but in filthinesse. Wherefore fullie to satisfie all English Subiects, I haue made demonstration, not onlye of the necessitie of a supernaturall Religion in generall, against all Atheists and Epicures: but by diuers Arguments by which true Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence may be prooued, or error impugned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, and farre both greater in number and more forcible then can be alleadged, to establish anie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: that onlie Catholike Christian worshippe is the same in particuler, against all enemies as well Iewes, Mahumetanes, Pagans, and other exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall aduersaryes, which I will performe with so much more breuitye, by how much I may hope there is lesse need thereof in a Christian Nation: as also against all Heretickes and internall enemies more at large, by aboue an hundred vnanswerable Reasons (as the present occasion more requireth, in which the former Infidels will likewise bee more plainly cōfuted) manifestly conuincing all theyr Sects and Professions of intollerable errors and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable abuses, even by the light of Nature, and without all shew or apparaunce of true Reuerence,
<pb facs="4"/>
hauing no groūde either natural, or aboue nature of such doctrynes, being onelie resolued into the lying &amp; manifest deceitfull, and false inuentions of the deuill and licentious deceauers: and contrariewise euerie Article of that worshippe I defend, by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments diuyne and humane, supernaturall and by nature, Testymonies of God and Creatures, Attributes, Properties, Offices, Prerogatiues, Endes, Effects, Name, Nature, and signes of true Relygion, and priuiledges of truth, to be the moste certayne knowledge in the worlde,<note place="margin">August. lib. 7. confess. c. 10.</note> as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (to vse S. <hi>Augustines</hi> example) or more vndoubted then that a man liuing is a liue, or any other manyfest veritie in nature, and resolued vnto the moste faithfull and vndeceaueable trueth of God, whereupon not onlie the whole substance, but euery priuate question thereof is builded. For which cause amongst others I haue named it a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of Religion,</hi> because it is resolued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that first and vnfallible veritie, which by no possibilitie can be deceaued. By which proportion in naturall Sciences, Philosophers affyrme those conclusions and arguments to be moste true, which can be resolued to the first principles which cannot be false. And as in practicall and compounded thinges, that composition and potion of Phisicke (to giue example) which as it is composed of diuers
<pb facs="4"/>
simples in it selfe, is not perfectlie to be discerned, what vertue and operation it hath, but if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to those parciculer things of which it is made, and theyr natures and effects declared, the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole confection is euydentlie prooued: euen so it is in that great and noble Composition of spirituall preseruatyues in Religious causes, as I haue declared. So that no particle or least question of diuine worshippe, though neuer so secrette in it felfe, can haue the least suspition of doubt, beeing resolued into that infinite wisedome. And as all errors, that can be deuised concernyng Religion, are defended by one of these three kindes of people, Atheists, Epicures and Nullifidyans, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie all worshippe: or by externall Infidelles, Iewes Pagans, and Mahumetanes, which although they professe a worshippe, yet they both disalow the true Reuerence, and <hi>Christ</hi> the author thereof; or by internall enemyes and hereticks, which though they acknowledge <hi>Christ</hi> for a true <hi>Messias,</hi> (which lykewise Mahumetes did) and that hee deliuered true Religion; yet they doe erre in the manner of worshippinge in particular: So will I prooue these three conclusions: that there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be vsed, against the first; that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which <hi>Christ</hi> deliuered is true, against the second; and to the third, that Christian Catholike
<pb facs="5"/>
Religion is the same. In proofe of which Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not onlie the true worshippe shall bee inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie prooued, but all doubtes, difficulties and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections of these misbeleeuers solued and resolued: For which cause also I haue intituled this worke a <hi>Resolution.</hi> And so I end humblie desirynge all Readers of these books, which by them shall eyther be confirmed in truth, or reclaymed from error, sometimes to vouthsafe to remember in theyr deuoutest pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the poore Author hereof.</p>
