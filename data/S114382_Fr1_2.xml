   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no man that can plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the universall Decree of God concerning the necessitie of Mans mortalitie: <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die:</hi> and every man can say as that wise woman of <hi>Tekoaeh, wee are all as water spilt upon the ground.</hi> There is no Age, Estate, Condition or ranke of men, but have beene foyled with that invincible Champion death; who ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up and downe the world upon his pale Horse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove these five thousand yeares, hath with an impartiall stroke laid all flat before him: some in their Infancie have proved what it is to die before they knew what it was to live; others in the strength of Youth; some in their Old age: rich and poore, high and low, of all sorts; young men may die, old men must die; even those that are stiled Gods (and that by no fawning Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophant, but by God himselfe) their mortality proves them to be men to themselves, though they be as Gods to others: and as <hi>Epictitus</hi> once told the Emperour, <hi>That to be borne, and to dye was common both to Prince and Beggar.</hi> The sicknesses and miseries of this world have made the proudest <hi>Painims</hi> to confesse with St. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Cornelius, Even I my selfe also am a mortall man:</hi> so that experience (as well as Scripture) concludes, <hi>what man is he that liveth and shall not see death?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
There are no ingredients in the shop of Nature that are sufficiently cordiall to fortifie the heart against this King of terrors or his harbingers: the velvet slipper cannot fence the foote from the gout, nor the gold ring the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from a fellon; the richest Diademe cannot quit the head-ach, nor the purple Robe prevent a Fever: Beauty, strength, riches, honour, friends, nor any, nor all can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale that sentence, <hi>Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt returne.</hi> Every fitt of an ague, and every distemper of this fraile constitution being as a light skirmish before the maine battell of death, wherein weake man being vanquished, is led captive to his long home: and when once the lines of mortalitie are drawne upon the face of the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest mortall, hee becomes a ghastly spectacle (how love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soever before) and the conclusion is, <hi>bury my dead out of my sight.</hi> This inevitable necessitie, however it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and acknowledged of all; yet lamentable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth that in the Christian world most men so live as though they should never die, and at length they so die as though they should never live againe, and when the time of their dissolution commeth, their soules are rather chased out by violence, then yeelded to God in obedience.</p>
   <p>Indeed to a wicked man death is the <hi>beginning of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,</hi> it is a trap-dore to let him downe to the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting dungeon of Hell; but the children of God (though they cannot scape the stroke, yet) they are freed from the sting of death, they can play upon the hole of this aspe without danger, and welcome the grimmest approch of this Gyant with a smile, being freed from the hurt of him, by <hi>Him</hi> that is the <hi>Captaine of the Lords Hoste, who hath abolished death, and brought life and immortalitie to light;</hi> so that the sting of it being plucked out, and the suffering san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Christ, death is become to every beleever but a <hi>darke entry</hi> to the glorious Pallace of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now as it is Gods tender mercy to his children, that
<pb facs="3"/>
their conflict and misery should be temporary, but their perfect happines eternall; so it should be their care in this little space of time alotted them, (whereupon their everlasting condition depends) so to provide that they may live happily where they shall live eternally: and since we cannot escape death, to prepare for it, that we may get the sight of this Basiliske before it approach; and so avoid the danger of it. Wretched is the estate of that man, who when these spirituall <hi>Philistims</hi> (the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of death) make warre upon him, shall have just cause to say, <hi>The Lord is departed from me:</hi> the death of such a one will bee like the sleepe of a franticke man, who when the malignant humour is concocted, awakes in a greater rage then he lay downe; whereas to him that is wise to consider his latter end, death is no way dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; death may kill him, but it cannot hurt him; it doth free him from temporary misery, but cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from eternall felicity: and as that noble Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who having gotten the victory over his enemies, but withall, received his mortall wound, he made this his grand enquirie, <hi>whether his weapons were safe or no? whether his buckler was not in his enemies hands?</hi> and when it was replied all was safe, he died with a great deale of cheerefulnes and fortitude. So when a Christian is to grapple with death, his maine care is that his Buckler of <hi>faith,</hi> and the helme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> of his <hi>salvation,</hi> his <hi>hope,</hi> that they be safe to guard his soule, and then he passeth not much what becomes of his outward man, hee dies in peace and confidence.</p>
   <p>Now that wee may bee fitted to encounter with this last enemy (besides the manifold helps which God hath reached to us in his word, in the passages of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the frequent examples of mortalitie before us continually, and in our owne sensible approaches to the gates of death; I say, besides these and infinite more,) this ensuing Volume (with so much care and paines
<pb facs="4"/>
compiled) by Gods blessing, and our endeavours, may prove no small furtherance in our Pilgrimage; <hi>Each Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon therein being as a severall Legacie bequeathed by those, upon the occasion of whose deaths they were preached as by so many Testators, who themselves have made a reall experiment of mortality, and left these for our instruction that survive them.</hi> It is true the dayly examples of mortaltie are so many reall Lectures, that by a kinde of dumbe oratorie perswade us to expect our end, but as they are transient, so our thoughts of them vanish, therefore it can bee no small ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ntage to have in continuall readines that which may furnish us abundantly with meditations in this kind.</p>
   <p>It was a custome in former times for men to make their sepulchres in their gardens, to mind them of death in the midst of the pleasures of this life. This present worke may not unfitly be tearmed a Garden, wherein whosoever takes a dayly walke, may gather in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall beds thereof those wholsome flowers and hearbs, which being distilled by serious meditation, will prove water of life to a fainting spirit▪ in some hee shall finde instruction, in some incitation, in others consolation, in all profit. Here thou shalt finde that <hi>Lethall gourd</hi> sprung up by <hi>Adam</hi> his transgression, that makes all his posterity cry out, <hi>There is death in the Pot.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>There thou mayst gather hearbs of grace, as a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-poyson against the malignity of death: in a third there is the spirituall <hi>Heliotro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>ium</hi> opening with joy to the Sunne of righteousnesse, the hope of a blessed resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Doe the glittering shewes of outward things make thee begin to over-fancie them? heere thou shalt finde how little they will availe in death: the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof will make them like that precious stone which being put into the mouth of a dead man loseth it's vertue▪ are thou over-burthened with afflictions? here thou art supported in the expectation of <hi>a farre more exceeding weight of glory:</hi> art thou ready to faint under thy
<pb facs="4"/>
labours? here thou shalt finde a time of rest, and of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: doth the time seeme over-long, that thy patience begins to flag? heere thou hast a promise of thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours speedy comming. In a word, be thy estate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition what it will be; heere thou mayst have both di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to guide thee, and comforts to support thee in thy journey on earth, till thou arrive at thy Countrey in Heaven.</p>
   <p>Certainely, there is no man can sleight and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value so deserving a Worke, but hee shall discover himselfe either to be ignorant, or idle, or ill affected; especially when so judicious and learned men have thought it a fit concomitant for their severall labours, which they have added for the accomplishment of it: Therfore take it in good worth, improve it for the good of thy soule; that being armed and prepared for death when it shall approach; thou mayst have no more to doe but to die, and mayst end thy dayes in a stedfast assurance, <hi>That thy sinnes shall be blotted out when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the</hi> LORD.</p>
