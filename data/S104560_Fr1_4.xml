                 <title>A treatise of metallica : But not that which was published by Mr. Simon Sturteuant vpon his patent, which is now by order cancelled and made voyd, by reason of his standing out-lawed at the time of the grant, and so still continuing, and his neglect, and not performance o the workes.

And containeth a briefe explanation, demonstration, or discouery of the inuentions priuiledged, and the meanes, instruments, engins, furnaces, &amp;c. with the materials, things, and workes to be made by the said fewels</title>

   <head>TO THE READER</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not my purpose to commend my Inuentions of making and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Mettals, and other Materials, and things with Sea-cole, and such other fewels: What I haue perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med herein, in that which hath been held most difficult, by making Iron with Sea-cole, is sufficiently knowne, to the full satisfaction of some iudiciall Iron-masters, Founders, and others experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in Iron-workes, who haue seene one of my Furnaces, and the workes therein done. Yet am I farre from arrogating all to my owne meere Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For howsoeuer the maine workes, and the vse of the priuiledged fewels thereabouts, with the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, haue beene deuised and acted by my selfe in the workes of most difficulty; yet many Instruments, operations, and meanes Metallicall, being necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be vsed for the better, more easie, and cheape working and effecting the workes, I do willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to the world, that the conferences and informations of many my good friends, who haue beene desirous to further these workes, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge granted by his Maiesty to me, haue added
<pb facs="4"/> much to my owne Inuentions, and giuen great light and furtherance, by meanes of diuers new-deuised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operations, instruments, and Engines: Onely thus much more I thought good to giue notice; That whereas it pleased the late most excellent Prince deceassed, vpon a grant of priuiledge obtained by his meanes for one Maister <hi>Sturteuant,</hi> for the like workes, to commit the trust of making and registring of all Indentures and Conueyances thereabouts, with acquittances vpon all receits of money, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profites thereby to Maister <hi>Ferrour</hi> of Graies-Inne, Esquire, his Maiesties seruant, to the end that euery aduenturer, and other that was to receiue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite thereby, might haue his due without deceit, or diminishment, which was also agreed vnto, and confirmed to Maister <hi>Ferrour,</hi> by grant of Maister <hi>Sturteuant</hi> vnder his hand and seale: which Patent is by reason of the neglect of performance by Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Sturteuant,</hi> and by his standing out-lawed at the time of the Patent granted, and still so continuing, become forfeited, made voyd, and cancelled. And the like priuiledge granted by his Maiesty to me; in regard whereof, and for that Maister <hi>Ferrour</hi> hath beene my chiefe assistant, and aide, to effect these workes, and an eye-witnesse of all my endeuours therin. And besides, I know and am priuy, that it was alwayes the purpose &amp; intention of the late Prince, that vpon my performance of these workes, and obtaining his Maiesties grant of priuiledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, Maister <hi>Ferrour</hi> should make and register all Conueyances and Acquittances that should bee made, by reason of my priuiledge, as he should haue
<pb facs="4"/> done, if Maister <hi>Sturteuants</hi> had remained in force: I haue therefore authorized Maister <hi>Ferrour,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, to make and register the same, giuing hereby knowledge therof to all whom it may concerne; and such as shall be willing, or desirous to aduenture, or deale in, or about any thing concerning ought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within his Maiesties Letters Patents to mee made and granted, that they may repaire to Maister <hi>Ferrour</hi> at his Chamber in Graies-Inne, or to such other place as he shall appoynt, wherein to write, make, and register the said Conueyances, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittances, where they may know of him, in what sort, and vpon what tearmes and conditions they shall be dealt with. And because some Aduenturers with M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Sturteuant,</hi> by his neglect &amp; forfeiture, were in danger to sustaine losse, such hath been his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Royall care of such as dis-bursed money, to, or with Maister <hi>Sturteuant,</hi> by, or vpon meere aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to forward the workes, that a speciall clause and prouiso is contained in the Indenture of Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to me made &amp; granted, that I am to performe and vndergoe such order for their recompence and satisfaction, as shall be held fit in equity by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Barons of his Highnesse Court of Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. But if such Aduenturers shall bee willing to make knowne the manner and truth of their Aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to me, or Maister <hi>Ferrour,</hi> and to treat with vs thereabouts, I doubt not but such conclusion shall bee made, as they shall not need to make any further complaint else-where for their reliefe. To print the whole patent is a worke both tedious and superfluous; only the Inducement of his Maiesties
<pb facs="5"/> grant, the tearme of yeares, the effect of the things priuiledged, and the distribution of the profites, is fit to be made knowne; to which end I haue caused an Abstract thereof to bee abridged out of the Indenture, and committed to the Presse, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Treatise of Metallica,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a briefe of the meanes, and manner of the workes inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And so I rest.</p>
