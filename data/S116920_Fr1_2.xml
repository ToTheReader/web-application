      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was said of old,<note place="margin">Ier. 23.15.</note> that from the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was wickednes gone forth, into the whole land: And, it may be said, as truly this day. that, the Sinns of the <hi>ministers,</hi> have infected, the whole Estate.</p>
   <p>Now indeed, by the rule of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> it must needs be so: <hi>If the light</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>which is in thee,</hi>
      <note place="margin">mat 6.23.</note>
      <hi>be darknes, how great is that darknes?</hi> If the calling, which should give direction to others, be it selfe corrupted how great must that corruption be? If the <hi>founteine</hi> be poysoned, all, that <hi>drinke</hi> thereof, must needs be in danger. I am, by the mercie, of him that hath called me, a Christian: therefore, cannot but even honour, the feete of Gods <hi>messengers:</hi> I am a <hi>minister,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 10.15.</note> and also am bound, to mainteine the credit, of the calling: but let my tongue, cleave to the roofe of my mouth, rather then I shoule use it, to the <hi>licking</hi> over those sores, which, except they be <hi>launced</hi> to the quicke, and <hi>searched</hi> to the bottome, can never be cured. And wretched is that <hi>kindnes,</hi> which goeth about, to heale the hurt of the <hi>church,</hi> with sweete words: saying, all is as it should be, when the <hi>garden</hi> of the Lord, lyeth, like the feild of the <hi>Sluggard,</hi> and his <hi>vineyard,</hi> like the <hi>vineyard</hi> of him that is idle: and <hi>Sion,</hi> even now,<note place="margin">Jer. 4.31.</note> as in time past, sigheth, and stretcheth out her hands, and

   <p>What man can see, the desolation of the Lords howse, by dumbe <hi>Idoles,</hi> incroaching <hi>Simoniacks,</hi> drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy <hi>Demasses,</hi>

The earnest desire, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by all good meanes, the speedy <hi>reformation,</hi> of theise grosse <hi>corruptions,</hi> stirred vp, the worthy <hi>Authour,</hi> of this fruitfull <hi>Sermon,</hi> being called to preach at a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>visitation</hi>) to imploy part, of that <hi>precious</hi> gift, where with the Lord, in a large measure, had endowed him, to that most necessarie, important purpose. As the <hi>text</hi> was excellent, for the thing intended: so hath he handled it: I <hi>speake</hi> my <hi>opinion,</hi> and doubt not, but thou wilt joyne with me, when thou shalt <hi>peruse</hi> it: except, thou art <hi>forestalled,</hi> either against the <hi>man,</hi> or against the <hi>matter:</hi> his handling of it, as may be seene, was such, as neither <hi>wrung</hi> in ought, that might be thought impertinent; nor omitted any <hi>observation,</hi> which the words, kindly, and voluntarily, might not afford. The <hi>sence,</hi> is delivered <hi>soundly:</hi> the <hi>division</hi> made <hi>artificially,</hi> the <hi>doctrines</hi> raysed <hi>naturally,</hi> prooved <hi>substantially,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. tim 2.15.</note> and applyed powerfully; heere is <hi>art:</hi> the words cut a-right, heere is <hi>learning,</hi> the declaration of the trueth, heere is <hi>eloquence</hi> in the plaine evidence of the <hi>spirit,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2 4</note> heere is <hi>zeale</hi> allayed with <hi>mildnes</hi> of the spirit, and <hi>sharpnes</hi> of reproofe, tempered with sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of exhortation.</p>
   <p>Such, as thou seest his <hi>Sermon</hi> to be, were his <hi>weekely</hi> exercises: such was his <hi>doctrine,</hi> such was his <hi>life,</hi> for

Few such <hi>Elthues,</hi> so full of matter: such <hi>Timothes,</hi> so nourished vp, in the words of faith,<note place="margin">iob, 32.18. 1. tim. 4.6 Esay. 57.2</note> and of good doctrine, which he <hi>continually</hi> followed. And as he walked, before God, in his life time: so now he <hi>resteth</hi> from his labours, in him: and is joyned to the <hi>company</hi> of innumerable <hi>Angels,</hi>

   <p>I pray <hi>God</hi> the reading it, may so worke with thee, that, if thou be a <hi>minister,</hi> it may either reforme thee; or incourage thee; according as, thou art either <hi>lyable</hi> to the <hi>reproofe,</hi> or, <hi>capable</hi> of the <hi>comfort</hi> herein contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: or, if thou be a private <hi>Christian,</hi> it may both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, &amp; increase in thee, a reverence, to the <hi>ministers</hi> of God: &amp; such a deepe <hi>detestation,</hi> of theise <hi>enormous</hi> corruptions, heere taxed: that thou mayst become a daylie <hi>suttour,</hi> at the <hi>throne</hi> of grace, that the <hi>Lord,</hi> for his owne name sake, and for his poore <hi>churches</hi> sake, would vouchsafe, spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to reforme them, Amen! {inverted ⁂}</p>

      <head>A post-script to the Reader.</head>
      <p>CVrteous <hi>Reader,</hi> we must renew the common, and ordinarie <hi>request,</hi> at thy hands: namely, to conceive the better, of such, as had the <hi>peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> and <hi>printing</hi> this <hi>Sermon:</hi> when thou shalt meete with some few places therein (for they are not many) more difficult, then can be wel vnderstood: &amp; other, petty, small faults, of the <hi>presse.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For the one, know, the <hi>Coppy</hi> came to vs miserably written, which therefore craved a necessitie of <hi>retrans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing,</hi> wherein were some places hard to be read: yet being loth, to leave out any sentence, or peice of a sentence, which we could make <hi>English</hi> of, we put some words downe, at a <hi>venture.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>For the other, know, that it was printed, where, our <hi>language</hi> is a stranger: and by such, as could neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand nor speake the same: and therefore, it could not be, but that more then ordinarie slips, and <hi>solaecis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> in our tongue, must be committed: but sticke not thou, at theise triffling errours; make vse of the solid, and substantiall matter, thou shalt find in the worke: and give God the glory of his owne trueth, tho in the light thereof, a little obscured, with the <hi>motes,</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more frailety, from shining, altogether so cleerely to thee. Fare well.</p>
