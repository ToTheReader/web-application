S. Paul geuing a rule how men shulde singe, first saith, I<note n="43" place="margin">.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi>
      </note> will singe in voice, and I will sing with vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding: and in an other place shewing what songes shulde be songe, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Ephesians to<note n="44" place="margin">Ephes. <hi>5.</hi> d.

As if the holy ghoste wolde saye, that the songe did inflame the heart to call vpon god, and praise him with a more feruent and lyuely zeale. and as musike or singinge is naturall vnto vs, and therfore euery man deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth therein: so our mercifull god set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before our eyes, how we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and singe to the glorie of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, recreation of our spirites, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="18" facs="10"/> of our selues. But as ther is no gift of god so precious or excellent, that Satan hath not after a sort drawen to him selfe and corrupt: so hath he most impudentlye abused this notable gifte of singinge, chieflye by the papistes his ministers in disfiguring it, partly by strange language, that can not edifie: and partly by a curious wanton sort, hyringe men to tickle the eares, and flatter the phantasies, not esteminge it as a gifte approued by the worde of god, profitable for the churche, and confirmed by all antiquitie. As, besides other places, is moste manifest by the wordes of<note n="45" place="margin">Epist. li. <hi>10.</hi>

For they that are skilfull in the hebrewe tounge by comparinge the psalmes with the reste of the scriptures easelie may perceyue the metre. and to whome is it not knowen, how the holy ghoste by all meanes soght to helpe our memorie, when he facioned many psalmes accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dīge to the lettres of the Alphabet: so that euery verse begīneth with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres therof in ordre? sometimes.

<pb n="21" facs="11"/> Nowe to make you priuie also, why we altered the ryme in certeyne pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of hym whome for the gyftes that God had geuyn him we estemed and reuerenced, thys may suffice: that in this our ētreprise, we did onely set God before our eyes and therfore wayed the wordes and sense of the Prophete: rather cōsideringe the meanyng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then what any man had wrytt. and chiefly beinge in this place where as moste perfite and godly iudgemēt dyd assure vs, ād exhortatiōs to the same en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>corage vs, we thoght it better to frame the ryme to the Hebrewe sense, thē to bynde that sense to the Englishe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. and so either altered for the better in suche places as he had not attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto, or els where he had escaped parte of the verse, or some tymes the whole, we added the same: not as men desyrous to finde fautes, but onely as suche which couuete to hyde theym, as the learned can iudge.
