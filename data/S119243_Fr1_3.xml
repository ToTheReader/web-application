   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>IRGIL</hi> sirnamed <hi>Maro,</hi> was borne but of meane parentage, especially on the fatherside, who was called <hi>Maro,</hi> whom some suppose to haue bin a potter, but moe thinke that he was at the first, couenaunt seruant w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> a traueilinge wyseman, and afterward for his towardnes, by mariadge of his daughter: became his soonne in lawe, whom when his father in lawe had put in trust with his husbandrie, and his catteyle, and byinge of wooddes, and lookinge to Bées, therby he increased his smale substance. He was borne the yéere y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <hi>Cn. Pompeius,</hi> and <hi>M. Licinius Crassus</hi> were first <hi>Consuls</hi> the .15. day of Octobre, in a village called <hi>Andes,</hi> not far from
<hi>Mantua.</hi> His mother <hi>Maia,</hi> beinge great with childe with him, and dreaminge that she was deliuered of a laurell bowe, which prickt into the grownde grew forthwith to a great trée, replenyshed with sundrie kindes of Frutes, and Flowers: the next morning walking forth into the countrey with her husband, stept a side, and was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therby, in a ditche. The report goeth, that the childe so soone as he was borne neuer cried, but looked so pleasantly, that he gaue an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hope that by his birth some notable thinge should chaunce.</p>
   <p>There befell also another strange token, for a <hi>Poplar</hi> trée branch, which was prickt into the grownd accordinge as the manner of the countrey at womens traueiles is, so grewe vp in short space, that it matched in bignes many great <hi>Poplar</hi> trées, that were set there long before, whiche was afterwarde consecrated, and called by the name of <hi>Virgils</hi> trée, and had in great reuerence amongst téemynge women, and such as were with child, which daily made prayers, and offringes there. His infancie, that is to say, vntill he was seauen yeare old, he passed in <hi>Cremona,</hi> and when he was thirtéene yéere of age he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the garment of manstate, when those were made <hi>Consuls</hi> agayne<pb facs="4"/>that were when he was borne, and it fortuned that <hi>Lucretius</hi> the poet departed the same day. But
<hi>Virgil,</hi> from <hi>Cremona</hi> went to <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> and shortly after from thence to <hi>Naples,</hi> where diligētly applying the studie of the <hi>Greeke,</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> toonges: at length betooke himself to <hi>Physicke,</hi> and knowledge of the <hi>Mathematicals,</hi> wherin he surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all other in skill, and departinge to <hi>Rome,</hi> fell in fauour with the M. of the horse to <hi>Augustus,</hi> and cured the horses of manie, and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie diseases. Who commaūded therfore that
<hi>Virgill</hi> shuld haue such allowance of bread, as other of the stable had.</p>
   <p>Duringe this tyme the <hi>Crotoniati</hi> sent vnto
<hi>Caesar</hi> for a present, a goodlye horsecolt, that in all mens iudgment would proue both verie couragious, and woonderfull swift. When
<hi>Virgil</hi> beheld him he told the M. of the stable, that he was fooled of a sicke, and infected mare, and that he would proue nether stronge nor swift, as afterward it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, wherof when the M. of the stable had enformed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: he cōmaunded that his bread shuld be dubled, for reward. Lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse, when there were certen Dogges sent to
<hi>Augustus</hi> foorth of <hi>Spayne, Virgil</hi> both told what maner ones the siers were, &amp; what sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and swiftnes they would be of. Which when he vnderstoode▪ he then commaūded agayne that
<hi>Virgil</hi> should haue so much more bread as he had before. The Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> doubtinge of himself whether he were sunne to
<hi>Octauius</hi> or to some man else, and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe that <hi>Virgil Maro</hi> could resolue him, that knew so well the natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res and siers of horses, and dogges: remoouing all companye aside <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> called him into the priuie chambre, and asked him there alone, if he knew what he was, and what abilitie he had to make men hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie? I knowe ({quod}
<hi>Maro</hi>) that thou art <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> and thou hast almost equall power with the immortall goddes and that thou mayst make happie whom thou liste. Surely ({quod} <hi>Caesar</hi>) I am of this mind, that if y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> answer mée truly to that I shall aske, I will make thée hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, and blessed. I wold to god ({quod}
<hi>Maro</hi>) that I could answere truly to that y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> demaundest. Then sayd the Emperour, some say I am sunne to <hi>Octauius,</hi> and some suspect that I am some other mans sunne. Wherat <hi>Maro</hi> smylinge: I will sone tell you that ({quod} he) yf you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me in answeringe that you commaūd. The Emperour swore by an Oth that he wold take neuer a worde in ill part, yea and that he shuld not depart vnrewarded. Therwithall <hi>Maro</hi> fixinge his eyes fast on the Emperours: it is an easie matter ({quod} he) by other lyuinge<pb facs="4"/>thinges to discerne the disposition of the parentes, through skill of
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematickes,</hi> and <hi>Philosophie,</hi> but in men it is not possible. Howbeit I am able to giue some probable iudgment, what trade of lyfe thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exercised. To this <hi>Augustus</hi> gaue diligēt eare what he wold say. Then <hi>Virgil,</hi> so far as I can perceaue ({quod} he) thou art a Bakers sun. The Emperour thereat was astunned, and marueiled much in his mind how that could come to passe. Marie then ({quod}
<hi>Virgil</hi>) I will tell you why I iudge so. When as I foretold certen thinges which could nether be knowne, nor vnderstoode but by such as be very wel lerned: thou that art prince of all the wordle commaundidst that I shuld haue a certen of bread giuen mée for a reward, which is the vse ether of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, or els of such as are bakers children. This merie iest, pleased the Emperour wel, but henceforth ({quod} he) y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> shalt not be rewarded by a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker but by a most valiēt prince, &amp; estéemed him much, and commendid him to <hi>Pollio.</hi> He was of bodie and stature bigge, of colour tawnie, hardfauoured, sycklie, for he was manytimes gréeued with payne in the stomack, iawes, and head, and some tymes he did spet blood. He fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented but litle the vse of deyntie meates and wyne. Some report that he was prone to the detestable sinne with boyes. But the better sort suppose rather that he loued them as
<hi>Socrates</hi> loued <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> also. Aboue the rest he loued most <hi>Cebetes,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom in the second <hi>Ecloge</hi> of his <hi>Bucolikes</hi> he termeth
<hi>Alexis,</hi> giuen vnto him by <hi>Asinius Pollio.</hi> When they came vnto him they were nether of them vnlearned. For <hi>Alexander</hi> was a good
<hi>Grammarian,</hi> and <hi>Cebetes</hi> a <hi>Poet.</hi> Some likewyse affirme that he had carnall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie with <hi>Plotia Hieria.</hi> But
<hi>Asconius Pedianus</hi> sayth that he was woont to declare to some auntient mē, that indéede he was reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by <hi>Varius</hi> iointly to kéepe her, howbeit he ernestly refused so to doe. In all other respectes he was of lyfe, language, and conuersation so vpright: that through all <hi>Naples</hi> he was called, commonly
<hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</hi> And when haply he was séene at <hi>Rome,</hi>
(whether as he came very seldom) going abroade in the open streetes if eny followed, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him: he wold turne away into the next house. When
<hi>Augustus</hi> offred him the goods of one that was banished, he vtterly refused them He was worth in substance an hundred <hi>Sestertia,</hi> which were giuen him through the liberalitie of his fréendes, &amp; he had an house in <hi>Rome</hi> in a place called <hi>Aesquiliae</hi> neare to <hi>Mecoenas</hi> gardaynes, although he was accustomed much to withdrawe him self into <hi>Campania</hi> and<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Scicil.</hi> Whatsoeuer he requested of <hi>Augustus:</hi> he neuer had deniall therof. Euery yéere he sent monie abundantly to succour his parentes which died when he was of lawfull yéeres, his father beinge blinde when he died, &amp; his two brethren the one surnamed <hi>Silo</hi> died while he was a child, and <hi>Flacchus</hi> when he was come to māstate, whose death he bewayleth vnder the name of <hi>Daphnis.</hi> Amonge other studies (as I haue sayd before) he chéefly applied himself to <hi>Physick</hi> and
<hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes.</hi> He neuer plead at barre more then one cause, and that but once, whom <hi>Melissus</hi> reporteth to haue bin very slow of toongue, &amp; as though he were altogither vnlearned, when he first began
<hi>Poëtrie,</hi> he made this <hi>Disthic,</hi> or these two verses vpon one <hi>Balista</hi> a scholema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that for reporte of théeuery was couerid with an heape of stones.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Vnder this hugie hill of stones <hi>Balista</hi> tombd doth lie,</l>
      <l>Waifarer saufe both night and day thy iorney now maist hie.</l>
   </q>
   <p>After this he wroat <hi>Moretum, Priapus, Epigrammes, Dirae,</hi> and <hi>Culex</hi> when he was yet but fiftéene yéere old, the argument wherof is this. A shepheard wearyed with heat, and sleapinge vnder a trée, when a serpent was cumming fast towards him, there came a Gnat flying out of the Fenne nearby, and lighted on the sheapheardes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head betwéene his temples, and there stunge him. Then he lyftinge vp his handes crushed the gnat, and when he espied the serpent: killed him also, and made a tombe for the gnat with this superscription.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Thou litle gnat, the shepheard for thy due desert to bee,</l>
      <l>This buriall rite, for losse of lyfe, here yeldeth vnto thee.</l>
   </q>
   <p>He wroat <hi>Aetna</hi> also, wherof some men doubt. But shortly after when he had begun <hi>Romane</hi> matters mislikynge the sharpnes, and roughnes both of the argument, and names, he fell to the
<hi>Bucolickes</hi> but cheifly to celebrate the name of <hi>Asinius, Pollio, Alphenus Varus</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Gallus,</hi> by cause y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in the deuision of land beyond <hi>Padus</hi> amongst the old souldiours after the conquest at <hi>Philippe</hi> made, at the cōmaundment of the
<hi>Triumuiri,</hi> or the Thre conspiratours, they had saued him harmlesse. Afterward he made his worke called <hi>Georgica</hi> in the honour of <hi>Mecoenas</hi> by whose meanes, when he was yet scarce knowne vnto him, he was assisted against the old soldiours of
<hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> or rather as some suppose, against the violence of
<hi>Arius</hi> the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turian,</hi> by whom in that hurlyburly about deuiding of landes, he was very neare slayne. Last of all he tooke the
<hi>Aeneidos</hi> in hand, a worke of a diuerse, and manifold argument, and resemblinge, in a maner<pb facs="5"/>both the workes of <hi>Homere.</hi> Besides that it contayneth indifferenly both wordes, and matter aswell
<hi>Greeke</hi> as <hi>Latine,</hi> and that cheife is which he most endeuored, it comprehendeth both the originall of the citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi> the Emperour. When he wroate the <hi>Georgica,</hi> it is reported, how that euerie morninge he was accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to write a certen numbre of verses, which he would all the day longe ouerlooke, and so abbridginge them, bringe them vnto a very fewe, not vnfitly sayinge that he brought forth verses, as the femall Bear doth her young and bringeth them into due fashion by lickinge. The worke called <hi>Aeneidos</hi> he wrote first in twelue bookes in prose (as some thinke) and afterward digested it into verse. And othersome iudge that if he had liued longer, he wold haue lēgthned it vnto xxiiij. bookes euen vnto the time of
<hi>Augustus,</hi> and wold haue touched many other thinges therin, and with great diligēce haue set forth <hi>Augustus</hi> tyme, since that in writing, least he shuld be vainly troubled with eny thinge: he left some thinges imperfect. And some thinges he wroate in very slender verse, which (as he was woont, to iest) he sayd he put in for Iesters, and Minstrels, to hold vp the worke, vntill the sownd pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were framed. He absolued his <hi>Bucoliks</hi> in thrée yéere, at
<hi>Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Pollios</hi> request. The same at that tyme ruled the prouince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Padus,</hi> by whose meanes and sute, when the
<hi>Cremonenses,</hi> and <hi>Mantuans</hi> lands were distributed vnto
<hi>Augustus</hi> auntiēt souldiours, yet notwithstandinge
<hi>Virgil</hi> lost not his. This <hi>Pollio, Virgil</hi> loued entierly, and was likewise of him very welbeloued agayne, and great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly rewarded, for when he was vpon a tyme desiered by him to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and there sodenlye surprised with the singulare beutie, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>Alexander, Pollios</hi> boye: receaued him of gift. Likewise he loued dearly <hi>C. Asinius, Pollios</hi> sunne, and <hi>Cornelius Gallus</hi> a noble Oratour and a singulare Poet, who trāslated <hi>Euphorion</hi> into
<hi>Latin,</hi> and wroate in fouer bookes his loue of <hi>Cytheris.</hi> At the first he was in good credite with the Emperour <hi>Augustus,</hi> but afterward vpon suspition of cōspiracie against him, he was slayne. Of whom <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> speaketh thus:</p>
   <q>
      <l>Whilst <hi>Gallus</hi> in the tentes, the ensignes doth defend:</l>
      <l>Before the Egle bloodie signe, he found his fatall end.</l>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Virgil</hi> loued this <hi>Gallus</hi> so well, that the fouerth booke of <hi>Georgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes</hi> from the middle to the end contayned his prayse, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at <hi>Augustus</hi> commaundment he changed into the fable of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staeus.</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>He finished the
<hi>Georgiks</hi> in seuen yéere at <hi>Naples,</hi> and the
<hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neidos</hi> he made partly in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> partly in
<hi>Campania,</hi> in eleuen yéere. And his <hi>Bucoliks</hi> he made with so good successe that they were often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times sunge openly by
<hi>Musitians</hi> in playes. When <hi>Cicero</hi> had heard certen of the verses, and by and by through sharpe iudgment percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that they procéeded from no commune veyne: he willed that the whole
<hi>Ecloge</hi> shuld be reade from the beginninge. Wherto when he had attended diligently, in the end he said these words <hi>Of mighty Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me a second hope,</hi> as though himself were the first hope of the
<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> toongue, and <hi>Maro</hi> wolde be the second, which wordes also he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth in the <hi>Aeneidos.</hi> The <hi>Georgikes,</hi> when
<hi>Augustus</hi> returned from the <hi>Actiacan</hi> victorie, and for recreationsake soiourned at <hi>Atel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> he read there vnto him continually the space of fouer dayes, and when his voice failed him at eny time: <hi>Mecoenas</hi> supplied his romth in readiynge. He pronunced with meruelous swéetnes, and great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation. <hi>Seneca</hi> writeth that <hi>Iulius Montanus</hi> the <hi>Poet</hi> was woūt to say, that he wold take away by force some thinge from <hi>Virgil</hi> if he could set them forth with the same voice, coūtnance, and gesture▪ And that the selfsame verses if he pronounced them, wold sound well, but without him: wold be drie and dumbe. Of the <hi>Aeneidos</hi> scarce yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, there was spread such a fame: that <hi>Sextus Propertius</hi> doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not thus to foretell.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Giueplace you <hi>Romane</hi> writers all, and <hi>Greekes</hi> giueplace likewise</l>
      <l>I can not tell what greater worke then <hi>Ilias</hi> doth arise.</l>
   </q>
   <p>When <hi>Augustus</hi> by fortune was absent from the
<hi>Cantabrick</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and partly by requestinge and partly by manacinge letters, merely required of <hi>Virgil</hi> that he shuld send to him if it were but the verie title or some one full sentence of
<hi>Aeneidos,</hi> for those were his words: he refused so to doe. To whom yet not longe after when the matter was fully perfected, he recited thre bookes, namely the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the Fourth and the Sixt. And that especially, bycause of <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia,</hi> who beinge there present at the recitall, at those verses of her sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, <hi>Marcellus thou shalt be,</hi> is reported to haue fainted for sorowe, and when by much labour she was recouered agayne, she commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>Virgil</hi> shuld haue to the value of fiue poūds for euerie verse. He read his bookes also to diuerse, but not oft, &amp; those places only whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rof he stoode in eny doubt, therby to heare the iudgment of men Yt is sayd that <hi>Erotes</hi> his secretarie, whom he also made frée, when he was<pb facs="6"/>very aged was woont to report, that once in the readinge of his worke he made two of his half verses out of hand, and that <hi>Misenus Aolides</hi> added,
<hi>was better none then he.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Lykewyse vnto this verse, <hi>In kindlinge men with noyse,</hi> with like heat he adioyned, <hi>And fightinge fields to cheere with brasse,</hi> &amp; that he was commaunded strayt wayes to wryte those ij. additions so in the worke. He perused both his
<hi>Bucoliks</hi> and <hi>Georgiks.</hi> And when he was 52. yeare old, to thintent to finish the <hi>Aeneidos,</hi> he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to withdrawe him self into <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Asie,</hi> and there to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploye whole thre yeares in correctinge and perusinge, that he might bestowe all the resdue of his life only in the studye of <hi>Philosophie.</hi> But when he was in his iourney, and met with <hi>Augustus</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> who was returninge forth of the East cuntreyes towards <hi>Rome:</hi> he purposed to goe home agayne with him. And trauailinge to <hi>Megara,</hi> a towne nigh <hi>Athens,</hi> only to sée it, tooke there a sicknesse, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall trauaile on sea augmented, and encreasinge more and more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he came to <hi>Brūdusium</hi> with in fewe dayes after dyed there, the xxj. day of September when <hi>Cn. Plautius,</hi> and <hi>Q. Lucretius</hi> were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls.</hi> Who when he felt him self mortally assaulted with the maladie: he called often, and very ernestly for his deske, that he might burne the <hi>Aeneidos.</hi> Which beinge deneid him, he willed notw<seg rend="sup">t</seg>stādinge by his last testament that it shuld be burned, as a work both faultie, and vnperfect. But
<hi>Tucca</hi> and <hi>Varrus</hi> told him that <hi>Augustus</hi> wold in no wyse suffre that. Wherruppon he bequeathed the same worke, and his other writinges vnto <hi>Varrus</hi> and <hi>Tucca</hi> vpon this condition, that they shuld set forth nothinge but that which he wold haue set forth, and such verses as were vnperfect: they shuld so leaue them. He willed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that his bones shuld be borne to <hi>Naples,</hi> wheras he had lyued longe tyme, and merely. His bones therfore were translated to
<hi>Naples,</hi> at <hi>Augustus</hi> commaundment, as he apointed, and were buried in the way to <hi>Puteol.</hi> at the second stone, and vpon his tumbe was writen this disthick, which he made him self.</p>

   <p>He made heyers of half his goods <hi>Valerius Proculus</hi> his half bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by another father, &amp; of the fourth part, <hi>Augustus,</hi> of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> twelfth part <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> of all the remainder <hi>L.

   <p>There remayne also many noble verses made by

   <q>
      <l>And shall a wicked work so vile a deede in finall voice</l>

   </q>
   <p>Wherfore <hi>Varrus</hi> at <hi>Augustus</hi> commaundment did set forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge, as <hi>Virgil</hi> willed he shuld not: but generally perused all, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing also those verses as they were, still vnperfect. Whiche verses diuers afterward tooke in hand to make vp, but they could not for the difficulty therof, for they be all <hi>Hemistichia,</hi> that is to say half verses, besides this: <hi>Whom <hi>Troy</hi> vntimely bare thee,</hi> which séemeth to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with it perfect sense.
<hi>Nisius</hi> the <hi>Grammarian</hi> said that he had heard of his elders, that <hi>Varrus</hi> had changed the order of two bookes, and that which was then the Second he transposed into the third place. And that he changed also the beginninge of the First booke, takinge these verses cleane away:</p>
   <q>
      <l>I that my slender Oten pipe in verse was woont to sound</l>
      <l>Of wooddes, and next to that I tought for husbandmē the groūd</l>
      <l>How frute vnto their greedy lust they might cōstraine to bringe,</l>
      <l>A worke of thankes: loe now of <hi>Mars,</hi> and bloody warres I singe.</l>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Virgil</hi> also amongst other, who was one of the pillers of the <hi>Latin</hi> toongue, lacked not slaunderers. In his <hi>Bucolickes, Paro,</hi> but very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshly, mocketh at two <hi>Ecloges,</hi> and thus he beginneth to flout.</p>
   <q>
      <pb facs="7"/>

   <p>And in the next.</p>

      <l>Whose beastes are these Damaetas, tell, is this god
<hi>Latine</hi> speach?</l>
      <l>No but tis <hi>Aegons,</hi> for our clownes in cuntrey so do teach.</l>
   </q>
   <p>Another also when he read this place out of the <hi>Georgiks: Eare naked, naked sowe:</hi> he added, <hi>then cold, and feuer thou shalt take.</hi> There is also extāt a boke made by <hi>Carpilius Pictor</hi> vnder this title, The <hi>Aeneidos</hi> scourge. <hi>M. Vipranus</hi> sayde that <hi>Mecoenas</hi> had set vp a finder out of an euell imitation, and that he was nether loftie in Stile, nor low, but that he made that worke with commune vulgare wordes. <hi>Herennius</hi> only gathered togither his faultes, and <hi>Perilius Faustinus,</hi> that which he stole of others. There are also certē volumes of <hi>Quintus Octauius Auitus,</hi> in the which are obserued what ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and from whome he tooke them. <hi>Asconius Pedanus</hi> in his booke which he writeth against the slaunderers of
<hi>Virgil,</hi> setteth downe a fewe thinges which were obiected against him, and this chiefly, that he tied not wel his historie togither, and that he borowed much of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere.</hi> But this fault (as they say) he was woont thus to defend, saiyng why do not they likewyse attempt the lyke théeft? But they if they wayghed it vprightly shuld vnderstand that it were an easear mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to pulle the club out of <hi>Hercules</hi> hand, then to take a verse away from <hi>Homere,</hi> and that notwithstandinge he determined to withdrawe himself for a time to amend euerie thinge that his ilwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers found fault withall.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pedianus</hi> also reporteth, that he was very curteous, and a louer of all good and honest men, and so far from Enuie, that if he sawe eny thinge done, or spoken lernedly by eny, he reioyced therat, none otherwyse then if it were his owne: that he dispraysed no man, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed goodmen, and was of so gentle nature: that there was no man, vnlesse he were ouer stubberne and malicious, that not only fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, but also hartely loued him. He séemed to haue nothinge priuate to himselfe. His library stoode as ready open to othermen as to himself, and he oftentimes vsed the sayinge of <hi>Euripides: All thinges amongst freendes are commune.</hi> He had all the Poetes of his tyme so freendlye, and beholdinge vnto him, that although they much enuied one another, yet him they all reuerenced, as <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Tucca, Horace, Gallus, Propertius,</hi> But <hi>Anser,</hi> by cause he tooke not part with <hi>Antonius,</hi> dyd not regard him. <hi>Comificius</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>could not abyde him, such was his froward nature. He so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned glorie, that when some ascribed to them selues certen of his verses, and therfore were accoumpted the better learned, he tooke it not only not displeasantly, but he much reioysed therat. And makinge a couple of verses contayninge the prayse and felicitie of <hi>Augustus,</hi> which were set vpon the gates with out name, the verses were these.</p>
   <q>
      <l>All night it raynes, the sights at morning tide returne againe,</l>
      <l>And Caesar with almighty Ioue hath match and equal raigne.</l>
   </q>
   <p>The authour of which verses <hi>Augustus</hi> longe made enquirie for, but he could not finde him. At length when none came,
<hi>Bathyllus</hi> an indifferent good Poet, ascribed them vnto himself, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore encoraged, and rewarded by <hi>Caesar,</hi> which
<hi>Virgill</hi> not takynge well, set vpon the same gates this beginning foure times: <hi>So you, not for your selues. Augustus</hi> required that these verses should bée by some finished, which many assaying in vayne: <hi>Virgil</hi> thus replied, to the forewritten
<hi>Disthic.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>
      <hi>These verses</hi> I <hi>did make, therof another tooke the prayse.</hi>
      <l>So you not for your selues, poore birds, your nestes do build in trees</l>
      <l>So you not for your selues, yee Sheep, do beare your tendre flees.</l>
      <l>So you not for your selues, your hony gather, litle Bees.</l>
      <l>So you not for your selues, your neckes, poore beastes, with harrowes squees.</l>
   </q>
   <p>Which beyng once knowne: <hi>Bathyllus</hi> for a time was all the iest ingstocke to the whole citie of <hi>ROME.</hi> When on a time he had the workes of <hi>Ennius</hi> in his hande, and beyng demaunded by one what he did with thē: answered y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he gathered golde out of <hi>Ennius</hi> dounge. For that authour expresseth worthy sentences &amp; matter, vnder words not of the finest. Vnto <hi>Augustus</hi> that demaunded of him how a Citie might best be gouerned: he answered, if the wisest men did holde the helme, and good men were set in aucthoritie ouer euell, and so that the best men may haue their due honour, and the rest be not in iuriously dealt withall. Then <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> what thing is it ({quod} he) that neuer bringeth lothsomnesse to man? The likenesse, answered
<hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> or the abundance of euery thinge, anoyeth vs, except of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng. He asked moreouer, how a man might alwayes preserue his happie and fortunate state? To whom then <hi>Maro,</hi> if by how much he excell other in Honour, and Ritches: he endeuour to excell them in Liberalitie an Iustice. He was wount also to say, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng more méet nor commodious for a man then Pacience, and that<pb facs="8"/>there was no fortune so sharpe which by wisely tolleratyng a valient man might not ouercome. Which opinion of his, he hath expressed in the fist of the
<hi>Aeneidos.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>
      <l>O Goddesse sun, where destnies drawes &amp; driues: let vs go there,</l>
      <l>What euer it is, who conquer fortune will, must fortune beare.</l>
   </q>
   <p>There was familiar with <hi>Augustus</hi> one named
<hi>Filistus,</hi> an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and méetly wel learned in Poetrie, and had a pleasant, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able witte, and vsed to carpe the saiynges of all men, not to th'intent thereby to learne the truth (for so
<hi>Socrates</hi> was woont to do) but ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to appeare the better learned. The same, wheresoeuer he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to méete with
<hi>Virgil</hi> or be in his companie, vsed to prouoke him with reproches, and floutes. Wherfore, either he departed commonly with silence, or els with blusshing held his peace. Then when as in presence of
<hi>Augustus,</hi> he sayde that <hi>Virgil</hi> was dumbe, and that if he had a toongue he coulde not defend himself: hold thy peace babler ({quod} he) for this taciturnitie of myne causeth <hi>Augustus,</hi> and
<hi>Mecoenas</hi> to be the patrones of my cause, and when I list I will speake with suche a trumpet, that shall euerywhere, and very longe be heard. And thou with thy pratlyng dost not only breake mens eares, but walles also. Then the Emperour looked vpon <hi>Filistus</hi> with a fierce countenance, and rebuked him. And <hi>Virgil, Caesar</hi> ({quod} he) if this man knew a time to holde his peace: he would seldome speake. For a man ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be silent, vntill such time as his silence shall either hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or his talke may profit others.</p>
   <p>When <hi>Augustus</hi> had obtayned the Empire, he debated with him self whether it were better to resigne vp the Dominion, and commit the state to yéerely <hi>Consuls,</hi> and the gouernment of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to the <hi>Senate.</hi> In which case he called to counsell twayne, of two seuerall opinions, <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa. Agrippa</hi> in longe discourse shewed, that although it were not very decent for him to do, yet would it be profitable, which contrarie,
<hi>Mecoenas</hi> very much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him from. By occasion wherof,
<hi>Augustus</hi> minde was brought into great perplexitie, for their sundrie opinions, were confirmed by sundrie reasons. Wherfore he demaunded of <hi>Maro,</hi> whether it were expedient for a priuate man, to vsurpe a gouernment in his cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth or not? Then <hi>Virgil,</hi> vnto all ({quod} he) that haue vsurped the state of their commonwealth, the gouernmēt hath bin wearysom both vnto them, and to the subiectes, bycause that of necessitie through<pb facs="9"/>hatred of the people, or suspiciō growinge to them of their owne great iniustice: they do liue in much feare. But if the citizens could finde eny one, whom they do loue entierly: it should be profitable to the citie, if he were set in auctoritie. Wherfore, if you do continue to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute iustice to all men, without regard of eny person, as you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redie begunne, it shalbe most profitable both for your self, and all the worlde that you ruled, for you haue so much the goodwill of all men, that they honour you, and repute you for a God. Whose opinion <hi>Caesar</hi> allowinge: retayned still the Empire.</p>
   <p>But since wée haue now breifly spoken of the auctour, it séemeth good wée speake of the kind of verse, which commonly is handled two maner wayes, that is to say, before the worke, and in the worke. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the worke are, the Title, the Cause, the Intention. The Title, in which is asked, whose it is. The cause, from whence it rose, and for what cause cheifly they Poet tooke this in hand to write. The Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the which is knowne his drift, &amp; where about the Poet goeth. In the worke thrée thinges are marked, the Numbre, the Ordre, the Explanation. Although therfore by falsification, manie workes are caried abroade vnder othermens names, as the tragedie of <hi>Thiestes</hi> made by this Poet, which <hi>Varrus</hi> setforth for his owne, &amp; manie such like: yet we cannot doubt but that cléerly the <hi>Bucolickes</hi> are
<hi>Virgills,</hi> especially since the Poete, doubtinge some such matter, both in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge of the <hi>Aeneidos,</hi> and in another place witnesseth that they are his, sayinge:</p>
   <q>
      <l>I that my slendre Otē pipe in verse was wont to sound.
<hi>Likewise</hi>
      </l>
      <l>I that the rimes of sheapheardes sunge, and rash in tendre yeeres,</l>
      <l>Thee <hi>Tityrus</hi> &amp;c.</l>
   </q>
   <p>That they be fitly termed <hi>Bucolickes,</hi> and so accompted: if nothing els declared, yet this might be proofe sufficient, that in
<hi>Theocritus</hi> they be called by the same name. But we must shew also some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. There be thrée kindes of Sheapheardes that are famous in <hi>Buco<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lickes.</hi> Wherof the vilest sort are termed
<hi>Caprarii,</hi> or Goatheardes. The <hi>Opiliones,</hi> or Sheapheards are next of dignity, but y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      <hi>Bubulci,</hi> or Cowheardes are the best and chiefest. Wherof therfore was it most conuenient that the Sheapheardes verse shuld be named, but of that degrée which is found most excellent amongst Sheapheardes?</p>
   <p>The cause may be two wayes considered, of the beginninge of the verse, and of the minde of the writer. Of the beginninge, and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="9"/>of the <hi>Bucolick</hi> verse: diuers haue assigned diuerse causes. There are some that saye this kinde of verse was first instituted to <hi>Diana,</hi> by the Sheapheardes of
<hi>Lacedaemonia,</hi> when through occasion of warre, which at that tyme the
<hi>Persians</hi> made vpon all <hi>Greece,</hi> the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins could not do sacrafice accordinge to their custome. Others some say, that the same kynde of verse was made to <hi>Diana</hi> by <hi>Orestes,</hi> when he wandred about <hi>Sicilia.</hi> What euer they all say, this is most certen, that the <hi>Bucolik</hi> verse, tooke beginninge of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, when men ledde only sheapheardes liues, and therefore the simplicitie of such personages doth represent a shewe of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wordle. Wherfore <hi>Virgil</hi> begunne very commendably with those, verses, as it were, with that life, which was first in the earth. For afterward the fieldes were tilled, and last of all, for eara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fertyle ground: contention rose, and warres ensued, which <hi>Virgil,</hi> that he would expresse: sange first of sheapheardes, next of Husbandmen, and last of warriours. It remayneth now that wée consider what cause mooued the Poet cheifly to write the <hi>Bucolickes.</hi> Ether he was entised by the swéetnes to haue <hi>Theocritus</hi> verse in admiration, or else for orders sake he sought to expresse the life of man, as wée haue sayd before. Or rather that <hi>Virgil</hi> would setfoorth the thrée kindes of <hi>Elocution,</hi> which the
<hi>Greekes</hi> call <hi>Carecters, Ischnon</hi> that is, lowe,
<hi>Adron</hi> which is loftie, <hi>Meson,</hi> that is the mean or middle. Whefore beinge likely that he which was right cunninge in all the kindes: endited his <hi>Bucolickes</hi> in the first, the <hi>Georgikes</hi> in the second, and the <hi>Aeneidos</hi> in the third. Or therfore it is to be sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>posed he wroat the <hi>Bucolickes</hi> first, to thintent in that kind of verse which is more frée and rough then the rest he might take opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to currie the Emperours fauour, and to recouer his lande which he had lost, for this cause. The third day of the <hi>Ides</hi> of March, when <hi>C. Caesar</hi> was stayne, and the old souldiours had taken vp <hi>Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> beinge but a child to be their captayne, the senate not much repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge against it, a ciuile warre risinge therof, the <hi>Cremonēses</hi> with other of the same faction, aided the aduersaries of <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> Wherby it came to passe that when <hi>Augustus</hi> had the victory he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that the old souldiours shuld be brought in to the <hi>Cremonen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses</hi> fieldes, to deuide, and possesse them. And when their fieldes were not sufficient for them all: their neighbours the <hi>Mantuans,</hi> amonge whom was
<hi>Virgil,</hi> lost a great part of their landes, by cause they lay
<pb facs="10"/>neare vnto the <hi>Cremonenses.</hi> But <hi>Virgil,</hi> presuminge on the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie which he had with <hi>Augustus,</hi> and on his owne verses: durst resist <hi>Arius</hi> the <hi>Centurian.</hi> He strait wayes, like a souldyour, put his hand to his sword. And when
<hi>Virgil</hi> had betake himself to flight: he left not of followinge him, vntill <hi>Virgil</hi> had cast himself into a riuer, and so escaped. But afterward through the fauour of <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> and <hi>Pollio,</hi> and
<hi>Augustus</hi> himself, he was restoared to his landes. The Intention of the booke which the <hi>Graetians</hi> call <hi>Scopus,</hi> is grounded on the imitation of <hi>Theocritus</hi> the Poet, who was both a <hi>Siciliā</hi> and a <hi>Syracusiā.</hi> The intentiō also is to be reduced into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> praise of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and other princes and noblemen by whose meanes he was brought againe into his former seat, &amp; liuing. Wherby y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the end might cōtaine both delectatiō, &amp; profect: he did althinge accordinge to ordre, &amp; precept.</p>
   <p>This question is sometime asked why he wroate no moe then ten <hi>Ecloges,</hi> which wilbe no meruayle vnto him that shall waigh the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie of the pastorall <hi>Scenes,</hi> which cannot be stretched beyonde this numbre, and since this Poet more circumspect then
<hi>Theocritus</hi> as the matter it self declareth, séemeth to doubt least that <hi>Ecloge</hi> which is in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Pollio,</hi> will not appeare rusticklike enough, whiche he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth after this maner, saying:</p>
   <q>
      <l>Sicilian Muses, of thinges sumdeale greater let vs singe.</l>
   </q>
   <p>And so likewise doth he in other twayne. And this wée foretell to be obserued in al the <hi>Bucolikes</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> that they are neither wholy destitute of figures, neither altogither full of figures, that is to say <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagories.</hi> These thinges are scarce to be graunted vnto <hi>Virgis,</hi> for the prayse of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to recouer his landes, since <hi>Theocritus,</hi> whom <hi>Virgil</hi> sought by all endeuour to imitate: wroate altogether plainly, and simply.</p>
   <p>As touchyng such thinges as accustomably are handled in the verse are these: Numbre, Order, Explanation The numbre of the
<hi>Eclogs</hi> is apparant, for there are Ten, of which, seuen are thought properly to deserue the name of <hi>Bucolickes.</hi> For the last thrée ought not to be called <hi>Bucolickes,</hi> namely <hi>Pollio, Silenus,</hi> and <hi>Gallus.</hi> The first therfore contayneth a publique complaint, and a priuate thankes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng for land, and is called
<hi>Tityrus.</hi> The second, the loue of a boy, and is termed
<hi>Alexis.</hi> The third, a contention of Sheapheards, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Paloemon.</hi> The fourth, <hi>Genethliacum,</hi> and is named
<hi>Pollio.</hi> The fift, <hi>Epitaphium,</hi> and is termed <hi>Daphnis.</hi> The sixt, <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis,</hi>
      <pb facs="10"/>and is called,
<hi>Varus,</hi> and <hi>Cilenus.</hi> The seuenth <hi>Pharmacentria.</hi> The eight, the loues of diuers sexes, and is named <hi>Damon.</hi> The ninth contayneth a complaynt for his lost landes, and is termed <hi>Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> The tenth, the disier of <hi>Gallus,</hi> and is called <hi>Gallus.</hi> As touchynge the order of them, wée must vnderstand this, that only in the first and last <hi>Ecloges</hi> the Poete would keep due order, for in the one he began, as he witnesseth in the <hi>Georgickes:</hi>
   </p>
   <q>
      <l>O <hi>Tityrus,</hi> of thee I sange, vnder the broad Beech tree.</l>
   </q>
   <p> In the other he shewed the end, when he sayth,</p>
   <q>
      <l>This finall trauayle mine, graunt <hi>Arethusa</hi> vnto mee.</l>
   </q>
   <p>But amongst the <hi>Eclogs</hi> that there is no sheapheardly, or prescript order obserued, it is most certen. Wherefore there are some, that say the <hi>Bucolikes</hi> begin not at <hi>Tityrus,</hi> but:</p>
   <q>
      <l>Our <hi>Muse</hi> in <hi>Syracusian</hi> verse vouchsaued first to play.</l>
   </q>
   <p>There remaineth now Explanation, vnto which before wée come, I must admonish this, that the verse of a <hi>Bucolike</hi> is but a stender verse, and so farre differyng from the stile of the
<hi>Heroike:</hi> that this kinde of verse hath his peculiar diuision, and cuttinges, and is dist in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by his owne proper lawes. For, since a verse is prooued by thrée thynges, cutting, scannyng, and tunyng: it is no <hi>Bucolike</hi> verse vnlesse the first foote do contayne a full part of the sense, and the third foote be <hi>Trochaeus</hi> and a cuttyng, and the third being rather a <hi>Dactile</hi> then a
<hi>Spondeus:</hi> do finish a parcell of sense, the fift and sixt féete con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of whole words. Which beyng obserued by
<hi>Theocritus,</hi> yet wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at length through difficultie of the worke: he neclected it, &amp; only in the beginnyng it is vncertayne whether diligence, or chaunce did kéep these cuttynges. For, <hi>Tityre,</hi> a <hi>Dactile</hi> finisshed part of the Oration: <hi>tu patu, lae re cu,</hi> cloased vp the third <hi>Trochaeus,</hi> though in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde word: <hi>bans sub,</hi> and when he had put the fourth <hi>Spondeus</hi> for a <hi>Dactile, tegmine fagi,</hi> when he had ended the partes of oration, he absolued the whole <hi>Cōma,</hi> wherin the diligence of
<hi>Theocritus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in all his verses is wounderfull. And he that shall diligently with sharpe iudgement consider the aboue written, shall easely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what is the intention of the <hi>Georgikes,</hi> and what the ende, and likewise also in the <hi>Aeneidos.</hi>

   <p>There are thrée kinde of stiles in a Poeme, ether Actiue, ether Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue which <hi>Graecians</hi> call <hi>Dramaticum,</hi> wherein are persons brought<pb facs="11"/>in speakinge, without speakyng of the Poet, such as <hi>Tragoedies,</hi> and <hi>Comoedies</hi> are. For <hi>Dran</hi> in
<hi>Greeke</hi> signifieth to do. In which kinde first <hi>Tityrus</hi> was writen, then next <hi>Quo te Moeri.</hi> Or els <hi>Enerrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi> which the <hi>Greekes</hi> call <hi>Diegematicon,</hi> in which the Poet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self speaketh without interpretation of persone, as the first thrée boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of <hi>Georgikes.</hi> Likewise <hi>Lucretius</hi> verses. Ether els commune, and mixt, which the <hi>Greekes</hi> do terme <hi>Micton,</hi> where both the Poet himself doth speake, and personnes lykewyse are brought in, such as is the <hi>Aeneidos</hi> of <hi>Virgil.</hi>
