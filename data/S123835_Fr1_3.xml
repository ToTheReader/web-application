   <head>THE TRANSLATOVR to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had read this litle boke set forthe (by a certain godly lerned mā) in the French lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, it lyked me so well, that partly for the worthynes of the matter, and partly for myne owne exercise in that tongue, I applyed my selfe to bring the same in to our English speache: mynding nothing lesse than to haue it prynted, till that I was earnestly moued thervnto by diuers godly persōs, whose iust request, I could not iustly withstand. The boke doubtles wil sufficiently commend it self if the enuy of such, as are to much delited with idolatrie and superstition, do not let &amp; hynder the same. The things herein conteyned may seeme to some straunge, and perhaps are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen to the most, and therefore at the fyrst syght wyll be merueyled at of many. But thou (good christian reader) perusing this short dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and perceyuing that the moste parts of the masse sacrifice, were inuented by Numa Pompilius the second king of the Romains and a great coniurer, 700 yeres before the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of iesus Christ, cease marueyling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that it is no straunge thing, if man (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the saying of the Poete) be still sauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that whiche he firste learned, and was brought vp in. The bishops of Rome (whiche were the greatest corrupters of the holy sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="4"/>
&amp; true seruice of god, with beggerly and superstitious ceremonies) had long tyme bene noselled in the religiō of Pompilius. Ys it then straunge, if they (according to the new fangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mans brayne, scarse at any time cōtented with the simplicitie of gods worde) did bring in their wonted ceremonies vsed in their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices inuented by Numa the coniurer, to adorne and deck (as they thought) the ghospel of christ iesus, vnto the which they were lately conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and tourned? In the tyme of the apostles, &amp; many yeres after the Masse was not hard of, and no ceremonies were vsed, but such, as were com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded by our Lord &amp; sauiour christ, as prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, &amp; ministring of the holy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramēts. &amp;c. But afterward whē mā waxed we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of the heauenly Manna, diligent search was made to find out pleasant thīgs for him to play withal. Then in place of preaching, cam in mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, in place of sincere ministring the holy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, came in abhominable witchcraft, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iuring, and idolatrie, &amp; in place of the true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring of god, came in these trumperies &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles of Numa Pompilius: namely, the vestments, the aulbe, the tunicle, the holy water coniured to dryue away diuels, the aulter, the burnyng of tapers or torches, the trauersings along the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with crossyngs, beckyngs, and bowings, and prayers towarde the East, the procession and banners, the reliques, and carying of shrynes by the priests clad in whyte surplyces, &amp; theyr crownes shauen, the Confiteor to he and she saincts, the Orgaines, the canticles, the hymnes, and odes, the censor, and the encense, the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
<pb facs="4"/>
the eating of lytle roūd cakes consecrated in their sacrifices to their gods, &amp; in thende this pleasant songe, Ite missa est. Be not these abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable additions to the onely sufficient word of God? Peter was iustly reproued for causyng the gentilles to obserue the ceremonies of the Iewes: And shal they be commended that cause the christians to kepe and obserue the vayne &amp; superstitious rites and traditions of the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours gentills? Cerrainly I thinke, if Paull were present to aunswer them by word he wold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that which he hathe written: They are worthy to be reproued for as much as they go not simply to the truth of the gospell, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing christianite thēselues cause other (that do seldome heare any preaching, or if they doe heare it, doe hardly vnderstand it) to obserue &amp; kepe the blynde ceremonies of the infidels, and heathen, wherein the rude and ignoraunt put such confidence (by meanes their senses be cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually occupied about the same) that christ is quit shut out, his gospel not regarded, &amp; his due worship in spirit &amp; truth vnknowē. And if any would obiect that some or the most part of the ceremonies aboue mencioned, wer first among the iewes, and therfore ought or may be retey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by vs: I answere, that whatsoeuer was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the comming of Iesus christ may not now be obserued, without deniyng of him.</p>
   <p>Fot in retayning of them, we do seame to dout weather he hath fulfylled that which was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured and shadowed by the same. Wherefore sins the ceremonies of the Iues, and the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious inuentions of the Gentils are by the
<pb facs="5"/>
sciptures condemned. Let those that be true christians, vse such onely as maye be to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not to contention, to instruction, and not superstition, to vnitie, and not vanitie, in suche sorte that the faithfull bee not spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of their libertie, and that by necessitie they be not compelled vnto those things, from the which they be made free by the gospel of iesus Christ. I will (faithfull reader) hold thee no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, beseching thee to geue god hearty thankes for purging the church of England frō so many blinde and dumme ceremonies, &amp; earnestlye to pray that the rest (which at this day do molest the godly, and minister occasion to the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to sclaunder the true professors of gods holy ghospell with discord and discention) may be also shortly rooted out. So that god may be freely worshipped, the godly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, the enemie confounded and his people trewelye taught.</p>
