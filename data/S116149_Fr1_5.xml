   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Am not ignorant (friendly Reader) that hitherto, in writing, neuer any man pleased all; nor will I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be the first. To perswade the courteous, were causelesse, for they are naturally kind; and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the captious, were bootlesse, for they will not be diuerted: Let the first make true vse of these my Labours, and they shall find much pleasure and profit therein; let the last (if they like not) leaue it, and it shall not offend them. To make apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie or exornation, in defence or commendation of the subiect whereof I treat, were needlesse; it being alreadie, in the worlds opinion, of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent habilitie and reputation, both to defend and commend it selfe: Onely of my manner and order in handling the same, I will say somewhat, as briefely as I may, for thy better instruction and vnderstanding thereof.</p>
   <p>In generall, I haue disposed and digested the same into foure Bookes; whereof, the two former tend specially to the principles and rules of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie, with performance thereby of many vsefull and necessarie conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; and the two later, to matter of suruey, with many instrumentall conclusions, tending as well to that, as diuers other purposes.</p>
   <p>More particularly, in my first Booke, I begin with the Matters, Grounds, and Elements of <hi>GEOMETRIE,</hi> as the definitions and termes of art belonging thereunto; most fitting first by the Practicioner to be learned and well vnderstood: then next haue I placed therein diuers Geometricall <hi>THEOREMES,</hi> as the foundations, grounds, and reasons whereon the practike part dependeth.</p>
   <p>In the second (hauing formerly laid the foundation) I shew the means and practike operation of manie necessarie conclusions and Geometricall <hi>PROBLEMES,</hi> as the distinction, application, and diuision of Lines and Angles; and the description, reduction, addition, inscription, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, diuision, and separation of all formes and kinds of superficiall Figures, with their seuerall dimensions. And considering, that as well in the <hi>THEOREMES</hi> of the first Booke, as the <hi>PROBLEMES</hi> in the second, I wholly omit (for breuities sake, and auoiding confusion to
<pb facs="5"/>the learner) their seuerall demonstrations, vsing onely explication and construction; I therefore expresse in the Margent against those <hi>THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REMES</hi> and <hi>PROBLEMES,</hi> where, how, and in what place of <hi>EVCLID, RAMVS,</hi> and other Authors, to find their seuerall demonstrations at large: and likewise, at the end of each construction, I haue inserted the like numbers and notes of reference, from the <hi>THEOREMES</hi> in the first Booke, to the <hi>PROBLEMES</hi> in the second; and the contrarie: whereby most plainely and readily is found, and had, as well the reason and ground of any <hi>PROBLEME</hi> proposed, as the effect and operation of any <hi>THEOREME</hi> deliuered.</p>
   <p>In the third Booke I begin with the description of the seuerall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments fit and vsuall for Suruey; and of their seuerall vses: wherein somewhat haue I spoken (though too sparingly) concerning their abuse; being now growne shamefully generall, by the multitude of simple and ignorant persons (vsing, or rather abusing, that good plaine Instrument, called the <hi>Plaine Table</hi>) who hauing but once obserued a Surueyor, by looking ouer his shoulder, how and in what manner be directs his sights, and drawes his lines thereon; they presently apprehend the businesse, prouide them of some cast <hi>Plaine Table,</hi> and within small time after, you shall heare them tell you wonders, and what rare feats they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; yea, and will vndertake (or I will for them) that for tenne groats a day, and their charges defrayed, they shall be able to vndoe any man they deale with; or at leastwise, to doe him such wrong and preiudice, as perhaps he might, with more ease, and lesse losse, haue giuen ten pounds a day to one that would haue spoken lesse, and performed more. But what should I say more of them then thus, <hi>Monoculi inter caecos oculissimi sunt,</hi> and so will I leaue the blind, with tumbling the blind into the myre.</p>
   <p>I further describe in this third Booke, the composition and vse of an Instrument of mine owne, which I call the <hi>Peractor,</hi> and of a Chayne, which I call the <hi>Decimall</hi> Chayne, with the diuisions and parts thereof: which rightly vnderstood and practised (I dare boldly say without osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) is farre more vsefull and absolute for speed and exactnesse, then any yet euer vsed: And I will maintaine by sufficient demonstration, that no man (vsing not the same, or the like) shall attaine to the same or the like perfection, for precise exactnesse in any dimension, as I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by performe.</p>
   <p>And I further shew therein, the best, speediest, and exactest meanes, for the suruey and instrumentall mensuration of a Mannor, or any other superficiall content whatsoeuer, by diuers and seuerall meanes; with
<pb facs="5"/>manie extraordinarie obseruations and courses, therein to be had and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, not vsually knowne or practised; as by the argument of that Booke more particularly appeareth.</p>
   <p>Wherein by the way J would aduise the Reader, who desireth to make vse thereof, and to profit himselfe thereby, in reading and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; to take the Chapters before him as they lye in order; for that I haue striued to place them in such an orderly and methodicall forme, as the one necessarily follow the other in vse and practise; well knowing that disorder and irregularitie in this kinde, breedeth not a little trouble and confusion to the weake practicioner.</p>
   <p>The fourth and last Booke, consisteth of the <hi>legall part</hi> of Suruey; wherein I first shew what a Mannor is and the seuerall parts thereof, with the appendants thereunto; how the same is created and maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and how and by what meanes destroyed and discontinued: also the seuerall sorts and kindes of estates whereby any lands or tenements may be holden, and the seuerall tenures, rents and seruices depending on those estates: I further shew therein the order and manner of keeping Courts of Suruey, with the entrie of the tenants euidence and estates; and the orderly and artificiall manner of ingrossing the same, with many other necessary rules and obseruations tending to those purposes, as more at large also appeareth by the argument of the same Booke.</p>
   <p>And here, as before, would I aduise the practicioner, to obserue the like course in reading and practising the rules and instructions of this Booke, as I haue formerly directed for the third, for that J haue strictly obserued the like decorum in placing the Chapters each after other, as of necessity they are to be vsed and practised.</p>
   <p>Now might I here much inlarge and protend this Preface, in explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the wonderfull vse of the two former Bookes, in the performance of infinite conclusions Geometricall, so farre passing this subiect of Suruey, as it in it selfe exceedeth the meanest matter of dispose, which (to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide prolixitie) J will here forbeare, leauing the consideration thereof to thine owne iudgement, when thou shalt finde therein by thy diligent practise the sweet and pleasing taste of such sense-beguiling fruit.</p>
   <p>And further might I amplifie the same, not only in declaring the great and infinite pleasure, with no lesse profit, which the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, vse, and vnderstanding of the two later Books may bring (aswell to Surueyors, as all owners and occupyers of land in generall) but also of the antiquitie and necessitie of Suruey; howsoeuer sleighted by many, who will not bestow a penny in points, or two pence in tape, or the like, but they will number the one, and measure the other, before they pay for
<pb facs="6"/>either, and yet will disburse manie thousands in a purchase, without the certaine knowledge of either quantitie, qualitie, or value thereof: (and these are those which are called penny-wise, &amp;c.) whereby it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens (as I haue often knowne) that a valuable purchase being made, within few weekes after, the money hath beene raised of the woods, and the lands perhaps immediately sold for much more then the money dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursed; and the same againe vented at the third hand, hath yeelded a double value: and all this vnseene, and vnsurueyed, with what disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to the first vendor, I will leaue to the consideration of my young Master, who hath thus offended in selling all, and resteth now in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with full resolution not to offend in the like. And the like haue I knowne of a purchase made, when a moitie of the charge could scarcely be raised.</p>
   <p>But to spend time to this purpose, were to little end, and therefore will I end this purpose; only intreating thee gentle Reader, that as I haue thus imployed mine idle houres, to find thee houres of imployment; if thou reape either pleasure or profit by these my paines, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord me thy good opinion (for <hi>Virtus laudata crescit, &amp; honos alit artes</hi>) which is all I craue.</p>
