   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, although the world is alreadie so full of Bookes, that a man may spend his whole time in reading titles and inscriptions; yet are there but few amongst this multitude in our English tongue, which containe sound expositions of the bookes of holie Scriptures; which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to be the obiect of our faith, and the rule and directorie of our life and manners. In consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as I did in the generall thinke, that no man can better spend his labours then in expounding and cleering these holie and hidden mysteries; so more particularly, that it should be a profitable and acceptable labour, to explaine the <hi>Prophecie of Hosea;</hi> which as it is exceeding obscure, and not by any (that I know of) expounded in our tongue, so also when it is vnderstood, most excellent, and of singular vse for these times. And therefore relying my selfe vpon Gods assistance, I haue vndertaken this hard taske, and by his blessing haue alreadie proceeded vnto the fifth Chapter. In handling whereof, I haue chiefly laboured to cleere this Scripture from all obscuritie; and then to informe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders iudgement, by such instructions as naturally arise out of the text; and to reforme his affections, life and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="7"/> by making thereof vse and application. The which my labours (I may truly say) I only intended for the benefit of mine owne priuate charge, and neuer thought of making them publike by the presse, till I had finished the three first Chapters; when as being perswaded by some of my friends to set them out, for the good of others, I began to resolue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this course, yet with a purpose not to diuulge any part till the whole were finished. But he who is at the charge of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this booke, herein ouerruled me, perswading me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish my readings vpon these Chapters first, for a taste of the rest. Vnto which motion I haue condescended, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to take the like paines in those Chapters which remaine, by the assistance of God, if I shall in the meane while perceiue that this part findeth good acceptation, and shall be thought profitable by those who are of better iudgement, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of Gods glorie, and good of his Church, which my desire is should be the maine end of all my labors. Which that I may the better performe, I intreate, that as I ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to benefit thee with my paines and studies, so thou wilt assist mee with thy feruent prayers, for the helpe and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Gods holie Spirit in these my endeuours, who only can enable vs to expound that, which was first preached and written by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inspiration.</p>
