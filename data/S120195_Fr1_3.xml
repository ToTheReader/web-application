   <head>A LETTER OF A JVDICIOVS FRIEND requested by the Authour to deliver his censure on his Translation.</head>
   <p>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. B.H. I haue read your smooth translation of rough <hi>Persius,</hi> and send it home to you with my Censure (such as you wish) ingenuously free. I will deale Iustly with you Now, Friendly at Other times. In My judgement, when you conversed in this familiar and friendly manner with <hi>Persius</hi> his Satires, your witte stooped farre below the elevation of its owne worth. But as <hi>Scaliger</hi> said of <hi>Claudian</hi> and his works, <hi>Solo argumento ignobiliore oppressus addit de ingenio, quantum deest materiae: (Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>Poetic:)</hi> So I of You and Your Poem; Whatsoever is meane in your Authour, is (mee thinkes) so choicely adorned by Your <hi>Genius:</hi> that if it stand out of the presence of Ignorance or Desperat Emulation, it may bee Gracefull. Which I doe more hartily affirme, because you haue Chastised your Poet with modest, yet significant termes: where some ranke-breathed Interpretet would haue rendred him with a strong savour of lasciviousnesse. I know not now, what should stay You from sending it abroad, or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from giuing it welcome entertainment. If Old <hi>Persius</hi> were ever worth the hauing: Yours, I doubt not, will bee thought Well worth the reading; yet looke for Other cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and Neglect them. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
