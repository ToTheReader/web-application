      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>IKE as in a Garden, there grow diuers Hearbes and Flowers of sundry sortes, which do so amaze the beholders, as that they are in doubt which to make their choyce off: So the holy Scriptures are a plentifull Garden, being full replenished with all maner of heauenly comforts, and spirituall conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for the soule of man, doth offer vnto vs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sweete flowers, and pleasant fruites; the chiefe whereof is (Fayth in Christ Iesus.) Our sauiour Christ, speaking of the nature and vertue of this Hearbe, sayth, <hi>If ye had Fayth as much as is a grayne</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk. 17. Math. 17.</note>
      <hi>of Mustard-seede, and should say to this Mulberie-tree, Plucke thy selfe vp by the rootes, and plant thy selfe in the Sea, it shoulde obey you. Luk.</hi> 17. &amp; <hi>Math.</hi> 17 And in an other place. <hi>Whatsoeuer ye shall aske in</hi>
      <note place="margin">Math. 21.</note>
      <hi>prayer (if ye beleeue) ye shall receaue it. Math.</hi> 21. And againe I say vnto you, <hi>Whatsoeuer ye desire when ye pray, beleeue that ye shal haue it, &amp; it shalbe done vnto</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mark. 11.</note>
      <hi>you. Mark.</hi> 11. And S. Paule saith, <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all vnder sinne, that the Promise, by the fayth of Iesus Christ, should be geuen to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</hi> And againe: <hi>Before Fayth came, we were kept vnder the Law, and shut vp vnto the Promise, which should afterwardes be reuealed: wherfor the Law was our Scholemaister: for we are all the sonnes of God, by
<pb facs="3"/>
fayth in Christ Iesus. For allyee that are baptised into Christ, haue put on Christ. Galla.</hi> 3. And S. Paule in the. 10. to the Romans, speaking of the Israelites fayth, saith: <hi>They being ignorant of the righteousnes</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note>
      <hi>of God, and going about to establish their owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, haue not submitted them selues to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of God.</hi> For, saith he: <hi>Christ is the ende of the Law for righteousnes vnto euery one that beleeueth.</hi> And sayth further: <hi>If thou shalt confesse with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and shalt beleeue in thine hart, that God raysed him vp from the death, thou shalt be saued. For with the hart man beleeueth vnto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, and with the mouth man confesseth vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi> Therefore was it, that one being desirous to obtayne saluation, asked of the Apostles, <hi>What must I do, that I may be saued?</hi> Who answered: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 16.</note>
      <hi>in the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou shalt be saued, and thine houshold. Act.</hi> 16. This is that Hearbe, the vertue wherof our sauiour Christ sheweth, saying: <hi>Whosoeuer beleeued in him, should not perish, but haue</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note>
      <hi>eternall lyfe. Iohn.</hi> 3. Holy <hi>Iob</hi> in his affliction, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the strength and vertue of this Hearbe, did flie vnto Iesus, saying: <hi>I haue heard of thee by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iob. 42.</note>
      <hi>of the eare: But now mine eye seeth thee. Iob.</hi> 42. The woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> through the sweete sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of this Hearbe, desired him, <hi>to giue her of that water, that she might not thirst, neither come to the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note>
      <hi>Well to draw. Iohn.</hi> 4. The operation and strength of this hearbe, enforced the woman that was a sinner, <hi>to stand at the feete of Iesus, behinde him weepeing, and began to wash his feete with her teares, and did wipe</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk. 7.</note>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>them with the heares of her head, and kissed his feete, and annoynted them with oyntment. Luk.</hi> 7. So also an other woman lifted vp her voice, and sayd vnto him, <hi>Blessed is the wombe that bare thee, and the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk. 11.</note>
      <hi>pappes which thou hast sucked. Luk.</hi> 11. And certaine men that were in the Shippe came to him, and worshypped him, saying: <hi>Of a trueth thou art the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Math. 14.</note>
      <hi>Sonne of God. Math.</hi> 14. This caused <hi>Symon Peter</hi> to say, <hi>Thou art the Christ, the sonne of the lyuing God.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Math. 16.</note>
      <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. The Centurion by the scent of this hearbe, was prouoked to sende vnto Iesus, beseeching him that he would come, and heale his seruant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sicke. And Iesus comming, being not faire from the house, the Centuryon sent his friendes to him, saying: <hi>Lord trouble not thy selfe, for I am not</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk. 7 Math. 8.</note>
      <hi>worthy that thou shouldest come vnder my roufe: But say the worde, and my seruant shalbe whole. Luk.</hi> 7. &amp; <hi>Math.</hi> 8. This also caused a woman, <hi>hauing a boxe</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mark. 14.</note>
      <hi>of oyntment of Spicknard very costly, to breke the box, &amp; to power it vpon his head. Mark.</hi> 14. And an other woman, who was troubled with a bloody Issue twelue yeeres, to say in her selfe: <hi>If I may touch but</hi>
      <note place="margin">Math. 9.</note>
      <hi>his garment only, I shalbe whole. Math.</hi> 9. The Theife through this Fayth, sayd vnto Iesus, <hi>Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk. 23.</note>
      <hi>me when thou cōmest into thy kingdome. Luk.</hi> 23. Therfore as the Passion of Christ serueth to none, but such as do beleeue: so neyther doth Fayth (as it is only a bare qualitie or action in mans minde) it selfe iustefie, vnles it be directed to the body of Christ crucified, as to her obiect, of whom she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth all her vertue. And therefore these two
<pb facs="4"/>
must alwayes ioyntly concurre and holde togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Fayth, &amp; Christ Iesus, crucified. This Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise following (gentle Reader) teacheth the vse, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and vertue of Fayth, in such abundant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent manner, as it were all one for me to cast a drop of water into the Sea, as to take vpon me to enlarge any matter therevpon: And yf I should, or could; I can but reiterate or repeate that which already hath been set downe. For the Booke doth so set foorth it selfe (as in my poore vnderstanding) needeth lytle helpe: sauing that some few wordes that were wrong placed, I haue amended, &amp; some others I haue added, for the better explanation of the Authour: And I haue els folowed the former Coppie, with a briefe collection or exposition of a summe of <hi>S. Paules</hi> doctrine deliuered vpon the same, set foorth before (but lying hid as it were) in a great volume: which I haue also thought meete &amp; very necessary, were put into a smaller volume, to the intent to be caried about with vs (as a flower or hearbe in our bosome) for our oftener remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce &amp; instruction. This Hearbe being once knowen, it is sayd by the Authour, you haue the pith of al Diuinitie: written and set foorth by that learned, godly, and zelous Martire, M. <hi>Patericke Hamelton,</hi> being a Scottishman borne, and of the kings blood: who (as is set foorth in the booke of Martyrs) taught, and earnestly preached the trueth to the people, and refelled their abuses, constantly &amp; stoutly susteining the quarrell of Gods Gospell, in the time of ignorance and blindnesse: Through
<pb facs="4"/>
which occasion (as is also there set foorth) he was cited to appeare before the Archbyshyp of <hi>Sainct Andrew,</hi> named <hi>Iames Beton,</hi> and his Colledge of Priestes, the first day of March <hi>Ann.</hi> 1527. And the same day at after dinner in all haste, was had away to the fyer, and burned; the king then being but a childe, which made the Archbyshoppe more bolde. The which Treatise (gentle Reader) as I cannot commende vnto you in that measure, as it deserueth or requireth: So do I confesse in my selfe such want of habilitie, knowledge, and skill, as most vnworthy of al others, to set foorth so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a matter, of so high a nature or mysterie. But it pleaseth Almightie God by troubles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, to bring his chyldren to the exercise of many of those vertues, that do belong to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man; And in tribulation, Fayth is chiefly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, in considering the cause of Gods exercising of vs: and in beleeuing most assuredly the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses he hath made for our delyuerance. In which consideration, I hauing passed somtyme in my greeuous and sorrowfull troubles of aduersaries, I spent that time chiefly, in vnderstanding and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting this Treatise folowing; which is able so to instruct, teach, and geue such heauenly lyght and comfort vnto vs (yf we be desirous and willing to seeke thereaster) as may vndoubtedly redounde to our euerlasting lyfe and saluation; as our sauiour Christ him selfe teacheth vs: <hi>This is lyfe eternall, that they know thee to be the only true God, and whom</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note>
      <hi>thou hast sent, Iesus Christ. Iohn.</hi> 17. Vnto whom let
<pb facs="5"/>
vs still be praying incessantly, that it wil please him to lighten the darknes of our hartes &amp; vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and to encrease our Fayth and knowledge in his Sonne Iesus Christ, our onley Sauiour and Redeemer: which is the onely key &amp; meanes for vs to attayne to the true knowledge and feelyng of this Fayth, whereby we may be found worthy to be numbred amongst those whom our Sauiour Christ prayeth for. <hi>Father, I will that they whom thou hast geuen me, be with me euen where I am, that</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note>
      <hi>they may beholde my glory, which thou hast geuen me. Iohn.</hi> 17. Of the which his glory, as he hath power to make vs partakers: so, yf we lay all our Fayth, hope, and trust, vpon him, he wil then say vnto vs, as he sayd vnto the blind man, <hi>Receaue thy sight, thy Fayth hath saued thee. Luk.</hi> 18. Farewell in him, <note place="margin">Luk. 18.</note> whom we are all to follow and beleeue. Amen.</p>
