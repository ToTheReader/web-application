                 <title>The vvhite vvolfe or, A sermon preached at Pauls Crosse, Feb. 11 : being the last Sonday in Hillarie tearme, anno 1627. and printed somewhat more largely then the time would permit at that present to deliuer. Wherein faction is vnmasked, and iustly taxed without malice, for the safetie of weake Christians. Especially, the Hetheringtonian faction growne very impudent in this citie of late yeeres, is here confuted. By Stephen Denison, minister of Katherine Cree-Church, London</title>

nothing so much as to know the right way
to heauen, hauing also many doubts, which
cause thee to runne vp and downe, sometimes
to the publike Congregations, and other
sometimes to priuate Conuenticles, for resolution. I haue for
thy sake and safety vndertaken this paines; whereby I haue
incensed many factious persons against my selfe, exposed my
good name to the obloquie of a thousand bad tongues, and
made somewhat to bold with my owne Flocke whilst I was
painefully imployed in this more laborious worke, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes

in this seruice, saue onely the good Assistance of Authority,
for the which I hope I shall praise God as long as I liue, and
the testimonies of honest witnesses. For howsoeuer there were
many which disliked the Hetheringtonian Faction, abhorred
their opinions, complained of them to Ministers in secret,
and murmured against them which should see these things
reformed, yet for any that would lend their helping hand to
set forward this matter of so great importance for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

also with many discouragements, some in their ignorance
would be ready to say, that though this faction held some ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
points, yet that they held nothing against the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
not vnderstanding how they vndermine Religion at the
very roote of it: for grant vnto them this, that our Church
is no true Church of Christ, that our Ministers are no true
Ministers of the Gospell, that our best Professors are Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,
