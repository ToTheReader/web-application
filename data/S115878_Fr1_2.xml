   <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOVRABLE, SIR ROBERT NANTON, Knight, Master of his <hi>Maiesties Court of Wards and</hi> Liueries, and one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties most Honourable Priuie Councell.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>RIGHT HONOVRABLE,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome in their <hi>Dedicatories</hi> employ their Pen, not so much to craue <hi>Patronage,</hi> as to buy and purchase it by large (and happily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued) commendation of those whose names and fauour they implore. How plentifull matter in this kind I might be furnished withall, they well know that are able to ballance your pietie, learning, and othervertues. But as <hi>Cato</hi> resolued to haue a mean <hi>Tombe,</hi> or none at al, that it might rather be asked, why he had no <hi>Monument,</hi> then why a sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous:
<pb facs="3"/>so in my speaking to &amp; of your worthy selfe, rather would I be asked of many, why I said so little, thē of any one, why so much. I therefore here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse my selfe to your <hi>Honour,</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to that side onely which lyeth most conspicuous &amp; opportune for my harbour, and that is the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of you as you are by his <hi>Maiestie</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the worthy Head, and Master of that honourable Court, erected for the protection of those, who by reason of <hi>Nonage,</hi> are vnable to support them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against iniury. In which imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, out of your religious &amp; vertuous resolutions, the world knows you most ready to do <hi>Iustice,</hi> and yeeld <hi>Protection,</hi> as by way of Iudicature vnto <hi>Orphanes,</hi> so also in a larger extent by way of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor &amp; countenance to others that need the same, especially in cause of <hi>Religion.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>My poore selfe, though not pleading either <hi>Wardable Tenure,</hi> or <hi>Infancie</hi> of years, yet in the generall as a <hi>Churchman,</hi> and in particular, as deuoted to doe all
<pb facs="3"/>the seruice I may for the maintenance of <hi>Religion</hi> established, presume to cast my selfe as a <hi>Ward</hi> into your tuition. First,
<note place="margin">Ecclesia semper est pupilla.</note> the Church by the Ciuil &amp; Canon Lawes, is said to remaine in perpetuall pupillage, and iustly claimeth succour and defence from men in high place, as vnable to relieue it selfe against either those <hi>Corrupters</hi> that wil thrust in with <hi>strange fire,</hi> to pollute the <hi>Altar;</hi> or those <hi>Spoilers,</hi> that would cut short the skirts of <hi>Aarons</hi> cloathing. Then also for my personall case in regard of my disabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to vndertake so high a taske, I must needs acknowledge my selfe to bee a weake Infant, <hi>Puer sum, non possum loqui;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ierem. 1.4.</note> and the more liable to wrong, because incompassed with aduersaries exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated against the Truth, and mee for speaking Truth.
<note place="margin">Ezck. 2.6.</note>
      <hi>Bryers and thornes are with mee, and I dwell amongst Scorpions,</hi> whose stings are the sharper bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my breast, because I haue indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored to giue <hi>Antidotes</hi> vnto the Kings liege people, for their defence against
<pb facs="4"/>such balefull poyson, whereof my selfe haue formerly had a taste. Nor am I more by mine owne danger driuen, then by your goodnesse drawne to cast mine vnworthy selfe, and these my poore Labors into the bosome of your Protection. Though it bee perhaps none of my least faults, that without your Honours leaue I haue intruded vpon your Patronage, yet I cannot bee so mistrustfull in so good a cause, as to feare your either repulse, or offence.</p>
   <p>In this good hope I craue your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Pardon and Fauour, alwayes praying God, whose cause I defend, whose truth you aduance, to prosper your Honour in all your laudable and religious indeauours.</p>
