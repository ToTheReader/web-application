      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>RIE, AND THEN TRVST, saith the olde Adage: but I must hope for trust without triall: bicause as I can compare you, (Right Honourable) to none more fit, thē to ALEXANDER the Macedon: So must I humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest your good Lordship, to imitate that famous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie: who being sicke, was aduertised by letters, that his Phisition would empoyson him. The good Prince notwithstanding being offered the medicine by the accused, first tooke it, and dranke it vp, and then gaue the Phisition the letter of his accuser to reade: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing no alteration of countenaunce in the man, he tooke good courage, and by that same medecine (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though extreame in operation) presently recouered his former health. In like manner (Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) hauing translated and gathered together this compēdious &amp; short way of Chirurgerie, as I thought none so meete, to whome I might consecrate these fruites of my trauailes: So must I moste humbly desire your good Lordship to peruse it, and then to make tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the contentes thereof: which being deuised and practised by a worthye and famous Capitaine, called Signior LEONARDO PHIORAVANTI of Bolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnia, doth shewe both the names and natures of eche
