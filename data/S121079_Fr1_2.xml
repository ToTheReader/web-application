         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost gracious Soveraigne,</hi> meeting with this compendious <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance of the Prelates late dainge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous encrochments, both upon your owne Prerogative Royall, and your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Liberties,</hi> compiled by a late lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Gentleman, out of a zeale to your Majesties ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and your peoples good: I could doe no lesse in point of allegiance to your Highnes, and true affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my Countries weale, then prostrate it in all humility, at your Royall feete, imploring your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely acceptation of it. The rather because it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally destinated to your Majesty by the author; whom I heard oft complaining, that it was the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, sometimes, of the best Princes (by reason of the unfaithfulnesse and misrepresentations of those
<pb n="4" facs="4"/> State-agents whom they most imployed, and least suspected,) to be utterly ignorant of the true estate both of their owne and the Republikes affaires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving all things to be uprightly and justly managed, when it is nothing lesse: relating with much regreet that memorable speech of <hi>Aurelian the Emperor</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred by <hi>Flavius Vospiscus</hi> in the History of his life,) <hi>There is nothing more difficult, then to raigne well.

Whereupon hee makes those Iudges whom hee ought not, and remooves those from the Republike whom hee should retaine. In a word; as Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian himselfe said; a good, cautious, yea the best Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror is sold and abused by his most indeared instruments;</hi> whiles hee seeth all things onely with their eyes, heares nothing but with their eares, and executes all things with their hands. The consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as it instigated the Author originally to compile, so it hath animated mee to enlarge this <hi>Breviate</hi> (with the addition onely of some late occurrences;) and to present this third Impression of it to your Highnes veiw, (though perchance with some hazard to my person and estate, by reason of the Prelates great swaying power and implacable malice:) wherein as in a Christall glasse, your Majesty may eft soone
<pb n="5" facs="4"/> discerne the insufferable usurpations of your ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Bishops, upon your owne Royall Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences and your Subjects Liberties: (contrary to all Law and justice,) in their true naked coulors, uncased of all such false varnishes, and specious glosses which themselves have cast upon them, to cover their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and delude your Majesties senses, who sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no such blacke workes of darknes under their pure white Rochets.</p>

      <hi>First, That the</hi> 214. Bishops <hi>in the</hi> 4.

That hee should have vile <hi>(not Lordly, costly,)</hi> household stuffe, and a poore table and fare, and should seeke the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of his dignity by his faith and merits of life. That hee should not take upon him the Probate or Administration of Wills; nor goe to Law for transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory things though provoked; That hee should not take any care of his temporall estate to himselfe; <hi>Sed lectioni &amp; orationi, &amp; verbi Dei praedicationi TAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVM MODO VACET;</hi> but should <hi>ONELY</hi> give himselfe to reading, and prayer, and the preaching of Gods word. That hee should ordaine no Ministers without the advise of his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the consent and testimony of the Citizens. That hee should heare no mans cause, without the presence of his Clergy; and that otherwise his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence should be meerly voyd, unlesse it were confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the presence and suffrage of his Clergy. That in what place soever hee was sitting, hee should not suffer a Presbyter or Minister to stand; That in the Church and Session of the Presbyters, the Bishop should sit in the upper place: but within any house
<pb n="19" facs="11"/>

For, and by reason of such things and Bishops, soules are neglected, the sheepe perish, diseases increase, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies and scismes breake forth, Churches are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, Preists are defiled, and other evills arise. Wherefore the cheife Preists may not imitate who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish women, who put over their children to others to

For if the Lord himselfe, among other cares of his sheepe, hath touched and cleansed the leapers, why doe wee disdaine to doe the same things? Especially when as the Lord sayd to Peter,<note n="*" place="margin">

   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.38.39.40.</note>Wee remember, that Iacob, who had served long for his wives, said thus to Laban: This twenty yeares have I beene with thee, thy ewes and thy shee-goates have not cast their younge, and the rammes of thy flocke have I not eaten. That which was torne of beasts, I brought not unto thee, I bare the losse of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or by night. Thus I was, in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night, and the sleepe departed from mine eyes. If therefore hee did thus labor and watch, who fed Labans sheepe, how great paines &amp; watchings ought he to take, who feeds the sheep of God? <hi>This can no Prelate or Bishop doe, who is busied in worldly affaires or flowes in worldly

         <hi>Epist.</hi> 37</note> Hildebert of Turen <hi>truly writes:</hi> It is impossible that hee should at any time speake with the Lord, who (even when hee is silent) talkes with all the world: Such a fable-bearer doe I, O wretch <hi>(saith hee)</hi> professe my selfe, who when as I spend the whole dayes about keeping of cattle and worldly affaires, doe not spend so much as one moment in keeping of soules. Businesses, which are worse to my spirit, meet with me, which engrosse me wholy to themselves, which steale away the secret times of prayers, which defraud Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call duties of their seasons, which as a small thing rage and vex me with stinges by day, and likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest me when I sleep by night; and that which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not acknowledge without teares, the creeping and theevish remembrance of causes follow me, poore wretch to the sacred Altars, where whiles I deprecate the flight thereof, I am surrounded with their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault. These birdes, I unhappy wretch, indure with sacrifying Abraham, but it is not yet given me to drive them away with Abraham. Now innumme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable losses of vertues follow the captivating occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the minde, to which whiles we miserably are subject, wee doe not so much as minister with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha: For Martha ministred, but to Christ; but which of us may say that wee doe run about and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister with Martha, who whiles wee run about, doe neither minister to Christ, nor for Christ. <hi>Hence</hi> is it (writes<note n="*" place="margin">De Statu Domus Dei. l. <hi>3.</hi> Bibl.

Whence chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty now waxing cold in many, the desire of heavenly things vanisheth quite away in us, and all the studie of virtues is turned into the appetite of transitory things. For these things men desire to be Bishops and Prelates of Churches, that they may enjoy these things, that they may flow with pleasures, that they may rather rule over the Church of God, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit it; that they may have the family of the Church, subject to them, that they may be Lords of things, that how much the richer their Churches are, they may thereby become more famous. Since therefore ambition raignes in these men, how can they adorne the doctrine of Christ in word and example in all things? What vertue of true religion is there in them whose heartes the brightnes of divine illumination hath forsaken? <hi>Thus these, in direct opposition to this your Prelates suggestion, who pleade so much for worldly, honor, pompe, wealth, and rule, which of all other things they should most detest.</hi>

And from that time forward (<hi>saith</hi> Polychronicon <hi>out of</hi> Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Cambiensis) because of the great riches that the Church had, it was made the more secular; and had more secular busines, then spirituall devotion, and more pompe &amp; boast outward then holinesse within. Therefore Ierome in <hi>Vitas Patrum</hi> saith; Since the holy Church increased in possessions, it decreased in virtues according to the old Proverbe: <hi>Religio pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perit divitias, Et filia devoravit matrem. And out of</hi> Sant Bernard <hi>hee writes:</hi> that since Prelates increased in worldly pompe, chusing the first places in the Church, they have beene the cheifest in persecuting Christ, and have ever shewed themselves, not tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, but deceivers, not Pastors but Impostors; not Prelates but Pilates, succeeding not Peter in teaching, but Romulus in murthering: Concluding out of the same Bernard; that no Prelate, no not the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, can be both a Successor of the Apostles &amp; a Lord; for doubtles hee was forbidden one of them by our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 20.25.26. where Christ by severall duties and honors, hath set a difference betweene the offices of both powers.

      <hi>Noble Martyr</hi> Lord Cobham <hi>professed:</hi> That the will of God is, that Preists being secluded from all worldlinesse, should conforme themselves utterly to the examples of Christ, and his Apostles; be evermore occupied in preaching and teaching the Scriptures purely, and in giving whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some examples of good living to others, being more modest, loving, gentle, and lowly in spirit, then any other sorts of people. Where doe ye finde <hi>(sayd hee to the Prelates)</hi> in all Gods Law, that ye should thus sitt in judgement of any Christian man, or yet give sentence of any other man unto death as yee doe here dayly? No ground have ye in all the Scriptures so Lordly to take it upon you, but in Annas and Caiphas which sate thus upon Christ; and upon his Apostles, after his ascention. Of them onely have ye taken it to judge Christs members, as ye doe, &amp; neither of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor Iohn. Since the venime of Iudas was shed into the Church, yee never followed Christ, nor yet stood in the perfection of Gods Law. By Venime I meane your possessions and Lordships: For then cried an Angle in the ayre (as your owne Chronicles
<pb n="26" facs="15"/> mention) Woe, woe, woe, this day is venine shed into the Church of God. Before that time all the Bps of Rome were Martyrs in a maner: and since that time we read of very few: But indeed one hath put down another, one hath cursed another, one hath poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned another, one hath slaine another, &amp; done much more mischeife besides, as all Chronicles tell. And let all men consider this well, that Christ was meeke and mercifull; the Pope (and his Prelates) is proud and a tyrant: Christ was poore and forgave, the Pope is rich and a malicious manslayer, as his dayly Acts doe proove him. Rome is the very nest of Antichrist, and out of that nest cometh all the Disciples of him; of whom Archbishops, Bishops, Prelates, Preists and Monkes be the body, members, and these pild Friars the tayle. Though Preists and Deacons for preaching Gods word, ministring the Sacraments with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the poore be grounded on Gods Law, yet have these Sects no maner of ground thereof. Hee that followeth Peter most nighest in pure living, is next unto him in succession. But your Lordly order esteemed not greatly the behaviour of poore Peter, what ever ye prate of him.<note n="l" place="margin">

         <hi>In his workes. p.</hi> 124. 140 152. 142.</note> Master William Tyndall <hi>Martyr, writes</hi> thus: Let Kings rule their Realmes themselves, with the helpe of Laymen that are sage, wise, learned and expert. Is it not a shame above all shames and a monstrous thing, that no man should be found able to governe a worldly Kingdome save Bishops and Prelates that have forsaken the world, and are taken out of the world, and appointed to preach the Kingdome of God; Christ saith, that his Kingdome is not of this
<pb n="28" facs="16"/> world, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. Vnto the young man that desired him, to bid his brother to give him part of the inheritance, hee answered; who made me a judge or a devider over you: No man that layeth his hand to the plowe and looketh back, is fit for the Kingdome of heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. No man can serve two Maisters, for hee must despise the one. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. To preach Gods word, is to much for halfe a man: and to minister a temporall Kingdome, is to much for halfe a man. Either other requireth an whole man. One therefore cannot well doe both. The Bishops after they had put Christ out of his roome, they gate themselves to the Emperors and Kings, and so long ministred their busines, till they have also put them out of their roomes, and have get their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities from them, and raigne also in their steed: So that the Emperour and Kings are but vaine names, and shadowes, as Christ is, having nothing to doe in the world. Thus raigne they in steed of God and man, and have all power under them, and doe what they list. What names have they? My Lord Bishop, my Lord Archbishop, if it please your father-hood, if it please your Lordship, if it please your Grace, if it please your holines, and innummerable such like. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how they are esteemed, and how they are crept up above all, not into worldly seates onely, but into the seate of God, the hearts of men, where they sit above God himselfe. For, both they, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they make of their owne heades, is more feared and dread, then God and his Commandements. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists Bishops preach not, because they have no
<pb n="29" facs="16"/> leisure for their lust and pleasures, and aboundance of all things, and for the combrance that they have in Kings matters; and busines of the Realme. One keepeth the privy Seale, another the great Seale, the third is Confessor, that is to say a privy traitor, and a secret Iudas, hee is President of the Kings Counsell, hee is an Ambassadour, another sort of the Kings se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Counsell.<note n="†" place="margin">Note.</note> Wo is unto the Realmes where they are of the Counsell, as profitable are the Prelacy, unto the Realmes with their Counsell, as the Wolves unto the Sheep, or the Foxes unto the Geese.<note n="*" place="margin">

Now are they indurate and tough as Pharaoh, and will not bow unto any way or order. And therefore perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute they Gods word and the Preachers thereof, and on the other side lay awayte unto all Princes and stirre up all mischeife in the world, and send them to warre, and occupie their mindes therewith, or with other voluptuousnes, lest they should have leisure to heare the word of God, &amp; to set an order in their Realms. By them is all things ministred, and by them are all Kings ruled; yea in every Kings conscience sit they ere hee be King, and perswade him what they list, and make them both to beleive what they will, and to doe what they will, neither can any King or Realme
<pb n="30" facs="17"/> have rest for their busines. Turne thine eyes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt, and thou shalt see nothing prosperous but their subtile yolling, with that it is flowing water, yea and I trust it will be shortly a full Sea. In all their doings, though they pretend outwardly the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God, or a Common-wealth, their intent and secret Counsell is onely, to bring all under their power, and to take out of the way whosoever letteth them, or is to mighty for them.

<pb n="33" facs="18"/> to their owne vocation; to the glory of God, and the honor of the Realmes they dwelt in. Though they had not so much upon their heades, as our Bishops have, yet had they more within their heades as the Scripture and histories testifie. For they applied all the will, they had unto the vocation and ministry of the Church whereunto they were called. But our Bishops have so much witt, that they can rule and serve <hi>(as they say,)</hi> in both States, in the Church and also in the civill policy, when one of them is more then any man is able to satisfie, let him doe allwayes his best diligence. If hee be so necessary for the Court, that in civill causes hee cannot be spared, let him use that vocation, and spare the other. It is not possible, hee should doe both well.<note n="*" place="margin">See Bucerus De Regno Christi. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>12.</hi>
      </note> It is a great oversight in Princes thus to charge them with two burthens. The Primitive Church had no such Bishops as we. They had such Bishops as did preach many godly Sermons in lesse time then our Bishops horses be a brideling. Their house was a Schoole or treasure house of Gods Ministers. If it be so now, let every man judge. The Magistrates that suffer the abuse of these goods, be culpable of the fault. If the fourth part of the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke remained to the Bishop, it were sufficient, the third part to Schoolemaisters, the second to poore, and Soldiers were better bestowed. If any be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with me for this my saying, hee loveth not his owne health, nor Gods Lawes, nor mans; out of which I am alwayes ready to proove the thing, I have said to be true.

      <pb n="35" facs="22"/> themselves long customes, and authority, placing in Parliament, and many things more. And I feare me this land is not ripe to be plowed: for as the saying is, It lacketh withering. This land lacketh withering at least it is not for me to plough. For what shall I looke for among thornes, but pricking &amp; scratching? what among stones, but stumbling? what (I had all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most said) among Scorpions but stinging? But thus much I dare say, that since Lording and loytering hath come up, preaching hath gone downe contrary to the Apostles times. For they preached and Lorded not, and now they Lord and preach not. For they that be Lords, will ill goe to the plow. It is no meete office for them. It is not seeming for their estate. Thus came up Lording Loyterers. Thus crept up unpreaching Prelates. For how many unlearned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates have we now at this day? And no marvail, for if the ploughmen that now be, were made Lords, they would cleane give over-ploughing, they would leave their labour, and fall to Lording outright, and the plough stand. And then both ploughes not walking, nothing should be in the Common-wealth but hunger. For ever since the Prelates were made Lordes and Nobles, their plough standeth, there is no worke done, the people starve; they hauke, they hunt, they carde, they dice, they pastime in their Prelacies with gallant Gentlemen; with their daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Minions, and with their fresh companions, so that ploughing is set aside.<note n="*" place="margin">Lording hath put downe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. See Supplication to K. Henry the <hi>8.</hi> An. <hi>1544.</hi>
      </note> And by their Lording and Loytering, preaching and ploughing is cleane gone. And thus if the ploughmen in the country,
<pb n="36" facs="23"/> were as negligent in their office, as Prelates be, we should not long live for lacke of sustenance. And as it is necessary for to have this ploughing for the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation of the body, so must we have also the other for the satisfaction of the soule; or else we cannot live long ghostly. For as the body wasteth and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth away for lacke of bodily meate; so doth the soule<note n="*" place="margin">The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and preaching, as many now doe, onely starve and pine, not feed mens soules.</note> pine away for want of ghostly meate. And as diligently as the husbandman plougheth for the sustentation of the body; so diligently must the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Ministers labour for the feeding of the soule; both the ploughes must still be going as most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for man. They have great labors, and therefore they ought to have good livings, that they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously feed their flock; for the preaching of the word of God is called meate. Scripture calleth it meate, not strawberies, that come but once a yeare, and tarry not long, but are sone gone; but it is meate, it is no dainties. The people must have meate that must be familiar, <hi>AND CONTINVALL, and DAYLY GIVEN VNTO THEM TO FEED ON, &amp;c.</hi> And wherefore are Magistrates ordained, but that the tranquility of the Common-wealth may be confirmed, limiting both ploughes. But now for the fault of unpreaching Prelates, me thinke I could guesse what might be sayd for excusing of them. They are so troubled with Lordly livinge, they be so placed in pallaces, couched in Courts, ruffeling in their rents, dauncing in their dominions, burdened with ambassages; pampring of their paunches like a Munke that maketh his Iubely, mounching in their Maungers, and moyling in their gay Manours, and

I would heare a question, who comptrolleth the Devill at home at his parish, while hee comptrolleth the Minte? If the Apostles might not leave the office of preaching to be Deacons, shall one leave it for minting? I cannot tell you, the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that since Preistes have beene Minters, money hath beene worse then it was before: And they say, that the evilnes of money hath made all things deare. And in this behalfe I must speake to England. Heare my Country England, as Sant Paul sayd in the first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 6. <hi>chapter:</hi> for Paul was no sitting Bishop, but a walking and a preaching Bishop: <hi>Is there</hi> (saith hee) <hi>utterly among you no wise man to be an arbitrator in matters of Judgement?

         </gap>y Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, I meane not that I would have Prelates Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, nor that Lord Bps should be Lord Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents. As touching that I sayd my minde and Conscience the last yeare. And although it is sayd, Praesent, it is not meant that they should be Lord Presidents; the office of a Presidentship is a civill office, and it cannot be, that one man shall discharge both well.</note> Lord
<pb n="38" facs="24"/> President, but it must be a Prelate? Is there never a wiseman in the Realme to be a Comptroller of the Mint? I speake it to your shame, I speake it to your shame. If there be never a wise man, make a Waterbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, a Tinker, a Cobler, a Slave, a Page Comptroller of the Minte. Make ameane Gentleman, a Groome, a Yeoman, make a poore begger Lord President. Thus I speake, not that I would have it so, but to your shame. Is there never a Gentleman meet not able to be Lord President? For why are not the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and young Gentlemen of England so brought up, in the knowledge of God and in learning, that they be able to execute offices in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. The King hath a great many of Wards, and I heare there is a Court of Wards; why is there not a schoole of Wards as well as there is a Court for their lands? Why are they not set to the schooles where they may learne? Or why are they not sent to Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, that they may be able to serve the King when they come to age? The onely cause why Noblemen be not made Lord Presidents is, because they have not beene brought up in learning. Yet there be already Noblemen enough, though not so many as I could wish, able to be Lord Presidents, and wisemen enough for the Mint. And as unmeet a thing it is for Bishops to be<note n="*" place="margin">The same reason holds our Lord Presidents, Lord Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, Lord Treasurers &amp;c.</note> Lord Presidents, or Preists to be Minters, as it was for the Corinthians to plead matters of variance before heathen judges. It is also a<note n="‡" place="margin">Note.</note> slander to the Noblemen as though they lacked wisedome, and learning to be able for such offices. A Prelate hath a charge and cure otherwise; and<note n="*" place="margin">Note well.</note> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="39" facs="24"/> hee cannot discharge his duty, and be a Lord President too: For a Presidentship requireth a whole man, and a Bishop cannot be two men. A Bishop hath his office; a flocke to teach, to looke unto; &amp; therfore hee cannot meddle with another office, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth an whole man. Hee should therefore give it over to whom it is meet, and labour in his owne bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, as Paul writeth to the Thessalonians: Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man doe his owne businesse, and follow his calling. Let the Preist preach, and the Noble men handle temporall matters. Well, I would all men would looke to their duty, as God hath called them, and then we should have a flourishing Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Weale, &amp;c. But our Blaunchers, which will be Lords and no Labourers, when they are commanded to goe and be resident upon their Cures, and preach in their benefices, they will say: What? I have set a deputy there, I have a deputy, that looketh well to my flocke, and hee which shall discharge my duty. A deputy, <hi>(quod hee)</hi> I looked for that word all this while. And what a deputy must hee be trow ye? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven one like himselfe.

      <hi>Our learned Martyr</hi> Doctor Barnes, <hi>in his</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to King Henry the 8. <hi>p.</hi> 210. 211. <hi>writes:</hi> That it cannot be prooved by Scripture, that a man of the Church should have so great temporall posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as Bishops have. That they cannot by the Law of God have any Iurisdiction secular, and yet they challenge both powers. This is the Article that did bite you: for you cannot be content, with the office of a Bishop, but you will be also Kings. How that standeth with Gods Law, or with your oath, I have declared to our noble Prince. <hi>And our worthy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> Master Iohn Freth, <hi>in his</hi> Answer to Master Moores Preface, <hi>p.</hi> 116. <hi>determines thus:</hi> But surely since Sylvester received such possessions, hath the canker so crept in the Church, that it hath almost left never a sound member. Before that time there was no Bishop greedy to take a Cure: For it was no honor and profit as it is now, but onely a carefull charge, which was like to cost him his life at one
<pb n="42" facs="26"/> time or other. And therefore no man would take it, but hee that bare such a love and zeale to God, and his flocke, that hee could be content to shed his blood for them: But after that it was made so hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and so profitable, they that were worst, both in learning and living, most labored for it, for they that were vertuous would not intangle themselves, with the vaine pride of this world, and weare their Crownes of gold, where Christ did weare one of thornes. And in conclusion it came so farre, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever would give most money for it, or best could flatter the Prince (which hee knew all good men to abhorre) had the Preheminence, and got the best Bishoricke. And then in steed of Gods word, they published their owne Commandements, and made Lawes to have all under them, and made men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, they could not erre what ever they did or sayd. And even as in the roomes and steed of Moses, Aa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ron, Iosue, Caleb, and other such faithfull folke, came Herode, Annas, Caiphas, Pilate, and Iudas, which put Christ to death. So now insteed of Christ, Peter, Paul, Iames and Iohn, and the faithfull fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Christ, we have the Pope, Cardinals, Archbishops, Bishops, and proud Prelates, wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </note> to meddle too farre with matters of policy. If these two offices, I meane Ecclesiasticall and civill be so jumbled in both functions, there can be no quiet or well ordered Common-wealth.

Remember that Abimelech, when David in his banishment would have dined with him kept such hospitality, that hee had no bread to give him, but the Shewbread. Where was all his superfluity to keep your pretented hospitality? for that is the cause that you alleadge, you must have thousand thousands; as though you were commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to keepe hospitality, rather with a thousand then with a hundred: Remember the Apostles were so poore, that when the lame<note n="*" place="margin">

      <note n="m" place="margin">Chapter of Orders. Fox Acts &amp; Monuments Edit. <hi>1610.</hi> p. <hi>971.</hi>
      </note> Wee thinke it convenient, that all
<pb n="60" facs="34"/> Bishops and Pastors shall instruct and teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, committed unto their spirituall charge; that Christ did by expresse words prohibit, that none of his Apostles, nor any of their Successors, should under the pretence of authority, given unto them by Christ, take upon them the authority of the sword, that is to say, the authority of Kings, or of any civill power in this world, yea or any authority to make Lawes, or ordinances in causes, apertaining unto civill powers. If any Bishop, of what estate or dignity soever hee be, be hee Bishop of Rome, or of any other City, Province, or Diocesse, doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to take upon him authority or Iurisdiction, in causes or matters, which appertaine unto Kings, and the civill powers and their Courts, and will maintaine or thinke, that hee may so doe by the authority of Christ and his Gospell, although the Kings and Princes would not permit and suffer him so to doe. No doubt that Bishop is not worthy to be called a Bishop, but rather a tyrant, and a usurper of other mens rights, contrary to the Lawes of God, and is worthy to be reputed none otherwise, then hee that goeth about to subvert the Kingdome of Christ. For the Kingdome of Christ in his Church is spirituall, and not a carnall Kingdome of the world: that is to say, the very Kingdome that Christ by himselfe, or by his Apostles and Disciples sought here in this world, was to bring all nations from the carnall Kingdome of the Prince of darknes unto the light of his spirituall Kingdome, and so himselfe raigne in the hearts of the people by grace, faith, hope, and
<pb n="61" facs="34"/> charity. And therefore sith Christ did never seeke nor exercise any worldly Kingdome, or dominion in this world, but rather refusing and fleeing the same, did leave the said worldly governance of Kingdomes, Realmes and Nations, to be governed by Princes and Potentates (in like maner as hee did finde them) and commaunded also his Apostles and Disciples to doe the semblance; whatsoever Preist or Bishop will arrogate, or presume upon him any such authority, and will pretend the authority of the Gospell for his defence therein, hee doth nothing else; (but in a maner as you would say) crowneth Christ againe with a crowne of thornes, and traduceth and bringeth him forth againe with his mantle of purple upon his backe, to be mocked and scorned of the world, as the Iewes did to their owne damnation. <hi>Thus all our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Clergy (and after them</hi> King Henry the 8. in his necessary Erudition for any Christian man, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized and approoved by the Satute of 32.

      </note> that when Hubert, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Canterbury, was made Lord Chauncellour, cheife Iustice of England, and high Governour of all the Kings Dominions immediately under him, that hee was much blamed, and that not unworthily, and no lesse envied for taking these offices upon him: in so much that a Noble man said unto him in scorne, at what time hee was made Chauncellor, I have heard of many Chauncellours made Bishops, but of an Archbishop, that would vouchsafe to stoop to the Chauncellorship, till now I never heard of any, (for most Bishops that were Treasurers and Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, were first such Lay-officers, and Lay-men to, and then made Bishops for a reward of their service or better maintenance; not first Bishops, and then made Treasorers, Chauncellers, and such like tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall officers.) Whereupon within two yeares after his advauncement to these high places, the better to excuse his ambition, hee made a dissembling and counterfeit shew of being desirous to have his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall offices, in so much as hee dealt effectually with the King by letters, to give them leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe them,<note n="†" place="margin">Yet our great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates thinke not so.</note> saying, That the charge of his Church was worke enough for one man, whereunto onely hee would gladly dedicate himselfe. This hee did assuring himselfe in his owne conceit, that the King knowing
<pb n="63" facs="35"/> no man about him so likely, to manage those affaires as himselfe, and not being able to want him, would intreat him to retaine them still: But the King thinking his motion reasonable, and not willing longer to deny it, the Archbishop thus taken tardy in his owne snare, as though his minde and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were suddenly altered, signified unto the King in letters, that notwithstanding his great desire of betaking himselfe onely to spirituall matters, and the manyfold infirmities of his age, hee would be content to afford his labour and diligence in his other offices yet a while longer, if therein hee might doe his Majesty any profitable service, acquainting him with all, that in these two yeares, since his perfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hee had gathered for his use 1100000. markes which hee was ready to pay into his coffers, augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (it is like) the summe; and adding thereto out of his his owne purse, that so hee might in cleanly sort buy againe those honorable and gainefull offices, which his subtile dissimulation had almost lost him. But the King not long after, upon a petition of the Lords in Parliament, thrust him out of these offices; to which when he was againe restored; the Pope upon complaint by the Monkes of Canterbury of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling in civill affaires, presently enjoyned him without further delay, to resigne all his temporall offices; which hee (how loath soever) was faine to doe; the Pope assuring him, that hee would neither suffer him, nor any other Bishop or Clergy man to intermeddle in temporall affaires, commaunding all Prelates of the Church, upon their Canonicall
<pb n="64" facs="36"/> obedience, not to take upon them any temporall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, because being intangled in secular businesses, they could not possible sufficiently discharge their spirituall functions; for as the wise man saith:

<pb n="71" facs="39"/> Verily the heavenly King, who wills that men should serve him with all the heart, with all the foule, and with all the strenght, doth neither approove, nor love, nor accept his divine ministry. What then will hee doe, if a Bishop doth not give peradventure not so much as halfe of himselfe to execute the things which are of God, and become a Bishop; but committs his cures to unworthy and remisse execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, that hee may wholy serve an earthly Court or Palace? For no halfe man can sufficiently admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the offices of an earthly Prince. By which sentences and examples wee verily are admonished, that assiduous care and study of Cleargy men, in worldly and civill affaires, which makes them proove slow and unfit to divine things, is by all meanes to be reprooved, and that the complaint of those is very unjust, who tax them for not intermeddling with temporall affaires, and study to call them back from divine things, to which they ought with all their might to apply themselves. <hi>Thus this Archbishop</hi>
