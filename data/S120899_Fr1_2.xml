Who will giue me water vnto my head and fluds of teares vnto mine eyes, that I may be wayle day and night the Slayne of my Country!</hi> Let (I say) this weake inclination of Nature yeeld vnto Gods holy will, and vnto the motion of heauenly Grace concurring with Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to preferre before priuate sorrow for friendes, the publicke

      <hi>Luctus mortui septem dies,</hi> especially for them whose soules (as we with reason hope) do raigne in glory, be changed into mourning for <hi>blind Ignorance and Impiety,</hi> which the same Holy Spirit will haue commeasured vnto the length of their life, <hi>luctus fatui &amp; impij omnes dies vitae eorum,</hi> to wit, so long as there is hope by teares of instruction to reclayme them.</p>
   <p>This Duty is necessary for foure ends, and vndertaken for the satisfaction of foure sortes of persons.

Secondly, to still their teares who thinke they cannot weepe inough for their Friendes, not so much at their death, as at their being taken away by so strange and dreadfull a mischance. Thirdly, to allay the wondering of them that secretly may complayne of the seuerity of Gods iudgments, that in these circumstances he would not spare his owne People, not spare his owne Name. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to somewhat asswage their sorrow who grieue not for temporall respects,<note place="margin">Psal. 41.3.</note> but <hi>their teares are to them bread day and night,</hi> to see Gods Enemyes insult vpon his Church, &amp; to say vnto her, <hi>where is thy God?</hi> Which foure kinds of persons styrred vp and troubled with different affections, by one, and the same commiserable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shappe, we shall endeauour to quiet by foure kind of Arguments; by Testimonies of holy Scripture; by Examples of former Christian tymes; by comparison with some more prodigious euents vnto our Aduersaries; finally by shewing Gods ends in the permission of this Accident, of which we may make our Profit.</p>
