      <hi>Qu.</hi> Is there any place in the Scripture, that vrgeth men
to bee fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in perfection, and
striving to be perfect:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Answer.</hi> Yes: Ye shall therfore be perfect, as your Father
which is in heauen is perfect, Mat. 5. 48. Also the great commandement doth
say: <hi>Loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp; with all thy soule,
and with all thy minde, and with all thy strength. This is the first and the
great commandement. And the second is like vnto this: Thou shalt loue thy
neighbour as thy selfe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="19"/> On these two commandements hangeth the whole Law and
the Prophetes.</p>
   <p>The whole Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, and is
profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to teach, to improue, to correct, and to instruct in
righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes: That the Man of God may be absolute, being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnto
all good workes, 2. Tim. 3. 16. 17.</p>
   <p>This is a straight gate, yet we are commaunded to striue to enter
in at the straite gate, Luke 13. 24.</p>
   <p>Now he that despiseth the Teacher &amp; vrger of this Doctrine,
despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Authour of the doctrine even Christ him selfe.</p>
   <p>Although no man can be perfect in this life, yet it is no reason
that the mouth of the Oxe should be moozled, for treadinge out the corne before
them: and telling men what they ought to bee, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh he knoweth, that none
can be perfect in this life, no more then a Cammell can goe through the eye of
a needle, and though this be vnpossible to man, yet nothing is vnpossible to
God.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>When thou art converted, strengthen thy Brethren.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Iesus
the great shepheard of the sheepe▪ through the blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
covenant, make you perfect in all good workes, to do his will, working in you
that which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in his sight, through Iesus Christ, to whom be praise
for euer. AMEN.</p>
