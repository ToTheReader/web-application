   <head>THE AVTHORS ADMONI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>BEloued <hi>Reader,</hi> it is about fourtene years past since <hi>I</hi> was commanded by the late Illustrate and most vertuous Princesse <hi>Iean, Queene of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> to reduce the <hi>Historie of Iudith,</hi> in forme of a <hi>Poeme Epique,</hi> wherein <hi>I</hi> haue not so much aimed to follow the phrase or text of the byble, as <hi>I</hi> haue preased (without wandring from the veritie of the Historie) to imitate <hi>Homer</hi> in his <hi>Iliades,</hi> and <hi>Virgill</hi> in his <hi>Aene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idos,</hi> and others who hath left to vs workes of such like matter: thereby to render my worke so much the more delectable. And if the effect hath not answeared to my desire, <hi>I</hi> beseech thee to laye the fault vppon her who proposed to me so meane a <hi>Thean e</hi> or subiect, and not on mee who could not honestly disobeye. Yet in so much as <hi>I</hi> am the first in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> who in a iust <hi>Poeme</hi> hath treated in our toung of sacred things, I hope of thy fauour to receiue some excuse, seing that things of so great weight cannot be both perfectly begunne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together. If thou neither alow my stile nor work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, at least thou shalt be driuou to alow the honest pretence and holy desire which <hi>I</hi> haue to see the youth of <hi>Fraunce</hi> so holyly by mine example exercysed.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>I</hi> may not forget that they doe greatly wrong mee, Who thinkes that in discriuing the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of this Historie (truelie tragicall) thinkes that <hi>I</hi> am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comme a voluntairy Aduocate to these trouble some &amp; sedicious sprites (who for to serue their temerarious passions, and priuate inspirations) conspires against the
<pb facs="6"/>liues of placed princes. For so much doe I disassent that this example and the like ought to be drawen in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quēce, that I am verily perswaded that the act of <hi>Ahud,</hi> of <hi>Iaell,</hi> and of <hi>Iudith,</hi> who vnder coulour of obeisance and pretext of amitie layde their reuenging handes vppon <hi>Aeglon, Sisara,</hi> &amp; <hi>Holophernes:</hi> had beene worthie of a hundreth gallowes, a hundreth fires, and a hundreth wheeles, if they had not beene peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chosen of God for to vnlose the chaines, and breake the bands which retainde the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> people in more then <hi>Aegiptian</hi> seruitude, and expresly called to kill those tyrants with a death as shamefull as their liues were wicked and abhominable. But seing this question is so diffuse that it cannot bee absolued in few words, &amp; that my braine is to weake for so high an enterprise, <hi>I</hi> send you to those who haue spent more oyle and tyme in turning the leaues of the sacred scriptures, then <hi>I</hi> haue done for the present. It mee sufficeth for the tyme to admonish the <hi>Reader,</hi> to attempt nothing without a cleare and indubitable vocation of God against those whom he hath erected aboue vs and aboue althing, not to abuse the lawe of humaine hospitalitie, and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bands for to giue place to these frenetike oppinions so to abolish a pretēted tyrannie. <hi>I</hi> haue also to warne thee of two different sortes of men of the which one sort is so depraued that they can heare nothing, but that which is altogether prophane, and the other is so supersticious that they make conscience not only to write, but also to reade of holy things in vearse, as though that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and iointure of sillabes were so constrained as it
<pb facs="6"/>were vnpossible to keepe the sence vnperuerted, or at least excessiuely obscured. Now if <hi>I</hi> perceine that this my first assay may be to thee agreable, <hi>I</hi> shall continue more gladly my new commenced race in such sort that thou shalt not repent thine indulgence, nor <hi>I</hi> my passed paines. But if cōtrarie fall, in time to come <hi>I</hi> wilbe ware to lay out my small pack in this ample <hi>Theatre</hi> of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> where there is almost as many Iudgements as beholders. A Dieu.</p>
