   <head>THE AVTHOR TO THE COVRTEOVS READER, TOVCHING THE REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of this present Dedication to the Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>House of</hi> HOVVARDS.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Muse, courteous Reader, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing meditated certaine Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall and Poeticall Essayes, as well in Latine, as in English, in honour of our most gracious King <hi>Iames,</hi> his most Noble wife Queene <hi>Anne,</hi> and of their most hopefull children, Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> Princesse <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and Prince <hi>Fredericke</hi> her Spouse, in whose common extraction &amp; descent, I haue remarked no fewer then 25. Emperours, and 30. Kings of diuers Countries, I resolued with my selfe to commend the same to the honourable Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of the Illustrious house of <hi>Howard,</hi> for these reasons following.</p>
   <p>First, because of the singular excellencie of this name, in whose extraction no fewer then 12. Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and 30. Kings of diuers Countries, are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, whereof most part are the same Emperours and Kings which do occurre in the extraction common
<pb facs="7"/>to the aboue-named, two most Noble Princes, as shall bee shewed, God-willing, in our Latine worke: and truely it must needs be a thing that doth much il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate and commend, the exceellencie and honour of our King and Country, to haue such Subiects as this worthy house doth yeeld, being so Nobilitated by the meanes both of their Princely descent, and of their publicke deserts, as they are.</p>
   <p>Secondly, because of a certaine kind of honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and notable similitude, and affinity, that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble name of <hi>Howard</hi> hath with the Royall name of <hi>Steward;</hi> for both names do signifie, in the old Saxon tongue, as much as the Warden, or Gouernour of a a Place, Fort, or Castle; both being at the first impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by reason of the charge, preferment and place, the two first persones, that were so named, did beare in the Common-wealth.</p>
   <p>So that these two Sur-names, may truely say, that which many other Sur-names cannot say; which is, that the first two Wights, that euer bare the names of <hi>Steward</hi> and <hi>Howard,</hi> as they were both borne in South-britanny, so were they both men of quality, reputation and rancke, and euen such, as wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly name Gentlemen, and Noblemen.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, as both names giue the Lyon Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant, though different in coulour, for their badge or Armes; so both can fetch their Pedigree from diuers of the same Emperours, and Kings of diuers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and namely from Kings of England, and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Likewise both names haue beene matched with the Royall bloud of England; for as <hi>Margaret,</hi> a daughter of England, was married to a Royall
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>Steward</hi> of Scotland, King <hi>Iames</hi> the 4. (in the which businesse a Noble <hi>Howard</hi> had an especiall employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) so <hi>Katherine,</hi> a daughter of the house of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> was married to a King of England, <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. Besides, that famous Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from this Illustrious house on her mothers side, the Lady <hi>Anne Bolen,</hi> whose mother was the Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Howard</hi> Countesse of <hi>Wilshire</hi> and <hi>Ormond,</hi> daughter to <hi>Thomas,</hi> the first of this name, Duke of <hi>Norfolke.</hi> As also the foresaid two Names, haue had the fortune to seeke and aime at a three-fold matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Vnion one with another. The first attempt and designe of marriage (but hindered) was betweene a Royall <hi>Steward,</hi> euen a matchlesse Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> and a Princely <hi>Howard, Thomas</hi> the third of this name, Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> brother to <hi>Henry,</hi> Earle of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton,</hi> Lord Priuy-seale, father to <hi>Thomas,</hi> Earle of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> Lord Chamberlaine, &amp; Grand-father to <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> the sonne of Earle <hi>Phillip.</hi> The second attempt, or designe of marriage, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the sonne and daughter of the fore-said two Princes, to wit, betweene <hi>Charles-Iames <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>ward</hi> Prince of Scotland, and the Lady <hi>Margaret Howard,</hi> which was likewise hindred with the former. The third designe onely tooke effect, by the vniting-meanes of our Concording-King, the Maker of the marriage betweene <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> Earle of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi> Lord <hi>Admirall,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Margaret Steward</hi> daughter of <hi>Iames</hi> Earle of <hi>Murrey.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, it hath bene the common fortune of both these names to reape much good lucke, and preferment, either of them by the meanes of three
<pb facs="8"/>Ladies, being both of the same Country, and of the same names, to wit, either of them by two <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets</hi> and one <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The three English Ladies, which brought good fortune to the Royall name of <hi>Steward,</hi> were these; first, <hi>Margaret,</hi> the daughter of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> sur-named the <hi>Out-law,</hi> son of King <hi>Edmond Ironside,</hi> who being married to <hi>Malcolme Cammore</hi> King of Scotland, brought to King <hi>Iames,</hi> the first right of succession to this Crowne; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of the house of <hi>Yorke,</hi> daughter to King <hi>Edward</hi> the 4. married to King <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. of the house of <hi>Lancaster:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Margaret,</hi> their eldest daughter borne in the blessed white-red Vnion-bed of the two Roses, who being married to <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth, king of Scotland, brought the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond right of succession to our most gracious King <hi>Iames,</hi> the happy Vniter of the two Kingdomes. To these three Ladies of <hi>Britanny,</hi> wee may adde other these of <hi>Germany,</hi> bearing the same names, from the which King <hi>Iames,</hi> and his hopefull children, namely, Prince <hi>Fredericke,</hi> are collineally descended, and they are these; first, <hi>Margaret</hi> Countesse of <hi>Holland,</hi> Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse of <hi>Bauier</hi> and Empresse, wife to <hi>Lodowicke</hi> the 5. Duke of <hi>Bauier</hi> and Emperour; secondly, <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Princesse <hi>Palatine</hi> &amp; Empresse, wife to <hi>Robert</hi> Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> and Emperour, thirdly, <hi>Margaret</hi> Dutchesse of <hi>Lorraine</hi> their daughter. And it is my ardent wish that the fore-said two <hi>Germane Margarets</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> may proue as lucky to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and his hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full children for their Imperiall preferment in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> as the two English <hi>Margarets</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> haue done for his Royall preferment in <hi>Britanny.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <p>And the three Ladies of the same names which brought good fortune and preferment to the house of <hi>Howard,</hi> were these; first, <hi>Margaret Plantagenet</hi> Dutchesse of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> the onely daughter and heire of <hi>Thomas Plantagenet,</hi> Earle of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> son to King <hi>Edward</hi> the 1: secondly, <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Lady <hi>Segraue,</hi> the daughter and heire of the said Lady-Dutchesse <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Segrane;</hi> thirdly, <hi>Margaret Mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi> daughter of the said Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and of <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Mowbray,</hi> maried to Sir <hi>Robert Howard</hi> Knight, the father and mother of <hi>Iohn</hi> Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolke.</hi> So that as a <hi>Robert</hi> was the first Royall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor of the Royall <hi>Stewards,</hi> King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce</hi> surnamed the <hi>Noble,</hi> being the Grand-father of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> the first King of the <hi>Stewards;</hi> and as a <hi>Robert</hi> Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> and Emperour, likewise sur-named the <hi>Noble,</hi> is he, from whom King <hi>Iames</hi> and Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> are descended both in the 9. degree (as our late published Pedigree doth show) so was a Noble <hi>Robert</hi> the first Progenitor of the Dukes of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> of the honoured name of <hi>Howard,</hi> vnto whose wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Patronage, wee thought good, for the reasons afore-said, and others wee might mention, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our Essayes in Latine and English (whereof these Presents are but a scantling) vndertaken by vs, in honour of a number of most Noble Princes: And thus, Courteous Reader, crauing thy fauourable construction of these our endeuours, wee hauing no other intent, but onely thereby to do honour in a schollar-like kind, to such as are worthy of honour, we bid thee hartely fare-well.</p>
