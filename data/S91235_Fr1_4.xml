      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a sorrowfull matter, but yet for the knowledge of thinges done in those dayes, necessarie to be entreated of. For I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thinke but that when Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon of Athens that excellēt Clerke, dyd wryte of the bese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and famishing of Athens and of the throwing downe of the walles of it, he was sorie in his harte that he had occasyon so to doe. And yet he wrate it, bycause he thought it expediēt that the rememberance of such things shuld not perishe. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth our Liuy deserue les praise when he reherceth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and burning of Rome by the Frenchmen, then when he setteth out y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> famous triumph of Paulus Emylius ouer the

      </gap>s Affricanus. For it is the dutie of an historie to put in writing all aduētures as well unfortunate as fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. And therfore a man maye wyshe y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> best, but he must write be it good or bad as occasiē of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth. I assure you as I was inditinge these matters, albeit many things did greue me, for thentier loue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I beare to my natiue countrye, yet not wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng thys reason I had to comfortine, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> although Italy suffered at y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> time most extreme miseries. yet at the length she not onely gate thupper hand &amp; expulsed those forreine nations but also hath remayned from y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> day to this most welthy &amp; puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant both by sea and land, and
<pb facs="14"/>that from that tyme forth her Cities haue florished in ryches &amp; aucthorie most abundantly, and doe florishe still at this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, thonour and dominion of thē now stretching it self far of on al sides, so that the thinges that haue happened vnto her, seme not so much to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to be reioyced at, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hercules whose greate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits made him more famous then euer he should haue bene yf he had not attempted those daungerous enterprises. I wil not speake of the great Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, good Nurture, Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye, &amp; trad of all Liberall arts &amp; learning, of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which Italy she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth it self to be a natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; a very nourice, for I will let y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> comendations of her alon vntil another tyme. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="14"/>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> warres y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we now must entreate of, there remained no mention of thē among y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Latin writers onely there went a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port frō man to mā &amp; that very slēder &amp; obscure, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Belisarius &amp; Narses captains of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> emperour Iustinian draue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Gothes out of Italy, but where or in what sort, or by what meanes, there was no inkling at al left in wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting. We came by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> knowledge of thē out of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> grek Chroncles. Wherfore as I had don by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thinges before, so also I endenored to bring agayn to light these things beīg wellny blurred &amp; blotted out of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> so much y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rather, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> other stories for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> most part do concern thaffaires &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ings of strāgers, but this cōcer neth wholy our own matters.
<pb facs="15"/>Wherein it maye be worthe a mans labour to search &amp; peruse y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> state of Italye in those daies what Cities, and what kind of people were in it what townes and cities were beseged, which were wonne and brought in subiectio, &amp; in what places bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells were fought. For to know all these thynges it is a great prayse, and not to know thē it is a foule shame. For it is a tokē that a man loueth his country, not to be ignoraunt in thorigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and procedings therof, or whatsoeuer ells hath fortuned vnto it in tymes past. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> knowledge of Histories doth greatly delight the mynd bycause all we men doe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture couit to know things, and also it bringeth great profit for
<pb facs="15"/>as much as it contameth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of like affaires to what end they came, &amp; gyueth experi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ens in many thyngs, through the which old men are accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wiser then yongmē, bicause they haue sene ino thynges in their liues time, and by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens not only of their own but also of other mens perilles, are made more ware, and therfore are able to giue better iudgmēt and are wont to be led by bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter counsel. For whē they rede of the riches and Empires of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> greatest kyngs and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> puissan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test nations and percayue how sone they com to decay, they vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstand by &amp; by what a folly it is to boast &amp; be prowd for those things, whych no man is able to assure himself that they shall
<pb facs="16"/>cōtinue with him vntill night. Thus doth an Historye make vs bothe more wyse and more modest in our dooinges. And therfore ryght reuerend father I determined to dedicate these Bookes vnto you, as well to thentent you might vnderstād my entier loue and affection to wardes you, as also that you myghte be as a Iudge of my worke and trauel, the which I shal thinke very well bestowed if so myse and wel learned a mā as you are, doe allow them and take them in good worthe. Whereuppon I wyll take occasion to goe in hand with the processe of myne Historye. Farrewell.</p>
