What is wrought in every ones heart <hi>God</hi> onely knowes.

      </gap>eech you in the <hi>Lord,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and well consider your holy calling: You pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse your selues Christians, even the followers of Christ, and you haue, and may here againe evidently discerne the Lord, by his Spirit shewing you <hi>the old and good way,</hi> and leading you in it by footing of this excellent Prophet. Now manifest your selues to be, as your are and will be called; be Christians: follow the voice of the Lord in his word, follow his followers, and set your feete into the path of life. Will you walke in the counsell of the ungodly? stand in the way of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? sit downe in the seat of scorners? Will you sweare, curse, lie, slander? will you drinke, roare, will you speake wantonly, will you with such carelesnesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane the Sabboth, despise <hi>God</hi> in his saving Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, neglect the Lord in your families, and then thinke and say, <hi>We shall be delivered, though we doe all these abominatiōs?</hi> Take heed my Brethren, we serue a most gracious, but yet a jealous <hi>God,</hi> whose <hi>jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie shall smoke against such despisers,</hi> to bring all the fearefull curses temporall and eternall (threatned in the Law) upon such a rebellious miserable creature.
