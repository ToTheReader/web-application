      <hi>THe Author of the following Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers had thoughts of reviewing and inlarging them before he parted with them; and at least, of an annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Notes to several of those Titles of the historical Platform, that are yet left untouch'd. But, besides his want of health and leisure, he was, by the supervening of some urgent occasions, oblig'd abruptly enough to lay aside this work he was about, and apply himself to others, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd him more than the Scrutiny of Mineral Waters could. Wherefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, that he had already made Annotations, though but short ones, upon most of the considerablest Titles or Topicks of inquiry, enumerated in the Second and Principal Part of his
<pb facs="4"/>
Schemes above them, he was content to give the ensuing writing unfinished as it was, to the Solicitations of some</hi> Vertuosi, <hi>who rather than tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry till he should have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he knows not how long he shall want, were desirous to take what they sound ready, with all its imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Which pressingness of theirs he could not deny to be the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable, on this occasion, because the communicated writing is not pretended to be a full and methodical History of Mineral Waters, but only a bundle of</hi> Short Memoirs, <hi>contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the compiling of such a Work.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>These, that they may be the more conveniently cited or referr'd to, I thought sit to divide into six Sections; where of the First is introductory, and and contains some General Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the Occasion, the Subject, and some other things relating to those Memoirs. The Second contains only a set of Titles for the First Part of the proposed Work, because urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions kept me from making, as I
<pb facs="4"/>
intended, some Marginal Notes, upon several of the particular Articles. The third exhibits a Scheme of Titles for the Second Part of the propos'd work,</hi> viz. <hi>The way of experimentally exploring portions of a Mineral Water sever'd from the Spring or Receptacle. And because the Second Part is that which I mainly design'd, I have referr'd to it two other Sections, one, which is the Fourth, containing a Collection of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments and Observations relating to the usual way of examining Mineral Waters by Galls, as a</hi> Specimen <hi>given on the 13th Title of larger Annotations on the Titles of the Second Part; and the</hi> other <hi>consisting of less copious Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and sometimes much shorter Notes on divers other Articles of the same Second Part. To which Lastly is subjoyn'd the sixth Section, consisting only of a Set of Articles, referrable to the Medicinal use of Mineral Waters; together with a Conclusion address'd to the ingenious Dr. that set me upon this Task. In prosecuting of which I desire
<pb facs="5"/>
it may not be thought strange, that I have not cited Authors that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of</hi> Thermae <hi>or of</hi> Acidulae. <hi>For in the disadvantageous Circumstances wherein I wrote, I should have been kept from consulting them, if I had had them at hand. And I thought it enough for for me at that time, to impart to my Friends, what my own Experiments and Thoughts had furnish'd me with, how little or mean soever that was. Which Advertisement is therefore the more fit to be here given, that I may not divert any from studying those more elaborate Pieces, that have within no long time been publish'd by skilful Men, and especially by the very learned, Dr.</hi> Lister.</p>
