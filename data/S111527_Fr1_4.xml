   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, my two
yeeres silence since the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of my last Latine
poems argueth me in thy
censure, eyther to haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerslept
my selfe with Epimenides, or to
haue plaid the micher amongst the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
Antipodes. Which inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(I confesse) the worldes ingratitude,
being a great discouragement, and the
burthen of my professiō, a necessary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
made me with diligent care to
attend another Cynosure, by which the
course of my studies might be directed.
In consideration whereof fearing some
patent of concealement I breake forth
at length, and am come to plead mine
own tenure in a more familiar language.
And this I do, aswell because euery one
may perfectly know my meaning, as
that I might craue pardon of mine audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
if either I goe awrie, or chaunce to
trip, no mā goeth so vpright, but he may
by some casualty or other kisse the
ground. It is a good horse, that neuer
stūbleth. Erre I may in writing, but it is
thy part (courteous Reader) to brooke
mine errours with patience.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
As for the subiect of my discourse, it
resembleth the hearbe Muscouy, in that
as it being ioyned to other flowers dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
the sweetnes of thē: so these fruits
of mine being now growne to a Groue,
will augment each other sauour to the
sence-pleasing comfort of the reader. If
any man delight to haue himselfe shine
with a glorious shewe of vertue, I haue
giuen him the toppes of moral behauior;
if to haue his house and family wel beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified;
I haue yeelded him diuers braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
for that purpose; if to haue his coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
flourish, I haue sent him the deep-grounded
stemme of policy. And if the
greatest Gardener of the best manured
Eden had vouchsafed me the settes of
Diuiner worth, such as bloomed in the
holy and golden groues of his Prophets,
I would haue offred vp a sweet smelling
sacrifice of the purest choise; but since
that glorious Paradise for the first mans
offence hath bene shut vp from any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce,
I thought good to present thee
with such fruites, as this earth affoords, a
three leau'd bud, not onely of incōpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sweetnes to him, that hath it, but also
of infinit admiration to him, that behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
In conclusion, wheras in these bookes
I make often mention of my Comenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
vpon Persius, thou shalt-vnderstād,
that I haue had thē ready together with
a most easie Paraphrase in English and
Latine to be printed aboue a tweluemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
agoe, but for certain respects, I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thē to be closed in a case of delay &amp;
reiourneied, till I find better leasure to
put thē forth. For euen thus &amp; thus must
we take opportunity for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> publishing of
our labours, howsoeuer they may chaūce
to please the curious sort <hi>but so and so.</hi> If I
could promise my selfe kind &amp; gracious
acceptāce, I would promise our age the
like Cōmentaries vpon a Satyrist of the
like vaine, euen the learned <hi>Iuuenal,</hi>
thereby to stirre vp other men,
<q>
         <l>—quos aequus amauit</l>
         <l>Iuppiter, aut ardens euexit ad aethera virtus</l>
      </q>
to giue light to his gloomie and hidden
excellency. In the meane time view o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
this Golden-groue seriously, and, if
thou reapest, any good thereby, glorifie
the great Lord of Hierarchies, who for
thy sake gaue mee grace to frame it.
Farewell.</p>

      <signed>Thine in the Lord
