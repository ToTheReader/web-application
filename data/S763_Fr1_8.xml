   <p>AS that Honorable Lord <hi>Nepeir</hi> (the first inventer of <hi>Loga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rythmes</hi>) did call his <hi>Rods</hi> by reason of their facility in operation <hi>Rabdologia,</hi> the speech of <hi>Rods,</hi> and his numbers, <hi>Logarythmes,</hi> the speech of <hi>numbers:</hi> So this <hi>Instrumentall Projection</hi> as springing from that invention, I called <hi>Grammelogia,</hi> the speech of <hi>lines;</hi> for being so projected as they are, these lines graduated, doe promptly teach one what to speake in <hi>proportionall operations;</hi> which invention of projection of <hi>Logarythmes Circular,</hi> I promised to enlarge at the end of my first publication, with this intituled <hi>Grammelogia,</hi> or the <hi>Mathematicall Ring,</hi> Printed, Anno. 1630. notwithstanding it was there sufficiently perspicuous, how it might bee augmented unto any magnitude assigned, even to operate unto <hi>minuts,</hi> and <hi>seconds</hi> in <hi>Trigonometrie,</hi> and to finde <hi>Rootes,</hi> and <hi>proportionall numbers</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Arithmeticke</hi> unto sixe or more places: a <hi>diagramme</hi> of which projection I now here deliver, as fully sufficient to shadow out to the more learned the quintessence of this <hi>Logarythmall projection</hi> in <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> unto 6. 10. 40. 100. or 1000. yea, to as great a capacity as one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, (a project by Instrument never yet produced, though long desired) which plurality of <hi>Circles</hi> in this projection, must be conceived to bee the parts of <hi>Circles,</hi> and so there may bee a <hi>quadruplicitie</hi> of them,

         </gap>es of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> so this whole projection as adherent unto it, may not unfitly be called the <hi>Circles of Numbers, Sines, and Tangents,</hi> or in respect of operation (as some others lately called the <hi>Circles</hi> of my <hi>King</hi> singly projected on a <hi>Plate</hi> or <hi>plaine</hi>) the <hi>Circles of proportion,</hi> in which may be noted, that if this projection be made of 10. <hi>Circles,</hi> then may there be a <hi>quadruplicitie</hi> of them, which in all make 40. <hi>Circles,</hi> one <hi>quadruplicitie</hi> of which may serve for the inserting the <hi>Logarythmes
<pb facs="6"/> of numbers,</hi> another for the <hi>Logarythmes of Sines,</hi> and the other two for the <hi>Logarythmes of Tangents.</hi> If the projection be of 50. <hi>Circles,</hi> then the whole projection will be of 200. <hi>Circles,</hi> whose graduations, beginnings, and terminations in each whole <hi>revolution</hi> is the same with the former; and as there is a conformity in the <hi>Projection</hi> by a greater number of <hi>Circles,</hi> as there is by a lesser; so is there the same facilitie and agreement in operation by many <hi>Circles,</hi> as by few, and the way how I have delivered in this Tractate, which is either by motion in a double projection, or in a single projection, by helpe of a thred &amp; lead, or a single or double Index at the Center, or periphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria: upon which I deliver severall wayes in this following Treatise. How it may please some mens affections I know not, my intentions and desires are free. Now since the publication of the first kinde of <hi>Logarythmes</hi> Projection, Anno 1630. or the originall of this enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it hath pleased many about this City and <hi>Kingdome</hi> to take liking thereunto, some contenting themselves with the double pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, with a moveable and fixed Circle, some with the single ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an <hi>Index</hi> at the <hi>Center:</hi> but generally the most part have beene by some invited if not forced to that which carries, as they say, with it the aplause and vote of men by a comparative attribution delivered by the assumed <hi>Author</hi> of that with an Index on a <hi>Plate,</hi> that the way on the plate in a single Projection with an Index at the <hi>Center,</hi> is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way than that of my <hi>Ring,</hi> or that of a double <hi>Projection</hi> on a <hi>Plaine:</hi> The authority of whose words to some ignorant mechanick composors of that <hi>Instrument,</hi> was a sufficient motive ever since to crowne his words with a divulged rumour out of their borrowed knowledge to maintaine his assertion, to put off their commodities, howsoever if the saddle (as the proverbe is) were put on his right place, this vote and attribution belongs to another, who fitted the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument</hi> so as it is now used, &amp; yet modestly would not appeare in it, and not our supposed <hi>Author,</hi> which assumption of fitting of it so with an <hi>Index</hi> on a <hi>Plate,</hi> had beene enough if not too much, without such a divulgation of endeavouring what in him lyeth, and in others, to annihilate and beate downe the way which I write upon, and to glory in the raising up of his supposed owne: thereby not onely possessing men with an untruth, but making me also ignorant in my choyse, that I should give unto the world the weakest and imperfectest part of the projection of <hi>Logarythmes,</hi> and leave the best for another to write up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Of which single <hi>Projection</hi> with an <hi>Index</hi> at the <hi>Center,</hi> had I first writ upon and left the other way, which is the double <hi>Projection</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/> for some other to write upon: then might he have used not indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that comparative aspertion of better. But before I writ of the <hi>Naturall sympathy</hi> of this projection, I was not unadvised which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to present unto the <hi>King,</hi> and to the publike view of the <hi>world</hi> first, but considered intentively with my selfe the excellency of both wayes, and the more copious performance of the one, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the other; And why I delivered it first in a <hi>Ring,</hi> was, for the aptnesse and gentile-forme (as I may call it) it naturally might be cast into. Secondly, for the excellent harmony, facility and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the <hi>Logarythmes</hi> so projected did afford: having no secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary assistance to helpe it in operation, but the motion of the <hi>Circle</hi> it selfe, for there was nothing to do but to move one number to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a proportion assigned, either in a double <hi>Projection</hi> in single Circles, or the projection inlarged; and instantly there was presented all other numbers in the same proportion; By an <hi>Index</hi> on a <hi>Plate</hi> in a single <hi>Proiection</hi> it was grosse and course for the forme (in respect of a <hi>Ring)</hi> and for operation there must bee besides extending the feet of the <hi>Index</hi> to the members, upon every severall question a new search of numbers with a new motion (which extending of the feet of the <hi>Index,</hi> was the same with M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Gunters Invention</hi> of his <hi>Ruler</hi> and no new <hi>invention</hi>) Besides if the single Projection bee inlarged there doth necessarily adhere unto it sundry &amp; manifold observations in the way of operation by it, which cannot be avoided, which to a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the first seemes not a little harsh &amp; difficult; all which the <hi>Ring</hi> or the way of the <hi>Ring on a plate,</hi> in the double <hi>Proiectiō</hi> inlarged, doth naturally avoyd, and not only caries a facility in its operation, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in it also a speciall advantage in its performance, once rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the <hi>eye</hi> and the <hi>hand</hi> may worke together, and what the <hi>eye</hi> finds in proportion, the <hi>pen</hi> may presently expresse in <hi>writing</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a second trouble to search out another number as before, and then to bring the edge of the <hi>Index</hi> to it. But some envious detractors would not admit of this forme and facility (though perhaps the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding times may) eyther as before to disanull the worke, or for the difficultie that was found in an unexpert <hi>workeman</hi> in the true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing and <hi>making of the worke,</hi> for if the Circles on the <hi>Ring,</hi> or double <hi>Proiection on a plaine</hi> being not exactly composed and gradua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may cause some small error in operation (which is onely from an excentricke motion) the single <hi>Proiection</hi> hath not onely the same defect, but also a second to helpe it, to wit the <hi>Index,</hi> for by how much the legs of it are long and the Instrument large, by so much the more
<pb facs="7"/> is it subject to errour, which is from a continued augmentation of an error in the fitting of it to a lesser Circle which hath reference to a greater. <hi>But</hi> to passe by the errors that are subject to the best kinde of <hi>Instruments</hi> that can be made, let us a little examine the <hi>Authors</hi> &amp; others comparison of <hi>Better,</hi> why the way of the <hi>Index</hi> in a single <hi>Proiection</hi> is better then a mooveable and fixed Circle, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to have reference unto foure generalls about the <hi>Instrument. First,</hi> either in the forme of the <hi>Instrument; Secondly,</hi> in the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Circles thereon; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the expedition that is found in the practise thereof; And <hi>fourthly</hi> and lastly, the copiousnesse of the uses of the <hi>Instrument:</hi> and other c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uses I conceive not, why this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Projection with an Index is better then a double, except it be in the magnitude that is now usually made, or for the price of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument:</hi> in the first there may bee an equall extendure of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes unto both <hi>Instruments,</hi> and so as a thing common unto them, and no wise different. And for the price it may bee made as cheape, if not cheaper hereafter as I shall order it for these that aflect them: Now in the first place as touching the forme, upon that I have spoken somewhat alre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>dy, (as afore said) and may be sufficient: as for the <hi>second</hi> generall touching that of the ordering of the Circles on this double projection, to have one <hi>Circle mooveable</hi> and one <hi>Circle fixed,</hi> that is agreeable to the projection and dividing of these Circles in the first direction following, according to the great <hi>scheme</hi> in the <hi>Booke</hi> noted with the letter <hi>A,</hi> for if the Circle of numbers noted with <hi>N, N,</hi> be cut through, and the Center of that <hi>Circular plaine</hi> be fastned, so that it may move upon the Center of the other Circle, it shall fully represent the projection of my <hi>Ring</hi> upon a <hi>Plaine,</hi> to which may bee placed a small single Index as in the <hi>scheme</hi> of the title page <hi>B,</hi> to helpe the <hi>eye</hi> for the finding of opposite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, these <hi>Circles</hi> of the mooveable, or fixed <hi>Circles</hi> on the plaine are inserted on both sides of a <hi>Ring</hi> as it is specified at the end of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of these <hi>Circles.</hi> Now to have all the <hi>Circles</hi> placed upon one side of the <hi>Ring</hi> (as is according to the second direction of making the <hi>Ring</hi>) were to leave the other side naked, without one would <hi>patch</hi> and <hi>peece</hi> some other thing on the other side, therefore to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyde mixture, part of the projection (as an ornament) is placed on the other side, by which occasion the whole projection at once is not visible to the eye, as it would be in the second way in accommodating the Circles into a <hi>Ring,</hi> as is in the double projection on a <hi>Plaine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, noted with <hi>A.</hi> But perhaps it may be objected that
<pb facs="8"/> the Circles are easily continued on a <hi>Plaine,</hi> and the Index being at the Center the edge of it, doth accuratly cut each Circle in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionalls, which intersections in a <hi>Ring</hi> are defective and difficult to finde by the eye alone. To all which I answer, that the Circles in a <hi>Ring</hi> are as easy to be continued as on a <hi>Plate,</hi> allowing the moove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and <hi>fixed Circle</hi> a sufficient breadth, and here by the way I would have the <hi>Reader</hi> to understand that the <hi>Circle</hi> of <hi>Tangents</hi> being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected from 1. gr. unto 45. gr. is sufficient for operation (these degrees being their complements to 90. gr. but for greater expedition in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king they may be continued as is seene in the great <hi>scheme A,</hi> which continuation I learned not from another (as may bee suspected by some) seeing I now published it after another, but long before that publication I instructed sundry persons upon that continuation by way of facility. As for the second clause in such Circles which are not upon the edge of the <hi>mooveable</hi> and <hi>fixed Circle,</hi> where the eye seemes to bee troubled to point out some opposite <hi>numbers,</hi> a small edge of <hi>metall</hi> may easily supply that (as many use to doe) but the graduations being so nere the edge of the Circle, the proportionalls are sufficiently given by the <hi>eye</hi> alone without such an <hi>edge.</hi> Now if in these respects the <hi>single projection</hi> with an Index, is better then that of a mooveable and fixed Circle being easily supplyed as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, it is but a poore one, in common sense. <hi>But</hi> if the way with an <hi>Index</hi> on a single <hi>Projection</hi> bee not better then that of a double for the former respects, then it may bee in the third <hi>generall</hi> to wit the <hi>Instrumentall</hi> expedition: in which there needes little declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to prove the double Projection to have a greater expedition then the single projection with an Index, seeing it appeares so obvious, that what can be quicker; then having mooved one <hi>number</hi> to another in proportion assigned, that all other <hi>numbers</hi> are opposite one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the like projection (which a single <hi>Index</hi> doth point out easily to the eye as before.) By the Index in a single projection there is first putting the one foot to one <hi>number,</hi> and extending the other foot to another <hi>number,</hi> then must the <hi>eye</hi> have reference to one of the <hi>feete</hi> that it fall upon his third <hi>number,</hi> and afterward to looke for the second <hi>foote</hi> for the fourth <hi>number,</hi> and so to move it to another number, and still to have a double respect with the eye as before in every new operation: in this regard also I see not why the way of an Index in a single <hi>Projection</hi> is better then that which I have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a double <hi>projection.

To speake ill of a <hi>man</hi> upon know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge shewes want of <hi>Charity;</hi> but to raise a scandall upon a bare supposition, &amp; to act it in <hi>Print,</hi> argueth little <hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> lesse <hi>Christianity:</hi> but enough of this if not too much, I am sure some have casted too much already, perhaps o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hereafter may helpe to bare a <hi>share,</hi> for my owne part I desire no favour but the <hi>truth</hi> and equitie of my <hi>cause,</hi> and the due <hi>waighing</hi> of things with their reall <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. Ʋeritas non quaerit Angulos.</hi> I desire no shifting, or pretences, but if I have done others wrong let me <hi>suffer;</hi> If I have beene <hi>wronged</hi> by others let me have <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>right</hi> done me, thats all I <hi>require.</hi> Who am</p>
