   <head>The Conclusion.</head>
   <p>Now I haue as I hope made relation not of so fewe and smal things but that the countrey of men that are indifferent &amp; wel disposed maie be sufficiently liked: If there were no more knowen then I haue mentioned, which doubtlesse and in great reason is nothing to that which remaineth to bee discouered, neither the soi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, nor commodities. As we haue reason so to gather by the difference we found in our trauails: for although all which I haue before spoken of, haue bin discouered &amp; experimented not far from the sea coast where was our abode &amp; most of our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing: yet somtimes as we made our iourneies farther into the maine and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; we found the soyle to bee fatter; the trees greater and to growe thinner; the grounde more firme and deeper mould; more and larger champions; finer grasse and as good as euer we saw any in England; in some places rockie and farre more high and hillie ground; more plentie of their fruites; more abondance of beastes; the more inhabited with people, and of greater pollicie &amp; larger dominions, with greater townes and houses.</p>
   <p>Why may wee not then looke for in good hope from the inner parts of more and greater plentie, as well of other things, as of those which wee haue alreadie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered? Vnto the Spaniardes happened the like in discouering the maine of the West Indies. The maine also of this countrey of <hi>Virginia,</hi> extending some wayes so many hundreds of leagues, as otherwise then by the relation of the inhabitants wee haue most certaine knowledge of, where yet no Christian Prince hath any posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or dealing, cannot but yeeld many kinds of excellent commodities, which we in our discouerie haue not yet seene.</p>
   <p>What hope there is els to be gathered of the nature of the climate, being answerable to the Iland of <hi>Iapan,</hi> the land of <hi>China, Persia, Jury,</hi> the Ilandes of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> and <hi>Candy,</hi> the South parts of <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and of many other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and famous countreis, because I meane not to be tedious, I leaue to your ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne consideration.</p>
   <p>Whereby also the excellent temperature of the ayre there at all seasons, much warmer then in England, and neuer so violently hot, as sometimes is vnder &amp; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween the Tropikes, or nere them; cannot bee vnknowne vnto you without farther relation.</p>
   <p>For the holsomnesse thereof I neede to say but thus much: that for all the want of prouision, as first of English victuall; excepting for twentie daies, wee liued only by drinking water and by the victuall of the countrey, of which some sorts were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry straunge vnto vs, and might haue bene thought to haue altered our temperatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in such sort as to haue brought vs into some greeuous and dāgerous diseases: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the wāt of English meanes, for the taking of beastes, fishe, and foule, which by the helpe only of the inhabitants and their meanes, coulde not bee so suddenly
<pb n="32" facs="31"/>and easily prouided for vs, nor in so great numbers &amp; quantities, nor of that choise as otherwise might haue bene to our better satisfaction and contentment. Some want also wee had of clothes. Furthermore, in all our trauailes which were most spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and often in the time of winter, our lodging was in the open aire vpon the grounde. And yet I say for all this, there were but foure of our whole company (being one hundred and eight) that died all the yeere and that but at the latter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de thereof and vpon none of the aforesaide causes. For all foure especially three we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re feeble, weake, and sickly persons before euer they came thither, and those that knewe them much marueyled that they liued so long beeing in that case, or had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentured to trauaile.</p>
   <p>Seing therefore the ayre there is so temperate and holsome, the soyle so fertile and yeelding such commodities as I haue before mentioned, the voyage also thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to and fro beeing sufficiently experimented, to bee perfourmed thrise a yeere with ease and at any season thereof: And the dealing of <hi>Sir Water Raleigh</hi> so libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in large giuing and graūting lande there, as is alreadie knowen, with many hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes and furtherances els: (The least that hee hath graunted hath beene fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred acres to a man onely for the aduenture of his person:) I hope there remaine no cause wherby the action should be misliked.</p>
   <p>If that those which shall thiter trauaile to inhabite and plant bee but reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably prouided for the first yere as those are which were transported the last, and beeing there doe vse but that diligence and care as is requisite, and as they may with eese: There is no doubt but for the time following they may haue victuals that is excellent good and plentie enough; some more Englishe sortes of cattaile al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hereafter, as somehaue bene before, and are there yet remaining, may and shall bee God willing thiter transported: So likewise our kinde of fruites, rootes, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arbes may bee there planted and sowed, as some haue bene alreadie, and proue wel: And in short time also they may raise of those sortes of commodities which I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue spoken of as shall both enrich them selues, as also others that shall deale with them.</p>
   <p>And this is all the fruites of our labours, that I haue thought necessary to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise you of at this present: what els concerneth the nature and manners of the inhabitants of <hi>Virginia:</hi> The number with the particularities of the voyages thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made; and of the actions of such that haue bene by <hi>Sir Water Raleigh</hi> there in and there imployed, many worthy to bee remembred; as of the first discouerers of the Countrey: of our generall for the time <hi>Sir Richard Greinuile</hi>; and after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, of our Gouernour there Master <hi>Rafe Lane</hi>; with diuers other directed and imployed vnder theyr gouernement: Of the Captaynes and Masters of the voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges made since for transportation; of the Gouernour and assistants of those alredie transported, as of many persons, accidēts, and thinges els, I haue ready in a discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
<pb n="33" facs="32"/>by it self in maner of a Chronicle according to the course of times, and when time shall bee thought conuenient shall be also published.</p>
   <p>Thus referring my relation to your fauourable constructions, expecting good successe of the action, from him which is to be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the authour and gouernour not only of this but of all things els, I take my leaue of you, this moneth of Februarii, 1588.</p>
