   <head>The first Epistle of the <hi>Translator touching Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> imitation in general, to the <hi>faithful Imitators of our Sauior</hi> Christ in England, S.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HO entereth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is giuen to imitation.</note> a due consideration of mans nature, shal ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie perceaue that most stranglie it is addicted vnto Imitation; and, though in truth, we should liue by lawes not by examples, that examples doe more mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, than doe lawes. Seruants in a familie; soldiers in an armie; subiects in a Common-weale maie confirme what I saie. For seruants wil imitate their maisters; soldiers their capitaines; subiects their gouernors <note n="a" place="margin">Ecclus. 10 verse. 2.</note>, be they good, be they bad, yea get they praise or get they infamie, profit or hurt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie: thinking their liues to be a lawe; and that to be wel done which is done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their example <note n="b" place="margin">Hieron. in Epist. ad Heliodo.</note>.</p>
   <p>1. Wherebie I note, first, that they
<pb facs="3"/>
should haue great regard vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, who are anie waie, either for birth, or for office, or for calling, whether it be spiritual or temporal better than other men. For they cannot sinne without great hurt, and danger to the Common-weale saie I of them, as once spake <hi>Cicero</hi> of iudges <note n="c" place="margin">Cic. act. 2. in Vetrem.</note>. Whence it is, that <hi>mightie men shal mightilie be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Wisd. 6, 6.</note>.</p>
   <p>2 Secondlie, that, seing our nature is such, we are to take special heede whome we folowe, or imitate. For euerie one maie not be folowed; neither shal the vngodlie behauior of others excuse vs before God. For <hi>we must al appeare before the iudgement seate of Christ <note n="e" place="margin">2. Cor. 5, verse. 10. Reu. 22, 12.</note> to receiue according to our owne deeds</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">Ps. 62, 12. Mat. 16, 27. Rom. 2, 6.</note>. The licentious life of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate shal not quite the subiect, if he liue not vnder lawes; nor the wickednes of maisters excuse the seruant, if he be vngratious; nor the il conuersation of the preacher, be a cause to saue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, if he be vngodlie. For <hi>that soule that sinneth,</hi> be he what he be maie, <hi>shal die</hi>
      <note n="g" place="margin">Ezec. 18, verse. 4.</note>.</p>
   <p>The precept therefore which is giuen<note place="margin">Who are to be folowed.</note> to an imitator of Orators, I could wish were folowed of a Christian Imitator. In oratorie imitation two sortes of examples
<pb facs="3"/>
there be: one alwaies, and most necessarie to be folowed <note n="h" place="margin">
         <hi>Sturmius in ca. 1. lib. sui de Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. Orat.</hi> Oratorie I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation. Demost. Cicero. Poēts. Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers. Christian imitation. Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be folowed. Good mē but sometime and in somethings to be folowed, and why; Foure sorts of examples of good men mentioned in the holie Scripture.</note>, the other but sometime and in somethings. The example alwaies necessarilie to be folowed of an Orator is among the Graecians Demosthenes, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero among the Latins: they who are but sometime, and in some things to be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, are Poëts and Historiographers.</p>
   <p>So in Christian imitation two sortes of examples there be: one to be folowed and that both necessarilie, and alwaies, which is our Sauior Christ; the other but sometime and in some things, as are good men and women, whether they be aliue or dead.</p>
   <p>Strange perhaps it maie seeme, that the good but sometime and in some things should be imitated. Yet is it not so strange as true. For euerie example of theirs may not be folowed of vs. For the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing whereof it is to be noted that foure sortes of examples, yea of the elect, and righteous we maie reade of in the holie Scriptures.</p>
   <p>1 The first we maie behold to imitate: as Abrahams faith <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 15, 5. 6. Rom. 4, 9. 10, &amp;c.</note>; Iosephs chastitie <note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 39, 7 8. 9, &amp;c.</note>; Dauids zeale <note n="l" place="margin">Psalme. 119, 14, 20, &amp;c.</note>; Tobias pitifulnes toward the poore <note n="m" place="margin">Tobit. 1, 16. 17. 18. Tob. 2, 2. 3. 4.</note>; and such like wherewith the Bible is most singularlie replenished.
<pb facs="4"/>
These are set before vs, <hi>that we should not be slothful, but folowers of them <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 6, 12</note> which through faith &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience inherite the promises.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>2 Other examples there be which are wicked: as the incredulitie of Moses and Aaron <note n="o" place="margin">Nomb. 20 verse. 12. Nomb. 27, verse. 14. Deut. 32, 51 52.</note>; the adulterie of Dauid <note n="p" place="margin">2. Sam. 11 verse. 2. 3. 4. 5.</note>; Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters denial <note n="q" place="margin">Matt. 26, verse. 69. 70, &amp;c.</note>; the ambition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <note n="r" place="margin">Luke. 22, verse. 24. 25, &amp;c.</note> &amp;c. which are placed before vs, but for diuers ends. First to keepe vs from that vane opinion which in these daies hath mightilie crept into the minds of manie, that the elect and regenerate sinne not. For that ech of these, yea and al these too were elected, I thinke the most fantastical wil not denie, and yet that they sinned in most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ainous manner is apparent.</p>
   <p>Secondlie to make vs the more ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to looke vnto our footing. For, if they so highlie in Gods fauor, &amp; so singularlie adorned with his heauenlie giftes, did fal and defile themselues so filthilie with sin, with what great feare and trembling ought we to make an end of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="s" place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note>, who are nothing comparable in spiritual gifts vnto them; least as God either punished (as he did Moses <note n="t" place="margin">Deut. 34, verse. 1, &amp;c. 4. 5.</note>, Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <note n="u" place="margin">Nomb. 20 verse. 25. 26. Nomb. 33, verse. 38.</note>, and Dauid <note n="x" place="margin">2. Sam. 12 verse. 10. 11. 2. Sam. 16, verse. 22.</note> with temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment) or reproued (as Peter <note n="y" place="margin">Lu. 22, 61.</note>, and the Apostles <note n="z" place="margin">Mar. 10, 42 Luk. 22, 25. 26, &amp;c.</note>) them to their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb facs="4"/>
so he punish vs eternalie to our vtter confusion!</p>
   <p>Thirdlie, though we sinne, that we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go on foreward, and proceede in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, nor despaire of Gods mercie, no more than they did. For <hi>the Lord is rich ouer al <note n="a" place="margin">Ro. 10, 12</note> that cal vpon him, &amp; repent.</hi> Therefore ought no man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire. For <hi>it is a true saieng <note n="b" place="margin">1. Tim. 1, verse. 15.</note> and by al meanes worthie to be receaued, that Christ Iesus came into the world to saue sinners</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">Matth. 9, verse. 13. Mark. 2, 17.</note>, wherebie manie haue attained mercie, <hi>vnto the ensample of them <note n="d" place="margin">1. Tim. 1, verse. 16.</note> which shal in time to come beleeue on him vnto eternal life.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Last of al they are set before vs to this ende, that as God is merciful; so should we be <note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 6, 36.</note>. And as he is readie to receaue such into fauor as repent <note n="f" place="margin">Luke. 15, verse. 20. 21. Ecclus. 2, verse. 18. 19. 20. 21.</note>: so should we be merciful towards al men <note n="g" place="margin">Matt. 18, verse. 21. 22. Matt. 5, 44. Luke. 17, 3. 4.</note>, that in his iudgement, we maie find mercie <note n="h" place="margin">Matt. 5, 7.</note>. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie certaine both Heretikes, as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharans, or Nouatians, who taught that none which sinned after they were rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, could be saued <note n="i" place="margin">Cypr. lib. 4. Epist. 2. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. Euseb. lib. 2. cap. 43.</note>; and Atheists, as Machiauel, &amp; his fauorers, who think that iniuries receaued should neuer be forgiuen <note n="k" place="margin">Theorem. 6. lib. 3. Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. cōtra Machiauel. page. 314. 315. 316, &amp;c.</note>, are confuted.</p>
   <p>3 Other things were wel done by good men in times passed, which in these daies
<pb facs="5"/>
cannot be folowed of vs without offence to God. As they circumcised their male children the eight daie <note n="l" place="margin">Leu. 12, 2, 3.</note>, which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for vs to do <note n="m" place="margin">Actes. 15, verse. 1. 5, &amp;c. Gal. 5, 1.</note>; they offered sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, and manie sacrifices, I meane blodie sacrifices, vnto the Lord <note n="n" place="margin">Leuit. 17, verse. 3. 4, &amp;c. Leui. 22, 17. 18. 19, &amp;c.</note>, we maie not so do <note n="o" place="margin">Coloss. 2, verse. 20. Hebr. 9, 1. Heb. 10, 1. 2, &amp;c.</note>; one brother in those daies mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the wife of another <note n="p" place="margin">Deut. 25, verse. 5. 6, &amp;c. Ruth. 4, 3. Mat. 22, 24. 25, &amp;c. Mar. 12, 19. 20, &amp;c.</note>, so to marrie now were incest.</p>
   <p>4 Finalie some deedes we maie read of which were singular, such as neither we may, nor others in those days might folow without the special and extraordinarie motion of the holie Spirit. As was Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams readines to kil his owne and onelie sonne Isaac <note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 22, 1 2. 3, &amp;c.</note>; as likewise was the spoile which the Iewes made of the Aegyptians by deteining their iewels of siluer, and iewels of golde <note n="r" place="margin">Exod. 12, verse. 35. 36.</note>. The doing whereof was commendable in them, because they were commanded <note n="s" place="margin">Gen. 22, 1. Exod. 11, 1. 2.</note>; but most damnable should be in others, for that there be commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the contrarie <note n="t" place="margin">Deu. 5, 17. Exod. 20, 13. Matth. 5, 21. Deut. 5, 19. Exod. 20, 15. Rom. 13, 9.</note>, but none to do so.</p>
   <p>Wherebie it is apparent that good men are not in al things to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But as S. Paule would be so folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as he folowed Christ <note n="u" place="margin">1. Cor. 11, 1.</note>: so should they be.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>Therefore our Sauior is the example<note place="margin">Christ alwais necessarilie to be folowed, &amp; why;</note> of vs to be folowed, and that alwaies, and necessarilie: alwaies, for that he was most perfectlie good <note n="x" place="margin">Esai. 53, 9 Iohn. 8, 46. 1. Pet. 2, 22. 1. Iohn. 3, 5.</note>; and necessarilie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause both himselfe <note n="y" place="margin">Matt. 11, verse. 29. Ioh. 13, 15. 34. Ioh. 15, 12.</note>, and his Apostles <note n="z" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. verse. 1. Ephes. 5, 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. Philip. 2, 5. 1. Pet. 2, 21.</note>, haue commanded vs to do so.</p>
   <p>But here mistake me not, I beseech you. For albeit I saie our Sauior Christ is alwaies; yet do I not saie in al things: and though necessarilie to be folowed; yet not as he was God. For he fasted fourtie daies and fourtie nights <note n="a" place="margin">Matt. 4, 2.</note>; he rebuked the waues of the sea, and the windes, and they cessed raging <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 8, 24 25. Mark. 4, 39.</note>; he walked on the sea as on drie land <note n="c" place="margin">Matt. 14, verse. 25.</note>; with seuen loaues and two litle fishes he fed foure thousand men <note n="d" place="margin">Mar. 8, 9.</note> besides women and children <note n="e" place="margin">Matt. 15, verse. 34. 38.</note> at one time; at another with fiue loaues and two fishes, he fed about fiue thousand men <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 6, 10.</note>, beside women and children <note n="g" place="margin">Matt. 14, verse. 19. 21.</note>; he restored sight to the blind <note n="h" place="margin">Matth. 9, 27. 28. 29, &amp;c.</note>; health to the sicke <note n="i" place="margin">Marke. 5, 25. 26, &amp;c. Matth. 4, 23. 24. Matth. 9, 35.</note>; to the dead life <note n="k" place="margin">Iohn. 11, 43. 44. Marke. 5, 35. 41. 42.</note>; and manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miracles by the almightie power of his Godhead he wrought, which are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable (as I maie saie) of mortal man. In somuch that they offend greatlie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do it of superstition, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists; or of meere zeale, as did the God of
<pb facs="6"/>
Norweigh <note n="l" place="margin">One so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for his fasting 40. daies, which he did more than once: of whom John Wie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus in a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of his De Jeiunijs Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitijs, pag. 125.</note>, who dare enterprise to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate our Sauior in anie thing which he did miraculouslie as a God. My reason is, because there is neither commandement that we should, nor example of anie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or Apostle in holie Scripture that would, or durst so do. <hi>For we are not commanded to make a new world, to create things visible or inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; no nor in the world to do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and to raise the dead,</hi> said Augustine <note n="m" place="margin">August. de verbis Domini. Wherein Christ is to be imitated.</note>, and so do I.</p>
   <p>Our Sauior Christ therefore in those things which he did as a God must reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouslie be worshipped; and folowed ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louslie in what he did as a man. He that loueth and hateth what Christ as a God, doth loue and detest, imitates Christ as much as man maie imitate God <note n="n" place="margin">Theodor. lib. de Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua virtute.</note>▪ he that doth that which Christ did as a man, doth folowe Christ as a Christian should.</p>
   <p>What that is, this booke at large most notablie, and Bernard in few wordes doth showe, namelie <note n="o" place="margin">Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus li. Sent.</note>, <hi>to abhor the vanitie of the world, and that cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouslie; For Iesus, because he would not be elected a King, fled fro the multitude: to repent, and that hartelie; For Iesus was killed as a Lambe: to haue true charitie; For Iesus praid for his enimies.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>1 And herevnto we are moued, as by<note place="margin">Reasons why wee should i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate, or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior Christ.</note> the commandements both of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and of his Apostles Paule and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of which afore: 2 so partlie because we are called Christians; but <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans haue their name of Christ, therfore is it meete that as they be coheires of his name, so they shold be folowers of his holines,</hi> so Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard <note n="p" place="margin">Bern. lib.

If thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest to be called a Christian, shew the fruites of Christianitie, and then wel maist thou take the name of a Christian vnto thee,</hi> saide the same Augustine <note n="s" place="margin">In the foresaide place.</note>. 3 Partlie for that he is our God. Therefore is it our partes to imitate him, whome we worship and serue. 4 Partlie, because we are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture giuen to imitation. Wisedome would therefore we should imitate the best. 5 And partlie because we are English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who of al other people are most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
<pb facs="7"/>
and infamous too for imitation. A shame were it therefore for vs to imitate so painefulie as manie do in eloquence Cicero; in philosophie Aristotle; in lawe Iustinian; in Physick Galen for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wisedome; yea to imitate, as most do, the French in vanitie, the Dutch in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
