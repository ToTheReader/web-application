   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE OLIVER Lord S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Baron of Bletso, his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties <hi>Lieutenant of the County of Huntington</hi> the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, and heereafter the Crowne of glory.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>BRAHAM the Prophet &amp; roote of true nobility (Right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) hasted to performe dueties of loue euen to strangers, and noble <hi>Nehemias</hi> stayed not vntill his poore brethren spake to him, but with <hi>Moses</hi> had his affections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest Gods afflicted ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, though they themselues abounded in earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Wherefore I make no doubt of your Honours fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable acceptance of these my small endeuours; not for my labours being of no worth, neither my person also of no respect, but of your honours godly disposition, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the better to see how it standeth with the people of God elsewhere. The present is small, and also plaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing serued in so homelily in an earthen dishe. With which presumption of mine, I trust your honour will beare, I being neither Prophet, nor a Prophets sonne; but a heardman, and gatherer of wild figges, and lighting yet (in my liuing abroad) on this small bunch of Rhenish grapes, which (though it be not that goodly one, brought out of that land, manifestly notifying the fruitfulnesse
<pb facs="3"/>thereof; to wit, the renowned Prince <hi>Frederike</hi> his Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme, vsed in all the Churches &amp; schooles of his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and also all the Netherlands reformed Churches) yet is it of the same grouth, and both watered and warmed ripe by the Spirit and Son of God from heauen, as well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth herein by their cōstancy to the truth of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested to them out of his holy word, by their meeknesse towards their brethren who yet are too vnnatural to them, and also by their vigilancie to preuent the subtle strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of the arch-enemy of Iesus Christ, intended against them, and the rest of the Churches of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if your honour be pleased to suffer it, onely to bee set at the lower end of your table, though vnder the couert of some of your goodlier seruices, I make no doubt but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wil thereby be encouraged the rather to tast thereof, and so find it as wholesome for their soules, as they haue done in Germany. (I assuring my selfe that no sound body can take any hurt thereby.) Which I only ayming at, and praying for; desire the Lord of light, to encrease your daies in honour, to the further comfort of his Maiesties subiects in this part of the land, and after you to make your sonnes like vnto the sonne of <hi>Barzillai</hi> to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; to follow your steps, as wel in inward as outward graces, to the glory of God, and further comfort of his seruants.</p>
