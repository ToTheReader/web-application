   <head>A PREFACE
TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thought it conuenient (good
Reader,</hi> who soeuer thou art, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
shalt read these my poore labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res)
to admonish thée (least hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> mightest take my woords
otherwise than I meant them)
of this one thing: That wheras in the processe
of this my booke, I haue intreated of certen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercyses,
vsually practised amongest vs, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Playes and Enterludes, of dauncing, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and such other like: I would not haue
thée so, to take mée, as though my speaches ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
to the ouerthrowe and vtter disliking of all
kynd of exercyses in generall: that is nothing
my simple meaning. But the particulare Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which are crept into euery one of these seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
exercyses, is the onely thing, which I think
worthie of reprehension.</p>
   <p>For, otherwise (all Abuses cut away) who séeth
not, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> some kind of playes, tragedies and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luds
in their own nature, are not onely of great
anciētie, but also very honest and very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
<pb facs="6"/>
exercyses, being vsed and practised in most
Christian common weales, as which containe
matter (such they may be) both of doctrine, eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
good example and wholsome instruction?
And may be vsed in tyme and place conuenient,
as conducible to example of life and reformation
of maners. For such is our grosse &amp; dull nature,
that what thing we sée opposite before our eyes,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o pearce further, and printe déeper in our harts
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nd minds, than that thing, which is hard onely
with the eares, as <hi>Horace,</hi> the hethen <hi>Poët</hi> can
witnesse. <hi>Segnius irritant animum, dimissa per
aures, quàm quae sunt hominum occulis obiecta.</hi>
So, that when honest &amp; chast playes, tragedies,
&amp; enterluds, are vsed to these ends, for the Godly
recreatiō of the mind, for the good example of life,
for the auoyding of that, which is euill, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that which is good, thā are they very tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
exercyses. But being vsed (as now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
they be) to the prophanation of the Lord
his sabaoth, to the alluring and inuegling of the
People from the blessed word of God preached,
to Theaters and vnclean assemblies, to ydlenes,
vnthriftynes, whordome, wantōnes, drunkēnes,
and what not? and which is more, when they
are vsed to this end, to maintaine a great sort of
ydle Persons, doing nothing, but playing and
loytring, hauing their lyuings of the sweat of
other Mens browes, much like vnto dronets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> swéet honie of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> poore labouring bees,
<pb facs="7"/>
than are they exercyses (at no hand) sufferable.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> But being vsed to the ends that I haue said,
they are not to be disliked of any sober, and wise
Christian.</p>
   <p>And as concerning dauncing, I wold not haue
thée (good <hi>Reader</hi>) to think that I condemne the
exercyse it self altogether, for I know the wisest
Sages and the Godlyest Fathers and Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
that euer liued, haue now and than vsed the
same, as <hi>Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and many others: but
my woords doo touch &amp; cōcerne the Abuses there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
onely. As being vsed vppon the Sabaoth
day, from morning vntill night, in publique as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
and frequencies of People, Men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
together, with pyping, fluting, dromming,
and such like inticements to wantonnesse &amp; sin,
together with their leapinges, skippings, &amp; other
vnchast gestures, not a few. Being vsed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abused in this sort, I vtterly discommend it.</p>
   <p>But vppon the otherside, being vsed in a mans
priuat-chamber, or howse for his Godly solace,
and recreation in the feare of GOD, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
abroade with respect had to the time, place
and persons, it is in no respect to be disalowed.</p>
   <p>And wheras I speake of gaming, my meaning
is not, that it is an exercise altogether vnlawful.
For, I know that one Christian may play with
another, at any kind of Godly, honest, ciuile ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
or exercise, for the mutuall recreation one of
the other, so that they be not inflamed with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueitousnes,
<pb facs="7"/>
or desire of vnlawfull gaine: for the
cōmaundemēt saith, thou shalt not couet: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if any be voide of these affections, playing ra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
for his Godly recreation, than for desire of
filthie lucre, he may vse the same in the feare of
God: yet so as the vse therof be not a let, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
vnto him, to any other Godly exploit.</p>
   <p>But, if a man make (as it weare) an occupation
of it, spending both his tyme and goods therein,
frequenting, gaming howses, bowling allyes,
and such other places, for gréedinesse of lucre, to
him it is an exercise altogether discommendable
and vnlawfull. Wherfore, as these be exercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
lawfull, to them that know how to vse them
in the feare of GOD, so are they practises at no
hand sufferable to them that abuse thē, as I haue
shewed. But take away the abuses, the thinges
in themselues are not euill, being vsed as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Godlynes, not made as spurres vnto
vice. There is nothing so good, but it may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused,
yet because of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> abuses, I am not so strict,
that I wold haue the things, themselues remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
no more than I wold meat and drinke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
is abused, vtterly to be taken away.</p>
   <p>And wheras also I haue spoken of the excesse
in Apparell, and of the Abuse of the same, as wel
in men, as in women generally, I wold not be
so vnderstood, as though my speaches extēded, to
any, either noble, honorable, or worshipful: for, I
am so farre from once thinking that any kind of
<pb facs="8"/>
sumptuous, or gorgeous attire is not to be worn
of any of them, as I suppose them rather Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in them, than otherwise.</p>
   <p>And that they both may, and for some respects,
ought to were such attire (their birthes callings,
functions and estats requiring the same) for cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in this my Booke laid downe, as maye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
and for the distinction of them from the
inferiour sorte, it is prouable both by the Woord
of GOD, Ancient Writers, and common
practise of all ages, People and Nations, from
the beginning of the World, to this day.</p>
   <p>And therfore, when I speake generally of the
excesse of Apparell, my meaning is of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
sorte onely, who for the most parte do farre
surpasse, either noble, honorable, or worshipfull,
ruffling in Silks, Ueluets, Satens, Damasks,
Taffeties, Gold, Siluer, and what not? with
their swoords, daggers, and rapiers guilte, and
reguilte, burnished, and costly ingrauen, with all
things els, that any noble, honorable, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull
Man doth, or may weare, so as the one
cannot easily be discerned from the other.</p>
   <p>These be the Abuses, that I speake of, these
be the euills, that I lament, and these be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that my words doo concerne, as the tenure
of my Booke consideratly wayed, to any indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<hi>READER</hi> doth purport.</p>
   <p>This much I thought good (Gentle <hi>Reader</hi>)
to informe thee of, for thy better instruction, as
<pb facs="8"/>
well in these few points, as in all other the like,
whersoeuer they shall chaunce to occurre in my
Booke. Beseaching thée, to construe al things
to the best, to beare with the rudenes therof, and
to giue the same thy good-woord, and
gentle acceptaunce. And
thus in the LORD,
I bid thée, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>

      <signed>Thyne to vse in the Lord,
