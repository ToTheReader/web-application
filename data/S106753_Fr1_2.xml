   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE MY SINGV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAR GOOD LORD, THE LORD CHARLES HOVVARD, Erle of Notingham, Baron of Effingham, Knight of the noble Order of the Garter, Lord high Admirall of England, Ireland, and Wales, &amp;c. one of her Maiesties most honourable priuie Counsell.</head>
   <p>RIght Honourable and my very good Lord, after I had long since published in Print many Nauigations and Discoueries of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in diuers languages, as well here at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as in the citie of Paris, during my fiue yeeres abode in France, with the woorthie Knight Sir <hi>Edward Stafford</hi> your brother in lawe, her Maiesties most prudent and carefull Ambassador ligier with the French King: and had waded on still farther and farther in the sweet studie of the historie of Cosmographie, I began at length to conceiue, that with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent obseruation, some thing might be gathered which might commend our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their high courage and singular actiuitie in the Search and Discouerie of the most vnknowen quarters of the world. Howbeit, seeing no man to step forth to vndertake the recording of so many memorable actions, but euery man to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his priuate affaires: the ardent loue of my countrey deuoured all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and as it were with a sharpe goad prouoked me and thrust me forward into this most troublesome and painfull action. And after great charges and infinite cares, after many watchings, toiles, and trauels, and wearying out of my weake body; at length I haue collected three seuerall Volumes of the English Nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Traffiques, and Discoueries, to strange, remote, and farre distant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys. Which worke of mine I haue not included within the compasse of things onely done in these latter dayes, as though litle or nothing woorthie of memorie had bene performed in former ages; but mounting aloft by the space of many hundred yeeres, haue brought to light many very rare and worthy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, which long haue lien miserably scattered in mustie corners, &amp; retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly hidden in mistie darkenesse, and were very like for the greatest part to haue bene buried in perpetuall obliuion. The first Volume of this worke I haue thus for the present brought to light, reseruing the other two vntill the next Spring, when by Gods grace they shall come to the Presse. In the meane season bethinking my selfe of some munificent and bountifull Patrone, I called to mind your honorable Lordship, who both in regard of my particular obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and also in respect of the subiect and matter, might iustly chalenge the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage thereof. For first I remembred how much I was bound, and how deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indebted for my yongest brother <hi>Edmund Hackluyt,</hi> to whom for the space of foure whole yeeres your Lordship committed the gouernment and instruction of that honorable yong noble man, your sonne &amp; heire apparant, the lord <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
<pb facs="3"/>
Howard,</hi> of whose high spirit and wonderful towardlinesse full many a time hath he boasted vnto me. Secondly, the bounden duetie which I owe to your most deare sister the lady <hi>Sheffield,</hi> my singular good lady &amp; honorable mistresse, admonished me to be mindfull of the renoumed familie of the <hi>Howards.</hi> Thirdly, when I found in the first Patent graunted by Queene <hi>Marie</hi> to the Moscouie companie, that my lord your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ather being then lord high Admirall of England, was one of the first fauourers and furtherers, with his purse and countenance, of the strange and wonderfull Discouerie of Russia, the chiefe contents of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Volume, then I remēbred the sage saying of sweet <hi>Isocrates, That sonnes ought not onely to be inheriters of their fathers substance, but also of their commendable vertues and honours.</hi> But what speake I of your ancestors honors (which to say the trueth, are very great, and such as our Chronicles haue notably blazoned) when as your owne Heroicall actions from time to time haue shewed themselues so admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as no antiquitie hath affoorded greater, and the future times will not in haste (I thinke) performe the like. To come to some particulars, when the Emperors sister, the spouse of Spaine, with a Fleete of an 130. sailes, stoutly and proudly passed the narow Seas, your Lordship accompanied with ten ships onely of her Maiesties Nauie Roiall, enuironed their Fleet in most strange and warrelike sort, enforced them to stoope gallant, and to vaile their bonets for the Queene of England, and made them perfectly to vnderstand that olde speach of the prince of Poets;
<q>
         <l>Non illi imperium pelagi saeuúm{que} tridentem,</l>
         <l>sed tibi sorte datum.</l>
      </q>
Yet after they had acknowledged their dutie, your lordship on her Maiesties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe conducted her safely through our English chanell, and performed all good offices of honor and humanitie to that forren Princesse. At that time all England beholding your most honorable cariage of your selfe in that so weightie seruice, began to cast an extraordinarie eie vpon your lordship, and deeply to conceiue that singular hope which since by your most worthie &amp; wonderfull seruice, your L hath more then fully sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>fied. I meane (among others) that glorious, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and thrise-happy victory atchieued against that huge and haultie <hi>Spanish Armada</hi> (which is notably described in the ende of this volume) wherein being chiefe and sole Commander vnder her sacred and roiall Maiestie, your noble go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and worthy behauior, your high wisedom, discretion and happinesse, accompanied with the heauenly blessing of the Almightie, are shewed most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to haue bene such, as all posteritie and succeeding ages shall neuer cease to sing and resound your infinite prayse and eternall commendations. As for the late renoumed expedition and honorable voyage vnto <hi>Cadiz,</hi> the vanquishing of part of the king of Spaines <hi>Armada,</hi> the destruction of the rich West <hi>Indian</hi> Fleete, the chasing of so many braue and gallant Gallies, the miraculous win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, sacking, and burning of that almost impregnable citie of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> the surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the towne of <hi>Faraon</hi> vpon the coast of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and other rare appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances of that enterprise, because they be hereafter so iudicially set downe, by a very graue and learned Gentleman, which was an eye witnesse in all that action, I referre your good L. to his faithfull report, wherein I trust (as much as in him lay) he hath wittingly depriued no man of his right. Vpon these and other the like considerations, I thought it fit and very conuenient to commend with all humilitie and reuerence this first part of our English Voiages &amp; Discoueries vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Honors fauourable censure and patronage.</p>
   <p>And here by the way most humbly crauing pardon, and alwayes submitting my poore opinion to your Lordships most deep and percing insight, especially
<pb facs="3"/>
in this matter, as being the father and principall fauourer of the English Nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I trust it shall not be impertinent in passing by, to point at the meanes of breeding vp of skilfull Sea-men and Mariners in this Realme. Sithence your Lordship is not ignorant, that ships are to litle purpose without skilfull Sea-men; and since Sea-men are not bred vp to perfection of skill in much lesse time (as it is said) then in the time of two prentiships; and since no kinde of men of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in the common wealth passe their yeres in so great and continuall hazard of life; and since of so many, so few grow to gray heires: how needfull it is, that by way of Lectures and such like instructions, these ought to haue a better educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then hitherto they haue had; all wise men may easily iudge. When I call to minde, how many noble ships haue bene lost, how many worthy persons haue bene drenched in the sea, and how greatly this Realme hath bene impouerished by losse of great Ordinance and other rich commodities through the ignorance of our Sea-men, I haue greatly wished there were a Lecture of Nauigation read in this Citie, for the banishing of our former grosse ignorance in Marine causes, and for the increase and generall multiplying of the sea-knowledge in this age, wherein God hath raised so generall a desire in the youth of this Realme to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all parts of the face of the earth, to this Realme in former ages not knowen. And, that it may appeare that this is no vaine fancie nor deuise of mine, it may please your Lordship to vnderstand, that the late Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the rawnesse of his Sea-men, and the manifolde shipwracks which they susteyned in passing and repassing betweene <hi>Spaine</hi> and the West <hi>Indies,</hi> with an high reach and great foresight, established not onely a Pilote Maior, for the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of such as sought to take charge of ships in that voyage, but also foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a notable Lecture of the Art of Nauigation, which is read to this day in the Contractation house at <hi>Siuil.</hi> The readers of which Lecture haue not only care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taught and instructed the <hi>Spanish</hi> Mariners by word of mouth, but also haue published sundry exact and worthy treatises concerning Marine causes, for the direction and incouragement of posteritie. The learned works of three of which readers, namely of <hi>Alonso de Chauez,</hi> of <hi>Hieronymo de Chauez,</hi> and of <hi>Roderigo Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morano</hi> came long ago very happily to my hands, together with the straight and seuere examining of all such Masters as desire to take charge for the West <hi>Indies.</hi> Which when I first read and duely considered, it seemed to mee so excellent and so exact a course, as I greatly wished, that I might be so happy as to see the like order established here with vs. This matter, as it seemeth, tooke no light impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the royall brest of that most renowmed and victorious prince King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight of famous memory; who for the increase of knowledge in his Sea-men, with princely liberalitie erected three seuerall Guilds or brotherhoods, the one at <hi>Deptford</hi> here vpon the <hi>Thames,</hi> the other at <hi>Kingston</hi> vpon <hi>Hull,</hi> and the third at <hi>Newcastle</hi> vpon <hi>Tine:</hi> which last was established in the 28. yeere of his reigne. The chiefe motiues which induced his princely wisedome hereunto, him selfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth in maner following. <hi>Vt magistri, marinarij, gubernatores, &amp; alij officiarij nauium, iuuentutem suam in exercitatione gubernationis nauium transigentes, muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lati, aut aliquo alio casu in paupertatem collapsi, aliquod rele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>amen ad eorum sustentatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem habeant, quo non solùm illi reficiantur, verùmetiam alij iuuenes moueantur &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigentur ad candem artem exercendam, ratione cuius, doctiores &amp; aptiores fiant naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus &amp; alijs vasis nostris &amp; aliorum quorumcúnque in Mare gubernandis &amp; manutenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, tam pacis, quàm belli tempore, cum opus postulet, &amp;c.</hi> To descend a litle lower, king <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt that prince of peerelesse hope, with the aduise of his sage and prudent Counsaile, before he entred into the Northeasterne discouery, aduanced the worthy and excellent <hi>Sebastian Cabota</hi> to be grand Pilot of <hi>England,</hi> allowing
<pb facs="4"/>
him a most bountifull pension of 166.li.vj.s.viij.d. by the yeere during his life, as appeareth in his Letters Patents which are to be seene in the third part of my worke. And if God had granted him longer life, I doubt not but as he delt most royally in establishing that office of Pilote Maior (which not long after to the great hinderance of this Common wealth was miserably turned to other priuate vses) so his princely Maiestie would haue shewed himselfe no nigard in erecting, in imitation of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the like profitable Lecture of the Art of Nauigation. And surely when I considered of late the memorable bountie of sir <hi>Thomas Gresham,</hi> who being but a Merchant hath founded so many chargeable Lectures, and some of them also which are Mathematicall, tending to the aduancement of Marine causes; I nothing doubted of your Lordships forwardnes in settling and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of this Lecture; but rather when your Lordship shall see the noble and rare effects thereof, you will be heartily sory that all this while it hath not bene erected. As therefore our skill in Nauigation hath hitherto bene very much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and increased vnder the Admiraltie of your Lordship; so if this one thing be added thereunto, together with seuere and straight discipline, I doubt not but with Gods good blessing it will shortly grow to the hiest pitch and top of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: which whensoeuer it shall come to passe, I assure my selfe it will turne to the infinite wealth and honour of our Countrey, to the prosperous and speedy discouery of many rich lands and territories of heathens and gentiles as yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen, to the honest employment of many thousands of our idle people, to the great comfort and reioycing of our friends, to the terror, daunting and confusion of our foes. To ende this matter, let mee now I beseech you speake vnto your Lordship, as in times past the elder <hi>Scipio</hi> spake to <hi>Cornelius Scipio Africanus: Quò sis, Africane, alacrior ad tutandam Rempublicam, sic habeto: Omnibus, qui patriam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruauerint, adiuuerint, auxerint, certum esse in coelo, ac definitum locum, vbi beati aeuo sempiterno fruantur.</hi> It remaineth therefore, that as your Lordship from time to time vnder her most gracious and excellent Maiestie, haue shewed your selfe a valiant protectour, a carefull conseruer, and an happy enlarger of the honour and reputation of your Countrey; so at length you may enioy those celestial bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, which are prepared to such as tread your steps, and seeke to aspire to such diuine and heroical vertues. And euen here I surcease, wishing all temporal and spirituall blessings of the life present and that which is to come to be powred out in most ample measure, not onely vpon your honourable Lordship, the noble and vertuous Lady your bedfellow, and those two rare iewels, your generous off-springs, but also vpon all the rest wheresoeuer of that your noble and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med family.</p>
