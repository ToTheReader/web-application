   <p>This shamful sutteltie and too foule and brode deceipt vvas neuer so notoriously vsed as in the late persecutions and practises of protestants, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>England</hi> against the CATHOLIKES: in vvhich, such as are not skilful in the old histories of the <hi>Church,</hi> may as in a glasse behold at once al the miseries that she hath suffered in this kinde of calumniation by the <hi>Arians,</hi> the <hi>Gothes,</hi> the <hi>Vandals,</hi> the <hi>Lumbards,</hi> the <hi>Donatistes, Eutichians, Mahometists, Hussists, Hugonots,</hi> and by what other sort in times past or present so euer.

      </gap> not many yeres sithence they arrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned to the great shame and confusion, the most Reuerend father and Confessor,<note place="margin">The arrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnement of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makan.

   <p>
      <note place="margin">The meanīg of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in this treatise.</note>My meaning is specially by Gods helpe to set furth in English &amp; lay befor the eyes of al thos of our realme that were not present at the deathes or arraignement of the late famous men and Martyrs, <hi>M. Campion</hi> and his happie fellovves: and in latine and other langages to the vvhole Christian world for a spectacle of heretical crueltie and Macheuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian practises, hovv by coulor of contriued treason
<pb facs="4"/> and conspiracie (the cause in dede-being religion) the ennemies of the Christian faith haue shed their innocent blood to the infinite shame of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion befor men, and no lesse peril of destruction of our vvhole common wealthe, by Gods iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: who euer reuengeth such publike iniquitie by inducing some great and common calamitie:<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> from which CHRIST of his mercie, saue our countrie, for their sake (which are innumerable) that haue not consented to this iniquitie, hovv soeuer it seeme othervvise to proceed frō publike authoritie.</p>
   <p>But to the matter: after that it vvas agreed vpon by such as God hath geuen povver ouer vs, that the holy <hi>Confessors</hi> whom they had in their hands should be made away, because diuers of thē were farre better lerned then any of their sect could withstand: and al so zelous, as none could sturre them from their faith and fellovvship of the CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOLIKE AND ROMAIN CHVRCH, thinking it not good to kil them for their religiō, they sought out vvith al arte and diligence hovv to find or faine handsomely any matter that cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorably might be dravven to treason, or any capital crime, in the old sense of our lavves.</p>
   <p>The causes why they would not put them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for their faith and conscience to death (Notvvithstanding they had not long before made diuers lavves forcible inough for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,<note place="margin">The causes vvhy they rather exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted them for pretēded treason, thē true religiō.</note> whereby sundrie principles and exercises of CHRISTIAN FAITH were made HIGH TREASON, a lamentable case, that our countrey is fallen to) were these, partely common to al old heretikes, partely peculier to our countrey and present state.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="j."/> First, the cases of religion are diuers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as euery mans conscience is informed where other crimes of what sort so euer are agreed vpon
<pb facs="5"/> of al hands to be punishable. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="ij."/> Secondly, religion to wordly men specially to many <hi>Athiests</hi> novv a daies whom men cal, honestly <hi>politikes:</hi> seemeth not material any farther then as it pertaineth to the preseruation or destruction of the ciuil state. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="iij."/> Thirdly, for that it is impossible or exceding hard to persvvad men of any wit or capacitie that, to professe that religion should be an offence wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie death, which al our ovvne auncesters and al nations round about vs so many hundereth yeres together vvere christened in and haue liued, died, and been saued in, and is defended at this day as cleerely as the sunne against the protestants, both in our realme and al the Christian world beside. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="iiij."/> Fourthly, for that they can not put vs to death by any coulor of equitie as for our religion, hauing no lavv nor determination of councel, schole or parlement, that hath made it heresie, and to cal it treason, though them selues haue made it so, is to much mockery. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="v."/> Fifthly, for that our heretikes hold for their ovvne special saftie, that none should be executed for their conscience, &amp; that they would be counted both at home and abrode in such cases meeke and clement, and not blouddy as they say the Papists were towardes them, when the staffe was in their handes.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="vj."/> Sixtely, for that the executing of them for the CATHOLIKE RELIGION, whereof daily more and more are zelous fauorers in England: might bread great daungers and discontentement to the euident peril of the whole state, which they haue brought into such straite tearmes by this nevv religion, that it can not be vpholden but by much iniustice. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="vij."/> Seuenthly, the pretence of other crimes specially of the inuasion of the realme,<note place="margin">Seeking the destruction of both sorts they would put at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest thē selues.</note> bringeth the zelous Catholikes and namely Gods Priests into great hatered not onely amongest the protestants, but among others wel affected in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb facs="5"/> though not so strong to stand to the losse of their life and goods: whereby they subtily seeke to make a diuision betvvene the tvvo sorts of weaker and stronger Catholikes, for the easier ouerthrovv of them both, in deede hating and fering no lesse the closse dissembler, then open professor.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="viij."/> Lastely, they thought good rather to charge them vvith treason then religion, thereby to haue better coulor to afflict and spoile more deeply al such of the Nobilitie or worship, as they found or fained or hereafter shal forge to haue harbored and relieued them, or conuersed with them. And then to terrifie al Priests as they thought aftervvard for entering into the realme, &amp; the subiects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for receiuing them or sending their sonnes to be brought vp in the societie or seminarie.</p>
   <p>Vpon these and such like wordly considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they did not onely pretend to endite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and execute them for contriued treason against the Q. ovvne rial person and realme: spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying for the better couloring of the collusion, daies, places, persons and maner of executing their intents: but therevvith denounced and protested publikely, both in open court and printed procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and bookes, that they ment nothing in al this bloddy pursute for any matter of religion or conscience.</p>
   <p>But God that streight discouered this cruel stratageme,<note place="margin">The perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors put to double shame.</note> and easely ouer-reacheth the wisedom of the wise, speadely hath met with their humane counsails and put the persecutors, to double confusion in the sight of the whole world. once for making them avvay in deede for religion, for which they vvere neither arraigned nor condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: &amp; secondly, for killing them for that offence which at the racke, barre, and their death, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincibly shevved them selues in the sight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb facs="6"/> as wel of Protestants as Catholikes, to be as innocent as any Sainct or Angel in heauen. Vvherevpon though some fevve hote <hi>Puritans,</hi> were wel contended to see them by what meanes so euer out of their way: yet the more prudent of euery sort marueled much at that vnvvonted impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique proceding,<note place="margin">Error in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.</note> being very sorovvful to see thereby her M honorable iustice, and her most graue counsellers actions, so notoriously and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorably subiected to reprofe, as in no case in mans memorie, or in the records of antiquitie, hath been lightely marked the like. Vvhereof I could report the very words and communication of certaine principal persons of seruice the day of arraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and actors in that bloddy tragedy, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after their departure thence one to an other of the matter and of the shame of that daies worke.</p>
   <p>But I may not name them, lest they should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre daunger thereby: though if any of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries stand with me against the truth thereof, I wil not sticke, though to their some litle rebuke, to vtter to Gods honor and these his blessed Sainctes, who for the double confusion their persecutors haue receiued,<note place="margin">By their practise the Saints of God, haue receiued double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</note> are doubly glorified, first with the crowne of Martyrdom for cōfession of their faith, which was the true cause of their death: and also with the noble renome and revvarde of such, as be innocēt of the fault: whereof they were executed, which was the case of Abel, and others murdered through enuie or malice of man, specially as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both was by false accusation, that he had spoken wordes against God and the king.</p>
   <p>Vvhich kinde of iniquitie vsed against inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent men, maketh their deaths also pretious in our Lords sight. And men also of what religion or conscience so euer, when they see any man (hovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he othervvise deserueth) to be guiltles of
<pb facs="6"/> the crime for which he dieth, they pitie the case naturally, and condemne in their harts and detest, that iniurious course of proceding in place where iustice and iudgement should raigne.</p>
   <p>Vvhich also hath dravven many (thankes be to God) to consider better of the true cause of their punishement, which was the CATHOLIKE RELIGION, and of the protestants actions and conscienceles faith,<note place="margin">Protestants conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celes.</note> that can not be vpholden but by such sinful pollicie and patchery. Trevvly for vs that through CHRISTS grace be Catholike, if they had not vsed this matter in such an odde sort, to bring not onely these men of God,<note place="margin">They them selues haue ministred the cause of al these vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Gods Saints.</note> but the vvhole Catholike flocke of Christs afflicted CHVRCH in our countrey, into the sclaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous suspitiō &amp; obloquie of crimes neuer thought of: but onely executed their nevv lavves against them, and made them avvay for religion without more a doe, we should neuer haue complained of any farther iniquitie or violence done against vs, but haue compted it as an act proceding of their erronious conscience and vnskilful zele in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the professors of truth, for false teachers. But novv vpon this double witting and wilful iniquitie, if we should hold our peace, heauen &amp; earth would condemne vs, and we should be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the vengeance that the cry of this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and sacred bloud calleth for at Gods hand against their persecutors.</p>
   <p>Alas we that knevv them to the very bottome of their harts,<note place="margin">The testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>holikes with whom they liued.</note> with whom they conuersed so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and confidently, in vvhose hovvses they were harbored so often, what they daily talked in al familiaritie and secrecie, heard our confessions, deliuered vs the holy Sacraments, preached to vs so commonly, and yet neuer heard word nor half vvord of these supposed intentions against her M. and the state: though their false accusers say it was
<pb facs="7"/> their proper commission to deale vvith vs for to admit inuasion of strangers, and to with dravv our selues from our soueraines obedience: vve therfor for their cleering and our ovvne in that case, and al the Catholikes in the realme, cal God and his holy Angels to vvitnes, that these men of God vvere most iniuriously, and vvilfully murdered.</p>
   <p>And as we their frends in England acquainted with al their actions sithence their repaire into the realme, can testifie this vpon our ovvne certaine knovvledge:<note place="margin">Testimonie of forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> and the forraine Princes whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments they were fained to be for inuading the land, and the Superiours of their Societie and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges by whose appointement and direction they came in, can and wil, if neede be, giue authentical intelligence vpon their honors and conscience of the truth hereof. So may euery man that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent either at their examining, racking, arraigning or death: or that hath heard of the same, or of the strange course of proceding tovvards them either before their condemnation or aftervvard, cleerely behold the same.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The effect of the endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tement.</note>To proue that they practised the Q. death at Rome and Remes, and inuasion of the realme by forraine povvers in the xxij yere of her M. raigne, the last of March and last of May and diuers other times, which was the effect of their enditement: there was neither witnes, confession of the parties, probable presumptions, nor any word spoken, or euidence in the world, that was to the point of the enditement, or that could touch any of them that vvere vpon the same enditement arraigned the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day.</p>

   <p>But let vs consider a litle of the qualities of these witnesses, that you may see what instruments the protestants are forced for lacke of better to vse to the affliction of Godly men. They cal Priests and Iesuists the POPES instruments to aduaunce his intentions: oh good God what difference is there then betvvixt the POPES instruments and these that the Heretikes onely vse. Vvhat are <hi>Nicols, Sledd,</hi>
      <note place="margin">The qualitie &amp; cōditions of the vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</note>
      <hi>Eliot, Munday,</hi> companions knovven to be of no religion, of euery religion, coozeners, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblers, espials, yea &amp; some of them to be charged with aduoutery, murther, and such like crimes, and therfore as wel for lacke of conscience and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as for pardon of their faults, most fit to be corrupted, vvhat I say are these the offal of the

And yet vpon the testimonie of one onely of these without any other profes or presumptiōs in the vvorld worthy the hering, vvas <hi>M.

   <p>Vvherein the iniurie was the greater that the Apostle expresly geueth order that no accusation be hard against a Priest, vvithout tvvoe witnesses. yea and if the glorious doctor S. Augustine might be heard, none of al these vvitnesses nor a hundreth such more should be receiued against these blessed confessors. Thus he saith to <hi>Pancarius</hi> an officer, and an honorable person before vvhom a certaine Priest named <hi>Secundinus</hi> was accused of a great crime.<note place="margin">Heretikes are no sufficient vvitnesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est by S.

   <p>But novv Gods true religion being abandoned out of our miserable countrey through our sinnes,<note place="margin">In this irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious time, Priests most subiect to iniuries.</note> the honor of God &amp; reuerent respect of his sacred Priests is gone withal: and in steed of priuiledge and prerogation graunted to them by diuine and humaine lavves, they are most subiect to iniuries, villanies, contempt and calumnies, of al conditiōs and stats of the realme.

   <p>But to sifte better the vvorthines and vveight of the forenamed false witnesses as of the cheefe plaiers in this action.

This man of Belial hath many vvaies vttered him self since his comming from Rome. He confessed to a companion of his, that he had thought to haue slaine good <hi>M.

   <p>Hovv greatly the confession of the supposed fact vvas desired of the counsel, and to euery one of them vrged, and vvith vvhat singular arte they vsed the last of al that vvas executed, to haue him say some vvordes of disagremēt from his fellovves dead befor him, that therevpon they might haue caried him backe and made the people beleeue that he had confessed the fact and therefore pardoned, therevpon to haue disproued al the rest, it is a vvorld to see.</p>

   <p>Vve say nothing of their open declaration of their diffidēce tovvards al Catholikes, impeaching them in maner generally of their fidelitie &amp; good affection tovvards their prince and countrey, which geueth great occasion both at home and abrode, of much discontentement and desperation.

<pb facs="23"/> their seruice and our affliction. for I haue heard <hi>Norton</hi> him self say, that svveare they neuer so fast, he vvil not trust them, except they goe to the Church: meaning their schismatical seruice.</p>
   <p>This same man not discouered onely of il affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but iustly put into the Tovver for seditious wordes &amp; plaine treason (so much as would haue hāged an hundereth Catholikes &amp; honest men) yet much complained that he vvas so vnkindely dealt withal,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Norton</hi> tooke great vnkindnes.</note> that a fevve rashe wordes which of many wise men were not misliked of, as he saith, could not be forgiuen, but with such difficultie. Specially to him that was so necessarie for their seruice, that neither the citie of Lōdon, to which he was a feed man: nor the parliament, wherein he did many good offices alvvaies: nor the Prince in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions for religion, wherein he was much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied, could spare him.</p>
   <p>And <hi>M. Nortons</hi> wife, if she wil be as plaine to the Counsel, as she is to some of her neighbours, can tel (if M. Secretarie him self remember it not) vvho put vnto this same <hi>Norton,</hi> being then for the said treasons in the Tovver, and iustly in disgrace with her M. to pen matters of state, &amp; to set dovvne orders and articles to be treated of against Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes in the parliament, and other places: the said persons can tel you perhaps, what he meant by these wordes often vttered in his disgrace:</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Norton</hi> his suspicious vvordes.</note>VVORTHY, WORTHY, <hi>Marreth al, but</hi> GRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIOVS, GRACIOVS, <hi>may make</hi> VVISER VVISER <hi>to amend al.</hi> the rack would picke as good matter out of this, as out of any poore Catholikes breast in Englād. And he to whom he vvrote these wordes, <hi>Defend me, and spare me not, according to the Irish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe:</hi> can read the riddel.</p>
   <p>The said <hi>Mistris Norton</hi> can tel also, where her husband did lay vp <hi>Stubbs</hi> booke<note place="margin">Stubbs his booke.</note> against her M. for a secret treasure. which geare vvel sifted, vvould
<pb facs="23"/> bevvray vvorse affection and intention to, then they shal euer find in Catholikes whilst they liue.</p>
   <p>This <hi>Stubbs</hi> being the Q deadly enemie &amp; then in the Tovver for his traiterous booke, vvas of M. Lieutenants Counsel in al things,<note place="margin">
         <hi>M.

      <note place="margin">Stubs perv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Charkes booke.</note> one that vvas once put to silence for puritanisme, or a vvorse matter, if worse can be, sent his booke against <hi>F. Campion</hi> to be perused, vvhich things the Lieutenant vvould neuer haue done or permitted, if he had borne that good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to her M. as he requireth in Catholikes, or if he and his fellovves might be posed in their thoughts, and of the time future, and their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to come.</p>
   <p>And it may be one of these fellovves deuises or some other of like spirit and inuention,<note place="margin">An other nevv practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> to send the poore Catholikes whom they haue ruined at home, to <hi>Terra Florida,</hi> there to exercise their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and to haue freedom of conscience, a strange coozenage and craft, to be rid of the poore gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilmen vnder pretence of their prefermēt, but most men of the realme wish rather the puritans there, as an humor that our cōmonvvealth had more need to be purged of.</p>
   <p>Vvho are also better acquainted in those parts, as being once sent thither out of <hi>Geneua</hi> by Caluin, when the french made the like attempt vvith as good successe as I feare these shal haue, which in truth can not by the lavv of God and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, if I take it right, possesse those partes which by former composition and by decree of <hi>Alexander the vj,</hi> pertaineth to an other Prince.</p>
   <p>It is the Catholikes that haue iustly possessed England these thousand yeres, it is no reason they
<pb facs="24"/> should be thrust into the Indes for their dwelling. but this is their art to weaken our side against the day of their ful reueng, which may be reckoned amongest the greatest of our persecutions, and to proceed of a shrevvder head then <hi>Nortons.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But al these deepe distresses, calamities and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the preface, vvith an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation &amp; praier.</note> which we suffer, not so much at her M. handes, or her grauest Counsellers as by these sinful, irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious persons, their il enformers, vve do from the bottome of our harts forgiue, and desire God of his vnspeakable mercie to turne avvay his heauie hand of iustice, from the Realme, and from euery one, that either procured, or consented to the deaths of these his blessed Saints, or the trouble of his holy <hi>Israel,</hi> vvhose blood and death most deare in our Lords sight, I pray CHRIST IESVS they cal not for vengeance, but for mercie and grace tovvards their persecutors, that they may rather with penance consider in this life against vvhom they haue pricked, then see and feele it to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in the next.</p>
   <p>But whatsoeuer fal through this great sinne or our other offenses either to their ennemies, or to vs their frends, that are yet left in this vvretched world, in the worst daies that were this thovvsand yeres, and in the heauiest and most douteful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our countrey that was since the cōuersion: these Martyres are blessed,<note place="margin">The blisse of these mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs soules.</note> safe, free, past al mortal miseries, in the hands and garde of God, vvhere the torment of malice can not touch them, nor such reach them, of whom our Sauiour said, <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that haue no more to do.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>They are exceding happy certs, that liue not these dooleful daies, but a thousand times more happy, that haue the grace and priuiledge to yeld any drop of bloud for the appeasing of Gods wrath, and assvvaging this publike rage of sinne
<pb facs="24"/> and heresie. Their deaths precious, their soules in glorie, their memories in benediction, their names eternal:<note place="margin">The honor of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> yea euen their bodies vvhich were the infirme part of these noble <hi>Machabees,</hi> though han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on ports, pinnacles, poles &amp; gibbets, though torne of beasts and birdes: yet rest in peace, and are more honorable, sacreed, and soueraine: then the embaumed bodies of vvhat worldly state so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer in their regal sepulchres.</p>
   <p>That day and hovver they stoode in the carte in misery and desolation as it seemed to the simple, yet euen then were they more happy then al the multitude that beheld them, neuer a wise man that there stoode thought othervvise, though the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent paines and briefe ignominie seemed to fooles &amp; carnal men to be extreeme miserie: but al those were so momentaine, that their better part was in heauens blisse, before their bodies were cold or out of the bouchiers hand, their soules praied vnto both by their happy fellovves openly, and by many a good man secretly, before their bonnes were cold. Because S. Augustine geueth vs that rule, That we must not pray for Martyrs, but pray to them.</p>
   <p>Vvhat honor shal they be in hereafter in Gods Church, and in our coūtrey specially,<note place="margin">The honor they be in already.</note> when malice and enuie shalbe worne out, it is easie to conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. Vvhen euen in the daies of their persecutors, and in as sharpe punishment, diligence and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, that their memories be not recommendable to the vvorld, as euer was vsed of the old heathen persecutors, against <hi>S. Policarp, S. Albon,</hi> and other auncient Martyrs, yet their renoume hath passed through al the Christian world, and hath pearsed the very heretikes harts in Fraunce, Geneua and Germany. No talke, as I am credibly enformed, more common there, then of this late double slau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter, first of <hi>F. Campion</hi> and his tvvo fellovves,
<pb facs="25"/> then of these vij. Machabees.</p>
   <p>And for the Catholikes, of <hi>Italie, Spaine, Fraunce,</hi> and namely (which is lesse to be marueled at) of <hi>England,</hi>
      <note place="margin">The great desire men haue of their reliques.</note> more then the vveight in golde would be geuen, and is offered for any peece of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, either of their bodies, haire, bones or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea or any thing that hath any spot or staine of their innocent and sacred bloud. Vvherein surely great diligence and honorable zeale hath been shevved by diuers noble gentilmē &amp; verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people, that haue to their great daūger obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned some good peeces of them, to satisfie presently the godly greedy appetite of holy persons of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers nations making extreeme sute for them</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The deuotiō of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tovvards their bodies already.</note>Marry that is most notable and memorable, that diuers deuoute people of our nation that can get no part of their sacred reliques, yet come as it were on pilgrimage to the places vvhere their quarters or heades be set vp, vnder pretence of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and asking vvhose heades or bodies they be, and what traitors they were, whose heades are set highe aboue others, there, to do their deuotion &amp; praiers vnto them, vvhose liues they knevv to be so innocent, and deathes so glorious befor God and the world.</p>
   <p>IESV! what a pleasur, what honor and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes haue their ennemies done vnto them, thus soddenly and euerlastingly, to make them num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in glorie amongest the saints: we and al their frends, and al the princes of the world, if they could haue yelded to them al the Kingdomes of the earth and the glorie thereof, could not haue benefited them so much vvitingly, as their enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies haue done against their intention, but by the prouidence of God, who turneth the wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice of man, to the eternal good and honor of his Church and Saints.</p>
   <pb facs="25"/>
   <p>O good God CHRIST IESVS, geue these, thy, their, and our persecutors, for thy deaths sake, and for this fresh bloud of thy MARTYRS, and for the grones, sighes and teares, of so many thovvsand thy chained, Imprisoned and afflicted Saints, geue them mercie and grace to see that they goe not the right vvay to saue our coūtrey &amp; them selues from perdition either temporal or eternal, humble their harts to the obedience of thy <hi>Lieutenant general,</hi> and to thy holy spovvse in earth, that so vnder thee, and not against or aboue thee, our Prince ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH as a mēber of thy Church, and not as head of the same, may reduce her Realme to the vnitie of the Christian vvorld, and so rule and gouerne our temporal &amp; ciuil state, in long peace, much honor and securitie.
