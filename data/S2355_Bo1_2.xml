      </gap>each to the danger of your person, of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ate and life. That treatise discovereth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ransposing of the crowne, the extincting of your line, and the hazarding of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>lme. It openeth vnto yow the contrivers of those treasons to be a couple of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
<pb facs="2"/>
of base parentes borne: first callid to Court, thone from booke, thother from butterie: which two be now more then Barons by office and dignitie, more then Earles by possessions and wealth, more then Dukes in authoritie: which two be now your cosoning Counsaillors, though sett vppe by your good fauour in the chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest places of the Realme, whereby they haue made them selues mightie in money, mariages and allies, and be the two cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cōspiratours, that haue in their owne power and in the handes of their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, all the offices, all the portes, all the fortresses, your treasour, your armour, yea your selfe, your succession and the whole realme to dispose at their will: They be the two captaine conspiratours, that haue beset yow rownde abowte with feares, and dangers prepared by them selues and by sondrie fine deuises remoued from yow all defenses of faithfull frindes at home and a broade, deuided the realme into factions, abused your authoritie, imploied your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours to the danger of your state, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie of your person, and to your final ouerthrow by death or depriuation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>ere it be long.</p>
   <p>Thus that treatise discouereth those two traiterous Counsaillours: who to worke
<pb facs="2"/>
more subtilly their mischeuous intentions, and to kepe yow from espying their terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treasons, haue misleaden yow by a false show of other treasons, wich were neuer intended, and abused yow vndre title of dutie, pretence of seruice, and colour of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie to hold them vnsuspected.</p>
   <p>In that treatise also your heighnes shal see the vnbuckling and lifting vpp of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>sardes and veiles, that wold walke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

      </gap>eene, and still couertlie circumuent yow by their fine fetches whiles they freelie fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish their determined treasons against your person and state.</p>
   <p>That treatise of treasons is abridged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this table, which showeth forth but in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

   <p>The author of the treatise, and the abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the same beare good affectiō to yow and to the realme: and therefore doe disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto you the present perills that now hang over both: which when yow shal by survew perceave and vnderstand, God giue yow grace, to consider and preuent.</p>
   <p>And Madam for that it cannot be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that those two Conspiratours doe watchfullie care and politickly provide, how to kepe frō yow alletters, bookes and treatesies, which they feare may let or disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their final purpose: It hath ben thought neccessarie to invent and find owt all good meanes whereby the said treatise or at least the Table of the same, might by some more faithful seruant of yours, be addressed to your owne handes: for the which respect it hath bene by meanes conveighed to the sight of your trustie servant Mr. Hatton (and others) who of dewtie and alleage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance hath bene thought the most fitt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to present yow the same. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he shal showe your heighnes, more love dutie and faithful obediece, then those of your Counsaillors, that so many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes sithence, haue had the treatise it selfe
<pb facs="5"/>
in their handes and concealed the same, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of doubt their practises might be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timelie discouered and preuēted, or in dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de for lack of love towardes your heighnes person: which standeth in greater perill then yow can beleeve. God geve yow grace to sorsee and avoide the same.</p>
