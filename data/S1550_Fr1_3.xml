   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F <hi>Master Mason</hi> (court<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ous Reader) in his Booke <hi>of the consecration of the Bishops in the Church of England,</hi> had either directly proued their lawfull calling, or impugned that of the Bishops of the Catholike Roman church, he might haue expected from his Catholike aduersaries some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the same. But seeing he pretendeth onely to cleare them, from the iust imputations laid vpon them by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Authors (which he calleth slanders) and thereby maketh himselfe only Defendant, he cannot with any reason, expect from them any reply, in forme of answer, to his booke. For there are few but know this difference betweene the defendant, and the Plaintiffe or Appellant: that the Defendant must necessarily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to all and euery obiection brought against him whereas the Appellant is not bound to reply, to his answers made to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obiection, but may (if he thinke good to impugne either his answeres, or the cause he maintaineth) make his choice of one, two, three, or moe, as he shall thinke most for his aduantage. Which if he can in such sort enforce against his aduersary, as he is not able to satisfie them, he shall clearly gaine his cause against him. For example, he that being accused of felonie, or treason, and therefore defedant, is necessarily constrayned to answer to all, and euery important accusation laid against him, and if he faile in the answer but of one only, he wil be found guilty; whereas his aduersary being appellant, is not tied for the euicting of his cause, to reply vpon his answer to euery accusation, but may make
<pb facs="4"/> free choice of such, and so many, either of his former accusations, or any other, as he findeth fittest for his purpose, which if he can presse in such sort, as the defendant cannot auoid them, he shal conuict him to be guilty. <hi>M. Mason</hi> therefore making himselfe meerely Defendant in this quarrel, is not to expect that I, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as Appellant, to proue their Bishops to haue no lawfull calling, should reply vpon euery parcell of his whole booke, in forme of answer to that which he saith. For besides that this would cost both me, and the Reader more labour, then the thing is worth, it is no way necessary for my purpose: which is not to answer him (who making himselfe Defendant hath the place of the answerer) but to impugne the thing that he would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; which whether I haue performed effectually or no, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the answeres which he hath already made in this his booke, I leaue to the censure of the iudicious though otherwise partiall Reader.</p>
   <p>Furthermore <hi>M. Mason</hi> thorow his whole Booke making choice only of such arguments, as he thinketh good to propose against himselfe, and vrging them only so farre, as he thinketh he can make some shew of soluing them (like vnto little children that build Castles of Tile-shards, and afterwards please themselues in throwing them downe) cannot hope that his aduersary should fauour him so farre, as (leauing his best aduantage either in the choice of his arguments, or in the maner of vrging them) to bestow his time and trauell in refuting the answeres, which he frameth to his owne obiections. This fauourable course (to deale plainly) I intend not to hold with <hi>M. Mason.</hi> Yet will I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise him, that where I finde he saith any thing, either for the preuenting, or answering any argument here by me proposed, it shal not be dissembled, but set downe in his owne words, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture vrged farther, then it is by him, which is as much, as he can with any reason expect at my hands in this cause. But, (to note this by the way) why is <hi>M. Mason</hi> so could in this matter
<pb facs="5"/> of their calling, that he proposeth not to himselfe to proue it, neither by Scripture, Traditions, Councels, nor Fathers, (all which kinde of proofes he knoweth to be authenticall with vs) but only pretendeth <hi>to cleare it from the slanders,</hi>
      <note place="margin">In the face of his booke.</note>
      <hi>and odious imputations of the Romanists, and to iustifie it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nothing contrary to the Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, or approued examples of primitiue antiquity.</hi> It is knowne they exact of Catholikes with all rigour and instance, positiue and precise proofe of Scripture for their doctrine in all points of controuersie. Why doth not therefore <hi>M. Mason</hi> bring at least such proofes, of Traditions, Councels, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (which he knoweth are not reiected by vs) for their new ministery, but contenteth himselfe with the buckler, and standeth only vpon his defence? Marry for this reason: that neither Scriptures, Councels, Fathers, or Traditions yeeld him any one positiue proofe of their vocation; or if they doe, I chalenge him to produce it, and he shall gaine his cause. Neither will I bind him to finde his proofes out of the Fathers within the first fiue hundreth yeares after Christ,<note place="margin">D. Humfray in the life of Iewel saith he gaue the Papists to large<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> scope: and M. Fulk hath the like in his Reten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiue. pag. <hi>55.</hi>
      </note> as M. Iewel did in his bragging challinge, and yet was reprehended by his brethren for being ouer liberall: but I giue him for this purpose the whole <hi>1500.</hi> yeares.</p>
   <p>Againe, (to come yet more neere him) what doth he thinke is sufficient, to cleare and iustifie their calling, <hi>to containe nothing contrary to the Scriptures, Fathers, Councels, and Antiquities?</hi> Will he say it is a sufficient iustification of this point, not to be driuen by force of argument, to confesse that it is against the Scriptures Fathers, &amp;c.? If he will say so, I make no doubt, but he hath or wil iustifie the consecrations, and calling of their Bishops and Ministers, to containe nothing contrary to the Scripture &amp;c. But though he be absurd enough in many things, as will appeare hereafter, yet I cannot think him so absurd as to affirme this. For so shall he be constrained to confesse, that
<pb facs="5"/> the Arrians, and all the obstinate heretiques that euer haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, haue iustified their heresies to containe nothing contrary to scripture &amp;c. none of them hauing yet euer bene constrained by force of argument, to confesse their doctrine to be contrary ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.</p>
   <p>He will peraduenture saie, that ouer and besides this, he will shew the obiections made against their Bishops, to be but <hi>slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and odious imputations.</hi> But how will he shew this? by any other meanes, then by such, as the Arrians, and all other heretiques pretended to shew, the arguments of the Catholique Doctors against their heresies, to be but slanders? that is by making shew of framing some kind of answere to them, that they might not be said to be ouercome, and forced to graunt the falsity of their heresie. In this sort surely and no other, doth M. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son iustifie the consecration, and calling of their Bishops to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nothing contrary to scripture, as will appeare in the processe of our dispute.</p>
   <p>And now must I acquaint thee (good reader) with the reason for which, hauing vndertaken to prooue the nullity, of our new English Bishops their consecrations, and calling, against M. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I enlarge my selfe so farre, as to disprooue also that, of all the other falsly tearmed reformed churches; which reason is this. Knowing that the whole multitude of heresies, that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ster the world at this time (as likewise all other which haue, or shalbee) are by no one kind of argument so easily and euidently refuted, as by that of the calling of their pastors: And hauing occasion offered me by M. Masons brauing apology for the Protestant Bishops of England, to shew the nullity of their consecratiō and vocatiō; Which though it haue the greatest outward appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of lawfull calling, of any other of the new stampe, and therfore it being refuted the rest might be thaught to be sufficiently refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it yet it being proper onlie to the pretended church of England, yea and not to that wholly (the Puritanes, Brownists,
<pb facs="6"/> Familians, and Anabaptists disclaiming from it as papisticall and superstitious) I considered that it was not to any great purpose, for the impugning of all these heresies, to refell it alone and leaue the others vntouched. Therfore I resolued to make this treatise generall, and to shew that no one of the new churches, called of the reformation, haue any true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and consequently cannot be any true churches, nor ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue any true faith, or meanes of saluation. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in all good methode those questions, that treate of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more generall, goe before those that handle the more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer, therfore in my discourse, haue those questions the first place, that treate of the more generall points pertaining to this matter.</p>
   <p>Yet because my purpose is specially to disprooue the calling, and consecration of the Bishops in England, as well for that it is peculiar to our owne countrie, (and it being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprooued, the rest can haue no great probability, for that it hath more shew of true calling then all the rest) as also for that the calling of the ministers of the French churches, which are the same with our Puritans, is already vnanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly refuted, by that famous prelate, and terrour of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques of those daies Cardinall of Perron, in a proper trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of that subiect, set forth long since, yet neuer answered, and so much therof hereafter related, as pertaineth to the matter there in question, for these reasons (I say) I stand longer vpon that point by much, then vpon all the rest. If M. Mason or anie other, shall thinke good, to continue the defence of this cause, let him frame a pertinent answere to the arguments here proposed, and he may expect a like reply, if God giue health and assistance. In the meane while if thou (cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous reader) canst make any vse of this my traueile, for the maintaining of the Catholique truth, and rooting out of the contrarie, either in thy selfe or others, I shall estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb facs="6"/> my paines very sufficiently recompensed and so I commend thee to Gods holy grace.</p>
