All the whiche, besydes the pleasure that maye be taken in readynge of them, be full of teachynges and documentes, to hym that woll taste, dygeste and reduce them vnto a morall sense. For there maye be perceyued many passages, which maye greatly serue to the conducte of publique affayres, aswell in the tyme of peace, as in the tyme of warre, And yet neuertheles, consyderynge my Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call estate, and also the seruytude that I beare towardes youe, whiche is suche, that I holde and repute my selfe bounden to desyre and procure youre soule helthe, chiefly: and also the prosperytie and felycyte of youre temporall estate, as muche, as any subiecte or seruaunte that youe haue, for many greate goodnes, which of youre grace and mere motion, you haue done vnto me wythoute anye myne merytes, in all poyntes vndeserued, and for the affectyon and confydence, whiche youe haue shewed, and shewe to haue in me, muche more greate, than my small seruyces maye haue deserued, I thought it not conuenable, that I had laboured so farre in translatynge for youe humayne hystoryes, excepte that I employed my tyme and laboure in some spyrytuall thyng.

And notwythstandynge after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes hauynge no other matter in hande, whiche semed vnto me worthy of translation for to presente vnto youe, wherof youe haue not had knowlayge, and that I haue not founde in your librairy in olde bookes, which haue benhertofore translated into Frenche by many &amp; diuers excellēt authours, I haue fynally cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hstory of Thucydides the Athenyan, which he hath wrytton in .viii. bokes of the warre of Peloponese and of the Lacedemoniens, whiche semeth ryghte singulier vnto me. not so muche for the declaratyon of the hystory (althoughe y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it be very fayre &amp; rare ynough to Frenche men, which haue not had many of the bokes of the hystoryes of Grekes at large in theyr language) as for the profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dytie and excellencye of the orations and propositiōs (which be called conciōs) conteygned in the same. Whiche comprehende generall teachynge of all waygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thynges, and the hole arte &amp; efficacite of Eloquence, as all authours, aswell Grekes as Latyns do shewe vs. Specyally Cicero, who is the Prynce of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence amongest the Latins. Thinking that I haue done nothyng by the trās<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations aforesaid, yf I had not translated thys hystorye, which so greatly is cele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brated by all them, whiche haue had knowlayge of the sayd orations &amp; cōcions.

Deuising with whome of this matter, by meanes of cōmunicatyon, whiche I had had with him in translation of the other Greke hystoryes, purifyed or trās<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated out of Greke into Latin, wherof I haue made mention afore, &amp; shewyng him the difficultie, that I founde in the sayde matter, he gaue me courage to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende vnto it, magnifying greatly vnto me the excellencye of the sayd hystorye, &amp; further promysyng me y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he woulde correct the latyne translatyon of the same, in places &amp; passages which he thought to haue be altered or darkened.
