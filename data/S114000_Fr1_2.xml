   <head>THE PREFACE, To the deuoute and distressed <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes of Great Brittan.</hi> WRITTEN AS IT SEEMES from one of their Priests, to inuite them to leaue England <hi>as a den of Heretikes, and get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to be made partakers of the riches and blessings laide <hi>downe in this Booke.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsidering (deere Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes) that nature teacheth, and we haue well learned that lesson in other things, to leaue the worse and take the better, it hath often made me muse and maruell, that you can bee hired to stay amongst these Heretikes, or kept from running to <hi>Rome</hi> with all speede possible: Many things haue amazed me in this consideration but three especially.</p>
   <p n="1">1 To see how all your hopes here vanish and come to nothing.</p>
   <p n="2">2 The miseries and vexations you here endure.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p n="3">3 The comforts and blessings you might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy at <hi>Rome.</hi> What our hopes haue been, it greeues me to call to minde. In those golden daies of <note place="margin">Onuphrius in vita Pauli 4 Petramalerius in vita Poli Card.</note> Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> when <hi>Cardinall Poole</hi> reconciled vs, then they reioyced at <hi>Rome,</hi> we triumphed at home and made bonefires of the Heretikes all ouer <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> But by and by all the fat was in the fire: for <hi>Elizabeth</hi> soone caused vs to turne our <hi>Te deum</hi> into <hi>de profund is.</hi> Wee cried and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Extat ipsa bulla excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municationis inter Petri Mataei Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutiones Rom. Pont. pag. 624.</note> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and found releife. <hi>Pius quintus</hi> thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred out his roaring Bull against her, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated her as an Heretike, depriued her, dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her subiects of their oathes to her. <hi>Gregory</hi> confirmed it. <hi>Sixtus</hi> renued it that this threefold cord might not bee broken, and wee for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that thrice blessed Bull, plotted Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the <hi>South,</hi> raised rebellions in the <hi>North:</hi> But alasse what became of all? Shee liued to see those three Popes &amp; three more, all turne vp their heeles as though the curse had falne vpon the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers heads: and the rebellions Treasons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies against her, were all discouered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feared.</p>
   <p>Hereupon the penalties of the lawes, being doubled and redoubled vpon vs, we groning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Vide librum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptum. Cane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizatio. S. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daci impressum. Roma anno 1588.</note> the burden, got <hi>Sixtus quintus</hi> to hire the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish King</hi> against her, who came vpon her with his Inuincible Armado. Now were our hopes at the height, and we could scarce containe our selues for ioy. But how soone was it dasht, for what became of all the inuincible Armado, but confusion to it selfe, shame and losse to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb facs="3"/> and such griefe to the Pope that procured it, as cost him his life: and we were left not like <hi>Sheepe</hi> to the slaughter (for we loue not the sheepes qualities) but like <hi>Foxes</hi> to be hunted by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes and ferretted out of all our warme nests.</p>
   <p>Thus laden with shame and sorrowes, we lay languishing in woe and misery, hauing now no hope left but the death of that wicked woman, for which wee said many a masse, made many a praier, and (because you know we trust not to our praiers) deuised many a treason against her life, but all in vaine, shee liued to see the hanging of hundreds of vs, and died at last with nothing but old age, surmounting in glory and greatnesse, all the Princes in the world of her sexe and time.</p>
   <p>And now had we beene vtterly forlorne, and desperate, had it not beene that some good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes put vs in hope to finde fauour from him that did succeed her. This kept vs in life, and and therefore at his entrance, wee went with the foremost, and let the world see our hopes were not dead. But alas alas for vs poore cursed caitiffes, wee lept out of the Frying-panne into the fire, for presently we found our selues in worse case vnder him and farre more hopelesse then before.</p>
   <p>Wherevpon some of our zealous brethren, <note place="margin">
         <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clarke.</hi>
      </note> seeing how they and wee were deceiued, plotted against him, and hoped to haue constrained him to that they desired, but all in vaine, for this was defeated and they were hanged, and wee poore
<pb facs="4"/> Catholikes left cold and comfortlesse. Oh had wee then beene so wise as to haue gone all to <hi>Rome,</hi> how happie had wee beene, but wee were yet put into one hope more by our ghostly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and confessors, that at the next Parliament wee should bee relieued: for the good successe whereof wee all praied and longed to see that happy day: and indeed a number of our brauest spirits and most zealous Catholikes had attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one of the worthiest exploits that euer the world heard of, and the blow was euen almost giuen, sentence was pronounced vpon the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes of <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe confirmed by all the Iesuited Catholikes in the world, and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was expected within a few houres: But alas alas (as some of those good men said when they were <note place="margin">
         <hi>Grant</hi> and <hi>Keyes.</hi>
      </note> in the Tower) the businesse was too good to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper, for all was discouered and we defeated, and so in stead of them, wee gaue our selues the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest blow that euer we had, and of which, whilst the world stands we shall neuer bee cured: for by this action many of our chiefe ones lost their liues, wee our peace, and our religion that little credit it had afore amongst them, &amp; all we got was this that his Holinesse least we should be all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from such braue workes, made them <note place="margin">As was the powdet trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note>
      <hi>Martires</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and wee hope ere long will Canonize them for <hi>Saints,</hi> as they well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
   <p>And thus good Catholikes if we will not cozen our selues, say in earnest, where are we now? and
<pb facs="4"/> what is become of all our hopes? are they not all like <hi>Tabacconists</hi> food, and the <hi>Alehimists</hi> riches blowne away in smooke? And as our hopes are past and worne away, so if we consider the present persecutions &amp; miseries we endure, it is more then marueilous we stay in in <hi>England,</hi> you know how bitter the lawes are against vs, and the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee seeth his mercy is abused, commands them all to be executed vpon vs, so that now to offer to bribe the <hi>Pursiuants</hi> and corrupt the <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> will doe vs little good, hee is so set against vs and transported with zeale to his owne religion (which He good soule thinkes verily to bee the true Gospell of Christ Iesus) as now all the gold we can keepe from <hi>Rome</hi> will scarce purchase vs a protector, or finde one that dare once open his mouth to speake a word for vs.</p>
   <p>Oh then (deere Catholikes) what doe wee here, what stay we for? what can you hope or looke for here? but for a heauier yoke, and more grieuous persecution euery day? why then doe we not get vs all to <hi>Rome,</hi> out of the stormy and tempestuous <hi>England</hi> into the happy hauen and sweete sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine of his holinesse fauours? where should the <hi>Children</hi> be but with their father? where the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants</hi> waite, but on their Lord? where the <hi>Sheepe</hi> feede but with their Shepheard? where can you drinke so pure as at the <hi>Fountaine?</hi> where graze so daintily as vpon the <hi>Seauen hills?</hi> where sucke so sweetely as at your <hi>Mothers teats?</hi> Is not his <hi>Holinesse</hi> your father, and the holy <hi>Roman Church</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/> your mother? why then can you bee kept from them, vnlesse you bee bastards and not children? But if you feare to finde him a hard father or a step-mother of her, bee not deceiued: how deerely he loues all his children, aske <hi>Venice, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Sauoy</hi> and <hi>Sicily:</hi> who euer committed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to his care that repented but once? And for her (most louing mother that she is) she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer receiued more then came to her, nor deceiued any that trusted her not: her lappe was euer open to receiue, and her treasure to disbuse againe, but marke the difference and magnifie her boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for she takes from you but your siluer or gold or such like temporall trash, but opens you her treasure, and lades you againe with better bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, spirituall riches, holy pictures blessed graines, <hi>Agnus deis,</hi> holy bones, holy stones, holy wood, holy bloud, holy relikes, holy ragges: glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pardons, gratious Indulgences, and other inualuable Iewells: and well may I call them so, for no liuing man can tell the value of them: leaue then these Heretikes, who (grosse heads) know not the vertue of these riches, leaue them I say to their Onions and Garlike, their word and Sacraments, their Psalmes and Sermons, their praying and preaching, like Dogs to their crusts, or Swine to their akornes. Let vs, as more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined spirits, seeke for purer feeding, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hasten to the seuen hils where holinesse dwels, and where we shall at easie rates, bee made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of such riches as the poore Protestants
<pb facs="5"/> neuer tasted of: witnesse this booke that here I send you venerable only for the antiquitie of it. For as to the truth of it, it cannot be questioned, seeing <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> and many other great and well <note place="margin">Onuphrius de 7 vrbis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sijs.</note> approued Authors, confirme the same, and all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers finde it to be true, as their purses will testifie if they should deny it.</p>
   <p>Oh then what a worthy change shall you make, <hi>Italy</hi> for <hi>England: Rome</hi> for <hi>London, Tiber</hi> for <hi>Thames, Masse</hi> bookes for <hi>Bibles,</hi> seauen <hi>Sacraments</hi> for two, and many other great blessings to boote: you shall be deliuered from Sermons, and Psalmes singing, and Praiers in a knowne tongue, and many other such superstitious ceremonies, which heere you are combred withall: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as here you can scarce walke in <hi>Pauls,</hi> nor make a bargaine in the <hi>Temple Church,</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended with Psalmes singing, Bells ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to serue hereticall deuotions, nor walke scarce by any Church, but shall bee scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and tormented with a Sermon. There you shall bee quite deliuered from all such purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and contrariwise you shall not peepe into a Church, nor creepe into a Cloister where you shall not finde more bounties and blessings, and more thousands yeares of pardon, then all the Churches of <hi>England</hi> are able to giue; as you shall well perceiue by this ensuing Booke: And if you haue such quesie and tender sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes as you cannot bee without a Sermon, his
<pb facs="6"/> Holinesse herein also condiscends to your infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and prouides, therefore you shall haue store of them in <hi>Lent,</hi> when like <hi>Fish</hi> they be in the best season.</p>
   <p>And if the feare of Purgatory happe to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you, <hi>Rome</hi> is the onely place in the world for you, for you will perceiue by this booke so many fine and easie waies to escape it, as you will hold him more then worthy to goe to hell, that euer suffers himselfe or any hee loues to come within the sent or smoake of purgatory.</p>
   <p>And for your Clergy and confessors, and young men vnmaried feare not, they will be in better plight then they euer were in <hi>England,</hi> for the stewes are there in euery streete which his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (out of his owne former experience, no doubt of the necessity thereof) in great wisdome tollerats both for Clergy and Layetie, for eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of greater inconueniences but espetially that his Clergie may auoide that fowle and detestable sinne of mariage: which with vs is held a greater <note place="margin">Costerus in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chirid. Gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secus, Ignatius &amp;c.</note> sinne then to lie with other mens wiues, or twenty whores. And if any thing doe afterward trouble the conscience, you haue there at euery houre a Confessor at hand, and are not to seeke him a farre off, send for him with cost, keepe him with danger, and send him away in secret as you doe in <hi>England:</hi> and he is as readie to giue you absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as you to pay him, and as able to discharge you of all your sinnes as of his owne.</p>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <p>And as for worldly wants, feare them not, how can so tender a father, and so louing a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther see their children want? who knowes not the rich and royall entertainment that <hi>Westmerland</hi> had, when hauing lost all for his Holinesse he fled to them? and least the <hi>English</hi> should plead it as their priuiledge, call to minde how the <hi>Scottish</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rosse</hi> was receiued &amp; rewarded, first with <note place="margin">Vnde laesleum in sua congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione ad Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertum Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducem de Seipso.</note> the title of the Bishopricke of <hi>Constance</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and afterward (because <hi>Constance</hi> by reason of the warres was little worth) with a promise of the Archbishoprike of <hi>Macklin,</hi> and that hee might not starue in the meane time, hee had a pension assigned him of fiftie scutes a moneth, which though it was most ill fauouredly paide him, yet was it most fairely and frankely bestowed on him: And howsoeuer you be not such Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traitors to your owne states, nor such wel-deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fauorits of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> as these two were, yet feare not for you shall at your first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming be welcome, and well refreshed at the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Colledge,</hi> and after that know for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, that euery day certaine pilgrimes of seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nations dine in the <hi>Popes</hi> presence, of meate from his owne table, blessed with his owne most holy hands: (oh who were not worthy to want it that would not post from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> for such a dinner) And it is but a reasonable sute to some <hi>Cardinall,</hi> or the fathers of the <hi>Colledge</hi> to be often made guests at this table, the very crummes
<pb facs="7"/> whereof gathered vp and carried away are of as much vertue as many of the Reliques in Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Church.</p>
   <p>Now then seeing there be such entertainments and rewards to be had for the bodie, as these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples proue and such riches for the soule, as this Booke declares, let vs leaue these Heretikes to wallow in their mire, let couetous Merchants goe to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and Gallants to <hi>Guiana:</hi> let silly Catholikes goe dwell in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and fooles into <hi>Virginia:</hi> Let vs take a wiser course and post to <hi>Rome,</hi> where wee are sure to haue as good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement as wee deserued at home, and to finde as much honesty as holinesse, and as much happinesse as both: And as the Heretikes make themselues sport with this Booke, because (poore fooles) they beleeue it not: so doe you more wisely who know it to bee true, take it with you, reade it in your iourney for your recreation, and when you come there, examine the truth of it Church by Church: And if you finde the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques there as pretious, and as full of vertue and value, as you will finde the relation heere made of them to bee true, I dare say you will bee the richest and happiest people in the world: And further, off this bee assured for your better content, the Heretikes will not so much enuy your rich and happie State in <hi>Rome,</hi> as they doe the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle libertie you haue in <hi>England:</hi> and to say truth (If I may without offence) they are not such cruel
<pb facs="7"/> bloud-suckers, as wee speake and write of them, for I haue often heard many of them say, they had rather haue you all sent away to <hi>Rome,</hi> then the bloud of any of you to bee shead in <hi>England.</hi> And that you may require them for this courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Let mee aduise you when you come at <hi>Rome,</hi> and now and then for your recreation goe foorth to see an Heretike burnt after a sessions from the Holy house (where it is pretty sport to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes to see how the fat Friers out, and how the burning Torches bring away pieces of their, flesh) then if it happen to bee an English-man, doe him this fauour for countries sake, to get him a little sooner dispatched out of his paine: But I put you to too much paine, by keeping you so long from preparing for your Iourney, which I am sure you will doe as soone as you haue read this Booke, vnlesse it bee you doubt of the truth of it, (which none will doe that are true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,) and then I suspect you are turning Heretiks and therefore will wish, that for your punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you neuer see Masse againe, and for your penance may euery Sunday heare a Sermon, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reade two Chapters of the Bible, and receiue the Eucharist once a moneth, which most grieuous penance, if you would auoide, get you first to your Booke, and then to your Iourney.</p>
   <p>And as true as the Pope is as (wee call him) the Vickar of Christ, and his brest the habitation of Holinesse and truth, and (as the Cannon-law
<pb facs="8"/> calls him our Lord God, so certainely you will bee most happie in your Iourney, and most welcome to his Holinesse, espetially if you leaue all you haue in <hi>England,</hi> and come to him poore and vnprouided, and so giue him occasion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise his Charity, for you know, He and his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, and all his Court hold it a better thing to giue them to reciue.</p>
