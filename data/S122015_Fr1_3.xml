   <head>TO THOSE THAT LOVE THE EXERCISE OF ARMES WISSHETH IACOB DE GHEYN HEALTH and prosperitie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is out of all doubt, that neither the quietnesse of a common wealthe without armes, nor the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes without convenient or due exercise, can stand or be maintained. VVhich hath not onely bene well considered by the old sages or wise, that haue vndertaken to give any examples of lawe, but is approoued by the effectuall experience of the most famous Townes and People, that haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served their Estate chieflye by those meanes. And examining the further course of the whole VVorld, we shall find, that the soueraigne powre hath alwayes bene by those which here in did most surpasse theyr neighbours. The Grecians, in the time thye haue bene in theyr most shyning glorie haue much embraced this point, and there in by theyr witt not little proffited. Yet the Romains haue farre surpassed here in aswell those as all others, and ever exercised theyr youth at all kinde of armes by those whom they called Campi-doctores or Mastres of the field. VVhich maner is playnelye showed vnto vs, in the writinges that are there of come to our handes, the same reason standeth fast for euer, and with all nations. But in regard that not onely the vse but euen the armes them selues are much changed chiefly sithence the findinge out of Gun pouder, it can not be denied but that wee can reape small or no benefite by the old rehearsals, without wee haue neewe instructions. His Princely Ex<seg rend="sup">ce</seg>. there fore the Earle <hi>Maurice</hi> of Nassau &amp;c. to whose care (by the Lords Estates generall of the vnited Provinces) is left the charge of defending so worthie countries and the conducting of a warre which is taken for a schoole or patterne to the whole VVorld, Like as he throughout the whole militarie order (before his time, much decayed) hath restored and partelye brought to the examples of the old, partely by his owne inventions amended and adorned, so hath he taken great regard to the exercise of Armes, as one of the principall partes of the militarie ordre, where out are risen such comodites as vnto euery man is knowne not onely in these Countries but also in the vttermost partes of the worlde. This hath bene the chiefe cause that hath mooved me to giue out the order which his Princely Ex<seg rend="sup">ce</seg>. in the vsing of the Calivres, Muskets and Pikes doth obserue as the perfectest and best patterne, aswell to pleasure those whose duety it is to followe the order of his directions, as to accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date any other who shall seeke to draw benefytt to hymself by so necessary exercise and practise of armes. Having to that purpose drawne all the postures that come in the holding or vsing of the armes by order and the same des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed with his reasons and wordes of comand: A worke (without question) very fitt for novices and yongeso ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to whom it belongeth to exercise themselues with great diligence here in, verye necessarye also to all Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes and Comandors the better to looke to the exercising of souldiers, and lastly verie proffitable to all Princes and People, beit in tyme of warre the better to defend themselues, and offend theyr ennemyes or be it in time of peace with the more facilitye (by this kinde of exercising) to draw a better assurance to themselues, and become the more dread full and redoubted to others. Seening then our meaning goeth no further then to instruct the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trained souldiers and to reinforce the minde of the expert by the sight and reading of it: No man shall finde it strange that wee in drawing of the Pikes, onely set that which for the vse of the same is most necessarye, omitting diverse maners of tossing of the pike by forme of recreation, which in militarie exercise bringeth little benefite or profite. Concerning the different or sutable apparell and armes of the figures, there is to be considered, that the shott with head peeces, and the Muskettiers with hattes are drawne and differently appareled, not that we hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de it for necessarie, but that such varietye might give the fuller ornament to the pictures, and to showe to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the manner of souldiers apparel vsed in these dayes, Like as on the other side the Pikemen are all armed after onesorte or kinde, for no other reason then to represent the right maner and fashon of the arminge of his Ex<seg rend="sup">ces</seg>. owne Garde, as it is at this tyme. In the small shot and Musquettiers, you shall also consider that the first figure showeth how a man shall holde a Musket or Caliver already charged vpon his shoulder, and the other pictures followinge tell what is further to be done bothe for discharging, and lykewyse for charging againe of the peece. And because that every man standing still shall knowe how to behaue himself intyme of need, there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb facs="4"/>
set downe in the ende ech seuerall picture with his seuerall difference of stand or posture and that to give truer light to the iudgement of the obseruer. But aboue all is to be well considered that which seemes here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a leasurly and stow proceeding in the apprehension (by reason of the smalenes of the sculpture which could not conveniently be otherwise formed) that I say) must the industrious learner with a diligent practise strive to bringe to a nimble and quicke readines of action. Neuerthelesse so, as that in the best fashon and with the most care and providence he make it appear that it is to offend the ennemy without hurting or anoynig him self or his fellowe, the rest the written instructions and the pictures shall shewe.</p>
