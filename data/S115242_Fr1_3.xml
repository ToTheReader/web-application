It hath bin ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought fitter to follow the first Authors inuention, than to publish the worke accordinge to the alteration of a translator: &amp; for that cause many places are reiected in the Latin coppy,
<pb facs="9"/> which are here published accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the first Italian edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let therfore the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heerof suspend his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if he find not a coherence betwixt the Latin &amp; the English, and allow of that translation which followeth the first and truest Coppy.</p>
