   <head>THE LIFE OF LVCIAN THE SAMOSATENIAN. WHEREIN, He is in some sort vindicated from certaine grosse Aspersions, heretofore cast upon him.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a twofold end of studying men. One to attaine the knowledge of our selves: for as the eye (<note n="a" place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>. Plat. in <hi>1.</hi> Alcibiad.</note> sayes the Divine <hi>Plato</hi>) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not behold it selfe in any other part of the body but the eye: so the soule, if it will see it selfe, must looke into the soule. The other, to gaine such a competent knowledge and understanding in other men, as to be able, not onely to make their lives and actions our examples, but to leave them as rules and patterns to them that shall come after us. They therefore that professe the latter, had need to bee well verst, and skilfull in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for he that is too short in the knowledge of himselfe, may be soone over-shot in his opinion of another. And therefore I have alwayes thought it a bold adventure of those that take upon them to become answerable to posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="6"/>
for other mens lives, seeing there are few or none that have observ'd such an orderly methode of living, as to be able to give any just account of their owne: and can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be hardly thought fit, and competent judges of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans. Written lives, being nothing else but the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of the minde: as the plaine draught, and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of a picture are of the body: colours may give it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and beauty, but addes but little to the true resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance: as he then that undertakes to copie out the one, had need to bee well skil'd in the composure and difference of faces; so he that adventures to draw the other ought to bee as cleare sighted in discerning manners and actions. For the least mistake but of the smallest touch or shaddow in a face, alters the shape, and posture of the countenance: and in matter either of life or government, the insertion or omission of the meanest circumstance may give an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and difference to an action.</p>
   <p>As for our author now in hand, there is but little trust to bee given to the tracke of former times: for some that have heretofore undertaken to record his life, having drawne three or foure severall persons of that name, some Sophisters, some Rhetoricians, and living at severall times into one <hi>Lucian,</hi> have not so much wrote his life as made it. In a matter therefore so full of uncertaintie, to avoyde the like errour, in following the doubtfull and various re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of such Writers as give no other reasons for their opinions then their owne authoritie: I have thought best, to gather him out of himselfe, and so, as neare as I can, make the author his owne <hi>Biographer.</hi>

That he was borne but of meane paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, we may well conjecture, <note n="q" place="margin">In Somnio.</note> his friends not being able to breed him up a Scholler, or to afford him education cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent to so hopefull a genius, and therefore plac't him with an Vnckle of his by the mothers side, who was an excellent cutter in stone, that hee might learne a trade, whereby to get his living: but there he stay'd not long, for either led by his good fortune, or driven by his hard usage, he soone gave his Vnckle the slip, and became his owne car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, applying himselfe afterwards wholly to his booke. At the length, both friends and meanes failing him at home, he left <hi>Samosata</hi> and went to <hi>Antioch:</hi> where having bestowed some time in the study and practise of the Law, that profession and condition of life either thwarting his disposition, or not answering his expectation, being besides an excellent Rhetorician, he left his Law and betooke, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb facs="7"/>
and travelling into <note n="r" place="margin">In Hercule Gallico, &amp; in pro mercede conduct.</note>
      <hi>France,</hi> became there a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique professor in that Art: Departing thence he went into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where hee gave a full and open testimony of his worth and learning,<note n="s" place="margin">In Herodoto.</note> before a generall assembly of the most able and sufficient persons of the whole country. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus after many and sundry perigrinations made himselfe knowne and famous in divers regions, he now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to draw nearer home, and to travell farther into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, for perceiving the Rhetoricians of those times to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the whole bent and scope of their studies towards their owne ends, endeavouring more the enriching and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themselves then the advancement of vertue and goodnesse: and finding the profession likewise <note n="t" place="margin">In Revivis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centib.</note> full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny disturbances, deceptions, oppositions, impudences, lies, clamours and infinite other inconveniences, hee forsooke this also,<note n="u" place="margin">In Hermotim.</note> and about the <hi>40<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
      </hi> yeare of his age betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to Philosophie: <note n="x" place="margin">In Icaromen. &amp; in Hermot.</note> When having by great industrie and studie, acquainted himselfe with the severall tenents and doctrines almost of every sect, and finding that they not only crost and contradicted each other in the very grounds and principles of all Arts and Sciences, and chiefly in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion, and in their conceits and opinions of the Gods; but also, that their lives and practises were nothing at all agreeable to their rules and precepts: hee grew at length into such an utter dislike of them, being himselfe a man that alwayes profest an uprightnesse of carriage, and freedome of speech (<note n="y" place="margin">In Piscator.</note> as may appeare by those artes which he acknowledges himselfe to be skill'd in, and that borrow'd name of <hi>Parrhisiades</hi>) that he bent his style almost wholly against them, and became a sharpe and earnest opposer of the titular and mock-Philosophers of that age: laying open to the world in his writings, by way of Dialogue, after a
<pb facs="7"/>
most pleasant and comicall manner, their avarice, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, ambition, and hypocrisie: and so farre deriding the senselesse superstition, and feigned deities of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, that hee thereby got the sirname of <note n="z" place="margin">Suidas.</note>
      <hi>Atheos,</hi> or <hi>Blasphemus,</hi> and was commonly reputed a mocker and derider both of Gods and men. They that report him to have beene sometimes a Christian, and that afterwards falling into apostasie he should scoffingly say, that he got no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing by that Religion, but only the corruption of his name, which was changed at his baptizing, from <hi>Lucius</hi> to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianus,</hi> have not only wrote more then they could justifie, but what is easie enough to bee disprov'd: for whosoever shall reade his booke <hi>de morte Peregrini,</hi> where he layes both the profession of the same Religion, and the falling from it in anothers dish, may soone perceive that hee was never a Christian, and for that speech of his, it must bee found in some worke that these times are not acquainted with, for in all those peeces that are as yet publisht, I am sure there is no such thing to be found. These men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are as much mistaken in his life as in his death, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that he was torne in peeces by dogges, and producing for both no other authority then themselves. That hee was a most impious blasphemer of our Saviour Christ, and of his sacred doctrine I will not deny: but that his whole workes so much admired and approv'd of by the most learned in all ages, both for wit and language should be therefore utterly banisht from the world, and condemn'd to a perpetuall obscurity, or those parts of him denyed the the light in which there is no such impietie found, but on the contrary, many rules and documents both of vertue and good learning, more then the writinges of <hi>Suetonius, Tacitus,</hi> and other famous authors, who were likewise
<pb facs="8"/>
enemies to the Christian Religion, seemes unto men most unjust, and partiall censure. Let us rather account him worthy of equall priviledges at the least with others, who so well deserv'd both of the nation, and age wherin he liv'd: for if we peruse the writings of <hi>Philostratus, Laertius,</hi> and others who have commended to posteritie the names &amp; memories of such as have bin famous in precedent ages both for arts and armes, we shall scarce finde any one of this Country, since those ancients, <note n="a" place="margin">
