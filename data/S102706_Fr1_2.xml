   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> following, hath beene translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; though not at all into ours, nor yet so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>into others, out of the true Original <hi>Italian,</hi> as I could haue wished. The differences between the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, which walke vp, and downe the world, are not great; sauing, that when there is question of truth; and that, concerning a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble subiect; and the same, accompanyed with variety of naturall, and liuely cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, I cannot find in my hart, to let any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence goe for small. I haue therefore, at once, taken both paynes, and pleasure, <pb n="3" facs="3"/>to draw store of copyes into my hand, and it hath not beene without successe. For if I haue not layd hold vpō the very first <hi>Original,</hi> which was written by the Relatour himselfe; I dare say, that I am growne very neere it, &amp; that it is precisely true. And this <hi>Elogium</hi> I will be bold to giue to the Discourse, which we haue in hand, that it hath beene reade in seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral countryes with extreme auidity. Nay perhaps there hath not issued, in many of these last ages, any one hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall <pb n="4" facs="4"/>
      <hi>Relation,</hi> of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer accident, the
<note n="(a)" place="margin">The relation follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath been sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome read without tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration whereof, hath more often beene attended by teares, then this.</p>
   <p>The
<note n="(b)" place="margin">The birth, &amp; person, &amp; parts of this Noble Man.</note> Person whome it concerneth, was a <hi>Baron</hi> of
<hi>Rome, Sig.<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Troilo Sauelli;</hi> a braunch, which sprunge vp, from a root of as noble bloud, as a most certaine extractiō from the ancient
<hi>Romans,</hi> could tell how to make it. His person, &amp; the parts of his generous mind, are best described in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> it selfe, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; <pb n="5" facs="4"/>so that, I will not heere by putting you to paynes, preuent the pleasure which there you wil haue to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them. The cause for which he suffered, is not specified there at all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his ghostly Father was the penner of this narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it became not him, who was the others Iudge <hi>in foro Conscientiae,</hi> to become his Accuser, <hi>in foro Curiae.</hi> For although his crimes were extant then, and are so stil vpon <hi>Record;</hi> and that the penitent did besids (for <pb n="6" facs="5"/>his owne greater confusion, and the exaltation of the inuincible Patience, and Mercy of Almighty God) giue his Ghostly Father ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse leaue, to declare his sinnes to the whole world; the Father yet, would by no meanes accept of that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but speaking only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall wordes, of sinne at large; he
<note n="(c)" place="margin">The inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble seale of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; &amp; how ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a good Ghostly Father, is, and ought to be.</note> burieth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulers in profoūd silence, and vnder the seale of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> for reuerence of that holy
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> which must neuer vpon any termes be defaced.</p>
   <pb n="7" facs="5"/>
   <p>But I, who am free, will not consent to haue my handes tyed vp; but doe think it fit to let you know, that although his yeares were few, his crimes were great, &amp; many; as doth stil appeare vpon the <hi>Record</hi> of his <hi>Processe.</hi> And betweene the sixteenth, and the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenth yeare of his age (till the former of which tymes, his vigilant, and holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was able to keep him in the discipline of piety, &amp; vertue) he sprouted out, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great exorbitances; and <pb n="8" facs="6"/>in the Company, and at the head of the

They were wont in Italy, to go, in great troopes vp and downe, &amp; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the passages. <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> was one of the first, who broke their backe.</note>
      <hi>Banditi,</hi> he committed both rapes and murthers, with a most tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous, and transported mind. <hi>Ominis
<note n="(e)" place="margin">The bane which is brought vpon young noble men by ill company.</note> inimica amici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, seductio mētis inuestigabilis.</hi> He did too early, cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the hands of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, &amp; wicked followers; and they made the way of sinne so smooth to him, as that he could not hold frō sliding through it. Nor was his tender youth so inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, <pb n="9" facs="6"/>nor his education so excellent, but that the moath, and canker of lewd company, did soon corrode it.</p>
   <p>Yet euen heerein, was not his misery so great, as the
<note n="(f)" place="margin">It is proper to God alone, to draw good out of euill.</note> mercy of God, vpon this occasion, was infinite. His crims were not known, but by such alone, as would not easily aduenture to draw vpon themselues, the displeasure of so greate a house as his, by detecting them. The manner only of his life, in respect of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
<pb n="10" facs="7"/>and riot, was such, in the exteriour, as wounded his noble, and tender Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the very soule. The passages, and proceedinges whereof, are deliuered in the <hi>Relation</hi> it selfe, with so greate tendernes, in the person of her sonne, as stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes the hart of him that reades the wordes. I will not therfore touch that flowre, for feare of strikng off the dew, euery dropp whereof is a pearle. One circumstance only which is not mentioned there, I will <pb n="11" facs="7"/>heer expresse; because it wil not faile to serue, towardes the increase of compassion, in all their mindes, who reade this story.</p>

To this course she was the more encouraged, &amp; in this hope the more confirmed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by this restraint, he would be cut off from that ill company, which was the very pest, and poison of his soule.

But now <hi>publique Iustice</hi> taking notice of his excesses; and <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the eight, in the beginning of his
<hi>Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> being desirous to shew a strong example, of what vnpartiall <hi>Iustice,</hi> the world was to expect at his hands;

Taking him so from her sight, that so she might enioy a glorious sight of him for euer; &amp; depriuing her of all humane comforts (which (for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned her) were abridged, &amp; locked vp in him alone) that so she might, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, send her whole hart vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whither now her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was gone before; and so <pb n="19" facs="11"/>be rewarded, for that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and entire care, which she had taken, for his pious education.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="13"/>much more close, vpon an vnion and sole dependance for all her comfort, vpon Almighty God; (wherein the happines, which we can haue in this life consists) and it is morally certaine, that the abundant grace of Contrition, and Charity, which God infused into the hart of the

<pb n="25" facs="14"/>vpon man, so instantly, so sweetely, so powerfully, and so like a God. And for hauing suffered, in his owne sacred soule, &amp; body, such desolations, and torments, as obtained, at the handes of the eternall Father, not only the remission of our sinnes, (if we will serue our selues of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and other remedyes which he hath left in the bosome of his holy <hi>Catholike Church</hi>) but the adorninge also of our soules, with the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent giftes, and graces of <pb n="26" facs="15"/>the holy Ghost. And yet further, for that he hath knowne, how to make our very sinnes, and greiuous crimes themselues, the meanes, some times, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we obtaine greater gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then

   <p>A great example, and proofe of this power of God, and of the diuinity of Christ our Lord, and the vnspeakable bounty of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> was the so speedy illuminating, &amp; inflaming the soule of this <hi>Baron.</hi> Who, as soone as he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the notice of his death, did, in his proportion, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of the <hi>Blessed Apostle.</hi> For as he, to Christ our Lord, appearing sayd, <hi>O Lord, what wilt thou haue me doe;</hi> so did this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Caualliere of Christ,

   <p>It is not impossible for a man to meete with some Roaring Boy, who may thinke that the <hi>Baron</hi> was to submisse. But it is one <pb n="29" facs="16"/>thing to be a Roarer of the damned Crue, and another to be an humble member of the body of Christ; who assured vs, by his owne sacred mouth, <hi>That

   <p>And this is that which I thought fit to represent to you, by way of <hi>Preface,</hi> to this <hi>Story.</hi> You will find the traces &amp; foot-steps of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men to death, and of the proceedinge which is held with
<note n="(l)" place="margin">The seuerall māners, of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquēts in soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes.</note> delinquents, to be very different, from that of our Countrey, both concerning the body, and the soule. I take not vpon me, to say which are better, and which are worse. With vs, the <hi>Processe</hi> of criminall persons, is euer made, in the face of the world; but they <pb n="43" facs="23"/>are not suffered to haue any aduocates who may defend their causes. In most other Countryes, the delinquēts are permitted to haue Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocates, but the <hi>Processe</hi> is made, though in publique Court, yet only in presence of the Iudges and some few Aduocates, and Officers. With vs, the delinquēts are suffered to liue some dayes after their comdemnation; which certainely is meant in compassion to them; in other parts, after they are iudged to dye, and that so it <pb n="44" facs="24"/>is declared, they thinke they do men a greater cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy, in putting them quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of paine. With vs, there is no difference in the manner of death, between a Clowne, &amp; the best Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Kingdome, vnder the degree of a <hi>Baron,</hi> vnlesse it be, in some very rare case, by most particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler fauour of his
<hi>Maiesty;</hi> but in all other places, that I haue seene, all Gentlemen are beheaded, to distinguish them, frō such as are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. With vs, no indignity <pb n="45" facs="24"/>is euer done to a <hi>Noble man</hi> of
<note n="(m)" place="margin">such as Barōs are, and al aboue them.</note>
      <hi>Title,</hi> by binding of his hands, or armes, or the like; and that custome I commend, as full of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but in many other places, they beare no such respects; in regard of the experiēce which they haue found, and I feare, which still they are in, of insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
   <p>But for as much, as concernes the comfort of criminalls, in the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their soules, towards the death of their bodyes,
<pb n="46" facs="25"/>I cannot but note it, as a point of charity, and piety most
<note n="(n)" place="margin">It is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to help mē to dye well.</note> remarkeable, that in very many of the good townes of
<hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spayne,</hi> there are certain <hi>Companies,</hi> or
<hi>Confraternities,</hi> of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, well borne and bred; who put this obligation of duty vpon themselues, to visit the prisons, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the night prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any executiō. And, togeather with Religious persons, and Ghostly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they watch, and pray, and exhort, and comfort <pb n="47" facs="25"/>the poorest criminalls of the Country, with the same industry, &amp; charity, which is heere, affoarded to this Noble man. And they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them all, to their death; and sometimes, they discharge their dying harts of care; either by vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to pay some of their debtes, or by assisting the poore wife, and children, which are left behind; or by obliging themselues, to get

And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of these good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours, <pb n="48" facs="26"/>we see men dye in those partes, with another manner of disposition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God, then vsually they haue with vs. Where it is a lamentable thing, to see many of so profane stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, that after liues most lewdly lead, they go either drunke, or dauncing to the gallowes. As if, they were but to dye in a play; or as if, after this life, there were no immortality of the soule; or els, at least, no account to be rendred, I say not, of idle words (which yet must <pb n="49" facs="26"/>be done) but of most wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deeds, wherof many of them are guilty.</p>
   <p>The example which heere we haue in hand, will read, to all the Readers of it in generall, a good lesson of humility, patience, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy, magnanimity, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and charity. And
