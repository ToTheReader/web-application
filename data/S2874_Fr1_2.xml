   <head>To the right reuerend Mothers, the Abbesse and Sisters of the Monastery of S. Andrew in Venice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of christian perfection.</head>
   <p>I Find my selfe so much bound to the feruent desire which I knowe to be in you, of walking on apace in the loue of Christ crucified; that seeing the needes of your soules, I cannot any way satisfie my self with the labours which hitherto I haue taken, as well for that I account my selfe to haue receiued already full payment by the comfort which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured hope hath giuen mee of the plentifull fruit which the word of god would bring forth in your harts; as also for that I haue doone much lesse then you desired, or then was answerable to the debt I owe you.</p>
   <p>Therfore being desirous in some part to supply it, and hauing in my hands at this time some written pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers concerning the mortification
<pb facs="3"/>
of our passions (of the which thing I haue so many times discourced with you) I thought it good for your great comfort and helpe, to put them in print, and dedicate them vnto you.</p>
   <p>For our life in earth being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall warfare, they may serue you to fight against your selues, since that by our Lord you are called and particularly chosen to this no lesse glorious, then hard conflict. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare not here how to vāquish cities, but how to ouercome our will; not to conquer forren kingdōs, but how to get the dominion of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is within our selues.</p>
   <p>To this spirituall Batrell I inuite you, and so doth also our Captaine▪ who for vs hauing left his life vpon the crosse, and by his death ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world, aleth vs to this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and death of our selues, that we may liue eternally with him.</p>
