   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not ignoraunt (Gentle</hi> Reader) what daunger I drawe vpon my selfe, by this attempt to answere the quarrels and slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of late time published in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Libelles, against the Bishops and other chiefe of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> We see the eagernesse &amp; bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their spirit that bee the authors of them: we taste alreadie the bitternes of their tongues and pennes. The raging furie of their reuenge vpon all which they mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, themselues dissemble not, but lay it downe in words of great threatnings. I must needs therfore looke for any hurt, that venemous, scoffing, and vnbridled tongues can worke toward me. And how should I hope to escape that, when the Saints of God in Heauen doe feele it? In the course of their whole Libell, when they speake of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Paul,</hi> or the <hi>Blessed Virgin Marie, &amp;c:</hi> whome other iustly call Saintes, their phrase in derision is, <hi>Sir Peter, Sir Paule, Sir Marie.</hi> Surely it had becommed right well the same vnmodest Spirite, to haue saide also <hi>Sir Christ,</hi> and so throughly to haue bewrayed himself. Seeing they haue sharpned their tongues and heartes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst heauen, we poore creatures on earth must bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in our weaknesse to beare them. The dartes, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, of deceitefull and slaunderous tongues, are verye
<pb facs="3"/>
sharpe, and the burning of the woundes made by them, will as hardly in the hearts of many bee quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as the coales of Iuniper. But I thanke God I feare them not, though they bring mee greater harme, eyther in credite, liuing or life, then I trust that God that seeth, knoweth, and defendeth the trueth, will suffer them. <hi>Ambrose</hi> beeing in case somewhat like, sayeth thus, <hi>Non tanti est vnius vita, quanti est dignitas omnium Sacerdotum.</hi> If I therefore shoulde hazarde the one for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the other: I trust the godlye woulde iudge that I did that duetie which I owe to the Church of God, and to my brethren of the same function and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
   <p>What is the cause why wee bee with such spight and malice discredited? Surely, because as the duty of fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Subiectes dooth binde vs, liuing in the state of a Church refourmed, we doo indeuour to preserue those Lawes, which her Maiesties authoritie and the whole state of the Realme hath allowed and established, and doe not admitte a newe platforme of gouernment, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, I knowe not by whome.</p>
   <p>The reasons that mooue vs so to doe, are these two. First, wee see no proofe brought out of the word of God, that of necessitie such forme of Gouernement ought to be: Secondly, that by the placing of the same, it woulde bring so many alterations and inconueniences, as in our opinion woulde bee dangerous to the Prince and to the Realme. Some of those inconueniences I haue in this treatise laid downe, and leaue them to the consideration of them, whom God hath set in place of gouernment.</p>
   <p>It may be some will iudge that I am wordly affected,
<pb facs="3"/>
because I shewe my selfe so much grieued with losse of our credite, and hinderance of good name among the people. In trueth, although a godly Minister shoulde haue no wordly thing so deere vnto him, as his credite: yet if the hurt went no further then to our selues, wee should make lesse account of it. But, seeing by our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche and infamie, the doctrine which wee teache is greatly hindered, we ought by all lawfull meanes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it. Christ himselfe, in this respect, answered such reproches, as the enemies obiected against him. As, <hi>that hee vvas a friende vnto Publicanes and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Matth. 9.</note>
      <hi>That hee vvrought his miracles by the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Matth. 12. Iohn 8.</note>
      <hi>power of Beelsebub: That hee broke the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth day: That hee was a Samaritane: That hee had a deuill &amp;c. Saint Paul</hi> also to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> against his Aduersaries sheweth, that hee was not a <hi>vaine Promiser:</hi> That hee was not <hi>light</hi> and <hi>vnconstant,</hi> and <hi>a wauering Teacher:</hi> That hee did not teache <hi>craftily,</hi> or <hi>corruptly dispensing the worde of God:</hi> That hee did not <hi>teach ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously, as seeking his owne glorie &amp;c.</hi> The like did a nomber of learned Fathers of the Primitiue <note place="margin">Tertul. Iustin. Melito. &amp;c.</note> Church, at large answering those vile and reproche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Slaunders raysed against the Christians in those dayes. <hi>Augustine</hi> in a whole woorke answered As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions falsly fathered vpon him: and so did many other. Wee seeke not therein our owne prayse and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If I doe insert particular prayses and commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I must say vnto the <hi>Libellers,</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> sayde to the <hi>Corinthians, Si insipiens fui in laudando, vos me coegistis.</hi> If I haue bene foolish in ouermuch prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, your immodest reproches, vntrueths, and slaunders
<pb facs="4"/>
do driue me to it. In this mine answere, I seeke not to fatisfie all kinde of men, but onely the moderate and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For the malicious Back-biter &amp; Rayler will neuer be satisfied: but the more he is answered, the worse he will be. If my defence may take moderate place with the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort, I shall be glad: if not, I may not be excessiuely grieued with sorowe, but I must say with <hi>Paul, Gloria nostra haec est, testimonium conscientiae nostrae.</hi> And with <hi>Iob, Ecce in caelis testis meus.</hi> This wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in heauen, and the witnesse of our owne heart and conscience, is sufficient to comfort vs. And for our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe, we must pray with <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably beaten and bitten with viperous tongues, <hi>Leade vs, O Lorde, in thy righteousnesse, because of our enemies: make thy way plaine before vs.</hi> This God I trust, will deliuer vs from the daunger of euill tongues, and open their eyes and hearts, that they may see and vnderstande what hinderance they bring to the Gospel of Christ, which they will seeme to professe so earnestly.</p>
