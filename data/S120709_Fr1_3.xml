      <hi>The generall Prologue vppon the Booke entytuled, <hi>the Diall of Princes, with the famous booke of</hi> MARCVS AVRELIVS. Compyled by <hi>the reuerend Father in God, the Lord Antony of</hi> Gueuara, Bishop of Guadix, Confessor and</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicler of Charles the fifte Emperoure of Rome, to whom &amp; to al other Princes and noble men this worke was directed.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>POLONIVS THIANEVS</hi> disputing with the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Hiarcas sayde: that among all the affections of nature, nothynge is more naturall, than the desire that all haue to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue life. Omitting y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> dispute of these great philosophers herin, we our selfes hereof haue dayly proofe: that to lyue men do tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: to liue birdes do flye: to liue fisshes do swime: and to lyue beastes do hide themselfes for feare of death. Finally I say there is no liuinge creature so brutish, that hath not a naturall desire to liue. If many of the auncient Paynems so little wene lyfe, that of their owne frée willes they offered thē selues to death, they did it not for that they dispised life, but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they thought that for their little regarding life, we would more highly estéeme their fame. For we sée men of hawte courages séeke rather to winne a longe during fame, than to saue a shorte lasting life. How lothe men are to dye, is easely sene by the greate paynes they take to liue. For it is a naturall thing to all mortal men, to leaue their liues with sorow, and take their deathes with feare. Admitte that all do taste this corporall death, and that generally bothe good and euill do dye: yet is there great difference betwene the death of one, &amp; the death of another. If the good desire to liue, it is for the greater desire they haue to do good: but if the euill desire to lyue, it is for that they woulde abuse the worlde longer. For the children of vanitie call no tyme good, but that wherein they liue according to their owne desires. I let ye vnderstande that are at this present, and ye also that shal come hereafter: that I direct my writing vnto those which embrace vertue, and not vnto such as are borne awaye with vice. God doth not way vs as we are, but as we desier to be. And let no man say I would, and can not be good: for as we haue the audacitie to committe a faulte, so (if we liste) we may enforce our selues to worke amendes. Al our vndoing procedeth of this, that we outwardly make a showe of vertue, but inwardlye in the dede we employe our thorough power to vice: which is an abuse, where with al the world is rorrupted and deceiued. For heauen is not furnished but with good dedes, and hell is not replenished but with euill desires. I graunt that neither man nor beaste desireth to dye, but all trauaile to thende they may liue: But I aske now this question. What doth it auaile a man to desire his life to be prolonged, if the same be wicked, vngodly, and defamed? The man that is high minded, proude, vnconstante, cruell, disdeinfull, enuious, ful of hatred, angry, malicious, full of wrath, couetous, a lier, a glutton, a blasphemer, and in al his doinges disordred: why wil we suffer him in the worlde? The lyfe of a poore man that for nede steleth a gowne or any other smal trifle, is forth with taken away: why than is he that disturbeth a whole common wealth left aliue? O would to God,
<pb facs="4"/>
there were no greater theues in the worlde than those, whiche robbe the temporall goodes of the riche, &amp; that we did not winke cōtinually at them, which take away the good renoume aswell of the riche as of the poore. But we chastice the one, &amp; dissemble w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the other which is euidētly sene, how the thiefe that steleth my neighbours gown is hanged forthwith, but he that robbeth me of my good name, walketh still before my doore. The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the firste booke of lawes sayde. We ordayne, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, that he that vseth not him selfe honestly, and hath not his house wel refour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, his riches well gouerned, his family well instructed, &amp; lyueth not in peace with his neighbours, that vnto him be assigned tutours which shal gouerne him as a foole, and as a vacabonde shalbe expulsed from the people, to thintent the common wealth be not through him infected. For there neuer riseth contention or strife in a common wealthe, but by suche menne as are alwayes out of order. Truly the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> had greate reason in his sayinges, for the man that is vitious of his person, and doth not trauaile in things touching his house, nor kepeth his family in good order, nor liueth quietly in the common wealthe, deserueth to be banished, and driuen out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Truly we sée in dyuerse places madde menne tied and bound fast, which if they were at libertie would not doe suche harme, as those that dayly walke the streates at their owne willes and sensualitie. There is not at this daye so greate or noble a Lorde, nor Lady so delicate, but had rather suffer a blowe on the head with a stone, than a blot in their good name with an euill tongue. For the wounde of the heade in a moneth or two maye well be healed: but the blemmishe of their good name duringe life will neuer be remoued. <hi>Laertius</hi> saith in his booke of the lyfe of Philosophers, that <hi>Diogenes,</hi> beinge asked of one of his neighboures, what they were that ordeyned the lawes? aunswered in this wise. Thou shalt vnderstande, my friende, that the earnest whole desire of our forefathers, and all the intention of the Philosophers was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structe them in their common wealth, how they ought to speake, how to be occupied, how to eate, how to slepe, howe to treate, how to apparaile, how to trauaile, and how to rest: and in this consisteth all the wealth of worldly wisedome. In déede this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher in his aunswere touched an excellent pointe, for the lawe was made to no other ende, but to bridell him that liueth without reason or lawe. To menne that wil liue in reste and without trouble in this life, it is requisite &amp; necessarye that they chose to them selues som kinde and maner of liuinge, whereby they may mainteyne their house in good order, and conforme their liues vnto the same. That estate ought not to be as the folly of their parson doth desire, nor as may be most pleasaunte to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes of the body: but as reason teacheth them, and God commaundeth them, for the surer saluacion of their soules. For the children of vanitie embrace that onely which the sensuall appetite desireth, and reiecte that which reason commaundeth. Since the time that trées were created, they alwayes (remayning in the firste nature) vntil this present day, doe beare the same leafe, and frute which things are playne sene in this, that the palme beareth dates, the figge trée figges, the nut trée nuttes, the peare trée peares, the apple trée apples, the chesnutte trée chesnuttes, the Oke acornes: and to conclude I saye all thinges haue kepte their firste nature, saue onely the sinfull man which hath fallen by malice. The planettes, the starres, the heauens, the water, the earth, the ayre, and the fier: the brute beastes, and the fishes, al continewe in the same estate wherein they were first created, not complayninge nor enuying one the other. Man complayneth continually, he is neuer satisfied, and alwayes desireth to chaunge his estate. For the shepherd woulde be a husbandman, the husbandman a squier, the squier a Knight, the knight a King, the king an Emperour. Therefore I say, that few
<pb facs="4"/>
is the number of them that seke amendment of life: but infinite are they that trauaile to better their estate, and to encrease their goodes. The decaye of the common wealth (at this present) through all the worlde is, that the dry and withered okes which haue bene nourished vpon the sharpe mountaynes, woulde nowe seme to be daynetie date trées cherished in the pleasaunt gardeins. I meane, that those which yesterday coulde haue ben pleased w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> dry acornes in a poore cottage at home: at this day wil not eat but of delicate disshes in other mens houses abroade. What estate menne ought to take vppon them to kepe their conscience pure, and to haue more reste in their life, a man cannot easely describe. For there is no state in the Church of God, but men may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (if they will) serue God, and profite them selues. Nor there is no kind of life in the world, but the wicked (if they perseuer and continew therin) may sclaunder their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and also lease their soules. <hi>Plinie</hi> in an epistle that he wrote to <hi>Fabatus</hi> his friēd, saith. There is nothing among mortal men more common and daungerous, than to geue place to vayne imaginacions, whereby a man beleueth the estate of one to be much better than the estate of an other. And hereof it procedeth, that the worlde doth blinde men so, that they wil rather seke that which is an other mans by trauaile and daunger: than enioy their owne with quiet and rest. I say the state of Princes is good, if they abuse it not. I say the state of the people is good, if they behaue them selues o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediently. I say the estate of the rich is good, if they wil Godly vse it. I say the estate of the religious is good, if they be able to profit others. I say the estate of the communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is good, if they will contente them selues. I saye the state of the poore is good, if they haue pacience. For it is no merite to suffer many troubles, if we haue not pacience therin. During the time of this our miserable life we cannot denay, but in euery estate there is bothe trouble and daunger. For then onely our estate shalbe perfit, when we shal come gloriously in soule and body without the feare of deathe: and also whan we shall reioyce without daungers in life. Retourninge agayne to our purpose (mightie Prince) although we all be of value little, we all haue little, we all can attaine little, we all know little, we al are able to doe little, we all do liue but little: Yet in all this little, the state of Princes semeth some great and high thing. For that worldely men say there is no such felicitie in this life, as to haue authoritie to commaunde many, &amp; to be bounde to obey none. But if either subiectes knewe how dere Princes by their power to commaunde, or if Princes knewe howe swete a thinge it is to liue in quiet: doutelesse the subiectes would pitie their rulers, and the rulers would not enuy theyr subiectes. For ful few are the pleasures which Princes enioy, in respecte of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that they endure. Sithe then the estate of Princes is greater than al, that he may doe more than all, is more of value than all, vpholdeth more than all, and finally that from thence procedeth the gouernement of all, it is more nedefull that the house, the person, and the life of a Prince be better gouerned, and ordred, than all the reste. For euen as by the yard the marchante measureth al his ware: so by the life of the Prince is measured the whole common weale. Many sorowes endureth the woman in nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing a waywerde childe, great trauaile taketh a scholemaister in teaching an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towarde scholler, much paine taketh an officer in gouerning a multitude ouergreate: howe greate than is the paine and peril, whereunto I offer my selfe, in takinge vpon me to order the life of such a one, vpon whose life hangeth all the good state of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale. For Princes and great Lords, ought of vs to be serued, and not offended: we ought to exhort them, not to vexe them: we ought to entreate them, not to rebuke them: we ought to aduise them, and not to defame them: finally I say, that right simple recken I that surgiō, which with the same plaisters he layed to a hard héele, séeketh to
<pb facs="5"/>
cure the tender eyes. I meane by this cōparison, that my purpose is not to tel princes, and noble men in this booke what they be, but to warne them what they ought to be: not to tell them what they doe, but to aduise them what they ought to doe. For that noble man which will not amende his lyfe for remorse of his owne conscience, I doe thinke that he wil amende it for the writing of my penne. <hi>Paulus diaconus</hi> the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer in the second booke of his commentaries, sheweth an antiquitie right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to remember, and also pleasaunt to reade: Although in dede to the hinderaunce of my selfe I shall reherse it. It is, as of the henne, who by longe scraping on the dong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, discouereth the knife that shall cut hir owne throte. Thus was the case. <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> the moste renowmed Prince and captayne of <hi>Carthage</hi> (after he was vainquished by thaduenturous <hi>Scipio</hi>) fled into <hi>Asia</hi> to kinge <hi>Antiochus,</hi> a Prince then liuinge of great vertue, who receiued him into his realme, tooke him into his protectiō, and right honourably enterteyned him in his house. And certes king <hi>Antiochus</hi> did herein, as a pitefull Prince: for what can more beautifie the honor of a Prince than to succor nobilitie in their nedefull estate. These two Princes vsed diuers exercises to spende the time honorably, &amp; thus they diuided tyme. Sometime to hunt in the mountaines, otherwhile to disporte them in the fieldes, oft to vewe their armies: But mostly, they wente to the scholes to heare the Philosophers. And truly they did like wise &amp; skilfull men. For there is no hower in a daye otherwise so well employed, as in hearinge a wise pleasaunt tonged man. There was at a time in <hi>Ephesus</hi> a famous philosopher called <hi>Phormio,</hi> which openly red and taught the people of that realme. And one day as these twoo Princes came into the schoole, the philosopher <hi>Phormio</hi> chaunged the matter whereupon be red, and of a sodayne began to talke of the meanes and wayes that Princes ought to vse in warre, &amp; of thorder to be kepte in geuing battaile. Such, so straunge, and high phrased was the matter which he talked of, that not onely they merueiled which neuer before sawe him: but euen those also that of longe tyme had dayly hearde him. For herein curious and flourisshing wittes shewe their excellency, in that they neuer wante fresh mater to entreate vpon. Greatly gloried the king <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> that this philosopher (in presence of this straunge prince) had so excellentlye spoken, so that straungers might vnderstand he had his realme stored with wise mē. For couragious and noble princes esteme nothing so precious, as to haue men valiāt to defend their frontiers: and also wise to gouerne their commō weales. The lecture<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, king <hi>Antiochus</hi> demaunded of the prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> howe he liked the talke of the philosopher <hi>Phormio?</hi> to whome <hi>Hannibal</hi> stoutely aunswered, and in his aunswere shewed him self to be of that stoutnes he was the same day, whā he wanne the great battayle at <hi>Cannas.</hi> For although noble harted and couragious princes lose all their estates and realmes: yet they will neuer confesse their hartes to be ouerthrowen nor vaynquisshed. And these were the words that at that time <hi>Hannibal</hi> said. Thou shalt vnderstande kinge <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that I haue séene diuers dotinge olde men, yet I neuer sawe a more dootarde foole than <hi>Phormio,</hi> whom thou causest such a great philosopher. For the greatest kinde of foly is, whan a man that hath but a little vaine science, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth to teach not those which haue only science, but also such as haue most certeine experience. Tel me (kinge <hi>Antiochus</hi>) what harte can brooke with pacience, or what tonge can suffer with silence, to sée a sely man (as this philosopher is) nourished all his life time in a corner of <hi>Grece,</hi> studieng philosophie, to presume (as he hath done) to talke before the prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> of the affaires of warre, as though he had bene either lorde of <hi>Affrike,</hi> or captayne of <hi>Rome?</hi> Certes he either full little knoweth him self, or els but little estemeth vs. For it appeareth by his vaine words, he would seme
<pb facs="5"/>
to know more in matters of warre, by that he hath red in bookes: than doth <hi>Hannibal</hi> by the sundry and great battayles which he hath fought in the fieldes. O king <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> how far and how great is the difference, betwene the state of philosophers, &amp; the state of captaynes: betwene the skill to reade in schole, and the knowledge to rule an armie, betwene the science that these wise men haue in bookes, and thexperience that thothers haue in warre: betwene their skil to write with the penne, and ours to fight with the sword, betwene one that for his pastime is set round with deskes of bookes, and an other in perill of life compassed with troupes of enemies. For many there are which with great eloquence, in blasing dedes done in warres, can vse their tongs: but few are those that at the brunt haue hartes to aduenture their liues. This sely philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher neuer saw man of warre in the field, neuer saw one army of men discomfeited by an other, neuer heard the terrible trumpet sound to the horrible &amp; cruel slaughter of men, neuer saw the treasons of some, nor vnderstode the cowardnes of other, neuer saw how fewe they be that fight, nor how many there are that ronne away. Finally I say, as it is semely for a philosopher and a learned man to praise the profites of peace: euē so it is in his mouth a thing vncomely to prate of the perils of warre. If this phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher hath sene no one thing with his eyes that he hath spoken, but onely red them in sondry bokes: let him recounte them to such as haue neither sene nor red them. For warlike feates are better learned in the bloudy fields of <hi>Afrike,</hi> than in the beautifull scholes of <hi>Grece.</hi> Thou knowest right wel (king <hi>Antiochus</hi>) y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> for the space of. 36. yeres I had continuall and daungerous warres, aswell in <hi>Italy</hi> as in <hi>Spayne,</hi> in which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune did not fauor me (as is alwaies her maner to vse those, which by great stoutnes &amp; manhodde enterprise things high and of much difficultie) a witnes wherof thou séest me heare, who before my berde began to grow, was serued: &amp; nowe whan it is hore, I my selfe begin to serue. I sweare vnto the by the God Mars, (kinge <hi>Antiochus</hi>) that if any man did aske me how he should vse and behaue him selfe in warre, I would not answere him one word. For they are things that are learned by experiēce of déedes, &amp; not by prating in words. Although princes begin warres by iustice, and folow them with wisedome, yet the ende standeth vpon fickle fortune and not of force, nor policie. Diuers other things <hi>Hannibal</hi> saide vnto <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who so wil sée thē, let him reade the <hi>Apothemes</hi> of <hi>Plutarche.</hi> This example (noble prince) tēdeth rather to this end, to condempne my boldnes, &amp; not to cōmende my enterprise, saying that thaffaires of the cōmon wealth be as vnknowen to me, as the daungers of the warres were to <hi>Phor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio.</hi> Your maiestie may iustely say vnto me, that I being a poore simple man (brought vp a great while in a rude countrey) do greatly presume to describe, howe so puissant a prince as your highnes ought to gouerne him self and his realme. For of trueth the more ignoraunt a man is of the troubles and alteracions of the worlde, the better he shalbe coūted in the sight of God. The estate of princes is to haue great traines about them, &amp; the estate of religious men, is to be solitarye: for the seruaunt of God ought to be alwayes voyde from vaine thoughtes, &amp; to be euer accompanied with holy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The estate of princes is alwayes vnquiet: but the state of the religious is to be enclosed. For otherwise, he aboue all others may be called an <hi>Apostata,</hi> that hath his body in the sell, and his hart in the market place. To princes it is necessary to speake &amp; common with all men: but for the religious it is not decente to be conuersaunt with the world. For solitary men (if they do as they ought) should occupy their hands in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, their body in fasting, their tonge in prayer, &amp; their harte in contemplacion. The estate of princes for the most part is employed to warre: but the state of the religious is to desire &amp; procure peace. For if the prince would study to passe his boundes, and by
<pb facs="6"/>
battaile to shed the bloud of his enemies: the religious ought to shede teares, &amp; pray to God for his sinnes. O that it pleased almighty God, as I know what my boūden du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is in my hart, so that he would giue me grace to accomplish the same in my dedes. Alas, whan I ponder with my selfe the waightines of my matter, my penne through slothe and negligence is ready to fall out of my hand, &amp; I half minded to leaue of mine enterprise. My intent is to speake against my selfe in this case. For albeit men maye know thaffaires of princes by experience: yet they shall not know howe to speake nor write thē but by science. Those which ought to counsaile princes, those which ought to refourme the life of princes &amp; that ought to instruct them, ought to haue a clere iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, an vpright minde, their words aduisedly considered, their doctrine holesom, &amp; their life without suspiciō. For who so wil speake of high things, hauing no experēce of them: is like vnto a blinde man that woulde leade &amp; teach him the way, which séeth better thā he him self. This is the sentēce of <hi>Xenophon</hi> the great which saith. There is nothing harder in this life than to know a wise mā. And the reason which he gaue was this. That a wise man cānot be knowen but by an other wise mā, we maye ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this which <hi>Xenophon</hi> saieth: that as one wise man cannot be knowen but by an other wise man: so lykewise it is requisite that he should be, or haue ben a prince, which should write of the life of a prince. For he that hath ben a mariner, &amp; sailled but one yere on the sea: shall be able to giue better counsaile and aduise, than he that hath dwelled .x. yers in the hauen. <hi>Xenophō</hi> wrote a boke touching the institucion of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; bringeth in <hi>Cambises</hi> the kyng, how he taughte, and spake vnto kyng <hi>Cirus</hi> hys sonne. And he wrote an other booke likewise of the arte of cheualrye, and brought in kyng Phillip, how he oughte to teache his sonne Alexander to fight. For the philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers thought that writting of no auctoritie, that was not intituled &amp; set forth vnder the name of those princes, which had experience of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they wrate. O if an aged prince would with his penne (if not with worde of mouth) declare, what misfortunes haue happened sins the first time he began to reigne, howe disobedient his subiectes haue ben vnto him, what griefe his seruauntes haue wrought against him, what vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes his frendes haue shewed him, what subtile wiles his enemies haue vsed towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des hym, what daunger his person hath escaped, what tarres haue ben in his palace, what faultes they haue said against him, how many times they haue deceiued straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, finally what grefes he hath had by day, &amp; what sorrowful sighes he hath fetched in the night: truly I thinke (&amp; in my thought I am nothing deceaued) that if a prynce wold declare vnto vs his hole lif, &amp; that he wold particularly shew vs euery thing, we wold both wōder at that body which had so much suffered: &amp; also we wold be offended with that hart that had so greatly dissembled. It is a troublesom thing a daungerous thing, &amp; an insolent and proud entreprise, for a man to take vpon him with a penne to gouerne y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cōmon wealth, &amp; with a prince to reasō of his life. For in dede men are not perswaded to liue wel by faire words, but by vertuous dedes And therfore not w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> out cause I say y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he is not wise, but very arrogāt, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> dare presume vnasked to giue a prīce counsail. For princes in many thinges haue their mindes occupied, &amp; haughtely bent, &amp; som of them also are affectioned, &amp; where as we (peraduenture) thinke to haue them mercifull, we finde thē more angry &amp; heauy against vs. For counsaile doth more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me than profite, if the giuer therof be not very wise, &amp; he also which receiueth it very pacient. I haue not ben a prince to know the trauailes of princes, nor am not as presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to counsel princes: yet I was so bolde to cōpile this booke, it was not vppon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption to counsaile a prince, so much as by an humble sorte to giue mine aduise.</p>
   <p>For to giue counsel, I confesse I haue no credite: but to giue theim aduise, it suffiseth
<pb facs="6"/>
me to be a subiecte. What the order is that I haue taken in this boke, how profitable it is to all men, &amp; how vnpleasaunt to no man, how holsome &amp; profound doctrine in it is conteined, &amp; how the histories be herin applied; I wil not that my pen do write, but they thē selues shal iudge which shal reade this worke. We se it oft com to passe that diuers bokes do lose their estimation, not for that they are not very good &amp; excellēt: but because the auctour hath ben to presumptuous &amp; vainglorious. For in my opinion, for a man to praise his owne writinges much, is nothing els but to giue men occasion to speake euil both of him &amp; of his worke. Let no man thinke that I haue written thys which is written, without great aduisement and examination. I do confesse before the redemer of the whole world, that I haue cōsumed so many yers to seke what I shold write, that this .ii. yers one day hath scarsely escaped me, wherin my pen hath not don his dutie to write or correct in this worke. I confesse that I toke great paine in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, for of trueth it hath ben written twise with mine owne hand, and thrise with another mans hand. I confesse I haue red &amp; searched in diuers &amp; sondrie partes, many and good strange bokes, to thend I might finde good and pleasant doctrine, &amp; besydes that I trauailed much to set &amp; apply the histories to the purpose. For it is an vnseme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing to apply an history without a purpose. I had great respecte in that I was not so briefe in my writinges, that a man might note me to be obscure: nor yet in anye thing so long, that a man shold sclaunder me with to much talke. For al the excellēcie of writing consisteth, where many &amp; goodly sentences are declared in few &amp; apte wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: For oft times the long stile is lothsom &amp; tedious both to the hearers &amp; readers. <hi>Nero</hi> y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> emperour was in loue with a lady in <hi>Rome</hi> named <hi>Pompeia,</hi> y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (to his fātasie) exceded all other. In the end partely w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> intreaty, partely w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> money &amp; presētes, he obteined of her y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> he desired. For in this case of loue, wher prayers &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities be paciētly hard, &amp; resistance doth lacke: The inordinate loue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <hi>Nero</hi> bare to <hi>Pompeia,</hi> proceded of the yelow heres she had, which wer of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> colour of amber, &amp; in prayse of them he cōpiled diuers &amp; sondry songes in heroical meter, &amp; with an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sang thē himself in her presence. <hi>Nero</hi> was a sage prince, wise, &amp; excellētly well learned in the latin tong, &amp; also a good musiciā: yet Plutarche in his boke of the gests of noble womē (to declare y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vaniti &amp; lightnes of <hi>Nero</hi>) reciteth this history: &amp; describīg <hi>Pōpeia</hi> said, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> her body was smal, her fingers lōg, her mouth proper, her eye lyds thin her nose sōwhat sharpe, her téeth smal, her lips red, her neck white, her forhead brod, &amp; finally, her eies great &amp; rowlin, her brest large &amp; wel propocioned, what thinke you wold <hi>Nero</hi> haue don if he had so affectionatly set his fātasy vpō al other her beautiful properties, sins y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> for the loue alonly of her yelow locks, he was depriued both of his wisdom, &amp; also sences. For vain &amp; light mē loue cōmēly not y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which reasō cōmaūdeth: but y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which their appetite desireth. The loue of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> emperor encreased w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> foly so much, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> not only he coūted seuerally al y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> héeres y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his louer <hi>Pōpeia</hi> had on her head, but also gaue to euery heere a proper name, &amp; in praise of euery one of thē made a song, in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> this effeminat prince spēt more time in bāketting &amp; plaieng w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his louer <hi>Pō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia:</hi> thā he did to reforme &amp; amend y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> faultes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cōmon welth. Yea his foly so much surmoūted al reasō, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he cōmaunded a cōbe of gold to be made, &amp; therw<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he himself cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her yelow locks. And if it chaūsed y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> any one here in kemīg fel of, he by &amp; by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to be set in gold, offred it vp in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> tēple to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> goddes <hi>Iuno.</hi> For it was an anciēt cu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stome amōg y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Romains, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the things which they entierly loued (whether it wer good or euil) should be offred vp to their gods. And whan it was once knowen y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <hi>Nero</hi> was so in loue with these héeres of <hi>Pompeia,</hi> which wer of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> colour of amber, al the ladies endeuoured thē selues, not only to make artificially their here of that colour: but also to were their garmentes, and other attyres of the same colour, in somuche that bothe
<pb facs="7"/>
men and women did vse collers of amber, brooches &amp; ringes set with amber, &amp; al their other Iewels were of amber. For alwayes it hath ben sene, &amp; euer shallbe, that those things wherunto the prince is most addicted, the people folow, &amp; aboue al other couet the same. Before this Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> plaied this light part in <hi>Rome,</hi> the amber stone was had in little estimacion, &amp; after that he set so muche by it, there was no precious stone in <hi>Rome</hi> so much estemed. Yea &amp; furthermore the marchant gained nothinge so much (whether it were in gold or silke) as he did in the amber stones, nor brought any kind of marchaundise to <hi>Rome</hi> more precious, or more vendible than that was. I doe meruelle at this vanitie, forasmuch as the children of the world do loue, desire, &amp; labor more to folow the straunge foly of an other: than to furnish &amp; supply their own proper necessitie. Therefore retourning againe to my purpose (most excellent prince) by this example you may coniecture, what I would say, that is, that if this writing were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted vnto princes, I am assured it woulde be refused of no man: And if any man would slaunderously talke of it, he durst not, remembring that your maiestie hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it. For those things which princes take to their custody, we are boūd to defend, &amp; it is not lawfull for vs to diminish their credite. Suppose that this my worke were not so profound as it might be of this matter, nor with such eloquēce set out as many other bokes are: yet I dare be bolde to say, that the prince shal take more profit by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this worke, than <hi>Nero</hi> did by his loue <hi>Pompeia.</hi> For in the end, by reading and studieng good bookes, men tourne, &amp; become sage and wise: and by keping il company, they are counted fooles &amp; vitious. My meaning is not, nor I am not so importunat and vnreasonable, to perswade princes that they should so fauour my doctrine, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> it should be in like estimacion now in these partes, as the amber was there in <hi>Rome.</hi> But that which only I require &amp; demaund is, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the time which <hi>Nero</hi> spēt in singing &amp; telling y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> héeres of his loue <hi>Pompeia,</hi> should now be employed to redresse the wrongs &amp; faultes of the common wealth. For the noble &amp; worthy prince ought to employ the least part of the day in the recreation of his person. After he hath giuē audience to his counsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, to the embassadours, to the great Lordes &amp; prelates, to the riche and poore, to his owne countrey men and straungers, &amp; after that he be come into his priuy chamber, then my desire is that he would reade this treatise, or some other better than this: for in princes chambers oftentimes those of the priuie chāber and other their familiares loase great time, in reciting vayne and trifling maters and of small profit, the which might better be spent in reading some good booke. In al worldly affaires that we do, &amp; in al our bookes which we compile, it is a greate matter to be fortunate. For to a man that fortune doth not fauour, diligence (without doute) can little auaile. Admitte that fortune were against me, in that this my worke should be acceptable vnto your maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, without comparison it should be a great grief &amp; dishonor vnto me, to tel you what should be good to reade for your pastime, if on thother parte you woulde not profite by mine aduise. For my mind was not only to make this booke, to the end princes should reade it for a pastime, but to that end (in recreating thē selues) somtimes they mought thereby also take profit. <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> in the. 12. chapter of his thirde booke entituled <hi>De nocte attica,</hi> said that amongs al the schollers which the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> had, one was named <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> a man amongest the Gréekes moste highly estemed &amp; of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes</hi> greatly desired. Because he was in his liuing seuere, and in his tonge and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine a very sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ire. If <hi>Demosthenes</hi> had come in the time of <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tiraunt, whan <hi>Grecia</hi> was peopled with tirau tes, and that he had not bene in <hi>Platoes</hi> tyme, when it was replenished with Philosophers, truelye <hi>Demosthenes</hi> had bene as cleare a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne in <hi>Asia,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> the greate was in <hi>Europe.</hi> Greate good happe hath a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

man to be borne in one age, more then in any other. I meane, that if a valiaunt Knight come in the tyme of a couragious and stout prince, such one truly shalbe este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and set in great authoritie. But if he come in the time of an other effeminate and couetous prince, he shall not be regarded at al. For he wil rather esteme one that wil augment his treasour at home: than him that can vanquishe his enemies in battayle abrode. So likewise it chaunseth to wise and vertuous men, which if they come in the time of vertuous and learned princes, are estemed and honoured: But if they come in tyme of vayne and vitious princes, they make small accounte of them. For it is an auncient custome amonge vanities children, not to honor him which to the common wealth is most profitable: but him whiche to the prince is most acceptable. The ende why this is spoken <hi>(Most pusant Prince)</hi> is because the twoo renoumed philosophers were in <hi>Grece</hi> both at one time: and because the diuine philosopher <hi>Plato</hi> was so much estemed and made of, they did not greatly esteme the philosopher <hi>Demosthenes.</hi> For the eminēt and high renoume of one alone, diminisheth the fame &amp; estimacion (amōg the people) of many. Although <hi>Demosthenes</hi> was such a one in dede as we haue sayd, that is to witte, eloquent of tonge, ready of memory, sharpe and quicke of witte, in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing seuere, sure and profitable in geuing of counsaile, in renoume excellent, in yeres very auncient, and in philosophie a man right wel learned: Yet he refused not to goe to the scholes of <hi>Plato</hi> to heare morall philosophie. He that shall reade this thinge or heare it, ought not to merueile, but to folow it, and to profit likewise in the same: that is to vnderstande, that one philosopher learned of an other, and one wise mā suffered him selfe to be taught of an other. For knowledge is of such a qualitie, that the more a man knoweth, dayly there encreaseth in him a desire to knowe more. All thinges of this life (after they haue bene tasted and possessed) cloyeth a man, wearieth and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth him, true science onely excepted, which neuer doth cloy, weary, nor troble them. And if it happen we wery any, it is but the eyes which are weried with lokinge and reading: and not the spirite with féeling and tastinge. Many Lordes and my familiar friendes doe aske me how it is possible I shoulde liue with so much study? And I also demaunde of them, how it is possible they should liue in such continuall idelnes? For considering the prouocacion and assaultes of the flesh, the daungers of the world, the temptacions of the deuil, the treasons of enemies, &amp; importunities of friendes: what hart can suffer so great and continual trauaile, but onely in reading &amp; comforting him selfe in bookes? Truely a man ought to haue more compassion of a simple ignoraunte man, than of a poore man. For there is no greater pouerty vnto a man, than to lacke wisdome whereby he should know how to gouerne him selfe. Therefore folowinge our matter the case was such, one day <hi>Demosthenes</hi> (going to the schole of <hi>Plato</hi>) sawe in the market place of <hi>Athens</hi> a greate assembly of people, which were hearing a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher newely come vnto that place: &amp; he spake not this without a cause, that there was a greate companye of people assembled. For that naturallye the common people are desirous to heare new and straunge things. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> asked what philosopher he was after whome so many people went? and when it was aunswered him that it was <hi>Calistratus</hi> the philosopher, a man which in eloquence was very swéete and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt: he determined to staie and heare him, to thende he woulde knowe whither it were true or vayne that the people tolde hym. For oftentymes it happeneth, that amonge the people some gette them selues greate fame, more by fauour, than by good learninge. The difference betwixte the diuine Philosopher <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Calistratus</hi> was, in that <hi>Plato</hi> was exceadinglye well learned, and the other very eloquente: and thus it came to passe, that in liuinge they folowed <hi>Plato:</hi> and in eloquence of speache
<pb facs="8"/>
they did imitate <hi>Callistratus.</hi> For there are diuers menne sufficiently well learned, whiche haue profounde doctrine, but they haue no waye nor meanes to teache it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> hearing <hi>Calistratus</hi> but ones, was so far in loue with his doctrine, that he neuer after hearde <hi>Plato,</hi> nor entred into his scole, for to harken to any of his lectures. At which newes diuers of the sages of <hi>Grecia</hi> marueiled much, seing that the tonge of a man was of such power, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it had put all their doctrine to scilence. Although I apply not this example, I doute not but your maiestie vnderstandeth to what end I haue declared it. And moreouer I say, that although Princes haue in their chambers bookes so well corrected, and men in their courtes so wel learned, that they may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely kéepe thestimacion which <hi>Plato</hi> had in his schole: yet in this case it shoulde not displease me, that the difference that was betwen <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Calistratus,</hi> should be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Princes and this booke. God forbidde, that by this sayeng men should thinke I meane to disswade Princes from the company of the sage men, or from reading of any other booke but this: for in so doinge, <hi>Plato</hi> shoulde be reiected which was diuine: and <hi>Calistratus</hi> embraced which was more wordly. But my desire is, that sometime they would vse to reade this booke a little, for it may chaunce they shal finde some holsome counsayle therein, which at one tyme or other may profite them in their affaires. For the good &amp; careful Princes ought to graffe in their memory y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wise sayings which they reade, &amp; forget the canekred iniuries &amp; wronges which are done thē. I do not speake it without a cause, that he that readeth this my writing shall finde in it some profitable counsaile. For all that which hath bene writen in it, hath bene in euery worde &amp; sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with great diligence so wel weyed, and corrected, as if therein onely consisted, the effecte of the whole worke. The greatest griefe that learned menne feele in their writing is, to thinke, that if there be many that view their doings, to take profit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: they shall perceiue that there are as many moe, which occupy their tonges in the sclaunder and disprayse thereof. In publishinge this my worke, I haue obserued the maner of them that plant a new gardein, wherein they set Roses which giue a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt sauour to the nose, they make faire grene plattes to delight the eyes, they graft fruitful trées to be gathered with the handes, but in the end as I am a man, so haue I written it for menne, and consequently as a man I may haue erred: for there is not at this daye so persite a painter, but another will presume to amende his worke. Those which diligētly wil endeuour themselues to reade this booke, shall find in it very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable counsailes, very liuely lawes, good reasons, notable sayinges, sentences very profound, worthy examples, &amp; histories very ancient. For to say the trueth, I had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect in that the doctrine was auncient, &amp; the stile new. And albeit your maiesty be the greatest Prince of all Princes, and I the least of all your subiectes, you ought not for my base condicion to disdayne to cast your eyes vppon this booke, nor to thinke scorne to put that thing in proofe which semeth good. For a good letter ought to be nothing the lesse estemed, although it be written with an euill penne. I haue sayde, and will say, that Princes and greate Lordes, the stouter, the richer, and the greater of renoume they be, the greater nede they haue of all men of good knowledge about them, to coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seil them in their affaires, and of good bookes which they maye reade: and this they ought to do aswel in prosperitie as in aduersitie, to the end that their affaires in time conueniente, may be debated and redressed. For otherwise, they shoulde haue time to repent, but no leasure to amende. <hi>Plinie, Marcus Varro, Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Macrobius,</hi> (which were historiographers no lesse graue than true) were at greate controuersie, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge what thinges were most autentike in a common weale, and at what time they were of all menne accepted. <hi>Seneca</hi> in a pistle he wrote to <hi>Lucillus,</hi> praysed without
<pb facs="8"/>
cessing the common wealth of the <hi>Rhodiens,</hi> in the which (with much a doe) they bent them selues altogether to kepe one selfe thinge, and after they had therupon agréed, they kept and mainteyned it inuiolately. The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the sixte booke entituled <hi>De legibus,</hi> ordeyned and commaunded that if any citizen did inuente any new thing, which neuer before was reade, nor harde of, the inuentour thereof should first practise the same for the space of .10. yeares in his owne house, before it was brought into the common wealth, and before it shold be published vnto the people, to thende if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencion were good, it should be profitable vnto him: and if it were noughte, that than the daunger and hurte therof should lighte onely on him. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his <hi>Apothemes</hi> saith, that <hi>Licurgus</hi> vpō greauous penalties did prohibite, that none should be so har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye in his common wealthe to goe wanderinge into straunge countreys, nor that he shoulde be so hardy to admit any straungers to come into his house: and the cause why this lawe was made, was to thende straungers shoulde not bringe into their houses thinges straunge, and not accustomed in their common wealthe, and that they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing through straunge contreis, shoulde not learne newe customes. The presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of menne now a dayes is so great, and the consideracion of the people so small, that what so euer a man can speake he speaketh, what so euer he can inuente he doth inuente, what he would he doth write, and it is no marueill, for there is no man that will speake againste them. Nor the common people in this case are so lighte, that amonges them you may dayly sée new deuises, and whether it hurt or profit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth they force not. If there came at this day a vayne man amonges the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which was neuer sene nor hearde of before, if he be any thing subtile, I aske you but this question: shal it not be easy for him to speake and inuente what he listeth, to set forth what he pleaseth, to perswade that which to him séemeth good, and al his sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enges to be beleued? Truly it is a wonderfull thinge, and no lesse sclaunderous, that one shoulde be sufficient to peruerte the sences and iudgementes of all, and all not able to represse the lightnes and vanitie of one. Things that are newe and not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed, neither princes ought to allowe, nor yet the people to vse. For a newe thinge oughte no lesse to be examined and considered, before it be brought into the common wealth: than the greate doutes whiche aryse in mennes myndes. <hi>Rufinus</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of his seconde booke of his apologie reproueth greately the Egyptians because they were to full of deuises, and blamed much the Grecians because they were to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in speaking fine wordes: &amp; aboue all other he greately prayseth the <hi>Romaynes,</hi> for that they were very harde of belife, &amp; that they scarcely alweyes credited the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Grekes, and because they were discrete in admitting the inuencions of the Egyptians. The author hath reason to prayse thone, and disprayse thother. For it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth of a light iudgement, to credite al the thinges that a man heareth, and to doe al thinges that he séeth. Returninge therefore now to our matter. <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> sayde there were .5. thinges in the worlde very harde to bringe in, whereof none (after they were commonly accepted) were euer lost or forgottē, for euen as things vainely begō, are easely left of: so things with great feare accepted, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> much diligence are obserued.</p>
   <p>The first thing that chiefly thoroughout al the world was accepted, was al men to liue togethers: that is to say, they should make places, townes, villages, cities &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon wealthes. For according to the saying of <hi>Plato,</hi> the first &amp; best inuentours of the cōmon welth, were y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> antes, which (according to thexperiēce we sée) do liue togethers, trauaile togethers, do go togethers, &amp; also for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> winter thei make prouisiō togethers, &amp; furthermore none of these antes do geue thē selues to any priuat thing, but al theirs is brought into their cōmō welth. It is a meruelous thing to behold the cōmō welth

of the antes, how netely they trim their hilles, to beholde howe they swepe away the graine when it is wet, and how they drye it whan they fele any moisture, to beholde how they come from their worke, and how the one doth not hurt the other: And to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold also how they doe reioyce the one in the others trauaile, and that which is to our greatest confusion is, that if it come so to passe, 50000. antes will liue in a little hillocke togethers: and two men onely cannot liue in peace and concorde in a cōmon wealth. Woulde to God the wisedome of men were so great to kepe them selues, as the prudence of the antes is to liue. Whan the world came to a certayne age, &amp; mens wittes waxed more fine, than tirantes sprange vp which oppressed the poore, theues that robbed the riche, rebelles that robbed the quiet, murderers that slew the pacient, the ydell that eate the swete of other mens browes: all the which thinges considered by thē which were vertuous, they agréed to assemble &amp; liue together, that therby they might preserue the good, and withstande the wicked. <hi>Macrobius</hi> affirmeth this in the seconde booke of <hi>Scipions</hi> dreame saying, that couetousnes and auarice was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test cause why men inuented the commō wealth. <hi>Plinie</hi> in the seuenth booke .56. chap. sayth, the first that made small assembles, were the <hi>Atheniens:</hi> and the first that builte great cities, were the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The seconde thinge that was accepted throughout all the worlde, were the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whiche we reade, whereby we take profite in writinge. Accordinge whereunto <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> saith, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> prayse them selues and say, that they did inuente them: and the <hi>Assyrians</hi> affirme the contrary, and sweare that they were shewed firste of all amongst them. <hi>Plinie</hi> in the seuenth booke saith, that in the first age, there was in the alphabet no more than 16. letters, &amp; that greate <hi>Palamedes</hi> at the siege of <hi>Troye,</hi> added other .4. and Aristotle saithe, that immediatly after the beginninge there were founde .18. letters. And that afterwardes <hi>Palamedes</hi> did adde but .2. and so there were 20. and that the Philosopher <hi>Epicarmus</hi> dyd adde other two, which were .22. it is no great matter, whether the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> or the <hi>Assyrians</hi> first founde the letters. But I say and affirme, that it was a thing necessary for a common wealth, and also for then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of man knowledge. For if we had wanted letters, and writings, we could haue had no knowledge of the tyme past, nor yet our posteritie coulde haue ben aduertised what was done in our dayes. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the second booke entituled <hi>De viris illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> in the seuenth booke and .56. chapiter, doe greately prayse <hi>Pirotas,</hi> by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he firste founde the fier in a flinte stone. They greatly commended <hi>Protheus,</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he inuented harneis, and they highly extolled <hi>Panthasuca,</hi> bicause she inuented the hatchet. They praysed <hi>Citheus,</hi> because he inuented the bowe, and the arrowes. they greatelye praysed <hi>Pheniseus,</hi> because he inuented the crosse bowe and the slinge. They highly praysed the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> because they inuented the helmet, the spere, and the sword. They commende those of <hi>Thessalia,</hi> bicause they inuented the combate on horseback, and they commende those of <hi>Affrike,</hi> because they inuented the fight by sea. But I doe prayse, and continually will magnifie, not those which founde the arte of fightinge, and inuented weapons to procure warre, for to kill his neighbour: but those which found letters, for to learne science, &amp; to make peace betwene two princes. What difference there is to wet the penne with inke, and to paynte the spere with bloud: to be enuironned with bookes, or to be laden with weapons. To study how eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ought to liue, or els to goe priuely and robbe in the warres, &amp; to lie in waight to kill his neighbour: There is none of so vaine a iudgement, but wil praise more the speculation of the sciences, than the practise of the warre. Because that in the end, he that learneth sciences, learneth nought els but how he and others ought to lyue. And
<pb facs="9"/>
he that learneth warlike feates, learneth none other thinge than howe to sley his neighbour, and to destroye others.</p>
   <p>The thirde thinge, that equally of all was accepted, were lawes. For admit that al men now liued togethesr in common, if they would not be subiect one to another, there woulde contention arise amongest them, for that accordinge to the sayinge of <hi>Plato,</hi> there is no greater token of the distruction of a common weale, than whan many rulers are chosen therein. <hi>Plinie</hi> in his seuenth booke .56. chapter sayth, that a Quéene called <hi>Ceres,</hi> was the first that taught them to sowe in the fieldes, to grinde in milles, to paste and bake in ouens, and also she was the first that taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to liue according to the lawe. And by the meanes of all these thinges our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers called her a goddesse. Since that time we neuer haue sene heard nor red of any realme, or other nation (aswell straunge as barbarous) what so euer they were, but haue had lawes whereby the good were fauoured, and also institutions of greuous paynes wherewith the wicked were punished. Although truely I had rather, and it were better, that the good shoulde loue reason: than feare the lawe. I speake of those which leaue to doe euill workes, for feare onely of fallinge into the punishementes appointed for euill doers. For although men approue that which they doe, yet God condemneth that which they desire. <hi>Seneca</hi> in an epistle he wrot to his friend <hi>Lucille,</hi> sayde these wordes. Thou writest vnto me <hi>Lucille,</hi> that those of the yle of <hi>Scicili,</hi> haue caried a great quantitie of corne into Spaine, and into <hi>Affrike,</hi> the which thing was forbidden by a Romayne lawe, and therefore they haue deserued greuous puni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nowe because thou arte vertuous, thou mayst teache me to do wel, and I that am olde wil teach the to say, wel: &amp; this is because that amongest wyse and vertuous men it is enoughe to saye, that the lawe commaundeth, appointeth, and suffereth this thing, but in as much as it is agreing with reason. For the crowne of the good, is reason, and the scourge of the wicked, is the lawe.</p>
   <p>The fourth thing that commonly through the worlde amongest all men was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, was the barbars. And let no man take this thing in mockery. For if they doe reade <hi>Plinie</hi> in the .59. chapiter the seuenth booke, they shal finde for a truth, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines wer in <hi>Rome</hi> .454. yeres without pouling or shauing y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hayres of the beard of any man. <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> said, that <hi>Publius Ticinius,</hi> was the firste that brought the barbers from <hi>Scicili</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> But admitte it were so or otherwise: yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge there was a greate contention amonge the Romaynes. For they sayde, they thought it a rashe thinge for a man to committe his life to the courtesie of another. <hi>Dionisius</hi> the <hi>Siracusan</hi> neuer trusted his beard with any barbor, but whā his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were very little, they clipped his beard with sisers: but after they became great, he woulde not put his trust in them to trimme his bearde, but he him selfe did burne it with the shales of nuttes. This <hi>Dionisius Siracusan,</hi> was demanded why he would not trust any barbours w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his beard. He answered, because I know that ther be some which wil geue more to the barbor to take away my life, than I wil giue to trimme my beard. <hi>Plinie</hi> in the seuenth booke saith, that the great <hi>Scipio</hi> called <hi>African,</hi> and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Emperour Augustus, wer y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first that caused them in Rome to shaue their beards. And I thinke thend why <hi>Plinie</hi> spake these things, was to exalte these twoo princes which had as greate courage to suffer the raysours touche their throtes: as thone for to fight against <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Afrike,</hi> and thother against <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> in <hi>Scicili.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The fifte thing which cōmonly through the world was accepted, were the dialles and clockes, which the Romaines wanted a long tyme. For as <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> say, the Romaines were without clockes in Rome, for the space of .595. yeres.
<pb facs="10"/>
The curious hystoriographers declare thre maner of dialles that were in olde time that is to say, dialles of the houres, dialles of the sonne, and dialls of the water. The dialle of the son <hi>Aneximenides Millesius</hi> inuented, who was great <hi>Animandras</hi> scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler The dialle of the water. <hi>Scipio Nasica</hi> inuented, and the Diall of houres, one of the scholers of <hi>Thales</hi> the Phylosopher inuented Of all these antiquities whyche were brought into <hi>Rome,</hi> none of them were so acceptable to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> as the dialles were, wherby they measured the daye by the houre. For before they could not saye, we wil ryse at .vii. of the clocke, we will dine at .x. we will see one thother at .xii. at .i. we will doe that we oughte to doe. But before they sayde, after the sonne is vp we wil doe such a thinge, and before it goe downe we wyll doe that we ought to doe. Thoccasion of declaryng vnto you these .v. antiquities in this preamble, was to no other intente, but to call my booke the Dial of Prynces. The name of the booke veing newe (as it is) maye make the learning that is therein greatly to be estemed.</p>
   <p>God forbyd that I should be so bolde to saye, they haue ben so longe time in Spayne without dialles of learning, as they were in <hi>Rome</hi> without the diall of the sonne, the water, and of the houres. For that in Spayne haue ben alwayes men well learned in sciences, and very expert in the warres. By great reason and of greater occasion, the Princes oughte to be commended, the knyghtes, the people, their wittes, and the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitye of their countrey: but yet to all these goodnes, I haue sene manye vnlearned bookes in spayne, which as broken dialles deserue to be cast into the fier to be forged anew. I do not speake it without a cause, that manye bookes deserue to be broken and burnte. For there are so many that without shame and honestie doe set forthe bookes of loue of the worlde, at this daye as boldely, as if they taught theim to dispise and speake euil of the world. It is pitye to see how many dayes and nightes be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in readyng vayne bookes (that is to say) as Orson and Valentine, the Courte of Venus, &amp; the .iiii. sonnes of Amon, and diuerse other vaine bokes, by whose doctrine I dare boldlye say, they passe not the tyme but in perdicion: for they learne not how they oughte to flye vice, but rather what way they may with more pleasour embrace it. This dial of princes is not of sande, nor of the sonne, nor of the houres, nor of the water, but it is the dial of lyfe. For that other dialles serue to know, what houre it is in the nyghte, and what houre it is of the day: but this sheweth and teacheth vs, how we ought to occupye our mindes, and how to order our lyfe. The propertye of other dyalles is, to order thinges publyke: but the nature of this dyal of prynces is, to teache vs how to occupye our selues euery houre, and how to amende our lyfe euery momente. It lytle auayleth to keape the dyalles well, and to see thy subiectes dissolutely without any order, to range in routes, and dayly rayse debate and contention amonge them selues.</p>
