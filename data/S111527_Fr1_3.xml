   <head>To the Right worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
my louing brother, Sir Iohn
Vaughan of Golden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groue,
Knight.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ato of Vtica (as
Plutarch writeth) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
demaunded whom
he loued best, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
his brother then
the other still continuing to aske
him, and who next, he likewise an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
his brother. And so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the third time, he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
his brother. Thrice in like sort
was I ask'd, &amp; yet vnask'd, ask'd of
my selfe, though vnask'd of others,
whether to one or three I would
dedicate this my threefold booke.
<pb facs="3"/>
To this my self vnto my self made
answere: to whō more fitly should
I dedicate my first booke treating
of Vertue, then to my vertuous
brother? to whom my second of a
Familie, then to my familiar bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
to whō my third of Ciuility,
then to my ciuil brother? The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of which points (deare
brother) moued me to present vnto
you alone, and not to three this
Groue of mine, cōformed as nere
as I could, like vnto that golden
groue of the ancient Hesperides.
VVherein I could be said to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
the Philosopher Athenodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
who parted with his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Zeno all his goods, &amp; gaue
vnto him the one half, for what is
more agreeable to nature, thē that
<pb facs="3"/>
one brother should to his power
reciprocally aid another? &amp; what
more prodigious, thē that one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should bee a wolfe vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
this plainly and wisely was
specified by the Greeke poet Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides,
who said: questionlesse he
that loueth not his brother, loueth
neither him, that begat him, nor
her, that hare. And againe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by Antigone in Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:
I must (quoth she) loue my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
better then my sonne, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that hereafter I may very well
haue more sonnes, but, my father
&amp; mother being both dead, neuer
more brethren. Standing, I say,
vpon these termes, &amp; hammering
in my mind on the anuill of our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
loue, I thought it part of my
duty to impart vnto you the iust
<pb facs="4"/>
halfe of my substāce, nay, in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
all my substance, desiring you
withall, that, euē as a skilful Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metriciā
at the games of Olympus
by the bignesse of Hercules foot
gessed of the stature of his whole
body: so by the outward view of
this my triple treatise, you will
measure the willingnesse of mine
inward mind. As for barking sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophants
and enuious caitifes, to
whose controlling check the very
best of all scholers haue bene sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
I passe not for them, namely,
let them make tennis balles of my
bookes, yea, and bandy them quite
away, if they can▪ Onely this is my
wish at this present, that you, most
louing brother, will diligently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
thē ouer, &amp; shelter thē vnder
<pb facs="4"/>
the vaile of your fauourable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
Almighty God (that I may
now ende) giue you your hearts
Christian contentment, while as a
Pilgrime you remaine in this
earthly groue, &amp; make your mind
pliable and ready for the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of that golden and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Groue prepared for the
Godly in the world to come. Frō
Iesus Colledge in Oxford.</p>
