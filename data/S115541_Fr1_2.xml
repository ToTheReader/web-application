   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFULL, <hi>SIR</hi> IOHN WRAY, Knight and Baronet, and to his truly generous Brother, EDVVARD WRAY of <hi>Rycot,</hi> Esq. Lovers and Incouragers of Learning and Piety.</head>

      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the attentive eye may bee as gainefull to the understanding as the listning eare; if the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatious words, which escape the eares pursuit, by that may bee arrested to the doome of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it can scruple at <hi>Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> when the eares credulity sums up with approbation, then may I discharge my selfe, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate censure, of an apologie, for exposing to a more deliberate review of the eye, what posted by the laborynths of the eare with lesse delay. I must confesse, in those forward births of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets (the usuall brats of pregnant impudence) nothing uses to be more legible, than Ignorance, inspir'd by Ambition: where the itch of publike prostitution breakes forth into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Frontispice: and those Characters which the Author fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

to be glorious on the front, the Reader deemes stigmaticall.</p>
   <p>Although my private resolutions to the contrary, have stoop'd to some assaults, and made my weaknesse now as publike as the rest, yet this must be my confidence, that some of my ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious friends have promised to share of the censure, if not as causes, yet as provocations to the delinquency.</p>
   <p>If in the subiect there be any thing satyricall, the patronage to which I have commended it, dare read without any consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous starting at invection. Their observations may throw it at the guilty world, and this shall truly number them in the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the guiltlesse. Innocency is no superecilious Patron, nor expects the manners of an Apologie from those that intrude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its protection. Neverthelesse, I was compell'd to invocate yours, for if I have gained any thing from obscurity, the light of your incouragements have led me to it; and as the Colledge, whereof I am a member, so my owne private duty shall ever prompt me to ranke your name amongst the chiefest of my Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and indevour to make nothing more publike (excepting Gods glory in the good of his Church) then your vertues, and that I am</p>
