   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIAN Reader, when thou takest a view of the bookes already abroad, and daily increasing, as also according to thy measure of grace receiued, doest discerne of and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the weaknesse and insufficiency of too many: I speake not now of those idle and vaine, oh that I might not say, tending to Atheisme and prophanenes; which are rather to be bewailed in a Christian common-weale, than censured: but of those, whose subiect is profitable, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men desirous to profit. Euen in too many of these thou hast cause iustly to complaine, there is no end of making many books, the reading of such being but wearisomnes to the flesh, and so breedeth a distast of the necessary vse of reading. But when thou shalt lift vp thine eies, and spie out as in a foggie mist,<note place="margin">Eccle. 12.10.</note> diuers also wherein is <hi>an vpright writing, the words of truth, able to teach and to conuince,</hi> thou art now to be encouraged, and not to be wearie to exercise thy selfe, as thy calling and meanes will affoord, in bookes that are necessary, pretious and godly. Among these, if thou wilt take the pains to read, thou wilt easily condescend, that these Sermons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, both for their matter and penning, to be preserued for the vse of Gods Saints. Which will appeare, if with mee thou wilt a little neerer obserue the frame and comelinesse of this work: namely, the doctrines naturally raised, the reproofe of the aduersary soundly concluded: and that in such a pithie phrase, and words sauouring of grace, that thou canst not but
<pb facs="11"/>with me acknowledge diuers excellent graces of God shining clearely in the Author, in the Penman. By the Authour the word is truly interpreted, and in a most excellent maner brought home to thy conscience, both for mortification of life, and quickening in heauenly duties, as also for setling thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that accursed heresie of Popery, which is too much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected of too many able teachers. In the Pen-man obserue diligence, wisedome, godlinesse; he tooke this pains only for his owne priuate vse: for very hardly could hee bee drawen to communicate this to the common good: yet so carefully is it performed, that vndoubtedly not a sentence, yea hardly will it appeare, that a word of moment escaped him, as those who were diligent hearers with him may remember and can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. His godly wisdome appeareth not only in attending on the Lords own ordinance, the publike ministery of the word, on the Lords day and other set times, but also in treasuring the same vp by writing: knowing well, that the voice wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king inwardly for a time, through mans weaknesse and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity doth quickly perish: to this end, that with his ordinary sanctifying of the Sabbath, he might (and that liuely) set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his owne eies this powerfull meanes also of saluation: therby nourishing the same faith and godlinesse in himselfe, which he saw from his infancy, and daily doth see to dwell in that reuerend and truely religious Iudge his father, and in that vertuous Lady, alwaies ready to refresh the bowels of the Saints, his mother: to whom I also owe my selfe, both for encouragement in my entrance to the worke of the ministery first begun in that their well ordered family, as also for many fauours since, principally for that charge where I now dwell, bestowed on me by that worthy &amp; most religious care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full disposer of the Church-liuings, the right honourable Sir
<hi>Thomas Egerton</hi> Knight, Baron of <hi>Elsemeere,</hi> Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor of <hi>England.</hi> Lastly, Christian Reader, with me consider
<pb facs="12"/>of the blessing of God vpon the labours of this godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Gentleman in his owne profession, who hath taken these paines now for thy good, euident to all those that know him: which doth clearely conuince, that the keeping of the sabbath is not the losse of one yeere in seauen, as too many of his rank, &amp; I would they only, by their practise do discouer they think. Indeed if the fourth commandement were ceremoniall, and consequently abrogated, if there were no heauen, no hell, and that man were only for this life, they might haue some colour. But that the care of thy calling and of holy religion may go together, yea hand in hand, heere thou hast a paterne and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: benefite thy selfe by this his paines, and tread in the same steps of godly wisedome.</p>
