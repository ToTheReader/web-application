      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIs brief Treatise following, which now I publish, I have written about the vnderstāding and exposition of those wordes of Christ, <hi>Tell the Church, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 18.17. The occasions that have moved me herevnto, are not vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to many others besides my self: and I need not speake of them in particular. Onely twoo things there are, which for some causes I thinke needfull to be mentioned and observed.</p>
   <p>The first is, that as the Papistes by insisting vpon the letter of the Scripture, have misvnderstoode and perverted the meaning of those wordes of Christ,
<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 26.26.</note>
      <hi>This is my body, &amp;c.</hi> And as the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistes pressing the letter, have erred in like maner about other wordes of Christ recorded by the same Evangelist, where it is saide,
<note place="margin">" Matt. 28.29. and 5 34.39.</note>
      <hi>Teach all nations, and baptize them: Sweare not at all: Resist not evill, &amp;c.</hi> So have many of vs done likewise about these wordes of Christ
<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 18.17.</note>
      <hi>Tell the Church, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The other is, that the misvnderstanding hereof, and the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise ensuing therevpon, hath bene a great meanes and speciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of
<note n="*" place="margin">For whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che see M. Sm. Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleles. cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racter, &amp;c.</note> straunge opinions, and aberrations, of lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and divisions, of opposing and despising the Elders go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of emulation and debate among people, with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie other evills arising and spreading them selves daylie, to the great dishonour of God, and our owne continuall griefe, and trouble, and much reproach from others abroad.</p>
   <p>Wherevpon I was drawen and bounde by dutie to God and his Church, both to consider with my selfe, and to manifest to others what I could, as it pleased the Lord by his worde to shew vnto me hereabout. Which whiles I have endevoured to doo, there are that knowe what opposition and dealing I have found,</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p> And what thinges further are befallen vs, which I had rather should be buried and amended, then published by me, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and encreased by any. My care and desire (I thanke God) hath bene, and I trust shall be alway, to receive and followe the trueth in love with peace and holynes: and to that ende (as out age and rymes occasion vs) to search out and discover to others (what in mee is) both the apostasie of Antichrist on the one hande, and the erroneous confused courses of the Anabaptistes on the other hande: that we may by the mercie of God, stande free and safe from both, and growe vpp daylie in the sounde knowledge and holy obedience of the trueth and Gospell of our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p>This in deed I haue done with much weaknes, and have in some thinges bene overtaken both in my writinges and in our practise divers wayes. But my righteousnes and salvation is of the Lorde: whose grace is sufficient for me. And to whose grace I commende thee, Christian Reader: Beseeching the Lorde to guyde thy heart and feete in the way of trueth and peace to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie. AMEN.</p>
