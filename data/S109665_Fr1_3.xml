in asmuch as the fayth, wher of so

that theyr fayth,<note place="margin">

were true &amp; liuish fayth, thā would
it worke loue in theyr hertes, both
toward God &amp; theyr neighboures.
Agayne,<note place="margin">Roma. xv.</note> if ther were such a law as

wold it whan tyme requireth,<note place="margin">Psal. i.</note> and

But he that kepeth his worde, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Agayne thys is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> loue of God that

         </gap>
      </note> that the loue
of God is in none, but in them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whiche do his wyll. Neyther do
Christes sayenges dyffer from this:
If ye loue me,<note place="margin">Ioh. xliii.</note> sayeth he, kepe my cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundemētes.
He that hath my cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundementes

that loueth not me, kepethe not my

ye shall abyde in my loue.
<pb facs="5"/>
Ye are my freendes, yf ye do theyse
thynges y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> I cōmaunde you. Christ
sayeth here playnely,<note place="margin">He louethe Christ that kepeth hys worde.</note> that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

but yf any do the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

than may theyse men be recounted

   <p>Hys worde is that they shoulde
