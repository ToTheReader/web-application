Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Mathewe. wherin Christe our spirituall Isaac diggeth agayne the welles of Abraham, which welles the scrybes and phareses, those wycked and spiteful philistines, hade stopped and fylled vp with the erthe of theyr false exposicyons. He openeth the kyngdome of heuen which they had shut vp that other men shulde not enter, as they them selues hade no luste to go in. He restoreth the keye of knowledge whiche they hade taken awaye and broken the wardes with wrestynge the text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his due and naturall course, with theyr false gloses. He pluckethe awaye from the face of Moyses, the vayle which the scrybes and pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reses hade spred theron, that no man myght per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaue the bryghtnes of hys countenaunce. He wedeth out the thornes and busshes of theyr pha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>resaicall gloses, wherwith they hade stopped vp the narowe way and strayt gate, that fewe coude fynde them.</p>
   <p>The welles of Abraham, are the scrypture.<note place="margin">Abrahams wellos The kyng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of heuen who it is.</note> And the scrypture may well be called the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heuen, whiche is eternall lyfe, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge saue the knowledge of God the father and of his son Iesus Christe. Iohan. xvii. Moyses face is the lawe in hir ryght vnderstandyng. And

the lawe in her ryght vnderstandynge is the keye or at the leest way the fyrste and princypal keye to open the dore of the scrypture.<note place="margin">The keye what it is. The lawe is the waye that ledeth to Chryste.</note> And the lawe is the very waye that bryngethe vnto the dore Chryste, as it is wrytten. Gala. iii. The lawe was our scole mayster to brynge vs to Chryste, that we myght be iustefyed by faythe. And Roman. x. the ende of the lawe, that is to say, the thynge or cause why the lawe was gyuen, is Chryste, to iustefye all that beleue. That is to saye, the lawe was gyuen to proue vs vnryghtuous and to dryue vs to Chryste,<note place="margin">lawe what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Rom. iiii. and that syn commytted vnder the lawe myght be the more synfull. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. vii. The lawe is that thynge, which Paule in his inwarde man graunted to be good, but was yet compelled ofte tymes of hys members to do those thynges whiche that good lawe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for euell. Roma. vii.</p>
   <p>The lawe makethe no man to loue the lawe or lesse to do or commytte synne, but gendereth more lust. Roma. vii. and increseth syn. Roma. v. For I can not but hate the lawe, in as moche as I fynde no power to do it, and it neuertheles condemneth me bycause I do it not. The lawe setteth not at one with God, but causeth wrathe. Roma. iii.</p>
   <p>The lawe was gyuen by Moyses, but grace and veryte by Iesus Chryste. Iohan. i. Beholde thoughe Moyses gaue the lawe, yet he gaue no
<pb n="iii" facs="3"/>
man grace to do it or to vnderstande it a ryght or wrote it in any mānes harte, to consente that it was good, and to wyshe after power to fulfyl it. But Chryste geueth grace to do it and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande it a ryght, and wryteth it with his holy spirite in the tables of the hartes of men, and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth it a true thinge there and no ypocresy.</p>
   <p>The lawe truly vnderstande,<note place="margin">The brase<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> serpente. Num. xxi.</note> is those Fyrye serpētes that stonge the chyldren of Israel with present dethe. But Chryste is the brasen serpent on whome who so euer beinge stonge with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seyence of synne, loketh with a sure faythe, is he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led immediately of that styngynge and saued from the paynes and sorowes of hel.</p>
   <p>It is one thynge to condemne and pronounce the sentence of dethe,<note place="margin">The lawe and faythe be of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racyons.</note> and to stynge the conscy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with feare of euerlastynge payne. And it is another thynge to iustyfye from synne, that is to saye, forgyue and remytte synne and to hele the conscyence, and certefy a man not onely that he is delyuered from eternall dethe, but also that he is made the son of God and heyre of euerlastynge lyfe. The fyrste is the offyce of the lawe. The seconde partayneth vnto Christ only thorowe faythe.</p>
   <p>Nowe yf thou geue the lawe a false glose and say,<note place="margin">The scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture howe it is locke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> vppe.</note> that the lawe is a thynge whiche a man maye do of hys owne strength, euen out of the power of his frewyll. and that by the dedes of the lawe thou mayste deserue forgyuenes of thy fore syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Then dyed Chiste in vayne, Galat, ii, and is made almoste of no steade, seynge thou arte be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>come

thyne owne sauyoure. Nether can Chryste (where that glose is admitted) be otherwyse ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or estemed of Chrysten men (for all his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syon and promyses made to vs in hys bloude) then he is of the turkes, howe that he was a holy prophete. and that he prayeth for vs as other sayntes do, saue that we Chrysten thynke that he is somewhat more in fauoure then other sayntes be (thoughe we ymagyne hym so proude that he wyll not here vs but thorowe hys mylde mother and other holye sayntes, whiche all we counte moche more meke and mercyfull then he, but hym moste of myght) and that he hathe also an hygher place in heuen, as the graye freres and obseruauntes set hym, as it were from the chynne vpwarde aboue saynt Fraunces.</p>
   <p>And so when by this false interpretacion of the lawe, Chryste whiche is the dore, the waye and the grounde or foundacyon of al the scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is lost cōcernyng the chefest frut of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syon, and no more sene in his owne likenes, then is the scripture locked vppe. and henceforth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme darkenes and a mace, wherī if thou walke thou wotteste nether where thou a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

It is an hedge or groue of bryers. wherin yf thou be caught, it is impossyble to gette out, but that yf thou lowse thy selfe in one place 'thou arte tangeled and caught in another for it.</p>
   <p>This wyse was the scrypture locked vp of
<pb n="iiii" facs="4"/>
the scrybes and phareses, that the Iewes coude not se Chryste when he came, nor yet can. And though Chryst with these .iii. chapters dyd open it agayne, yet by suche gloses, for oure vnthanke fulnes sake that we hade no luste to lyue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge. haue we Chrysten loste Chryste agayne, and the vnderstandynge of the moste clere texte wherwith Chryste expoundeth and restoreth the lawe agayne.</p>

As they haue interpretate here the wordes of Chryst wherwith he restoreth the lawe agayne to be but good counselles onely, but no precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes that bynde the conscyence.</p>

Ergo the lawe or the dedes of the lawe iustefye.</p>
   <p>These and all suche are naughtye argumentes For ye se that the kinge pardoneth no murderar but on a condycyon, that he henceforth kepe the lawe and do no more so, and yet ye knowe well ynough that he is saued by grace, fauour &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, yer the kepyng of the lawe come.
