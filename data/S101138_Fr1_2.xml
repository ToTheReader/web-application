      <hi>A</hi> Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIAN Reader, there came forth of late an injurious Pamphlet, entitled <hi>A just complaint against an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just doer;</hi> wherein is proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the world, <hi>The mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable slavery &amp; bondage of the English Church at Amsterdam:</hi> and the blame of this misery is layd upō me, as being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by my <hi>tyrannicall government &amp; corrupt doctrine &amp;c.</hi> Heynous accusations denounced as with sound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet from an high pinacle of the Printers Tower, and blowen abroad into many Countries. My hope and helpe against this tempestuous blast, is in that our mercifull and faithfull Advocate, who pleads the cause of his servants, and brings forth their righteousnes as the light, and their judgements as the noone day.</p>
   <p>To consider who have bene the speciall Actours in this work, may give some light unto the Readers for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter discerning and judging thereof. For as <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Davenport</hi> in his Protestation sayth, <hi>he knew not neither could imagine what motive set this Publisher upon this work, unlesse he knew the man:</hi> So when the Readers shall in some part know the <pb facs="3"/> persons that have bene the chief
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, they may in some part know or imagine what motive did set their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented humours upon this scandalous enterprise.</p>
   <p>The Printer hereof <hi>Sa. St.</hi> that left out his name in the title-page, did yet of himself voluntarily acknowledge that which he had done therein. Now he being a Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist, no marvell if he had a hand therein.</p>
   <p>Those that framed the Title, who did also make the conclusion of this book, having a hand either jointly or severally, both in the beginning and end thereof, are by their owne confession knowne to be Brownists, <hi>I.C.</hi> and <hi>S. St.</hi> It is not strange that these men for the furtherance of their owne cause, should encourage these complaināts against me, and as it were clap them on the shoulder, and say unto them in their conclusion, <hi>stand fast therefore, quit you like men in striving for the maintenance of this part of the faith, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The principall Publisher hereof, that sought help of the Brownists, &amp; caused it to be printed, is found to be <hi>Wi. Be.</hi> the foreman of the subscribers, who though in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription he have the foremost standing, yet that he is one of the least understanding among them, appeareth by his rash proceedings in this busines. The Printer of the Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists noted him to be a <hi>Simplician,</hi> when he would not otherwise expresse his name. And well might they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him a simple Person, that would suffer them to have a hand both in the Title &amp; conclusion of his booke, he not perceaving the evill thereof. <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Davenport</hi> himself deciphers him as <hi>an iniurious one, a sower of discord, and a busy body in other mens matters.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The first part of the Pamphlet was made by <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Davenp.</hi> conteyning a threefold writing, partly against the Classis, &amp; partly against me, ech of them having his name subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed thereunto. Now howsoever <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Davenport</hi> be a man greatly renowmed &amp; famous for his learning and gifts in <pb facs="3"/> preaching, yet

      </gap> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>s it seemeth) discontented that his calling among us did not succeed, and comming neerer unto the Brownists in this question about baptisme then unto us, it is therefore the lesse marvell that he also had a hand in writing cōplaints against me for not desiring him.</p>
   <p>The two Persons of trust, of whom <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Davenport</hi> speaks in his Protestation, to whom he committed his writings for the satisfaction of others, before they were printed, are unknowne unto me, otherwise then by conjecture. His secret friends that are my secret enimies, doe yet walk in the dark.</p>
   <p>The second part of the Pamphlet is subscribed with the names of many persons among us, all of them speciall friends of <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Davenport,</hi> that have made it their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and protestation against me; though many others among us doe utterly dislike and disclayme that which is done by them. Divers of them having formerly bene Brownists, and left their separation to come unto us, doe yet shew hereby that they still cleave too much unto some of their opinions. And for some others of them, I wish that they had not shewed so much affection and respect that way.</p>
   <p>The Person that brought these complaints into such frame and method, doth yet lurke in darknes, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth such a work, neither is he yet certainly knowne. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the subscribers themselves doe professe, that they know not who wrote them, and such as doe know, doe yet hide the same.</p>
   <p>One <hi>fore-reader</hi> of the complaints to such as met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the house of <hi>N.I.</hi> for the subscribing of them, is confessed to be <hi>Io. Tra.</hi> one that is no member of our Church, one that was once a Brownist of <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Robinsons</hi> company, and whether he have renounced that Church, or they him, or have any dimission from that Church, or whether he be now of any Church or none, I know not. <pb facs="4"/>

      </gap>
      <pb facs="5"/> Might they not well have suspected the matter, to see such an instrument employed in the busines?</p>
   <p>The Title of the Pamphlet is, as I heare, generally dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked by the subscribers &amp; complaynants themselves, and by some of them condemned as a vile Title. But the truth is, As is the one, so is the other: If the complaints be just, then is the Title just, being framed according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents &amp; speciall subject of the book: if the Title be a vile Title, then is the book also as vile; neither have I so much cause to complaine of the Brownists that made the Title, as of them that made the book. If this Church be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of that liberty and power which Christ hath given it, &amp;c. If the Elders be deprived of their power in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for the good of the Church, &amp;c. If I have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Church under the undue power of the Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, &amp;c. If these and the like assertions in their book be true, then is the Title and superscription as lawfull as the subscription; then is there cause to complaine of <hi>the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable slavery and bondage</hi> of this Church, and of <hi>Tyrannicall government, &amp;c.</hi> Then is there cause to commend &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the liberty and freedome of the Brownists, which are not subject unto the power of any Classis or Synod, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the government of other Reformed Churches. And then (if these complaynants had by the Word of God ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyed their complaints) it were reasonable that all the ancient churches of God in Europe should come to these complaynants, and learne of them their new forme of government.</p>
   <p>But I finde no just ground that these opposites bring for their complaints, nor any due proofe of their many reproofes: therefore though I be covered with reproach by them, I doe yet comfort my self in the Lord. That which some will have to be <hi>the slavery and bondage</hi> of a Church, that I esteeme to be the liberty, safety and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Churches. That which they count a <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall <pb facs="5"/> government,</hi> that I beleeve to be a Sanctuary against Tyranny. That
<hi>single uncompounded policy</hi> (as <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Iacob</hi> calles it) whereby particular Congregations are made to be independent, not standing under any other Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall authority out of themselves, that I conceave to bring with it manifold disorders, confusion and dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Churches. For the testimony of this truth, I am not ashamed to suffer that reproach which some lay upon me. Though I have already bene smitten on the right cheek, yet am I ready to turne the other also, rather then to forsake this truth, which I judge to be of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Yea if I were cast upon my death-bed, ready to deliver up my soule into the handes of the Lord, I should judge it to be my duety, and a speciall fruit of my love and care for the flock of God, among my last words to warne them of these things, as now I doe. And for these my opposite brethren, I desire they would be like-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that laying aside all prejudice and inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they would suffer themselves to be better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in these things, wherein they have bene evidently mistaken through want of due circumspection; that they would labour to doe those things, which God would have them to doe, and whereof they are to give an account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, they know not how soone.</p>
   <p>It cannot but be greevous to see contentions abound and overflow, to see enimies of the Church insult and hardned in schisme and errour; yet is not the truth to be betrayed or neglected. Nature and Religion teach men to answer for themselves when they are accused, and to make a defensive, when others make an offensive war. The state of Churches at this day is like unto <hi>a glassy Sea mingled with fire,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rev. 15.2.</note> with fire of fervent contentions at home and abroad, yet even there doe the faithfull stand with the Harpes of God rejoycing in the profession of that truth, which is oppugned and contended against. As for <pb facs="6"/> my self, how unjustly soever I am dealt withall in this kinde, being called as it were to the publick barre of a generall judgment before the world, and accused before all men, in this day of man, yet while I learne thereby to judge my self, striving still, and more then formerly, to be further of from the evilles unjustly imputed unto me, my hope is that the Lord will doe me good by these wrongs, and that I shall reape such fruit, as shall encrease my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the day of the Lord. And as for others, one speciall fruit that I exspect from this controversy, is that those which are wise and godly, will hereby take occasion to thinke more seriously of these things, taking heed what new formes of Churches and Church-government they frame unto themselves, or commend unto others. For these my opposites I wish unto them, that as some of them have already discerned their fault in this unadvised subscription, that so the rest also following their example, may come to the sight and confession of their errour, and thereby finde true rest and peace unto their soules. The God of glory, that brings light out of darknes, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter love of truth from sight of dangerous errours, guide us by his Word, and illuminate us by his spirit, to discerne the things that differ, and to follow that which is good, to ponder the path of our feet, and to turne neither to the right hand nor to the left. AMEN.</p>
