   <p>
      <hi>Naturall things</hi> are the more proper Obiect, namely the ordinary Workes of God in the Creatures, preseruing and, disposing by Prouidence that which his Goodnesse and Power had created, and dispersed in the diuers parts of the World, as so many members of this great Bodie. Such is the History of Men in their diuersified hewes and colours, quantities and proportions; of Beasts, Fishes, Fowles, Trees, Shrubs, Herbs, Minerals, Seas, Lands, Meteors, Heauens, Starres, with their naturall affections: in which many both of the Antient and Moderne haue done worthily; but if neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Obiect deceiue me not, this surmounteth them all in two Priuildges, the veritie and varietie, especially of things in this kind remotest and rarest.</p>
   <p>It is true, that as euery member of the bodie hath somewhat eminent, whereby it is seruiceable to the whole; so euery Region excelleth all others in some peculiar Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which may be termed extraordinary respectiuely, though otherwise most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary in its owne place. So Our <hi>England</hi> in the naturall temper, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall want of Wolues, artificiall Rings of Bels, Sheepe not at all or seldome drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, Lands and Waters turning Wood in some parts to Stone,<note place="margin">See of the Wonders of <hi>England Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Brit. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 18. before <hi>Hol.

      </note> Wonders of the <hi>Peke</hi> and other parts, doth not degenerate from nature, but hath a peculiar nature, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most miraculous to other Countries, as the naturall Wonders of their Regions are to vs: so also <hi>Irelands</hi> want of venome in Creatures, fulnesse of it, and barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in many of her wilder Natiues, after so long trayning in Ciuilitie, and so anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Renowme for Sanctitie: and so each part is to other part in some or other part, and particular respect admirable.</p>
   <p>What a World of Trauellers haue by their owne eyes obserued in this kinde, is here (for the most part in their owne words transcribed or translated) deliuered, not by one professing Methodically to deliuer the Historie of Nature according to rules of Art, nor Philosophically to discusse and dispute; but as in way of Discourse, by each Traueller relating what in that kind he hath seene. And as <hi>Dauid</hi> prepared ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple; or (if that be too arrogant) as <hi>Alex.</hi> furnished <hi>Ariotle</hi> with Huntsmen and Obseruers of Creatures, to acquaint him with their diuersified kinds and natures; or (if that also seeme too ambitious) as Sense by Induction of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars yeeldeth the premisses to Reasons Syllogisticall arguing; or if we shall be yet more homely, as Pioners are employed by Enginers, and <hi>Labourers</hi> serue Masons, and Bricklayers, and these the best Surueyers and Architects: so here <hi>Purchas</hi> and
<pb facs="5"/>
his Pilgrimes minister indiuiduall and sensible materials (as it were with Stones, Brickes and Mortar) to those vniuersall Speculators for their Theoricall structures. And well may the Author be ranked with such <hi>Labourers</hi> (howsoeuer here a Master-builder also) for that he hath beene forced as much to the Hod, Barrow and Trowel, as to contemplatiue suruaying: neither in so many Labyrinthian Perambulations thorow, and Circumnauigations about the World in this and his other Workes, was euer enabled to maintaine a Vicarian or Subordinate Scribe, but his own hands to worke, aswell as his head to contriue these voluminous Buildings▪ except in some few Transcriptions or Translations, the most also of them by his sonne <hi>S. P.</hi> that one and the same name might both father and further the whole.</p>
   <p>As for Master <hi>Hakluyts</hi> many yeeres Collections, and what stocke I receiued from him in written Papers, in the Table of Authours you shall find: whom I will thus farre honour, that though it be but Materials, and that many Bookes haue not one Chapter in that kind) yet that stocke encouraged me to vse my endeuours in and for the rest. I was therein a <hi>Labourer</hi> also, both to get them (not without hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions) and to forme and frame those Materials to their due place and order in this Aedifice, the whole Artifice (such as it is) being mine owne. Traduce mee not, nor let any impute to boasting what I haue said of my sole working (I know there is a <hi>vae soli</hi>) but I am compelled to doe it to preuent an Obiection of my promised <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paean</hi> supply to my <hi>Pilgrimage.</hi> I confesse, I was too forward to promise, because o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue beene so backward to assist: which I haue in former Editions signified, but to blind Eyes and deafe Eares. Whose Librarie, whose Purse hath beene opened to me, let his mouth be opened against me also: <hi>Europe</hi> otherwise could not, nor now vpon any price (it is too late) can be <hi>Purchased.</hi> I would not be misconstrued to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. Many haue applauded my endeuours, but <hi>probitas laudatur &amp; alget.</hi> If I had not liued in great part vpon Exhibition of charitable friends, and on extraordinary labours of Lecturing (as the terme is) the Pilgrime had beene a more agreeing name to me, then <hi>Purchas.</hi> Yet let my name be for euer forgotten, if I remember not his, which the Aduersaries haue (seeking to steale him from vs after his death) by their calumnie made more memorable; I meane, my decessed Patron Doctor <hi>King,</hi> late Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> to whose bountie vnder God, I willingly ascribe my life, deliuered from a sickly Habitation, and consequently (as also by opportunities of a <hi>London</hi> Benefice) whatsoeuer additions in my later Editions of my <hi>Pilgrimage</hi>; these present <hi>Pilgrimes</hi> also with their peregrinations. Yet such is ordinarily the <hi>greatnesse of the Epha, and smalnesse of the Shekel,</hi> in <hi>London</hi> Cures (especially within the wals) that wee are inabled thereby to disablings for workes of that kinde, whiles we must preach in season and out of season, (I say not out of reason) that wee may liue.</p>
   <p>One wing that Reuerend and bountifull hand gaue in hope that some blessed hand would adde the other, to fit me for an <hi>Europaean</hi> flight, wherein not finding his hopes seconded, he promised to <hi>right me himselfe</hi> (these were his syllables) but death righted him, and I am forced to wrong the World. I speake not to accuse any, for of whom, to whom can I complaine, but to plaine and excuse my selfe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to dedicate my thankefulnesse with the continuance of this Monument to that worthy Name.</p>
   <p>But to returne to our Philosopher; I also haue beene an <hi>Athenian</hi> with these <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Acts</hi> 17.21.</note> one delighting <hi>to tell,</hi> the others to <hi>heare some new thing.</hi> I haue therefore either wholly omitted or passed dry foot things neere and common; <hi>Far fetched and deare bought are the Lettice sutable to our lips.</hi> Common and ordinarie plants I remit to the Herbarists. <hi>Europaean</hi> Rarities (except in the remoter Regions both from our habitation and knowledge, as <hi>Island, Norway, Sueden, Constantinople,</hi> the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean</hi> Ilands, &amp;c.) to the Historians peculiar to each Countrey therein. My <hi>Genius</hi> delights rather in by-wayes then high-wayes, and hath therein by Tracts and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Trauellers made Causies and High-wayes, euery where disposing these Pilgrime-Guides, that men without feare may trauell to and ouer the most vncouth Countries of the World: and there be shewed with others Eyes, the Rarities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of such things also as are not against Nature, but either aboue it, as Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb facs="5"/>
or beside the ordinarie course of it, in the extraordinary Wonders, which Gods Prouidence hath therein effected according to his good and iust pleasure. And thus much for the workes of God.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Things humane,</hi> are such as Men are, or haue, or haue done or suffered in the World. Here therefore the various Nations, Persons, Shapes, Colours, Habits, Rites, Religions, Complexions, Conditions, Politike and Oeconomike Customes, Languages, Letters, Arts, Merchandises, Wares, and other remarkeable Varieties of Men and humane Affaires are by Eye-witnesses related more amply and cetainly then any Collector euer hath done, or perhaps without these helpes could doe. And thus we haue shewed the scope of the Author, and profitable vse of the Worke: which could not but be voluminous; hauing a World for the subiect, and a World of Witnesses for the Euidence: and yet (except where the Author or Worke it selfe permitted not) these vast Volumes are contracted, and Epitomised, that the nicer Reader might not be cloyed. Here also both Elephants may swimme in deepe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous Seas, and such as want either lust or leisure, may single <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

      </gap>, as in a Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Bookes, what Author or Voyage shall best fit to his profit or pleasure. I might adde that such a Worke may seeme necessarie to these times, wherein not many Scholers are so studious of Geographie, and of Naturall and Vniuersall knowledge in the diuersified varieties which the various Seas and Lands in the World produce, seeming as exceptions to Generall Rules, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> the best Scholer in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Schoole and her principall Secretarie could not so punctually and indiuidually see in the Ocean, the Remoter Lands and <hi>New Worlds,</hi> none of which he euer saw, nor till this last Age were knowne. And for the most part, those which are studious know not either to get, or to read the Authors of this kinde, of which so few speake <hi>Latine.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>As for Gentlemen, Trauell is accounted an excellent Ornament to them; and therefore many of them comming to their Lands sooner then to their Wits, aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture themselues to see the Fashions of other Countries, where their soules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies find temptations to a twofold Whoredom, whence they see the World as <hi>Adam</hi> had <hi>knowledge of good and euill,</hi> with the losse or lessening of their estate in this <hi>English</hi> (and perhaps also in the heauenly Paradise) &amp; bring home a few smattering termes, flattering garbes, Apish crings, foppish fancies, foolish guises and disguises, the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Neighbour Nations (I name not <hi>Naples</hi>) without furthering of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, the World, or themselues. I speake not against Trauell, so vsefull to vsefull men, I honour the industrious of the liberall and ingenuous in arts, bloud, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation: and to preuent exorbitancies of the other, which cannot trauell farre, or are in danger to trauell from God and themselues, at no great charge I offer a World of Trauellers to their domestike entertainment, easie to be spared from their Smoke, Cup, or Butter-flie vanities and superfluities, and fit mutually to entertaine them in a better Schoole to better purposes. And for the price, as I cannot set it, so I must acknowlege the aduenturous courage of the Stationer Master <hi>Henry Fetherstone</hi> (like <hi>Hercules</hi> helping <hi>Atlas</hi>) so long to beare this my heauy World at such expenses.</p>
   <p>NOw for the METHOD, I confesse, I could not be therein exact:<note place="margin">The Method and order of this Worke.</note> first because I had such a confused Chaos of printed and written Bookes, which could not easily be ordered: partly because this Method by way of Voyages often repeates the same Countries and (though I haue often pruned repetitions) yet, sometimes admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for more full testimonie) the same things, by diuers of our Authors trauelling the same parts, obserued, in which my Method brings in ordinarily the Authours whole Voyage there, where that part or Countrey, in which and for which we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him, principally occasioneth his memorie; and partly because in this long space of imprinting (from August 1621.) many things haue comne to my hand by diligent enquiry, which were not enrolled, nor in possession to be mustered in their due file and ranke; yea, diuers things haue beene done since our other passages of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were printed off: And thus diuers <hi>Dutch</hi> quarrels are related, which yet since the Impression of that part haue beene composed. Yet are we not altogether without Order.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>First, we haue diuided the World in our Method into the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New,</hi> alloting to each his owne TOME,<note place="margin">The first Part.</note> the first Ten Books to the former, the later to the other. But the Worke growing more voluminous then was expected, we are forced to cut each of them asunder in the midst, the figures in the top and Alphabets in the bottome, and some marginall references and annotations intimating but two Tomes, which only the quantitie hath made Foure. Againe in the Elder World, that is, <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> we obserue Antiquities and Generalities in the <hi>First Booke,</hi> one of the last printed, though first placed: vniuersall Circumnauigations (all knowne in that kind) in the <hi>Second</hi>; which though they containe many things of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> and the South Continent, yet being from and for <hi>Europe,</hi> and spending most of their time on the <hi>Asian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Coasts, are thither referred: in the <hi>Third, Fourth,</hi> and <hi>Fifth,</hi> are <hi>Indian</hi> Voyages and Affaires of the <hi>English,</hi> with <hi>Portugall</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> intercourse; in which is obserued a tolerable order of time from Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Times to the present.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The Second Part.</note>In the <hi>Second Part</hi> you haue first <hi>Africa</hi> in <hi>Two Bookes</hi> (the East <hi>Indie</hi> ships but touched on the Coasts) the <hi>Sixth Booke</hi> handling the Northerne parts, whatsoeuer of <hi>Africa</hi> is not termed <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and the <hi>Seuenth</hi> the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> part. The <hi>Eighth Booke</hi> enters into the Continent of <hi>Asia</hi>; in the first Chapters relating the History of the <hi>Franks</hi> (as all <hi>Asia</hi> since cals the Western Christians) in the <hi>Holy Land</hi> Wars; in the later, some Pilgrimages thither and the parts adioyning, with diuers <hi>Turkish</hi> Obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The <hi>Ninth</hi> proceedeth thorow the mayne Land of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Persia, Arabia, India,</hi> taking large view of those and other <hi>Asian</hi> Regions, returning by <hi>Africa</hi> with later and larger intelligence of the Easterne, Westerne and Northerne shores there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; New <hi>view</hi> of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Dominion and <hi>Seraglio,</hi> as also of the <hi>Maldiuae</hi> Ilands: which and the whole <hi>Tenth Booke</hi> came later to hand, and therefore is rather a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to all, then any well ordered part of the Worke, being therefore printed after the rest.</p>
   <p>Now for the <hi>New World,</hi> we begin it at <hi>China,</hi> which the Ancients knew not, and take all the East and North parts of <hi>Asia</hi> from the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, the <hi>Arctoan</hi> Regions, all <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Terra Australis,</hi> comprehending all in that <hi>New Title.</hi> The <hi>First</hi> of those Bookes beginning our <hi>Third Part,</hi> deliuereth especially the Authors of <hi>Tartaria</hi> in the succession of about three hundred yeeres, wherein the <hi>Second</hi> succeedeth, adding also <hi>Iapan, Corea</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> with the first Discoueries of the Northerne and <hi>Caspian</hi> Seas by the <hi>English.</hi> This <hi>Arctoan</hi> Region contayning <hi>Russia, Noua Zembla,</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyeds, Siberia, Island, Frisland, Norway,</hi> with the Neighbour Regions, <hi>Cherry I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Greenland, Groenland, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Third Booke</hi> relateth; continued in the <hi>Fourth</hi> with further Discoueries intended for a North or North-west Passage. The <hi>Fifth Booke</hi> giueth generall Relations of <hi>America,</hi> in her <hi>Mexican</hi> or Northerly, and <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> or Southerly Moyties (with what we could find of the South Continent) their Antiquities and state before, and since the <hi>Spanish</hi> Conquest. The <hi>Sixth</hi> (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the Fourth Part) containeth <hi>English</hi> Voyages to <hi>America,</hi> the <hi>Great Bay</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and the Southerne Moytie to the <hi>Magellan</hi> Straits; which in the <hi>Seuenth Booke</hi> are more amplified, and further enlarged with the Creatures, and Countries within Land, the <hi>Peruan</hi> Antiquities related by one of the <hi>Inca</hi> Linage, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and other occurrents of the <hi>Peruan America,</hi> and <hi>Terra Australis.</hi> The <hi>Eighth Booke</hi> comes homeward thorow the <hi>Mexican America</hi> and <hi>Florida</hi> vnto <hi>Canada,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>French</hi> Acts and <hi>English</hi> beginnings in those parts, touching in the way homeward at the <hi>Azores. Virginia</hi> is the Argument of the <hi>Ninth Booke,</hi> in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession and successe thereof from the Plantation 1606. to 1624. whereto <hi>Summers I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> are added. The <hi>English</hi> Plantations in <hi>New England</hi> and <hi>New-foundland</hi> follow in the <hi>Tenth,</hi> with diuers Fleets set forth by Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory, with whose blessing continued and confirmed by His Maiestie, wee commit you to God▪ and giue you leaue to rest at home in peace, <hi>vnder the shadow of your owne Vine and Fig-tree,</hi> which God for his Christs sake continue and confirme to vs and our posteritie. <hi>Amen.</hi>

   <p>You haue here a long Preface to a long Work, and yet you haue a longer touching

the vtilitie thereof in the first Paragraphs of <hi>Salomons Ophir.</hi> It had not beene pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for me in <hi>London</hi> distractions to haue accomplished so great a Designe, but for the opportunities of His Maiesties Colledge at <hi>Chelsie,</hi> where these foure last Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers I haue retired my selfe (without Pulpit Non-residence) to this Worke: which as it one way furthered, so another way it occasioned many <hi>Errata,</hi> by my absence from the Presse, as in the Bodie of the Worke, so especially in the Titles ouer each page; halfe of which I thinke, are mine owne, the other such as pleased the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, needing correction enough, and sometimes not giuing sufficient direction to the Reader; whom I intreat to accept of his Day and Night, Summer and Winter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, pardoning the one for the others sake. A Table had beene necessary, if Time and assistance to a wearie hand had permitted; I adde, if some had not committed contrary to promise. It is time to make an end of Prefacing.

      <p>THe necessitie of a Historie is, as of a sworne Witnesse, to say the truth, all the truth (in iust discretion) and nothing but the truth. This I haue indeuoured in the whole Worke. But, <hi>veritas odium parit.</hi> Some perhaps will blame me for rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting some Truths, specially the <hi>Dutch Zelots,</hi> in that I haue related such abuses of some of that Nation in the East <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>Greenland</hi> to the <hi>English</hi> there, as if I sought like an vnseasonable and vncharitable Tale-bearer to raise discord betwixt Neighbours. I answere that no Nation is in this World so pure, but hath both offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious members, and some bad members also as Dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

I question not, but that the <hi>English</hi> haue also such, and such wee haue occasionally noted, Fugitiues, Apostataes, Theeues, Murtherers, &amp;c. which yet are not Nationall faults, but person all, except the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth iustifie such vniustice, as <hi>Troy</hi> the Rap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

And for this cause I haue omitted some odious <hi>Greenland</hi> Relations, haue altered and reprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some more offensiue generall speeches disgorged by the passionate loosers, with Titles on the tops of pages, intended to Offenders, but in such vnwarie termes as might by ill willers be extended to the whole Nation: yea, I had purposed to omit many things printed alreadie, rather leauing a <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="7"/>
the necessities of the <hi>English</hi> East <hi>Indian</hi> Societie haue forced such a publication, my sparing purpose had beene in vaine to conceale the Shilling where the Pound was made manifest. I might also haue beene accounted partiall against mine owne Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This I haue done; I for the most part, doe but publish others Relations, (and Losers perhaps will speake the most) and by Annotations dispersed intimate that these are personall faults of that East <hi>Indie</hi> Company, or some Commanders there, not of the whole Nation; and if any Marginall Notes with <hi>Dutch</hi> Epithetes seeme to speake more, yet are they but directions to the Reader to shew what in that page or place is handled without further intent; so with my Prayers for Peace on both sides I commend both to the God of Peace.</p>
