For can christē matrimony be ony other wyse than a thyng of great excellency and incō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable dignite, seynge it was not ordeyned of Minos, of Creta, nor of Licurgus of Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monye, nor yet of Solon the Athenian, but of <note place="margin">Not mā but God himself instituted ho ly wedlocke, yea and that in Paradise</note> the moost hygh and immortall God hym selfe, &amp; by hym, yea by hī alone cōmēded to mankynd in so much that menne may seme to be allured, moued and styred vnto thys state of lyuynge w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> a certen inspiracion of the holy Ghost?

<pb facs="4"/>
this worlde, to shewe that it bryngethe to man great ioye, wealth, felicite &amp; quietnes. And syns that tyme hath it euer ben had in great estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion▪ yea and that not only amonge them that professe vnfayned faythe in the lyuynge God, but also amonge so many as only were led by y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> instincte of nature, in somuche that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a thynge of muche ignominye, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche to lyue wythoute the state of wedlocke &amp; to be vnfruytfull. Were not the holy Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <note place="margin">Gen. xi. xxiiii xxix. xli.</note> marryed men? Did not the Prophettes of God liue in the christen state of holy wedlocke? Dyd not God in the olde lawe bothe wyll hys <note place="margin">Leuici. xxi Ezechi. xliiii</note> prestes to marry, &amp; also appoynt thē, what wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues they shoulde haue? Was not Christ borne <note place="margin">Math. i. Luke. i. Math. viii. Marke. i. Luke. iiii. i. Cor. ix. Philip. iiii. Ioan. ii. Actu. xxi.</note> in maryage? Were not the Aposties of Christ marryed men? Dyd not Christ garnysh mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age withe the fyrste fruytes of his miracles, whan he wyth his mother &amp; his Disciples were at a weddynge in the Citie of Cana Galyle? Was not Ppilippe the Euangeliste a maryed man, and had foure doughters excellently lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in holy Scriptures: Were not many other <note place="margin">Eccle. Histo. Lib in.

   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
Of these thynges it is manifest, of how great estimacion holy wedlocke hath euer bene syns y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fyrst begynnynge of the worlde amonge all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of parsonnes. Who wyll not nowe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende <note place="margin">The excellen cy of wedde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke.</note> honorable wedlocke, as a thynge of great excellency. Who wyll not thyncke it a state of li uyng worthy hygh prayse and commēdacion? Who wyll not iudge that it ought to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with metyng armes, as they say, seynge that by it so many noble treasures chaunse vnto vs, vertue is mayntayned, vice is exchewed, houses are replenished, cities are inhabited, the grounde is tylled, scienses are practised, kyngdoms flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysh, amite is preserued the publique weale is defended, naturall succession remaynethe, good artes are taught, honest order is kepte, Christē dome is enlarged, Goddes word promoted, and the glory of GOD hyghely auaunced and sette forthe?</p>
   <p>But alas, and wo is me for it, the glorye of <note place="margin">The disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of wed locke.</note> this christen matrimony is now greatly obscu red, yea almoost vtterlye extincte and quenched thorow the abhominable whoredome, stynking adultery, wicked fornicacion, and alkynd of vn cleannes, which is vsed nowe a dayes amonge vs, yea and that frely and wythout ony punish ment. There is no truethe, there is no mercye, <note place="margin">Oze. iiii.</note> there is no knowledge of God on the earthe as
<pb facs="5"/>
the Prophet sayth, Cursyng, lyeng; man slaugh ter, theafte and whorehuntyng haue ouerflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the worlde. Men now a dayēs hunte y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes <note place="margin">Hiere. v.</note> and harlottes houses, as Hieremye sayethe. They are become lyke wylde stoned horses that ronne after meares, for euery one neyeth at his neyghbours wyfe. And woulde God this were the worste.</p>
   <p>Matrimony is despised, whoredome is had in price. True wyues &amp; faythfull yokefellowes are neglected and set at nought, but whores and harlottes are embrased, kyssed, kulled and much set by. Honeste wyues syt at home and allmoost perish for hōger but harlottes are sumptuously fed wyth al kynde of deyntyes. Matrimony is called an halter, but whoredome is recounted a pleasure. Wedlocke is now taken for a kynde of lyuynge replete wyth all misery, care sorow, po uerte, wretchednes and beggerye, but to lyue in whoredome and such other detestable vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is recounted to lyue lyke a cleane and right by man, lyke a lusty brute, lyke a ioly ruffelare, lyke a fellowe, that wyll not gyue his head for y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> wasshynge, yea lyke such an one, as it woulde do a man good, saye they, to be in his company, he is suche a mynyon and pleasaunt fellow, full of his mery conceates and wanton toyes. To tary at home but one daye wyth theyr wyues,
<pb facs="6"/>
is more than twyfe an hell, but to be dallyenge amonge whores, whole dayes, nyghtes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes, and there to spende all that they haue, is a pleasure for a Pope, and recounted no payne at all. O good God howe longe wylte thou suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this intollerable abhominacion? How longe shall the head rulars wyucke at this great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes?
