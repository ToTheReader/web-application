      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had Right Honorable about three yeares sithence presented to the late LORD TREASORER of worthie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie your Lordships prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor the Commentaries of <hi>Comines,</hi> translated into our English tongue, I was earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pressed by some of my friends to continue the Historie of Fraunce, from Charles the eight where he endeth till this our present age, which a long time I vtterly refused to doe, knowing that to annex my poore collections to the workes of so excellent a writer as <hi>Comines</hi> is, should be as arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant a part and as much to my discredit as if a
<pb facs="3"/>
Painter should haue attempted to finish the Image of Venus beegunne but not ended by Apelles, which was a worke of so rare excellencie that no Paynter after him durst aduenture to perfect it. Notwithstanding when I called to mynde that others before mee had attempted this that they required at my hands, and withall not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to withstand the importunitie of my friendes I beganne though somewhat timorously to take penne in hand. And whereas there are in all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings two kindes of methodes, the one procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the causes to the effectes, and the other iudging of the causes by the effectes which is called <hi>Iudicium a posteriori:</hi> my selfe not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to performe the former as Comines doth, who was priuie to the hidden misteries, of Princes deseignes, and of Counsell with their secret cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: determined onely to follow the second course, namely to set downe the effectes and the naked truth forbearing either to giue graue aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisments as well to Princes themselues as to their seruaunts as hee doth, or to enter into deepe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of high points of pollicie &amp; gouernment (as a matter farre aboue my capacitie) wherewith his workes are singularly beautified. In the which course hauing waded in the Historie of Fraunce till the death of Henry the second and purposing to continew it further, both my hart &amp; hand fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and my pen fell foorth of my fingers of it owne accord.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
For the actions of the ciuill warres of Fraunce are so blouddie, cruell, and barbarous and so farre I will not say srom all Christianitie, but from all humanitie and militarie discipline vsed in former times, that for my owne part I iudge them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to bee buried in the dongeon of eternall obliuion. Agreeable to the which actions were also the effects wherof my selfe haue beene an eie witnesse. For passing out of Spaine through France in the yeare 77, in companie of a Gentleman of good seruice not long sithens gone to God, whom hir Maiestie employed at that time to the King of Spaine for hir affaires: we found such a wildernes in all the country betwene <hi>Bayonne</hi> and <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> that whole forrests and woods were turned vp and consumed, the townes vtterly desolated, the people despearsed, the churches quite subuerted, and the children (a lamentable thing to bee recorded) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining vnchristened by the space of ten yeares, which bred in mee such a commiseration, to see so noble a member of Christendome so miserablye torne in peeces with hir owne teeth, that it did not onelie visiblie as it were set before mine eyes the destruction of Sodoma &amp; Gomorha, and the rude Chaos wherein the world lay buried and hidden, before God placed all things in this goodly order which wee now see them in: but also made mee call to minde the example of <hi>Africanus Minor,</hi> who wept bitterly with a certaine <hi>Sinpathie</hi> of sorrow, whan he saw <hi>Carthage</hi> all on flaming fier, calling to
<pb facs="4"/>
minde that the like mought happen to his owne countrey Rome in time to come. The vices that ouerflowed Fraunce at the beeginning of their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile warres are noted to bee these three, <hi>Magia, Atheismus, Libido,</hi> which I pray God England bee free from at this day. But I will no longer dwell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this argument, least my Epistle become to your honourable Lordship odious, and my booke bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in it selfe monstrous by hauing to great a head to so small a bodie, wherfore to returne to my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall purpose, hauing reduced the Historie of Fraunce, so farre as for the reasons aboue aledged I determined to proceede in it, I was soone resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to whom to dedicate these my simple labours, for hauing presented <hi>Comines</hi> to your Lordships predecessor, to whom could I fitlier consecrate this my continuaunce of his Historie then to your Lordship, being his successor in office, in honour, in gouernment, in Wisedome, and in all other vertues beelonging to a most worthie counsellour so that GOD hath raysed you vp vnder hir most excellent Maiestie, to bee no lesse famous in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Councell then others are in matters of warre, which <hi>Cicero</hi> as your Lordship knowerh preserreth farre beefore warly actions, beecause Councell preserueth the common welth without warrs, but warre cannot desend it without coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell. The handeling of the worke is meane I confesse, and too▪ vnworthie of so noble a patron: yet notwithstanding it contayneth the principall
<pb facs="4"/>
matters of state that passed in th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se parts by the space of three score yeares. Wherefore if your Lordship shall vouchsafe to accept it as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in the Scripture dyd the poore Widowes Mite: I shall thincke my selfe a happie man in hauing obtained the fruit of my desier, and shall daylie pray to Almightie GOD long to preserue your Lordship in all honor and felicitie, as well for the aduauncement of hir Maiesties seruice, as for the benefit of the whole common wealth.</p>
