   <p>Aboute the same tyme that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes had dryuen the Hunnes oute of Hungarie, it fortuned that one Aspar a noble man of greate power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye proclaymed hys sonne Arda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buris Ceaser agaynst Leo then Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure of Constantinople.

By meanes wherof it came to passe, that Italy and Rome became afterward the common pray of Barbarous kinges, so y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> he that coulde make hymslef strongest enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the possission therof. For Odoacer &amp; his Erules had scarcely yet fully set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled thēselues, when y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Easterngothes (who after the decease of Theodenur were now vnder y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gouernement of his sone Theoderich) enuying y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> prosperity of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Erules, &amp; therwith callyng to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce how their own country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mē the westerngothes had already cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Spayne, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Vandales Affricke, the Frenchmē, &amp; Burgonions Gallia, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Sarons Britaine, &amp; other nations o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleasant &amp; fertile coūtries, earnest<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly besought and required their king, to leade them into Italye to the entent as well to aduaunce the fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noune of their Cheuairie, as also to place thēselues in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> conntrye which as
<pb facs="9"/>it was the head and soueraine of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so had it also the report to be the most pleasant, welthie, and fertile of al the Regions of Europe. Theoderich albeit he were in manner constrained by his subiectes to doe the thinge that they requested, yet as one myndfull of the great benefites that his ancestours had receiued of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Emperours of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, and of the honorable enter tainement that he himselfe had had at suche tyme as he laye in hostage in the Emperours Court, he aduertised the Emperour Zeno therof, proreuing y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> he would doe nothing without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Zeno who at that tyme stood in feare of Theoderich and the Gothes, (as one that for doubte least he should grow to strong for him in that parte of Europe, was fully determined before, to haue profered that voiage vnto him though no such question had bene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) gladly condescended to his petitiō &amp; for the more honour created him Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Herevppon Theoderich and hys
<pb facs="10"/>countrimen with their wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren remoued into Italye. Of whose good successe and of the good successe of his posteritie in that countrie, togither with their expulsing or rather subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Imperialls, for as much as this Historie of Leonard Aretine doth at large entreate I will not be tedious in repeating the same. Howbeit it is to be vnderstanded that after the battell of Nuceria where Teias last kinge of the Gothes was slayne, althoughe some departed awaye wyth such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as they had according to couenant yet the greater part of them taryed stil: y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which degenerating into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> name of Italians, lost both their empyre &amp; own name for euer the lxxi. yere after their first cōming into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> coūtry vnder Theo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dorich, being y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> yere of grace CCCCC L.IIII. Nowe as concernynge the two noble and valiant captaines Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisarius and Narses the Conquerours and subduers of them, it is to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether the miserable misfortune
<pb facs="10"/>of the one by more to be lamented, or the vnaduisednesse and follye of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (if I maye terme the thyng accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to desert) be to be blamed. For Belifarius after that he had recouered Affricke from the Vandales, vanquis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the Persians, fought porsperously agaynste the Medes, abated the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and pulled downe the hygh cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of the Gothes openinge a waye of conquest to hys successour, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheued so many hault enterprises and Marciall exploytes that the gloryous fame of hys doynges did sprede hys re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne ouer all the worlde and made hys name immortall, in so muche that he was accompted as a perfecte and incomparable Mirrour for all Captaynes to beholde, and a verrye mayster of Cheualrye, whome neyther ambytion the common cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupter of noble hartes, nor the licentyous lybertye of the Campe, nor the instigatyons of myghtye
<pb facs="11"/>Princes could withdrawe from hys al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeans and promise made to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Iustinian. Was in the eude in hys olde dayes vppon lyghte suspicion wythoute proofe, by the same Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for whom he had so often put hys lyfe in perill: to whom he had acquired so muche honour, whose fauour he had estemed more then to raygne himselfe as an Emperour, depriued of both his eyes, and constrayned to begge hys bread miserably from doore to doore, an vnworthye rewarde for so manye good dedes and so muche good seruice done to the Empyre. And Narses the subduer of the Gothes and reducer of Italy to the Empyre when he had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned it quietlye manye yeres togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bys greate honour and admy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, at the laste (lyke a shrewd cow whyche when she hath geuen a good quantitie of mylke ouerthroweth the payle wyth her heele and spyllethe the same) prouoked onely by the presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous wordes of a vayne and enuious
<pb facs="11"/>woman, weued suche a web (according to his owne wordes) as neyther she nor the Emperour were able to weare oute, no nor he hymselfe to vnweaue agayne after he had ones putte it into the loome, thoughe he dyd the beste he could to haue stayed it, so hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult a matter is it to stoppe a mischief of the course, when it ones hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the reynes in the necke, and hathe set foote forward to runne the race. For the Lombardes beynge by hym in the extasie of his fumyshe rage called oute of Pannonie (which by that tyms was become the common receptacle of the enemyes of the Empyre) not onelye wythin shorte tyme after hys decease broughte Italye in subiection to them, but also syns that daye hytherto (why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thyng neyther the Gothes, Hsines Vandales, Erules, nor anye other of the barbarous nations with their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfolde and terrible assaultes were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to compasse and brynge to effecte) haue helde a portion thereof as a
<pb facs="12"/>perpetuall possession and inheritance to themselues, whych retaineth their name vnto this daye. But forasmuch as these thinges were done somewhat after the subduing of the Gothes, and doe lytle or nothinge pertaine to the presente purpose of thys Historie I will not stand any lenger vppon them, but remit the to the readynge of myne Author.</p>
