   <head>TO THE <hi>Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Doubt not, (courteous Reader), but you well remember, that, in the conclusion of my former Booke, I desired of him that would make Answere thereunto, these three things: First, that he would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere it, not by parts or peece-meales, but wholy and intirely, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, to the end. Secondly, that he would doe it, not superficially and sophistically, but substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, soundly, and satisfactorily, if he could. Thirdly, I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to doe it, as in love and Charitie, so also with an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, onely to follow Gods truth; and withall to set his name unto it, as I had done to that Booke of mine. But none of these requests hath this Answerer beene pleased to performe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. For, touching the first: he is so farre from answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole Booke, from the beginning of it to the end, that he hath endevoured to answere onely two Chapters thereof, namely the two Chapters, contayned in the first part of it, and no more: And whereas secondly I desired, a sound, sufficient, and satisfactory Answere to be made; he hath answered even to those two Chapters, (which himselfe selected to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere unto,) very sleightly, slenderly and superficially, and in no sorte substantially, soundly and satisfactory as shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appeare. And touching my third request, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of diverse branches, let any man judge, that hath seene
<pb facs="6"/> and read his Answere, whether it bee made, (as I desired) in a good, loving and Charitable manner, which would best have beseemed him: or, in a scoffing and deriding fashion, in sundrie places thereof, which doth no way become him: as also whether hee hath done it, with this affection, onely to follow Gods truth, or with an affection rather, to follow and advance mans errors and Constitutions, against a manifest divine truth: and lastly, what reason he had, not onely, not to set his owne right and true name unto it, but in steede thereof, to set a false, fictitious and counterfeit name, calling himselfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Stile.</hi> What? Is he ashamed of his owne right name? Or doe any use to get credite by putting a wrong name to their worke? But this is indeede, <hi>Dignum patella operculum:</hi> a false and counterfeite name, being fittest, &amp; most suteable to a false and counterfeite cause, which is the thing he maintayneth.</p>
   <p>Howbeit, as one desirous to excuse himselfe herein, he saith, that my requiring of the Answerer to put his name unto the Answere, is in effect asmuch, as to debarre any man from answering unto it: because of the Statute of <hi>2. Elizabeth,</hi> which doth, (saith he), bind mens tongues and pennes within this Kingdome, with the corde of a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> from oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Supremacie, eyther by word or writing. Whereunto I reply, that he that in answering is required to put his name to his answere, is so farre from being debarred from answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that cleane contrariewise, hee is thereby permitted to answere, (if hee please), so as he put his name thereunto. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth that Statute of <hi>2. Eliz.</hi> in this Kingdome, inflict the penaltie of a <hi>Praemunire</hi> for the first offence,<note place="margin">See the Statute of 2. Eliz. c. 1. in Ireland.</note> as he surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, but onely losse of goods and Chattels. It is indeede, after once conviction, for the second offence, a <hi>Praemunire:</hi> and for the third, High Treason. If then the penaltie of a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire,</hi> by that Statute, be the thing he feared, you see there was no cause for him to feare it, hee being never before convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb facs="6"/> or attaynted of that offence. And is it not strange, that he being a Lawyer, (as he saith he is,) and one of those, (as he likewise affirmeth,) that were debarred from pleading, for not taking the Oath of Supremacie, should neverthelesse be so ignorant in his owne profession, concerning that Statute, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though himselfe also cite it,) as not to know what the penaltie is, for the first offence therein? May not then his owne words be here rightly returned to his owne bosome, that seeing, in his owne facultie he sheweth no greater skill; Can it be imagined, that going out of his owne element, into the great Citie of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie, hee will doe any more, then the fish on the shoare, to gaspe a little for ayre? But admit, that for the first offence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Statute, the penaltie had beene a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> as hee conceived: Will he therefore bee so faint-hearted, in that his supposed Catholicke cause? How doth this agree with that, which he saith afterward, that an Angell or a Man, is bound by the instinct of Nature, to love God better then themselves? Yea, he observeth that in the Naturall bodie of Man, the hand will be content to loose it selfe, for the preservation of the head, and of the rest of the members: And that in the Politicke Body of the Common-weale, any good Subject will imbrace death for the conservation of his King, and the Common-weale: and thereupon he concludes, that so also should any good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian member of the Mysticall body of Christ, willingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go all disasters in the world, in attestation of his love to Christ, and of his willingnesse to preserve the honour and common good of his Church. And this motive, (saith he, in that his Epistle Dedicatorie,) made him, (though a Lawyer,) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose himselfe, for the defence of the Mysticall Body of Christ, and to answere, as he hath done, in the behalfe thereof. Now then doth it become him, who seemeth here to be so mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous and couragious in his cause, to shew himselfe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse so extreamely timorous, as for feare of a <hi>Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/> not to dare to set his right and true name unto that his Answere?</p>
   <p>Yea, the premises being well considered, what reason hath he to taxe me, (as sometimes he doth,) for that being a Lawyer by profession, I neverthelesse meddle in these matters of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and concerning Religion? For, I gave before, as I thinke, a sufficient Apologie for these my doings, in the Preface of my former Booke which he answereth not, nor is able to answere. And here I now may and doe further adde, that even this Man, (mine Adversarie) hath by his owne example justified me; inasmuch as he being likewise a Lawyer, (as himselfe affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth), doth neverthelesse, (as you see,) by his answering those two Chapters in my Booke, meddle in these matters of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and concerning Religion, aswell as I. And not onely his personall example, but the doctrine also, and reason he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth, (namely, that every good member of the Mysticall body of Christ, ought to interpose himselfe, for the defence of the honour of Christ, &amp; of his Church,) serveth very strongly to justifie my doings herein, not only as lawfull, but as requisite and necessarie, and such as in dutie ought not to bee omitted. But moreover, vvhy doth he Dedicate that his Answere, being a worke of Divinitie, to his dearest Countrie-men, <hi>The Lawyers of Ireland,</hi> if Lawyers had nothing to doe in these matters of Divinitie, or if the knowledge of things of that kind, did not belong unto them? Yea, who knoweth not, that Lawyers, and men of all professions and estates, have soules to save; and that at the houre of their death, it is not their skill or knowledge in Law, Physicke, or any other their worldly callings &amp; professions, (which serve onely but for this life,) that can doe them that good, or yeeld them that comfort touching the next world &amp; eternall happinesse, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Divinitie, and of Gods true Religion, and the care and observance thereof, in their life time, will be able to afford.</p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p>But being debarred frō pleading, for not taking the oath of <hi>Supremacie,</hi> he saith, he was desirous to reade, what solide ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments I had made to invest the King with the supremacie: &amp; finding them, (as <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> being weighed was found, in the Prophecie of <hi>Daniel,) minus habens,</hi> that is, too light,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.27.</note> he saith he was encouraged to answere them. But first, how cometh he now to answere any part of my Booke, who had said before in the same his Epistle Dedicatory, that he presented it to some of the most learned of his catholicke Clergie, &amp; that none of them after a mature deliberation, held it worthy of an answer? what? will he thinke it worthy of an answere, which those of the most learned of his Catholicke clergie thought it not worthy of? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if he had weighed my arguments, not with false Romish weights, but with true &amp; divine weights, that is, in such a bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, as God weighed <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> he would have found them weighty enough, though <hi>Belshazzar</hi> was found light. Thirdly, little reason hath he to call &amp; account those arguments light, somewhereof be such, as he dares not touch nor medle with thē, but doth, as childrē use to do, who, what they cānot reade, they skippe over: So, what he can no way answere, he pretermitteth: &amp; those which he dare be bold to touch, doe neverthelesse shew themselves to be of that weight and strength, as that he is not able to stirre, or move them, much lesse to remove them, or to lift them up from that ground, whereon they rest. Himselfe doth what he can, to answere them; yet distrusting his ovvne Answere, as <hi>minus habens,</hi> (to use his owne wordes against him,) that is, as being too light, weake, and insufficient, hee promiseth a more satisfying Answere that should afterward come forth from those that have more Lavv and Divinitie, then eyther he, or I. Yea, he saith againe, That my Booke shall be shortly answered, in my owne straine of Divinitie, with the three conditions required by me. So that, both by this his owne answere, as also by that further future promised answere, it is
<pb facs="8"/> verie c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>dent, that howsoe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">

      </gap>
      <hi>revera,</hi> and indeede, they thinke the force and strength of it to be such, against both Pope, and Poperie, as that they can have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>, nor quiet in their mindes, untill they have made, (which they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>never be able to doe,) a good, sufficient, and satisfactorie Answere thereunto. As for that hee saith, that if in steed thereof, I had made a solide Compendium of the Law, I had gained an applause: I would have him know, that neyther in this kind of learning, nor in any other, doe I seeke o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> hunt after ostentation, vaine-glory, popular applause, or prayse of men, (which be the things, that Papists in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings doe too much affect,) but both in that my former worke, &amp; in this also, the things that I sought &amp; still doe seeke after, is Gods glory, &amp; the advancement, &amp; preferment of his truth &amp; religion, &amp; the due authority, &amp; true honour belonging to our most gracious, &amp; most godly &amp; Christian Soveraigne, which was then K. <hi>Iames,</hi> &amp; is now K. <hi>Charles</hi> his most worthy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, whom God ever blesse, protect, &amp; preserve: &amp; therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the generall &amp; publicke benefit both of Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale. I graunt that my profession and place, would have allowed me, to have written of points of Law, and concerning Civill Iustice, and externall Peace: But I have rendered the reason in the Epistle Dedicatorie of my former Booke, why I medled not with those things, Namely, because the pretended Catholickes of this Kingdome, in those points, shewed no refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarinesse or opposition, but good conformitie and obedience: And, that, their defect was onely in the two other points, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Concerning the Kings <hi>Supremacie,</hi> and the <hi>Religion:</hi> whereof therefore, there then was, &amp; still is, greatest neede, and most urgent occasion to treate. Wherefore, hee that in such a Case, would rather have had a Compendium of the Law, then these two most necessarie, and most important matters to bee
<pb facs="8"/> dealt in for the generall good of the kingdome, seemeth in my understanding, to have made a great <hi>dispendium</hi> of his wit and judgement.</p>
   <p>Neverthelesse hee proceedeth, and saith, that because hee cannot commaund the Presse, he will imploy his endevours, to answere, in a Manuscript, my first Booke; (he meaneth the first part of my Booke, contayning those two Chapters aforesaid:) But what necessitie was there for him thus to publish his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere in a Manuscript, which he might have put in Print, if he had so pleased? For, although he could not commaund the Protestants Presse (neyther was it fit, he should), yet the Presse, which some say, the Papists have of their owne, within this kingdome, he might have eyther commaunded or intreated: or if they have no Presse within this kingdome, he might have sent or carried his Answere unto <hi>Doway,</hi> or to <hi>Rhemes,</hi> or to some other place beyond the Seas, where it might have beene printed, if they had held it worthy the Printing. Seeing then that hee might have printed it; Why did he rather choose to divulge it in a Manuscript? Did he thinke, that by that course used, he might the more freely speake and write what he listed, and that no man would answere or reply unto it, though he be never so much touched in it, or be the cause, therein handled, of never so great importance? But what reason is there for any man, to clayme, expect, or to be allowed such a priviledge? Yea, inasmuch as mens hearts may be poysoned, and seduced, aswell by Manuscripts, and written Bookes and Pamphlets, as by those that be Printed, especially after they be once scattered and dispersed abroad, (as this his Answere is), into diverse mens hands, and are withall supposed by the pretended Catholickes, (for whose sake all that labour is bestowed), to contayne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth: I see not but I may bee as bold to reply to his Manuscript, in Print, (the cause also so requiring), as he made bold to answere a part of my Printed Booke, in a Manuscript.
<pb facs="9"/> And therefore have I here replied unto it, partly in respect of my selfe, whom it concerneth to justifie, and make good the matter contayned in those two Chapters of my former Booke, which he oppugneth: and partly in respect of himselfe, vvho seemeth to be <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> suffertus,</hi> &amp; over highly conceited of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,<note place="margin">Prover. 26.5.</note> whom therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Proverbs adviseth to answere: and partly &amp; chiefely in respect of the pretended Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes of this Nation, whom by that meanes he seeketh to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce &amp; abuse, in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ints both of his Majesties <hi>Supremacie,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Religion:</hi> Both which points, (they being so high and eminent), it behooveth all good Christians, and all good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, evermore carefully &amp; dutifully to defend and mantaine. As for that godly, learned, Reverend, and worthy Bishoppe of <hi>Meath,</hi> whom my Adversary mentioneth in his Epistle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorie: I shall neede to say nothing of him, because himselfe will ever be best able to speake for himselfe, whensoever anie shall shew themselves in opposition against him.</p>
   <p>But to proceede with mine Adversary, if he be, (as he saith he is) debarred from pleading for not taking the Oath of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie;</hi> Whom can he blame therein, but himselfe, for his so unjust refusing to take so just an Oath? Against which throughout all his answere, himselfe neyther sheweth, nor is able to shew any good exception: which, no doubt, hee would there have shewed, where the <hi>Supremacie</hi> was purposely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, if he had beene able to have shewed it. But to make him yet the more in excusable, (if he will still be obstinate, which I would have, neyther him, nor any others to be), I have here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at large declared, the right of the Kings Supremacie, over all manner of Persons, and in all kindes of causes, <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall</hi> aswell as <hi>Civill,</hi> for his, &amp; all other mens most ample and most full satisfaction in that point. And yet my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie saith, That he will Arme himselfe with little Divinitie, and lesse Philosophie, to enter the lists against mee: which
<pb facs="9"/> though it be spoken, (after the Papisticall manner), proudly, scornefully, and like another <hi>Goliah;</hi> yet therein hee speaketh truer then he was aware of. For not to speake of his Philosophy, (which he sheweth indeede to be verie little), this my Reply to his Answere, will discover him to be as very a Punie in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie, (as touching any good skill, or found judgement, in it), as he is in Law. In somuch that upon reading of this Booke, his answere will appeare to be as good as no Answere, yea that it had beene better for his cause, if hee had beene silent, and spoken nothing in it: Such is the advantage that truth ever getteth against falshood, when falshood dare be so bold, to stand in opposition against it. As for the multitude of his idle words, his many needelesse Sillogismes, his extravagant sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and impertinent discourses, I passe them over, for the most part, not vouchsafing an Answere to them: they being inserted, but to fill up paper, to mispend time, and vainely to delight and please himselfe, and his followers. But where he hath alledged any thing that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> materiall, and pertinent to the cause, and of weight, or moment, to that have I answered and replied, as was fit I should. In which my reply, I have conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, not as he is <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Stile,</hi> (for in that respect, <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Downe,</hi> had beene fittest to reply unto him) but as one that is an Adversarie to that Cause I propounded in my former Booke, whatsoever his name, or profesion bee. And therefore doe I not so much answere the Man, as the matter by him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and alledged.</p>
   <p>Now then, although these be the Workes of a Lay-Man, yet if you find truth in them, esteeme them never the worse, because of that: For, <hi>non quis dicat, sed quid dicatur, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de:</hi> saith <hi>Isocrates</hi> to <hi>Demonicus.</hi> And,<note place="margin">Gerson de exam. doctr Panor. tit. de Elect.

            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap> proferenti, quam, vel Papae, vel toti
<pb facs="10"/> simul Concilio.</hi> For my part, I desire no further to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, then that shall be found true that I write: neyther ought any others in their writings, (he they professed Divines, or whosoever else,) any further to be beleeved, then so. And yet if that would any thing the more prevayle with the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Catholickes, I can assure them, that the Positions and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in both these Bookes of mine delivered, be the Positions, and Doctrine, not onely of one, but of many (and those lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) professed Divines, as is to be seene at large in their sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie workes and writings, extant against the Papists: which the Papists were never yet able, nor ever will be able substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and soundly to refell, and confute. And therefore, I have no cause to be ashamed of my Teachers, but doe thinke it rather honour and reputation, freely, ingeniously, and thankefully, to acknowledge, as I doe, where, &amp; of whom, I have learned these things. But, having thus answered his Epistle Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, I now proceede to that which followeth.</p>
