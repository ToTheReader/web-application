   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing finished my <hi>SAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTVARIE,</hi> and finding it to haue taken roote and life for some conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; I could not conceiue any better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of those houres, which I haue resolued to sequester for exercises in this kinde; then in making my conceptions legible vpon those Psalmes of DAVID, which liuely describe, both the forme
<pb facs="3"/>
and the force of true repentance. Partly in regard of the generall dignity of the whole Booke of Psalmes, largely extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by many; but chiefly in regard of the eminent excellency of these Penitentiall Psalmes, which heereafter I entend particularly to declare. And heerein I aime at no priuate end, but <hi>designe,</hi> and <hi>resigne</hi> my endeuors wholly to the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of the All-powerfull GOD: to whom <hi>Glory</hi> is so proper, that nothing is more repugnant to reason, then either not to attribute it to him, or to seeke to draw it to our selues.</p>
   <p>For albeit GOD, who is all fulnesse and perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ction, cannot receiue accesse or increase; yet by praysing and blessing his exteriour workes, we enlarge and spread his glory to others. This praise and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, because we cannot incorporate into his essence, whereto no addition can bee
<pb facs="3"/>
made: we are sayd to attribute to his NAME. For the NAME of a thing is separate, and externall from the thing which it serueth to signifie; and neither a part nor of the substance therof.</p>
   <p>But we on the other side, are inwardly hollow and empty, and alwaies wanting some amendment. Wherefore we haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to doe to labour in repairing that. We must not play our part for exteriour shewes; but inwardly, within our selues, where no eies shine but our owne. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we shalbe like to an Egge long coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with salt; the shell wherof wilbe faire and sound, but the inward substance alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether consumed. Or like an vnwise hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-starued beggar; more desirous of a faire garment, then of necessary meat. Hee who seekes himselfe abroade; who regardes more what hee is to
<pb facs="4"/>
to others, then to himselfe; who doth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, because he would be so esteemed; shall neuer produce profitable effect. As the intention is vaine, so wilbe the euent. But if constantly wee pursue reason and piety, let approbation of others follow if it please: as neither vainly desired, so not rigidly to be contemned.</p>
   <p>Much lesse must they expect any benefit by their trauailes, who retire themselues to priuate studies. For they liue not out of themselues, they study not other mens humours, they applie not their thoughts to the time. And this is the reason wherfore many well esteemed for sufficiency, whose vertue forbids them to be base, hang vnder the wheele, and cannot aduance. Yea, sometimes it happeneth, that whilest they are most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly busied, men of scornefull and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
<pb facs="4"/>
ignorance, separate from all imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table qualities or endeauours, will be nimble to nippe from them such small matters as they haue.</p>
   <p>I confesse I haue beene bitten by some such Vipers; who thinke nothing suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that they haue, nothing dishonest that they doe. But I enuie not the grauell in any mans throat. It sufficeth for mee that I haue attained a quiet contented life, free either from anguish in my selfe, or enuie at others: free either from wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great matters, or wanting some small: a life fit for serious cogitations.</p>
   <p>The rich compositions of Ancient times, I reuerence and admire; they doe not only satisfie, but astonish mee. I see them not to the depth, but I see them so farre, that I conceiue the farthest reach of our age cannot neerely approach
<pb facs="5"/>
them. Of my owne productions, neuer any did fully content mee, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of others is no warrant to my owne iudgement; tender and seuere in what I doe. They may happily bee somewhat sprinkled ouer, but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly died, I conceiue they are not. And in case any thing be excusable in them, it is not in regard of themselues, but in comparison of some other form-lesse vnsinewie writings; whereto notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I finde good allowance to bee giuen. Assuredly, knowing my owne ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and defects, I wonder much at the constant assurance of many others.</p>
   <p>But modestie forbids vs to speake good or ill of our selues. I haue heere vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken a difficult taske, in writing vpon these high parts of Scripture. I did put forth two of these psalmes at the first, for
<pb facs="5"/>
an assay, as before I did the like in my <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> And finding some accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I haue now added a third: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to proceede in some of the rest. And wherein I finde no encouragement from others, I will remaine satisfied with my owne contentments For by entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my thoughts in these sweet retreits, how many tedious and friuolous cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions haue I auoyded? How many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities and discontentments haue I therein buried? Let others hungerly hunt after fauour and wealth, the common drudgery of the world: let them spend their spirit and honestie in vnciuill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminings. I desire and pray, that this heauenly harmony may alwayes ring in my eares; that I may close the last pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of my life with one of these songs of Sion.</p>
