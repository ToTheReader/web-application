   <head>TO THE FRIENDLY READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause this Historie (friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reader) was translated at the first, and now at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent imprinted and set foorth for thy only benefit: I thought best to recommend it rather to the Readers correction, then vnto any mans particular protection. For as I cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise thinke, but diuerse and sundrie errors are in the translating by me committed, necessary by thee to be corrected: so do I assure my selfe the Historie is so excellent, as it needeth not to be protected. For whether is to be considered the man in his honorable vertues, or the matter with her rare and diuerse properties, you shall find both the one and the other able to protect themselues, and euery way satisfie thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. For both the which I will say no more then I find written by the French author, that the Historie is most true, and not deuised, according to the vanities of former ages, but
<pb facs="3"/>
being as it were buried in a straunge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen language is reuiued from that obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie by his trauailes, and presented vnto the Reader in his own tongue through my paines. VVhereof seeing thou art to reape the fruit, I doubt not but ye will accept and yeelde mee thankes for the same. I will not trouble thee with a vaine commendation of the famous Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan, who being amongest the worthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, as the sunne with the other starres, shall in the reading of this Historie shine vnto thee his owne vertues. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. From my house the xv. day of October. 1597.</p>
