   <head>The Translator to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous-minded English Scholler, and the indifferent READER.</head>
   <p>MY Muse being not inclined (according to the custome of these times) to the inuention of scandalous or reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue Inuectiues, by way of Epigram or Satyre, either for the disgorging of my stomake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any, (though occasion doth excite mee to reproue many from whom I haue receiued insufferable iniuries) or otherwise to carpe at the notorious humours and vices of particular persons that neuer offended me, onely for os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of my wit; but rather desirous to spend my vacant houres, and imploy the poore portion of my little learning, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally for the good admonition and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vicious, and instruction of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
<pb facs="7"/>I haue aduentured (as formerly of the Schoole-book inscribed with the name of <hi>Cato</hi>) to make interpretation of these Epigrams, which (notwithstanding they were for the most part, the fruits of <hi>Virgils</hi> minority, being by him composed at his age of 15. yeeres, as I note in his life written by <hi>Donatus</hi>) doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine such variety of good doctrine, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite inuentions, that to me they seeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue beene brought forth in his Maio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when Learning, Iudgement and Wit in him were most mature, or else the greatest number of them to haue issued (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> and other Commentors conceiue) from the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned heads of more ancient Poets. And for that cause I haue punctually obserued the peculiar titles of these Epigrams as they stand in the last edition of the Latine, without addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or alteration of any Authors name, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering withall, that to know the workeman is not so materiall, or so much to be inquired and regarded, as the benefit and good vse of the worke it selfe: and as in meates the wholsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is more to be wished then the toothsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so in bookes, the goodnesse of the matter is to bee preferred before the eloquence of the phrase.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>But here some selfe-conceited <hi>Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> being conditioned like the dog in the manger, neither willing to bestow their owne studies in translating such worke, nor permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others, without a snarling reproofe, to performe that part, will peraduenture tax and accuse me (as they haue done) of doing iniury to Learning, by making it so common, that now adaies they can discourse or deliuer nothing of worth out of Latine Writers, but the Hearer (though the Latinist) is ready to take the tale by the end, as one that knowes already no lesse then themselues, and that Learning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is vilified, and daily groweth out of request with many, who when their sonnes haue spent some time at Schoole, to keepe them out of the durt (as they say) and from hurt and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, choose rather to binde them Apprentice to deceitfull trades, and mechanike handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts, then to place them in the Vniuersity, where with their yeeres they might increase in discipline, and consequently become good members of the Church or Common-wealth.</p>
   <p>To these, I answer, that not onely in mine owne opinion, but by the approbation of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall (and those profound) Schollers, whose workes extant doe witnesse it, this custome of
<pb facs="8"/>translating doth rather Right then Wrong to Learning. For the knowledge of good disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline ought not to be kept priuate or restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, like treasure in a misers chest, in the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a few, but like the element of water, should be publike and vsefull for all men. And Parents by this meanes of translating, finding what excellent matters are comprized in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Authors, doe admire and fall in loue (as I may say) with the worth of Learning, and thereupon doe seeke to furnish their children with what they see wanting in themselues, hoping that the like fruit may be produced by their future studies, and that at length the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers obscure family may (as hath beene lately knowne, and some Latine Authors testifie) be ennobled by their sonnes aduancement. And thus hauing briefly and plainely, forthe better vnderstanding of the vnlearned, yet I hope suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently apologized for this my translation, I leaue you to peruse it.</p>
