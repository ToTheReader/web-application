   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Haue published this Pamphlet, to let my rich debtors vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that as often as I meete them, I doe looke that they should pay mee: and although I am shamefaste in not asking my due, yet I would not haue them shamelesse in detaining it from
<pb facs="7"/>
me, because the summes are but small, and very easie for them (in generall) to pay, and would do me a particular good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</p>
   <p>Secondly, I haue sent this into the world, to informe some, that through their want doe shun and auoid my sight and company, that they are much deceiued in my disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for I euer did esteeme an honest heart and a willing minde, as well as their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, there are some great men, who by reason of their extraordinary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, my small acquaintance, and lesse meanes of accesse vnto them, with my
<pb facs="7"/>
want of impudencie, and their mens want of courtesie to informe them, all these are lets, and demurres, against my satisfaction</p>
   <p>Lastly, the daily abuses that I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the booke of my Trauels, wherein I am accused for lies, and falsifications; but I doe and euer will stedfastlie stand to the truth of euery title of it, except the a-buse that I did to Maister <hi>Hilton</hi> at <hi>Daintree,</hi> &amp; that was not done on known malice neither, but on blinde ignorant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: and there is a second Edition of my bookes of <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>auels comming foorth, wherein I will Satyrize, Cauterize, and Stigmatize all the whole kennell of curres
<pb facs="8"/>
that dares maliciouslie snarle against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, apparant, and well knowne truths. In the meane space, you that are my deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, if you please to pay me, you shall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in put your selues out of a bad number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which you yet are placed: if you will not pay me, take this bone to gnaw vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That I doe hope to be euer better furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with mony, then you shall be with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie.</p>
