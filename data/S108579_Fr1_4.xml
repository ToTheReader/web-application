      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He charge you sustaine is great, and glorious. What is
more magnificent amongst men, then for one, to haue
authoritie ouer manie: to giue lawes, and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
to gouerne the sea, the land, peace, and warre?
This dignitie seemeth a certaine kind of diuinitie, and
so it is indeed, if it be exercised, for the profite, &amp; good
of the Common wealth. But how hard a thing it is, both reason, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
do teach vs. If we looke into reason: of what difficultie is it, for
so many heads to be brideled by one head, and that vniuersall multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
vnquiet, disunited, seditious, to be moderately brought vnder a
certaine common yoke of obedience? If we regard examples, how few
haue bene found, from the beginning of the world, who haue exercised
and discharged themselues of this charge, with commendation? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is a thing of more importance, then the ignorant sort do deeme, to
hold a direct course in this troublesome sea, and in the height of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
not to be carried away with the winds of immoderat libertie. How
manie vertues, are there required, by the which (as it were with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers)
this ship is held? How manifold wisedome, whereby (as with a
helme) it is gouerned? So that I may most truely say, it is a hard thing
for man, to rule ouer man: neither is it possible to be brought to passe,
by the wit of one alone. Wherfore those wise men are worthely prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
who in former age, and at this day, haue had this care, to haue gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
kings, by the light of their wholsome counsels. For wherein could
they possibly do better seruice to mankind? To set down some precepts
concerning maners, or sciences, deserueth praise, and there is good vse
thereof: and is it not a matter of more worth to do the like in a kingdom,
&amp; Ciuill gouernement? when as by that, some one citizen only, is made
better, and more learned: by this, in one, all others. Surely it is euen so.
We that are commanded, are linked together as it were with a straight
chaine, with him that commandeth. And as the mind in mans bodie,
cannot either be whole, or diseased, but the functions thereof in like
maner, are either vigorous, or do languish: euen so is the Prince, in this
<pb facs="6"/>
societie. Doth he leade vs the way to vertue? we followe. To vice? we
encline thither. Liueth he an honest, and blessed life? we flourish. Is he
vnfortunate? we decline, or runne to ruine with him. And as the light
or darknesse in this world below proceedeth frō the sunne: so the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of good or euill in the subiects, is deriued from the prince. <hi>Cesar</hi>
said no lesse stoutly,<note place="margin">Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>an. 5.</note> then truly, that <hi>all do follow the affections of great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>
Mankind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> in a few.</hi> Therefore this is a notable reason, that to
deserue well of the Common-wealth, we ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> to deserue well of our
Prince▪ that is, we ought to guide, and direct him, to this marke of the
common profit. For (be not ye (ô princes) led away with error) this is
your end. You haue preheminence ouer men, but it is for the benefite
of men: neither are you onely, Lords, and Iudges of matters, but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones,
and stewards.</p>
   <p>They are euill, and wicked Princes, who in a kingdome, thinke vpon
nothing else, but the commandement they haue, being arrogant, and
idle, and who do imagine, they are not giuen to their subiects, but their
subiects to them. For like as the starres receiue light, yet for the vse of
mortal men: so do you your dignities, but yet tied to a charge &amp; office.
The Common-wealth by God, and men, is deliuered into your bosome:
yea it is in deed laide in your bosome, but to th'end it may be cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
O rightly is that Prince iust, &amp; lawful, who in his greatest felicitie,
had not rather heare men say, that he is mightie, then that he is good:
and who knoweth, how to conioyne two most diuerse things, <hi>Modestie,</hi>
and <hi>Prudence</hi> together. Who when he walketh abroad, men do striue to
behold, as it were some fauourable, and beneficiall godhead: and being
indifferent betweene loue, and aw, and changing oft their iudgements,
do doubt, whether they should salute him as their Lord, or as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
These are those worthie things (ô Princes) which bring safetie, to
the which both those of former age, &amp; my selfe do call you. Giue vs the
hearing. Neither do you for this reason despise our counsels, because
you are aboue our commandements. For as it is a most happie thing in
a prince, not to be compelled. So is it a miserable thing in him, not to
be perswaded. I confesse, ye haue those about you, that do dayly yeeld
you, plentie of their counsell: but would to God they gaue alwayes
faithfull and good counsell. Alphonsus that worthie amongst kings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked, who were the best Counsellers? answered the dead; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
thereby good authors, and such other monuments, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
flattering at all, nor keeping any thing secret, do lay open the pure
and simple troth. The which that it may sticke fast in your memories: &amp;
that you may either knowe by my meanes, or acknowledge with me,
those things that are of best worth, I do from the bottome of my heart
pray vnto thee, who art the eternall veriue. Fare ye well.</p>
