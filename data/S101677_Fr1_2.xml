   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE <hi>HENRY,</hi> Earle of <hi>Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> Viscount <hi>Bulbecke,</hi> Lord <hi>Sanford</hi> and <hi>Scales,</hi> and Lord Great-Chamberlaine of ENGLAND.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Honourable Lord, I neuer affected flattery, if I had I should now haue beene much disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; for your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble worth exceeds what I can say. To particularize your honourable Titles, or here to blazon your excellencies were needlesse, and shall rather be printed in my faithfull heart, then published by my ruder pen; especially vpon the dedication of so slight a subiect. Sir, I haue long waited
<pb facs="3"/>
for opportunity, &amp; this great while whipt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion on, whereby I might tender some open testimonie of my loue, before I dye, which may remaine as a perpetual memoriall of my euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoted seruice. To that end (my Lord) I haue runne backe into my younger yeares, to summon the delights of my able youth, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the fruits of my more experienced age, (comprised within a few leaues) to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your Lordships leasure, and humbly to craue your Honours patronage. To arrogate to my selfe by an immoderate commendation of the Worke, were poore: to derogate too much from it through modesty, were as silly: Therefore (not to be excessiue in the one, nor too liberall in the other) I would (with your honourable fauour) doe you thus much to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand: As for the subiect it is not waighty (being but a Treatise of sport) and to attend and to giue place to your Lordships honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affaires, and more serious imployments; but as for the handling of the Subiect (I dare, and will boldly say and auerre) it is good: Nay, I will submit my selfe to partiall censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb facs="3"/>
vpon due triall, and bazard my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon true iudgement. My Lord, I frame not my wauering surmizes vpon probabilities of <hi>sic dicunt;</hi> but I ground my constant opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion vpon certainty of <hi>probatum est:</hi> Nor can I quote any Author but my selfe; and out of my owne industrious experiments I (first) extracted my owne conclusions: I reape no mans haruest, but plough with my owne Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. In fine, I here dedicate to your Lordship the delights of my Childe-hood, the pleasures of my youth, the experiments of my age, my faithfull (though painefull) labours, my fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (though slight) indeauours, myselfe, my continuall seruice and obseruance to your truely-noble Selfe, humbly requesting your Honour not to be ashamed to Patronize that which your seruant is not afraid to present: And that shall crowne my poore indeauours, and giue my labours an eternall <hi>sufficit;</hi> and make me euer rest</p>

      <signed>Your Lordships humbly deuoted, EDMVND BERT.</signed>
