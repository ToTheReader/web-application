   <head>The Epistle to the generall and gentle Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough (generall reader) the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this worst part of this last age hath conuerted all things to such vildnesse that whatsoeuer is truely good is now esteemed most vitious, learning being derided, fortitude drawne into so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions that it consisteth in meere words onely, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though nothing is happy or prosperous, but meere fashion &amp; ostentation, a tedious fustian-tale at a great mans table, stuft with bigge words, with out sence, or a mimicke Iester, that can play three parts in one; the Foole, the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar and the Parasit, yet notwithstanding in this apostate age I haue aduentured to thrust into the world this booke, which nothing at all belongeth to the silken scorner, but to the plaine russet Husbandman, for whose par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular benefit, and the kingdomes generall profit, I haue with much paine, care<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and industry, passed through the same. Now for the motiues which first drew me to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the worke, they were diuers: as first, when I saw one man translate and paraphrase most excellently vpon <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils Georgickes,</hi> a worke onely belonging to the Italian climbe, &amp; nothing agreeable with ours another translates <hi>Libault</hi> &amp; <hi>Steuens,</hi> a worke of infinit excellency, yet one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper and naturall to the French, and not to vs: and
<pb facs="4"/>
another takes collections from <hi>Zenophon,</hi> and others; all forrainers and vtterly vnacquainted with our climbes: when this I beheld, and saw with what good liking they were entertained of all men; and that euery man was dumbe to speake any thing of the <hi>Husbandry</hi> of our owne kingdome, I could not but imagine it a worke most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to men, and most profitable to the kingdome, to set downe the true manner and nature of our right English <hi>Husbandry,</hi> our soyle being as delicate, apt, and fit for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease as any forraine soyle whatsoeuer, and as farre out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going other kingdomes in some commoditie, as they vs in other some. Hence, and from these considerations, I began this worke, of which I haue here sent thee but a small tast, which if I finde accepted, according to mine intent, I will not cease (God permitting mee life) to passe through all manner of English <hi>Husbandry</hi> and <hi>Huswifery</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, without omission of the least scruple that can any way belong to either of their knowledges. Now gentle reader whereas you may be driuen to some amazement, at two titles which insue in the booke, namely, a former part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first, and the first part, you shall vnderstand that those first sheetes were detained both from the Stationer and me, till the booke was almost all printed; and my selfe by extreame sicknesse kept from ouer-viewing the same, wherefore I must intreate your fauour in this impression and the rather in as much as there wanteth neither any of the words or matter whatsoeuer: <hi>Farewell.</hi>
