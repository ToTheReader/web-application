      <hi>A</hi> Preface declaring the great benefit of Speech and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the order of this Treatise.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD (who hath so well disposed and ordered the course of nature in all his creatures,) as hee hath made man his chiefest and set him ouer all the rest of his creaturs of the earth, hauing endued him with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny graces aboue the rest, as wisedome, knowledge, reason, vnderstanding, and the like; euen as so many springs and riuers issuing from the Ocean of his infinit wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: So also that nothing might be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nothing superfluous in such a worthy creature, hath giuen him diuers outward
<pb facs="3"/>
meanes and sences so excellent, meete and conuenient, not onely for the nourishment and preseruation of his owne body (as they are likewise to other creatures) but also as well for the maintenance and increase of those inward graces wherewith hee is so adorned, as for the imployment of them and shewing and setting them foorth to other men to whom he hath not giuen the same measure; whereby he may be glorified of all men as their gracious and glorious Creator, all men may be glorified in him as his chiefest creatures: And to that end as he hath giuen man a reasonable soule to iudge and discerne, so also that all his knowledge, all his graces might not lie hid and smothered in his owne breast, he hath giuen him a voice composed with more rarenesse then in any other of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherby he may expresse the thoughts of his heart, may praise and pray to his God, may teach and instruct others in that which hee knoweth aboue other men, may aske aduise &amp; councell of others in that he knoweth not, and generally all may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate and confer together, as well tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb facs="3"/>
spirituall matters fit for the soule, as concerning all other things necessary in our worldly affaires: yet although the voice of man be of such needfull vse, that without it mans mind were but as in a dungeon, and in perpetuall thraldome of the body for the time of its being in this earthly habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if there were no other helpe then tht voice to expresse the mind: man could not be the better for any thing that should bee taught or spoken of no longer then the very words were speaking, or at the longest, but whilest our weake memories could retaine the very matter spoken of, and so it might easily be foreseene how soone all the labors of vs and our forefathers would perish, how quickly the wise councells, witty and graue sayings of the learned would be forgotten. The Princes in euery age (though in one and the same kingdome) would haue a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kind of ruling, the subiects a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent course of liuing, both the Princes and people a different and new course of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. All our doings, all our sayings, all our customes, and all our manners would be buried in obliuion.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
Then how vncertaine our estates would be, how vncomfortable our selues, how dangerous and pernicious it would be for the state of euery common-wealth, all men may easily iudge, yet God to preuent these inconueniences, for the further benefit of mankind, as hee hath giuen vs a voice to expresse the minde vnto the eare, so hee hath giuen vs hands to frame letters or markes for the voice to expresse the minde vnto the eyes. So that the eyes and eares are as it were the receiuers of message sent vnto the heart, the hands and voice as deliuerers of message sent from the heart: And though the voice be a more liuely kind of speech, yet in respect it is but onely a sleight accident made of so light a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance as the ayre, it is no sooner vttered but it is dissolued, euery simple sound doth expell and extinguish the sound going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, so that the eare can haue but one touch of the ayre beating vpon it to declare the speech vnto the mind: but the hand though it giue a dumbe and a more dull kind of speech, yet it giues a more dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A letter is a grosser substance, and
<pb facs="4"/>
therefore is of more continuance then a sound: what is once written still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth though the hand ceaseth. If the eyes haue not satisfied the mind at one view, they may looke on it againe, yea till they haue satisfied it's desire: And by this meanes of noting and charactring of the voice, all things worthy of memory are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from the iniury of forgetfulnesse; whereby is left vnto vs from most ancient times of our forefathers the most holy will of God, besides many necessary doctrines of godly and religious men, many excellent sayings both diuine and morrall, many hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane policies, counsells, and instructions, written by wise and learned men, together with diuers behoofefull arts and worthy sciences, which are hereby as in a sure treasury preserued, maintained and daily increased to the glory of almighty God, and continuall benefit and comfort of vs and our posterity. Of these two excellent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits the first being naturall, is by nature of euery man with a little vse easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, the other being artificiall cannot be perfectly framed vntill the true reason,
<pb facs="5"/>
order, and distinct parts of the former be first found out and knowne; the want of knowledge whereof, hath caused both in speech and writing, many imperfections and errors, as sometimes taking one simple sound of mans voice to be two, at other times taking two, three, or fower simple sounds to be but one, and according to that mistaken order fitting letters for them, whereby writing is thereby in some part made defectiue, besides by many other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors vsed therein, as by misplacing of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, contrary to the order wherein they are pronounced, inserting of superfluous let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where there is no need, nor any sound at all expressed for them, making one let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter serue for two different sounds, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for one and sometimes for another; and contrariwise, vsing for one and the same sound at sometimes one letter, at other times another letter, not proper ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, but to some other different sound in mans voice: by which confused order the speech is so darkely set downe, that our words in speaking seeme as a different kind of language to the same in writing. So that
<pb facs="5"/>
though by a common vse and beaten pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice euery particular nation can explaine themselues and pronounce their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per speech by their owne manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, yet it is so intricate to a stranger of another country, that he can neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their speech by their writing, nor write their speech according to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by hearing of it spoken, whereby no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Dictionary or Grammer hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been made, that the true order of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation might be taught, either to such as are desirous of the skill of languages, or to children, or such as are altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in reading and writing of their owne mother tongue. Besides a great inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which by some I haue vnderstood (and doubtlesse it is likely) to haue happened in the ancient learned tongues, Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine, which though they are written and imprinted in all parts, wherein they are in vse, by one and the same order of letters, yet in vtterance of them in speech, they are so diuersly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that men of different nations (though therein very learned) cannot
<pb facs="6"/>
one suddenly vnderstand the other in any argument, or conference had betweene them in any of those languages, euery one of them inclining to the manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of their owne country speech. Hence also it hath come to passe, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all nations of the earth came from one root, our first father <hi>Adam,</hi> and that God had giuen them all the same forme of body, the like sences, and for their voyce all instruments alike: (howsoeuer he had dispersed them into seuer all parts and habitations) yet the people of one kingdom in their learning of the language of any other nation haue not in many yeers, yea some in the whole course of their life haue not attained to such exact and perfect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation therein, nor so framed their mouthes in speaking but that they might easily be discerned and discouered to be strangers of another Country: Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing in other sciences lesse vsefull, the professors of them haue set them downe in exact propositions; I cannot see (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally considering how necessary a thing true pronuntiation is both for the grace of the
<pb facs="6"/>
speech, as for the commodity and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it may beget to the common-wealth as well at home, as in commerce and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique had in forraine parts with other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by conferring with them in their own languages) how in this it can be accounted vnnecessary to seeke a meanes whereby to remedy these manifold abuses and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in speech and writing, which are the grounds by which all other knowledges are taught and maintained, That by some ruled arte the true pronuntiation of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages might be learned, which hitherto is taught either by roat, or written in such a confused manner as cannot but seeme vnreasonable to any mans vnderstanding, howsoeuer allowed of and approued by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of custome. But here perchance I may be charged with presumption both in respect of my selfe, and in respect of my yeers, in that I professe to be a teacher of a science to others, hauing as it were but newly learned my letters my selfe: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I answer, that I learned not this my arte out of the books and workes of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, neither would my small meanes
<pb facs="7"/>
afford me to be acquainted with their great volumes, only out of a volume of Gods owne guift and making did I take this small Manuscript, euen to all men hath he giuen one of the same impression, whereby the truth hereof may be examined: yet certainly the vnripenesse of my yeeres, and want of other learning, had wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held me from the publishing thereof, so that it might haue died with my selfe and haue benefited no man, had I not cōsidered that euery one of what estate, degree, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soeuer, is bound in ducty to reueale whatsoeuer may be beneficiall to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; assuring my-selfe that God doth not giue either knowledge or riches to any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate person meerly for his owne particular vse, but imploieth those on whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth such guifts, as Cisternes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits to conuey and impart them likewise to others. Yet he therein so prouideth that themselues also be neuer empty. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration therefore caused me to thinke it were far better, though with boldnesse to set foorth that portion of knowledge which God had giuen me, then with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard-like
<pb facs="7"/>
feare for the causes afore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to conceale the benefit; Hauing therefore laboured to finde out the true ground of the speech, that the manifold errors therein might be made manifest, and so auoided. To the intent I might in such sort as God had enabled me, doe some-what for the common good of my Country, and adde something to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, I haue framed this small treatise of pronuntiation, and digested it into two parts. In the first by certaine propositions applying my selfe to set foorth the elements and parts of the voice: In the second part appointing for euery simple sound in mans voice sundry letters and characters, that the voice being thereunto once committed may by any (who shall know the vse of them) without any other expositor or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structor be aptly and truly pronounced vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on view of the writing, how strange soeuer the language be: yet seeing my intent and purpose herein is not, that I would any waies goe about, or desire to alter the order of letters, which of so long time hath been vsed and allowed of, wherein so many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb facs="8"/>
works haue been imprinted, knowing that could not be brought to passe without much difficulty, and greater preiudice then my simple iudgement can discerne. I would not therefore that any man should so much looke into or respect the characters which I herein vse, or the manner of the new pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, disposing, or naming of them, as the mateer and scope whereto I intend them, which is, that I might with the easiest way and meetest order, so paint out euery part of mans voice, that euery one might be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally discerned from other, and that the pronunciation of euery different language which hitherto is chiefly taught by word of mouth, might in a more certain māner be dedeciphered with the pen, wherby any that are desirous that way, may not only the sooner learne the experience of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine language, but may also with more ease, and in a shorter time attaine to the true pronuntiation thereof. For albeit any man in teaching of his owne country lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, doth by his owne speech giue the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true and absolute touch of pronuntiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet by reason of the swiftnesse of the
<pb facs="8"/>
voice, vnwonted composition of the parts thereof and dull apprehension of the eares, the same is not easily and read ly perceiued to a stranger: but the simple and distinct parts, and members of the whole voice (which are the grounds of all languages) being once certainly knowne, and cast into visible letters, (howsoeuer the order of an vnknown language doth diuersly disperse and mix them together) the eye by it's quicke and sharpe sight doth suddenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, and thereby teach the mouth of one altogether ignorant, &amp; vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with such language as aptly and truly to pronounce it, as any one to whom the same is naturally the speech, wherein he hath been alwayes trained and instructed, from the very time of his infancy, (this only excepted, that the vnaccustomed mixture of the sounds of the voice may at first cause a more slow vtterance.) And, for that cause hauing gathered together diuers letters and characters of sundry sorts and formes, I found none so meet (in respect of the accents which are necessarily to be placed ouer them) as those which
<pb facs="9"/>
were shortest, and of an equall length, and so hauing my selfe framed some few, I took the rest to make vp my number, and as the best for my purpose out of the Roman and Secretary letters, but haue not so vsed, and placed them in the same sence and order as they were formerly in their owne Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets; but haue diuersly disposed of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as seemed fittest for my vse, and the order of the worke did best require; And touching such places wherein I haue bin compelled in respect of the order of the worke to speak of matters incident to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, for that they are not much pertinent to this art of pronuntiation, I haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but lightly and briefly touched them, referring such matters to the teachers and professors of that science.</p>
   <p>And thus hauing shewed the occasion order, and intent of this my treatise, being the fruit of wearied times between other labors, I cōmit it to the view &amp; practise of those, that shall think it meet for their vse or experience, leauing these few verses to plead my excuse, if any errors haue hapned by reason of my great want of learning.</p>
