      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the holy Prophet (of our God) King Dauid coulde say,<note place="margin">Psal. 119</note> that trembling and feare was come on him, because the wicked did set light the law of God. Oh what feare &amp; trembling ought now to be in these our last dayes, &amp; daungerous times, that frō the pessant vnto the Prophet, all, (Oh almost all) are become either Atheistes, Papists, Epicures, belly goddes, or else bee settled in that pestilent chayre of scorners, deriders, dehorters or daunters of such as eyther professe, teache, or preach the trueth. But if either the lawe of God were feared, or our faith in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ throughly grounded, or his holy worde or Gospell embraced, or prayers to God pearced, or loue among brethren practised, or Christ and his preachers any thing esteemed, then should not our Prince, peace, &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
<pb facs="4"/> bee cominazed or threatned, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee that liue in these daungerous dayes be so much louers of our selues, yea onely selfe louers, and care neither for Gods law, beleeue Christes Gospell, prayer, Prince, Countrey, brethren, Kindred, Councell, Cominations nor threatnings from the almightie. Who woulde not therefore nowe feare, yea tremble, quiuer, &amp; roare for very griefe of hart, to see those that seme to be gods children, to lick of the butter frō Gods word, and cast the bread vnto the dogs, I meane feede thēselues with the fleece, and cast the holy worde at their tayles, or giue the fleece vnto such dogs that can not barke, and the holy bread vnto such that cannot tell howe to breake it, nor to whom to giue it, and therefore they feede themselues and sterue Gods children. If a lord or king exalt a poore man and make him his steward and put him in credite &amp; trust with his treasure, and then commaund him vpon paine of his high displeasure, dayly to bestow it on his owne children his heires kings and princes: If then this exalted ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, keepe that treasure and portion
<pb facs="4"/> vnto himselfe, and vse it at his owne pleasure, and sterue the young kings &amp; princes. Will not (thinke you) this lord and King when he seeth his steward hath set so light his straight charge and commaundement: take this steward &amp; cast him in his wrath into prison, and there let him perish without either pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or compassion. Yes verily. Euen so will our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, the King of kings, and Lorde of lordes deale with all such stewardes that hee hath giuen any portion vnto, in this world, from the highest vnto the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, if they vse it at their owne will, but especially vnto al those, whom he hath giuen that excellent treasure his holy worde to distribute the bread of life, which licke of that butter and cast the holy bread vnto dogges: and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke our good God in his wrath to take away from vs the sweete bread of life, the finest of the crop, and giue vs in his wrath the course, olde, and sower bread, that papisticall sower, rotten lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the pharisies, fit for dogges and beastes of this word, but yee beloued let vs drop downe like water, &amp; patience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="5"/> abyde our good Gods leasure, vntill he hath tried vs in this his fornace, vnto good and perfit gold. For he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised that he will neuer forsake his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle worme Iacob, &amp; wil also remember poore Ioseph, for the more misery that gods childrē hath, the nerer is their ioy. As for example, the more was Caynes crueltie, the nearer was Abels ioy. The more Noe was scorned, the sooner by the deluge he was deliuered. The more that Lot was threatned, the sooner hee was rescued. The more that Ioseph was imprisoned, the sooner to a kingdome he was exalted. The more Moses &amp; the children were perplexed, the sooner the red sea gaue place for their deliuerance. The more bitterer was Christs passion, the sweeter and firmer was our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore to conclude he that will raigne with Christ, must suffer with Christ, for by and through many tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, wee must enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. To the which God of his mercy for Christes sake bring vs all. Amen.</p>
