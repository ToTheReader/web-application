   <head>¶ To the Right worshipfull sir <hi>Henrie Guilford</hi> Knight, <hi>H. P.</hi> vvisheth all encrease of worship, and endlesse Felicitie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Worshipfull, although presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion merite pennance in dedicating such rude and vnpollished lynes, to the protection of so worthy a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage: yet I hope your wonted fauor and clemencie will priuiledge mee from blame, and accept of the giuer, as one who woulde hazard life to moue your Wor: the least iot of content. Yf it be thought a point of wisdome in that impouerished soule, that by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king sanctuarie, doth free himselfe from many dangers: then impute no blame vnto my selfe, that seeke for safegard, being round beset with many enemies. No soner had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port made knowen my harmeles <hi>Muses</hi> first progresse, how she intended to make tryall of her vnfledged plumes; but (my selfe being present where that babling dame was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) I heard iniurious Enuy, reply to this effect,
<q>
         <l>Dares she presume to flie, that cannot goe?</l>
         <l>We'le cut her plumes said they, it shall be so.</l>
      </q>
      <pb facs="3"/>
Then with a snarle or twoo, these euer medling Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers betooke them to their cabbins. At the next rowsing; I expect no other fauor, then <hi>Enuies</hi> extreamest furie, which to withstand, if I may purchase your Wor: safe protection, no better guarde will my fearefull soule desire. To make the cause manifest vnto your worthine, why <hi>Enuie</hi> thus bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth at mee, I intreat your wisedome to consider the sequel. This Historie of <hi>Hero</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> penned by that admired Poet <hi>Marloe</hi>: but not finished (being preuented by sodaine death:) and the same (though not abruptly, yet contrary to all menns expectation) resting like a heade seperated from the body, with this harsh sentence, <hi>De sunt nonnulla.</hi> I being inriched by a Gentleman a friend of mine, with the true I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian discourse, of those Louers further Fortunes, haue presumed to finish the Historie, though not so well as diuers riper wits doubtles would haue done: but as it is rude and not praise worthy: so neyther doe I expect praise nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations. This therefore is the cause of their sodayne enmitie, that I being but a flie dare presume to soare wyth the <hi>Aegle.</hi> But how-euer they dislike it, maye your wothines but grace this my first labor with your kind acceptance, my hart shal enioy the depth of his desire: And your Wor: shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually bind me in all seruiceable dutie to rest vnto your worship alwaies deuoted.</p>
