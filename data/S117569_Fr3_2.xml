      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, I send thee here the sowre and bitter Pill of Repentance, yet feare it not, for it comes not to kill, but to cure thee. It may bee bitter in the taste; but take my word for it, it will bee healthfull in digestion I know thou canst indure to sweat, purge, and toyle for the health of thy mortall bodie; why wilt thou not doe as much for the euerlasting good of thy immortall soule? If thou beest an Atheist, I leaue thee in thy gall of bitternesse vnto thy perdition (except thou Repent:) but if a Christian, I pray thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, what the Spirit of God sayes. Euery one that hath this Hope in him, purgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe euen as he is pure. Are all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb facs="165"/>
new by Christ? and dost thou thinke to goe to Heauen in the old rotten defiled ragges of the first <hi>Adam?</hi> there being no change wrought in thee? Deceiue not thy selfe, there is no remedie; if thou wilt not mourne for sinne, thou shalt mourne for iudgement. If thou wilt not shed teares here for thy offences, there is no remedie, thou must of necessitie weepe for euer in Hell, where shall bee (saith our Sauiour) wailing and gnashing of teeth world without end. Be not therefore (like E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim) a deceitfull Merchant: weigh thins rightly in the ballance of the Sanctuarie: and remember (as God wishes of his people Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael) that thy chiefest wisedome is to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber these things: The miserie of sinne; The Happinesse of Holinesse, and thy later end: which if thou neglectest, all thy other actions are and shall prooue but meere foolishnesse in the sight of God. Vanquished by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie of a friend (in hope it might prooue profitable for thy good) I gaue way to the Printing of this small Treat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>e: though (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my owne weaknesse) I did not hope to liue so long as to reuiew and publish it my selfe. Pardon therfore I increate thee the wants and failings thereof. Feed on the honey:
<pb facs="165"/>
supply the rest with thine owne mounting more ample Meditations: and with the help of others of this nature, vse it by Gods blessing as a poore helpe to lift thee vp one step higher vpon <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder (which is the end I aimed at) vntill some other of more learning, pietie, experience and wisedome erect for thy sake a more excellent fabricke vpon this weake foundation, which hee heartily wishes:</p>
