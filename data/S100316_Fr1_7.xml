   <head>A DISCOVRSE BY WAY OF PREFACE: <hi>Concerning</hi> The Vse and Subject of this Booke: The Author ANTONINUS; And this Translation of it.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all the severall sects and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions of Philosophers that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were knowne or heard of in the world, there was not any that ever did hold maximes and opinions so contrary to flesh and blood; never any that was judged even by the learned Heathens themselves (witnesse learned Plutarch, who hath written a whole Booke of this very subject:) so grossely and manifestly to oppose nature, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all grounds and principles of humane sense or reason, as the Stoicks did. And yet of all sects and professions, never any, that either with the best was of more credit, or with the vulgar more plausible. So plausible and popular, that there have beene times,<note place="margin">Lucian in Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motimo, &amp; Is: C. ad ista Pers. <hi>Si Cynico barbā petulans, &amp;c. pag▪</hi> 165.</note> when the number of the Stoicks alone, did exceed all the followers and professors of all other sects being put together. A thing the more to be wondred at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="2" facs="9"/>that for that very reason, Christianity (though nothing so harsh in comparison:) hath ever by them of contrary professions, beene much opposed and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. Of this a maine reason I conceive to have beene, that the Stoicks, though by their particular Tenets and opinions, they might seeme of all others most to oppose nature, yet that which they proposed unto themselves as the end of their lives, and the ground of all their Philosophie; that which they did ever sound in the eares of men and presse them with, was <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>to live according to nature.</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>:<note place="margin">B. V. N. IX.</note>
      <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that philosophie requireth no more at thy hands, then what thine owne nature doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and leads thee unto:</hi> saith Antoninus. <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>.<note place="margin">B. VI. N. XXV.</note>
      <hi>What acruell and unnaturall thing would it bee to restraine men from the pursuite of those things, which they conceive to themselves and their owne nature,<note place="margin">See Ant. B. V. Numb. I.</note> most proper and convenient?</hi> So they all speake, and that which they all generally did most beate upon, was this. Now whether the particular meanes which they did cōmend &amp; propose unto that end, were indeed proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall unto that end, unto which they did propose them, I will not here dispute. For the end, whether true or pretended, is that which men usually take most notice of. As for the meanes, how direct or indirect to that end, is not so easilie discerned. Their end therefore, being of it selfe so plausible and acceptable, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to have beene the thing especially, which made their doctrin and philosophie so too. And I am as
<pb n="3" facs="9"/>verily perswaded, that a conceit and opinion many Christians have, that most of those things which are reproved in them as sinnes and vices, agree best with their natures; and many, if not most, of those duties that are required of thē as Christians, are against, not depraved and corrupted only, which is not properly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but absolutely against the nature of man: and in generall that divine law and humane sense and reason, are things contrary and opposite; is that as much as any thing that doth discourage them from the intent practice and study of those things, which they by their profession cannot but acknowledge themselves bound unto. For it is not more naturall to a man to love <hi>his owne flesh,</hi> (which the Apostle witnesseth, <hi>no man ever hated:</hi>) then to love nature, and what he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives to bee according to nature. Though it bee not so, yet if hee conceive it so, he affects it naturally, and in time it becomes naturall unto him indeed.</p>
   <p>Now concerning Christianity, I know it is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of many, that, matters of Faith and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only excepted, there is nothing in the whole Gospell which is not <hi>juris naturalis,</hi> and most agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to humane reason. For my part, as I would not take upon mee,<note place="margin">See Hugo Grot. <hi>de jure Belliac P.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 2. § 6.</note> to maintaine their opinion precisely true in all points, and circumstances; so I must needs say, if wee esteeme that naturall, which naturall men of best account by the meere strength of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, have taught and taken upon them to maintaine as just and reasonable, I know not any Euangelicall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or duty belonging to a Christians practice, (even the harshest, and those that seeme to ordinary men most contrary to flesh and blood, not excepted,) but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="10"/>due search and examination, will prove of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I say upon due search and examination. Many have touched upon this point, rather to shew the way unto others, then by way of undertaking themselves: among others, of late, the best able that I know now living to performe this or any thing else that belongs to a generall and compleate Scholler, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Hugo Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> in his collection and Translation of Greeke sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. There be too, I know, that have undertaken much in this kinde: but of whom (as many as I have seene:) I may boldly say (and the more boldly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I name none:) that in many respects they have performed but little. I wish it with all my heart, that some able and judicious man would thinke it worth his labour and paines: were it but to this end, that the harshnesse which many Christians (though Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yet flesh and blood they will say) doe conceive to be in many divine precepts, might bee mollified and lessned, when it shall appeare that the very same things did not seeme harsh to them, that (in comparison of them whom God hath called by more speciall and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall illumination:) were nothing but flesh and blood. That they who as men can so hardly prevaile upon themselves to strive against nature, and to yeeld to those things which they conceive against all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane sense and reason; might be of another minde, when they shall see that mere naturall men, who in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane sense and reason, of all others most excelled, have both esteemed themselves bound by nature, and others most unnaturall that refused, to follow or to forbeare those very things: <hi>ut quivis arbitratur</hi> (saith Minutius F. though upon another occasion)
<pb n="5" facs="10"/>
      <hi>aut nunc Christianos philosophos esse, aut phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophos fuisse jam tunc Christianos.</hi> But not to prosecute this generall any further at this present. Of all Bookes in this kinde that ever have beene written by any Heathens. I know not any which either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of it selfe, (for the bulke thereof;) or in regard of the Author, deserves more respect, then this of <hi>Marcus Antoninus;</hi> sonne by name of Annius Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus (a man of great qualitie in Rome) and adopted sonne of Antoninus Pius, a Romane Emperour, whom also hee succeeded in the Empire about the yeare of our Lord <hi>162,</hi> or <hi>163.</hi> The chiefest subject of the Booke, is, the vanity of the world and all worldly things, as wealth, honour, life, &amp;c. and the end and scope of it, to teach a man how to submit himselfe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Gods providence, and to live content and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in what estate or calling soever. But the Booke, I doubt not, will sufficiently commend it selfe, to them who shall bee able to read it with any judgement, and to compare it with all others of the same subject, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten either by Christians or Heathens: so that it bee remembred that it was written by a Heathen: that is, one that had no other knowledge of any God, then such as was grounded upon naturall reasons meerely: no certaine assurance of the Immortality of the soule; no other light whereby he might know what was good or bad, right or wrong, but the light of nature, and humane reason. Which though it were, (such as it was) from God the Author of nature (as what is not?) yet inregard it was not by any revelation, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other extraordinary meanes, is therefore called hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and naturall. As for the Booke it selfe then, to
<pb n="6" facs="11"/>let it speake for it selfe; In the Author of it two maine things I conceive very considerable, which because by the knowledge of them, the use and benefit of the Booke may bee much the greater then otherwise it would bee, I would not have any ignorant of. The things are these: first, that he was a very great man, one that had good experience of what he spake; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he was a very good man, one that lived as he did write, and exactly (as farre as was possible to a naturall man,) performed what hee exhorted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers unto.</p>
   <p>For the first, I have alwayes thought that it was not without Gods especiall Providence, that of all them that once were the peculiar people of God, hee was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to write against the vaine pleasures and delights of this world, who of all the rest had had most know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience of those things, that hee did write against. A poore man may from his heart per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance declaime against the vanity of wealth, and pleasures; and a private man, against the vanity of honour, and greatnesse; it may be from their hearts, but it is ever suspicious, and therefore of lesse power and efficacie. Suspicious I meane, that they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with that they would faine, and cannot get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; yea, and perchance inveigh of purpose, that by inveighing (an ordinary thing in the world:) they may get that which they inveigh against. But at the best, that they make a vertue of necessitie; that they speake against they know not what; and though they meane sincerely, as now; yet if they were in place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, God knowes what minde they would be of. And the event indeed, doth justifiie these suspicions
<pb n="7" facs="11"/>but too often. But when a man shall heare such a one as Salomon was, speaking in this manner: <hi>I said in my heart, Goe to now, I will proove thee with mirth &amp;c. I made me great workes, &amp;c. I made mee gardens and orchards, &amp;c. I made me pooles of water, &amp;c. I got mee servants and maidens, &amp;c. I gathered mee silver and gold, &amp;c. So I was great, &amp;c. And whatsoever mine eyes desired, I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy, &amp;c. Then I looked on all the workes that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to doe; and behold, all was vanitie and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the Sunne.</hi> Is there any man so bewitched, and besotted with worldly wealth and pleasure, whom such a confession from such a one, will not move for a while at the least? And if this of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, who at first had received such measure of Grace and illumination from God, that it may be more justly wondred, that he ever did any thing contrary to this profession, then that he should professe so much; how much more should that confession of Antoninus move us, dilated here by him and inlarged into XII. bookes and briefly expressed and summed up in these words of his eight Booke.<note place="margin">B. VIII. N. I.</note>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. <hi>Thou hast already had sufficient experience, that of all the things that hitherto thou hast wandred and erred about, thou couldst not finde happinesse in any of them: not in syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismes, and Logicall subtilties; not in wealth, not in honour and reputation; not in pleasure: in
<pb n="8" facs="12"/>none of all these.</hi> Of Antoninus I say, a meere Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, lead by humane reason only; Antoninus a man for worldly wealth and greatnesse so farre greater then Salomon, as Lord and Master I dare say of more great Kingdomes, then Salomon was of great townes in all his Kingdome; Antoninus, a man for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and wisedome, by all men during his life, had in that honour and reputation, as never man either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him was, or (that wee know of) ever after him.</p>
   <p>But his goodnesse was the second consideration. It hath ever beene the complaint of all ages: There hath ever beene store enough of men that could speake well, and give good instructions: But great want of them that either could, or so much as endeavoured, to doe as they spake and taught others to doe. And what is the good that such can doe? The only good I can conceive, is, that they perswade men as much as in them lies (and they goe very effectually about it:) that <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. <hi>That all this that we call vertue and godlinesse, so much spoken of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, are but words and emptie sounds; that there is no such thing really existent indeed, as piety and justice, but that it is a meere fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some cunning juglers and impostors, or at the best a pretty device of Law-makers, and founders of common-wealths, to keepe silly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in awe and feare.</hi> Can any man thinke other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise (if otherwise he be not better grounded:) that shall heare them speake and then looke upon their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
<pb n="9" facs="12"/>Such therefore in my judgement might deserve farre more thankes if they did forbeare, and would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lose the commendations of either a smooth tongue, or a ready pen, then to incurre both the just suspicion of being Atheists themselves, and the certaine guilt and crime of having made many others so. Bee it therefore spoken to the immortall praise and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this famous Antoninus, that as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> did write so he did live. Never did writers so conspire to give all possible testimonie of goodnesse, uprightnesse, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and whatsoever could among Heathens be most commendable, as they have done to commend this One. They commend him, not as the best Prince on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but absolutely as the best man, and best Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher that ever was. And it is his proper commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that being so commended, hee is commended without exception. If any thing hath ever beene tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked against him, the Historians mention it but as a talke: not credited by them nor by any that ever were of any credit. Thus the Heathens of Him. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians had but little reason to speake well of him, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving suffered many cruell persecutions under him: And in this case how free they have beene (some of them:) even with all extremity to enveigh against other Emperors, though much commended and magnified by the Heathens, is not unknowne. Yet I find not that ever they could fasten any thing upon our Antoninus, whereby to staine his reputation; that ever they did so much as object unto Him, these many and grievous persecutiōs which they did suffer under him, as his owne act, or charge Him therefore of crueltie. And though it be granted, that Antoninus gave way
<pb n="10" facs="13"/>to those persecutions, which certainly he could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together be ignorant of; yet to them that know the state of those dayes, it can be no wonder, that such a thing should happen in the dayes of such a Prince as Antoninus was. When Christians, besides the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of many horrible crimes, as common incest, homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, &amp;c. which (such was the power of calumny:) lay upon them; were generally accounted no better, then meere Atheists and Epicures. For indeed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists, Christians,</hi> and <hi>Epicures,</hi> were commonly joyned together as names, if not of the same significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet of very great affinity, and hardly distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the vulgar, but that of the three, the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> was thought the worst. Let it be then Antoninus his commendation, the greater and the more incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this age, the more the age is full of dissimulation and hypocrisie, that hee was not (as now they rightly stile themselves, whom the common received Names of <hi>Christians,</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> will not content, such is their <hi>Zeale</hi> and <hi>puritie</hi> they thinke:) a <hi>Professor:</hi> as he spake and wrote, so he did. His meditations were his actions. His deeds (so still you remember Him a man and a Heathen:) did agree with his sentences. <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And againe, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. That hee did not only as he spake, but what he did, he did it out of meere love to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. That it was a cleere case, which no man doubted of, that hee was in very deed a good man; so incapable was he of any dissimulation.</hi> So Dio of him, and so others. And now that I have spoken so much of Antoninus his life, it will not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
<pb n="11" facs="13"/>to say somewhat of that surname the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> which by many hath beene given and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to this Emperor. In so much as Xylander, though he found it not at all (as hee confesseth) in his MS. yet thought it fitting to adde it in the Title, and Inscription of these bookes as his proper and usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Cognomen. But sure enough it is (as hath beene observed by learned men:) that this Title of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher</hi> was never taken by Antoninus himselfe, nor given unto him by others, as a proper surname, as his father Antoninus was surnamed <hi>PIUS,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers otherwise, but only as a deserved Elogium and testimonie, at the discretion of them that either did speake unto Him, or wrote of Him. And so indeed it was very commonly, and even by those learned and Pious Christians, that directed Apologies unto Him for the Christians, adscribed unto him as an Elogium, and Testimonie: just indeed and deserved, but arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and not proper unto Him, by way of a Cognomen or surname.</p>
   <p>But, an Elogium and testimony of what think you? of his great learning (as we take learning now;) and progresse in the Sciences? Read him himselfe, and judge how much he would have esteemed such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. A man would thinke, if Heathens, through their ignorance of the true God, and of his truth, had beene mistaken in the true application of words of praise or dispraise, that wee, by the helpe of a better light, might have rectified them, and not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their examples. But now it is fallen out quite contrary. Who they be that the holy Scriptures usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call <hi>wise;</hi> who they to whom they adscribe <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
      <pb n="12" facs="14"/>and <hi>understanding;</hi> and who they are, who by them are termed <hi>fooles, blinde, ignorant,</hi> and the like, is not unknowne unto any. So spake the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heathens, when they would speake properly. He that was an honest upright, vertuous man, without dissimulation and hypocrisie, though hee were such a one as had never beene brought up to learning, yea such a one as could neither read nor write, was their <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> their good scholler, their learned man, their Philosopher. His life and his actions, were all that they stood upon, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were of opinion, that it was very difficult, if not altogether impossible, for a man to come to the knowledge, of that which was right and wrong, just or unjust, and by consequent of true vertue, without much studie and paines taking. On the other side, an unjust man, a cunning, an intemperate; in generall, a vicious man, was their <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> their Illiterate, their Ignorant, their Idiot. The most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary distinction was, of an <hi>Idiot,</hi> and a <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</hi> Neither was this the proper language of the Stoicks (which sect our Antoninus was much addicted unto:) but of the Platonicks likewise, and of most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But the maine and principall property, whereby they did distinguish a Philosopher from all other men, was that he did all things <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto God and his Providence; <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, as Epictetus (in Arrianus) speaketh. This you shall finde that Antoninus doth much stand upon. For indeed they did esteeme it the very character and essentiall note of a philosopher. In so much as that if any man seemed never so just and
<pb n="13" facs="14"/>upright in his actions, yet if it were not <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, they esteemed him little more then a meere Idiot.</p>
   <p>Much more I had here to say concerning this matter, both in defence of Plato (whose name hath much suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered through some mens ignorance of the true sense of this word <hi>Philosophus</hi>) and for the clearing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obscure places of Antoninus, which otherwise I thinke will hardly be understood. But because I feare it would make the bodie of this Preface to swell too much beyond the proportion of the rest,<note place="margin">See Notes upon B. VIII. N. I.</note> and that in the Notes it will come in well enough, I will reserve it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that place.</p>
   <p>Now for this my Translation of Antoninus, which is the last thing wee are to speake of, were it so that this Booke were as commonly knowne, and as easie to be got as many others of lesse worth are, I should bee well content to spare my labour, and referre it wholly to the judgement of the Reader. But for as much as by my owne experience I know the Booke, (though twice printed,) to be so rare, that it is not to bee found in many private studies, and sometimes not for many yeares together, in any Booke-sellers shop: (I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to learned M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Holsworths well furnished li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary for the first sight, and long use of the latter and better Edition; as also for the use of many other Bookes:) and that the Latine Translation of Xylan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hath beene commended and approved by the most learned (<hi>doctissimus; eruditissimus Interpres; vir profundae eruditionis, &amp;c.</hi> So they speake of him:) I doe thinke it very necessary, both that I should give the Reader that satisfaction, that I doe not <hi>actum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere,</hi> and doe my selfe that right, that whereas I take
<pb n="14" facs="15"/>upon me to translate <hi>Marcus Antoninus Augustus,</hi> I may not be suspected to have translated <hi>Guilielmus Xylander Augustanus.</hi> Indeed what might bee expected from Xylanders Interpretation, may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by his owne ingenuous intimation, both in his Preface, where he is faine to Apologize for it, that he durst undertake it, professing that <hi>in quibusdam</hi> hee was constrained, to <hi>divinare &amp; audacter à codice Graeco aut usu communi recedere;</hi> as also in his Notes, where his words are, <hi>Sunt autem passim per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multa, in quibus ariolo magis quam Interprete opus sit:</hi> And that he doth so indeed, it doth but too manifestly appeare by his Translation. For I dare boldly say, and doe him no wrong, that sometimes in a whole page, he hath not two lines of Antoninus his sense, and meaning. Besides the liberty that hee takes unto himselfe to supply of his owne head, to leave out sometimes words, sometimes lines, to change and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at his will; without any reason given for it, or so much as the Reader acquainted with it. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Xylander puts the fault of all this upon the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and imperfection of the copie, I cannot any wayes approve it. For first, as I confesse the faults and corruptions of it, if in the printed copies they have not beene made more, then they were in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript (which I doe not beleeve:) to be many, so of those many, I know none or very few, that may be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med incurable. And as for the <hi>Lacunae</hi> of it, I hope that they neither in this Translation (and what anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent booke is there almost but hath some?) will not bee found many. As for any greater <hi>hiatus,</hi> as perchance of many leafes together, if any shall suspect the Copie
<pb n="15" facs="15"/>to have beene defective in that kinde, the method and composition of the booke being such, that it doth for the most part consist of certaine Aphorismes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, (they called them <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) without any certaine order or <hi>seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> either in regard of the whole (but that they all tend to one purpose;) or in regard of the parts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: as it is not possible by the matter it selfe for any man, to determine how much more in this kinde may have beene written by Antoninus; so if there were never so much extant, yet how this that we have here, could thereby be made more perfect then it is, I doe not see. Their conceit, who by reason of this unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of matters, would have the whole booke to be but excerpts and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> of a greater, and better compacted worke; there being so many other bookes both sacred and prophane written in the same kinde; and Epictetus (the Patterne of all latter Stoicks:) his Enchiridion among the rest, it can at the best passe but for a meere conceit, and needs I hope no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</p>
   <p>To tell you then what I have done, and that you may be the better satisfied that I except not against Xylanders Interpretation without cause, it remaines that for a <hi>Specimen</hi> I produce some few passages, by which it will be easie for any to judge of the rest. But first I must faithfully professe that my purpose in all this is not any wayes to detract, either from Xylander himselfe, or from the judgement of those learned men, by whom he hath beene highly commended, but rather to follow (after my best abilitie:) Xylanders owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; whom for his great paines, and labour in his
<pb n="16" facs="16"/>life-time to further and promote learning, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to have deserved much honour &amp; respect from all that love learning. I might adde that I shall deal with him more ingenuously too, then some others have done, who take upon them to correct some corrupt places of Antoninus, which Xylander in his Translation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they take no notice, had already plainly corrected. But now to Antoninus.</p>
   <p>Where Antoninus in his first Booke saith, that hee learned by his Fathers example, that it is not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for a man that lives at the Court,<note place="margin">B. I. N. XIV.</note>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. To live almost a private mans life, for matter of worldly pompe, and magnificence, and all outward shew and appearance (expressed by him before more at large:) and yet for all that, not to be a whit the more base and pusillanimous, or lesse stout or resolute in any publike affaires that shall require the power and authoritie of a Prince and Commander: he translates it,<note place="margin">Bas. Edit. pag. 174.</note>
      <hi>sed licere ei proximum privato ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini habitum sumere: imò verò eum splendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, eos qui principes rempublicam gerere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lint, demissiores, segnioresque efficere.</hi> Which neither of it selfe affords any tolerable sense, and is as wide from Antoninus his meaning, as any thing that could have beene conceived.</p>
   <p>In the eight booke Antonius saith that <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>:<note place="margin">Pas. Edit. 247.</note> That the common Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which was one of the many Synomina's, by which the Stoicks did expresse God:) doth distribute all
<pb n="17" facs="16"/>things in equalitie, as matter, forme, duration, and the like; and then adds, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>; <hi>This equalitie, thou shalt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, not if absolutely thou shalt goe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare all the particulars of any one thing by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, with the particulars of another by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:</hi>

      </gap>; that is,<note place="margin">B. VIII. N. VI.</note>
      <hi>but if thou consider all the particulars of any one thing together, with all the particulars of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, together likewise.</hi> His meaning is, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry naturall thing in his owne kinde, that is, after a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometricall, though not Arithmeticall equalitie, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually perfect: an Ant, as perfect in her quantitie, as an Elephant and Whale, so great and vast, in theirs. As strong for her little proportion of body, and other circumstances of her nature, and as long lived, as any other creature; and so of all other things, if all things be well considered. And this doth not only extend to things of severall kinds and natures; but even to those that are of the same. It is a very pleasant and usefull speculation, as it may be prosecuted and applied, and it is very fully expressed by Antoninus. After this (as his manner is:) abruptly passing to another matter, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, saith he to himselfe (for so must the words be distinguished, which in the Greeke are viciously joyned and confounded— <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) by way of objection, and then immediately answers, <gap reason="foreign">

All this is expressed by Xylander: <hi>Considera autem aequalitatem eam, inventurum te si singulas res examines; sin unam cum uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versis conferas, non item.</hi> and then he leaves a blanck, and beginnes a new line; <hi>Atqui licet libidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem arcere, voluptatibusque &amp; doloribus superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem esse, itemque gloriola: licet etiam stupidis &amp; ingratis non irasci.</hi>

   <p>At the end of the fift booke, Antoninus having spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of some vanities, addes <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. <hi>O man hast thou forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten what things these are? yea, but howsoever, they are things that other men much care for;</hi> saith he, by way of objection; then answeres, <gap reason="foreign">

         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> which Antoninus here elegantly, and acutely playes upon, which may signifie, either in generall a happy man, or in particular one that dyes happily: but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly signifies one that hath obtained a good part and portion. Howsoever, to render it as it may bee ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, the sense is very tolerable. Now Xylander ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found the words somewhat confused, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, (for it is printed <gap reason="foreign">

   </p>
   <p>At the end of the seventh Booke, Antoninus his words are, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. That the place must be so read and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected (if any man make a question of it:) I will bee judged by Antoninus himselfe <hi>B. VI. N. 39. B.

         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> here, as spoken of the same that <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>; to which purpose hee hath other passages, that reasonable creatures are the chiefest creatures. Yet if any man would rather have it; <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. reasonable creatures are his chiefest objects,</hi> I will not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and it will bee all one thing. But who could beare with Xylander his Interpretation, <hi>Universi natura olim ad mundum fabricandum se contulit: nunc autem vel omnia quae fiunt, consequentia fiunt sua: vel etiam in principiis eorum, ad quae se mundi gubernatrix natura confert, rationi nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum locum esse &amp; consilio, tenendum est. Hoc si memoria teneas, multis in rebus animo ut sis tranquilliori, efficiet.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>An easie matter it were to adde to these many more such passages, if I thought it as necessary, as it would be easie. They that shall take the paines (and it will be worth their paines I dare promise them) to compare diligently the Translations with Antoninus himselfe, will, I doubt not, before they have gone one or two Bookes over, be of my minde. I have of purpose
<pb n="22" facs="19"/>made choise of such places especially, where I have made bold somewhat to correct the Text. I say bold, but no bolder I will maintain, then any reasonable man must, and ought, that doth undertake any such work. For I have not (to my knowledge:) by my Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on altered any one place in this kinde in the whole booke, but such as by certaine proofes and demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Antoninus himselfe, I can maintaine. Those places that I thought any thing doubtfull, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven account of them to the Reader in my Notes. And if I have left any for desperate, as either imperfect or not intelligible by me, I may truly say, that had I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to my selfe but the tenth part of the libertie, which Xylander doth usually throughout the whole book; I nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to have left any such places at all. And I make no question, but that in so doing, I might have given to many content and satisfaction good enough. But considering how much this libertie is commonly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and how prejudiciall it proves to good Authors, I have rather chosen sometimes to say lesse then I might, then to give unto others an example of this bold kinde of dealing with ancient Authors. The chiefest ground of all the obscurity in the Booke, is, that Antoninus having beene all his life an indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable student, and so read a world of writers of all sorts, his manner is in these his bookes, as he rend any thing that made for his present purpose, closely and briefly to allude unto it, by some short meditation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: sometimes barely to excerpt some words, which either he had an especiall liking unto, or afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended further to meditate upon, without any mention of the place or Author from whence they are taken.
<pb n="23" facs="19"/>Now many of these Authors being quite perished, many of his allusions so close and obscure, that though the Authors be yet extant, yet it is not easie to finde from whence, or of whom, nor to what intent or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: it must not be wondred, if not only many places seeme obscure, but some also of little worth and use; because, it doth not appeare, what further use Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus had of them in his minde. Howsoever to them that are any thing versed in the writings of ancient Philosophers, Stoicks especially, there will not occurre many such places. If a man take but Arrianus, and Seneca, and compare them diligently with Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, he will finde a marvellous consent, and many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure short places of Antoninus, illustrated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by their larger discourse. I have done it in some few places, which I thought could not well other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be understood. And for the rest, I leave them to every diligent Readers industrie. Neither indeed would I have put my selfe to the labour of writing any Notes at all, if the booke could as well have wanted them, as I could easilie have found as well, or better to my minde, how to bestow my time. However as I thought some would be needfull, so did I thinke also, that if in the former Bookes, I did give satisfaction to the Reader, I might afterwards be spared, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be trusted my selfe, or trust to the Readers dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and abilitie for the rest. Wheresoever by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a word or two in the Text, I thought I could helpe the sense, and illustrate the matter sufficiently; to spare my selfe a Note, and for the ease of the Reader, I have done it. All such additions to the Text, you shall finde within two such [] markes included. And
<pb n="24" facs="20"/>whereas those former passages by me produced wherein I except against the Latine Translation, are all such as could not be well translated without some correction of the Text, that it may not bee thought, that in such places only it is amisse, I have for the further satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Reader (the bookes as hath already been said, being so scarce and hard to become by:) taken occasion in my Notes, now and then to instance in some other passages, wherein there can be no such exception. In the Author himselfe I feare exception will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, at many places, as meere repetitions; at some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wherein he seemeth to contradict what hee had said before. But if the Readers consider, first, that what Antoninus wrote, he wrote it not for the publick, but for his owne private use; and secondly, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus his words are so intermingled every where with his <hi>Excerpta</hi> that it doth not well appeare what is his owne, and what is not; as in regard of the first consideration they will, I doubt not, allow him farre more libertie then otherwise were fitting: so in regard of the second, I presume they will yeeld both those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny suspected repetitions in the Bookes, and those few supposed contradictions, the one perchance to be but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall collections of one subject and to one purpose from severall Authors; and the others certainely, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the different opinions of different Authors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same thing, then the contradictions of one man, inconstant to himselfe. And as for such places which may give offence, as repugnant to our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, and impious; as when hee seemeth to speake doubtfully of God, and his Providence; and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe all things to Fatall necessity, and the like: I
<pb n="25" facs="20"/>shall but desire the Readers to remember who hee was that wrote, and I hope they will desire no other satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in this point. For that any Christian should expect from any out of the Church and without the Scriptures perfect sound knowledge in these high points would be no small wonder to mee: it being both the happinesse of every the meanest Christian, that he may know more in these mysteries, then the greatest Philosophers could ever, with all their wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning attaine unto; and the proper priviledge of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Scriptures, that from them only all solid truth in points of this nature, is to be expected. However that Antoninus may not want any just defence that his cause doth afford, the Reader must further be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to judge of his opinions, by one or two short pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages here and there, occurrent, which whether they be his or no (as we have already said) is hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but to have a respect to other more large, and peremptory passages concerning the same purpose else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be found. As for example concerning God and his Providence, to B. II. Num. VIII. B. V I. Num. XXXIX. &amp;c. and concerning Fatall necessitie not only to the same Lib. II. Num. VIII. but also to divers other places, as B. VIII. Num. 6.27.30.32.46. &amp;c. by which places as it doth plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that he doth exclude all manner of Necessitie from humane wils and actions, so doth it appeare by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther passages, as Lib. <hi>8</hi> Num. <hi>33.</hi> that he did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together exclude from all divine providence not even those actions of men, that are most contrary to the will of God: from which place moreover may appeare what it is that he often calls <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>Fate,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny;</hi>
      <pb n="26" facs="21"/>which in his meaning is no other then (as by divers other Philosophers also it is expounded) Gods order and providence in matters of the world: to which purpose hee doth also expound the word <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> B. I. Num. XVII. On the other side, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he doth every where very absolutely maintaine this libertie of mans will, and that he was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the mysterie of originall sinne, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall concupiscence; yet shall you not finde in him those blasphemies, in exaltation of this humane power and libertie, which you shall in Seneca, and other Stoicks: neither did he (it should seeme, though but an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then:) so much rely upon it, but that he doth very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously commend prayers, as very powerfull and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all unto vertue. See lib. IX. Num. XL. Now if An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus himselfe being a Romane, for the propriety and facilitie of his expressions (wherein the Latine tongue, in matter of Philosophie, comes as short of the Greeke, as the English doth of the Latine:) did in the composing of these his Bookes preferre the Greeke tongue before his owne mother tongue; no man I hope will expect, that all things should in this Translation runne so smoothly, as in another kinde of Translation happily they might. But herein I must confesse my feare is for Antoninus, more then for my selfe. For first whereas he, being (I thinke) as well acquainted with ancient writers and philosophers as ever any was, doth every where very strictly and carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their proper choise words and termes, which both make the sense it selfe more current, and pleasing; and for a Scholler to know them and to be acquainted with them, is in many respects very usefull; This in
