Earle of PEMBROOKE,
Lord Chamberlaine to his
Maiestie: And to his entirely
beloued and most louing bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Earle of MONTGO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERIE;
health, honour, and

shall come to glorifie his Saints

   <opener>
      <salute>My good Lords,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it
behoueth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
man,
that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to instruct others
in any Art, Mysterie, or
<pb facs="5"/>
Science, to be himselfe
well furnished with
knowledg, iudgement,
practise, or experience,
in the thing he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to teach: yet for
want of the depth and
quintessence of that
knowledge and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
he may speake, to
the instruction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by the experience
of his owne practise.
I haue little knowledge
to iudge, &amp; lesse iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
truly and iustly to
censure other mens ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
or vice;: onely ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
some speculation,
<pb facs="5"/>
in, and some practise of,
and by practise some
experience, in that
which I am bold (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your Honourable
names) to publish, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
vertue of the minde,
perfect Patience:</hi> I haue
essayed (partly for mine
owne, partly for the
cōfort of others) what
profit I could produce
by mine owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
of the patient bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of mine own cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and troubles; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to confirme mine
owne assurance, and to
<pb facs="6"/>
intimate vnto others,
that are any way affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
or troubled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in minde, or
outwardly with any
crosse or tryall; that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
murmuring,
or grudging, make the
lightest crosses &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
seeme more irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
more harsh, and
heauier, then in deede
they are of their owne
nature: And, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
patience, makes
them seeme light, and
easie to be borne, being
neuer so weighty in the
opinion of men. And
<pb facs="6"/>
therefore I haue, out of
my slender experience,
endeuoured (in this little
Pamphlet, rudely dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted)
to remember some
seuerall occasions (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
infinite) requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this diuine vertue
<hi>Patience;</hi> wishing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all men to prepare
themselues, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
their troubles, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
or when they
come, with godly pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, who
suffered manifold <hi>tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
yet his soule alwayes
kept silence vnto God,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
himselfe, that
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>he should not, much be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:</hi>
not much; yet the
most godly man may
doe, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did <hi>in his
hast;</hi> fret at the prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of wicked men, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in affliction, pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and vnder the crosse.
But a wise man soone
reformes himselfe as he
did; when he conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
that <hi>though many are
the troubles of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
and that it is his lot
to suffer, <hi>yet that God
will deliuer him in the end
out of all.</hi> Therefore is
he patient vntill his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerie
come. And to the
<pb facs="7"/>
end that such as haue, or
may haue occasion, to
make vse of these my
weake meditations and
prayers; I haue in all
humblenesse presumed,
to publish them vnder
your Honorable names.
Entreating your good
Lordships, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that I seeme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
so idlely vaine-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and so forgetfull
of your places, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and Honorable
estates, as to presume to
teach your Honours,
the necessitie and vse of
this heauenly, and (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently)
<pb facs="8"/>
Honourable
vertue. But onely that
your good Lordships
would be pleased to
grace, this my weake la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
with your Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
countenance; for
the weaker the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
is, it requires the
stronger supporters: cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
your Honourable
fauours therein, that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men that haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to vse it, may the
more willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it. For, if men, of
whatsoeuer quality, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
or inferiour,
truly knew the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="8"/>
of this vertue,
though euery man hath
not one and the same,
yet the most of men
haue, or may haue some
cause to practise it, if
they will haue comfort
in their crosses, which
are of as many kindes,
as are the seuerall estates
and conditions of men,
of whatsoeuer quality,
high or lowe.</p>
   <p>Most humbly entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
your Lordships
Honourable pardon, of
my rudenesse, in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a work worthy
the labour of a man of
<pb facs="9"/>
most exquisite guifts;
And to beare with my
too much boldnesse, in
vsing your Honourable
names, in a matter so
impertinent to your
Honours. But I am so
much the more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
to present it vnto
your good Lordships,
by how much, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
(as well by the
approbation of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
men, as by mine
owne experience) your
Honourable enclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the practise of all
diuine vertues: And doe
assure my selfe, that
<pb facs="9"/>
your Honours wil take
in good part, that which
I haue (though weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
done, more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of my good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
then of the thing
it selfe; which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
recommend, vnto
your most Honourable
acceptations.</p>

for many your most
