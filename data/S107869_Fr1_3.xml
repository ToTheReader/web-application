I let it first abroad. And, now, so secure an Interpreter I am of

mee. Though you commend the two first Actes, with the
people, because they are the worst; and dislike the Oration of
<hi>Cicero,</hi> in regard you read some pieces of it, at School<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

vnderstand them not yet; I shall finde the way to forgiue you.
Be any thing you will be, at your owne charge. Would I had
deseru'd but halfe so well of it in translation, as that ought
to deserue of you in iudgment, if you haue any. I know you will
pretend (whosoeuer you are) to haue that, and more. But all
pretences are not iust claymes. The commendation of good
things may fall within a many, their approbation but in a
few▪ for the most commend out of affection, selfe tickling,
an easinesse, or imitation: but men iudge only out of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
That is the trying faculty. And, to those workes that
will beare a Iudge, nothing is more dangerous then a foolish
prayse. You will say I shall not haue yours, therfore; but rather
the contrary, all vexation of Censure. If I were not aboue such
molestations now, I had great cause to thinke vnworthily of my
studies, or they had so of mee. But I leaue you to your exercise.
Beginne.</p>
