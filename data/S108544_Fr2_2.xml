   <head>THE COPIE OF A Letter sent out of the Low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries by a Gentleman entertained by the King of Spaine in pension: To a yong Gentleman his Kinsman in <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y very good Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin, vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well by your Letters, as by the message lately done vnto me by the mouth of <hi>A. T.</hi> of the great longing and desire you haue to draw your self into these parts, &amp; to imploy your selfe here in seruice of the Spanish king: &amp; perceiuing also as well by your sayd Letters, as by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb facs="86"/>that brought the same, and by the reporte of diuerse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther young Gentlemen of our Countrie, there bee manye that are of your minde in that point: Some thereunto, as I doo gesse, moued of a youthfull and vaine tickling humour, to bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering abroade in straunge and forreine Countries: Others in hope there to growe to greate preferment, aduauncement, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and wealth: Other some pretending matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, seeme to haue sure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that there they maye liue with more libertie and ease of minde, then that within our Countrie they inioye. I haue thought good for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb facs="86"/>loue which I beare, and alwayes haue borne towardes you, vnto whome I wish as to my selfe, but chiefely in respecte of the sincere, faythfull, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and loyall fidelitye and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde I haue to the person of our sacred, renowmed, and most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soueraigne, the QVEENES most excellent Maiestie, and to my natiue Countrie and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye-men, to sette downe some notes and obseruations, vvhich by long and painefull troubles and experience in this place I haue gathered: by which I hope I shall make manifest not onelye to you, but also to all others my most deare Countrye men, if I maye haue the fauour to haue
<pb facs="87"/>it published: in which point I meane to labor by my best friends, to such of the greatest persons as may permit the same, how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you and they that desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire hether by any of the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before expressed, or in anye hope of good to be receiued from they sayde King, doo erre and are deceiued. I heartely and most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desire you, &amp; all other that shall reade the same, deeplye to iudge and consider of these points which I shall set downe, which (God willing) I wil doo with such fidelitie, true meaning, and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as that no parte of the same shall bee truly to bee gainsayde or refelled, and my selfe by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, times, and places, and other
<pb facs="87"/>circumstances shall make most manyfest and plaine, to anie that shal doubt of the truth of the same or any part thereof, &amp; I shal take great ioy &amp; comfort, if my self ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vndertaken an vntowardlye &amp; dangerous course, though with better successe then hath happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to many hundreds, may be as a caueat to all the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of our Nation, how they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard themselues so dangerouslie. And that my painfull experience may be to you as a looking Glas, wherein they maye beholde the spots &amp; errours of theyr concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued fansies, or as markes sette vp for them, whereby they maye auoide the perilles &amp; most daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rockes and shelfes, to
<pb facs="88"/>them yet vnknowen, &amp; lying hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder the smooth, faire, and delighful conceiued and fantasied pleasures forged in theyr imaginations.</p>
