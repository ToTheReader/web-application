   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE loue of God our Father, and the grace of our Lorde Iesus Christ, be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to you, and multiplyed from day to day, thorowe the communion of the holy Ghost. There is an auncient Poet which saith, that he which dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and profiteth altogether in his writings, hath gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the price and fauour towardes all men. The same is spoken bicause of the diuersitie of natures. It is very true, that the onely doctrine, wherein we knowe it to be good and profitable, ought to suffice vs, for to incitate and prouoke vs to reade willingly a booke, to giue and bestowe thereon all our studie, to loue and set by it, and finally to take pleasure in it. But there are a great many, and well neere the most parte, which will be a greate deale better pleased, that one should teach thē after a gentle &amp; pleasant fashion, then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: In such sort, that as in recreating themselues, they may profite &amp; receiue instruction, liuen then as those which occupie themselues to make bookes of pastime, vaine and friuolous, &amp; which cause the world to reade them, are to bee vituperated and despised although they haue no corruption in them: So on the other side, those which haue the grace, so to teach that they doe both delight and profite the Readers thorowe their pleasant stile, are double to be praysed. And in very deede that is a vertue &amp; a gift which is not in al men.
<pb facs="4"/> Yea, often times the wisest cannot atteine vnto it. And which is more do make themselues to be laughed at in desning that which is not giuen vnto them. For a man which desireth to vse mery conceits and iests, ought to beware of two vices. The one is, that he do nothing of compulsion, or laugh ouer much, as there are a great many which haue cold laughters, the which do seeme as though they were pulled out of their throat by force. The other is, not to vse baudy &amp; silthy talk, the which is called in Latine <hi>scurrilitas,</hi> in our language pleasant iestes.</p>
   <p>But to keepe the meane, that is to know how to speak effectually and with a good grace, so for to recreate that there be nothing spoken foolishly, at all aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or vncomely, which is no common vertue. I doe speake this by reason of these present Dialogues, out of which a man may so gather good instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and yet notwithstanding he shall haue occasion to laugh. For the matter of it selfe is very pleasant: And is set out with such grace, that it cannot be but that a man shall take greate pleasure in the reading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off. Our brother and companion in the worke of the Lord Iesus, <hi>Peter Viret,</hi> who is the Author, hath by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the vertue which I saide to be requisite in that man which will medle himselfe therein. It is vertue true that as in all other workes he giueth himselfe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better studie and of greater waight: So in these Dialogues his principall intent is not to delight the eares. And in verie deede, that shoulde be but a small labour, and a paine euill be stowed of a man of such witte and knowledge. Furthermore, besides the giftes that he hath of God, he is called vnto a more higher calling. But forasmuch as the matter that he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand to entreate off, sheweth that he teacheth by order of pastime and merrie iestes, he pretendeth notwithstanding the right doctrine, as the true marke to shoote at, mingling with the same, some merrie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites
<pb facs="4"/> as a companion therewith all. Yea in such sort that this booke is a suffient witnes, that be hath a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler dextentie to doe it, yea euen as much as he will himselfe: that is to say, as much as is needefull or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient. I doe knowe that it is a daungerous thing and that no man ought at the first sight to allowe a booke.</p>
   <p>But I feare not to haue any rebuke of good men, &amp; of such as are of sounde Iudgement, to haue commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the reading of that booke, as a booke in which the time shalbe wel bestowed. I neede not to bring witnes, nor to speake among those which know the man, This onely knowledge will suffice for to as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ure them that they cannot say<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e to stay themselues vpon it. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that it may bee that some for want of aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will make none accompt, to proue what it is: I haue partly testified what it is, for to giue encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement vnto those which wil beleeue me, &amp; to stir them forwarde to see them, vntill such time as they may Iudge of themselues. Not that I doe presume so much as to attribute vnto my selfe the Iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the workes of others, for to pronounce them as for authoritie: or to bring all the Readers vnto mine opinion or aduise. Yet neuerthelesse bicause that I thinke and am altogether perswaded, that many will not refuse to staye and content themselues to that, that I affirme vnto them: I am constrayned for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of them to speake my minde. Although it is not now needeful to set foorth at large all the profite that may be gathered, and the pleasure that may bee taken therein. This onely I can certifie, that all those which shall haue the patience to continewe the reading ouer it, will not repent themselues to be so well occupied.</p>
   <p>There is one onely point, which I knowe, which might diminish the grace of the booke towards some men: That is, that it shoulde seeme good that the matters of the Christia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tie ought to be intreated off
<pb facs="5"/> with a grauitie correspondent to their dignitie and worthinesse.</p>
   <p>And therefore it is not meete to mingle them with matters of myrth, considering that there is daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that in so doing wee shoulde turne them into laughing. Chiefely at this present time, in whiche impyetie ouerfloweth more then euer sithence the beginning of the Christian Church: Or at the least wise, it is more openly vncouered. To the ende that none for being preuented with that reason, bee not out of tast with the reading. It is to be noted, that one may dispute of the matters of the Christianitie two wayes: First in rebuking the foolish supersticions, which are risen among the Christians vnder colour of Religion, the which notwithstanding are not but corruptions of the same, for to destroy and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe it. Secondly, in declaring the simple and pure veritie according as it is reuealed vnto vs of GOD by his holy worde. As touching the seconde kinde, it is most certeine that assoone as wee haue opened our mouthes for to speake of GOD, no merrie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite or iest ought to enter in our matter: But wee ought in all that we say and speake, declare what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence we doe beare vnto his Maiestie, not pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing one worde but in feare and humilytie. But in disiphering and disclosing the superstitions &amp; follyes with which the poore worlde hath beene blinded in before time, he could not chose in speaking of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters so ridiculous but to laugh with open mouth. It is most true that there is also good occasion to weepe and lament: Forasmuch as it is not a sport or iest that the glory of GOD, and his eternall veritie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene so darkened, the which ought to bee had in vs in a singuler recommendation, hath beene so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished thorow infinit lyes: that so many poore soules haue beene ledde of Sathan into ruyne and dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>But the one must not let the other, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> and taking such sorrowe as we ought to haue, to bring vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in remembrance, how God hath beene so blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: hauing also pitie and compassion of the calamitie wherein the worlde hath beene so long time, and is yet at this present. Yet neuertheles in rehersing of such foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish dreames and fonde bables, we vse such mocketies as they doe merite and deserue. When we doe so, it shalbe after the example of the Prophets: who interpreting of the pure veritie of God, doe speake with a maiestie, which ought to make all the worlde to tremble: But in blaming the dreams of the Idolaters do make it no doubt to vse scoffings and laughings, for to declare howe ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous they are. Although the Prophets are one &amp; we an other. For asmuch as we speake not in the name of God as they, to the end that all that which we pronounce shoulde be receiued as a reuelation come from Heauen: It is lawefull for vs to vse a baser stile. But I haue allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this comparison onely for to declare, that it is not to giue any occasion vnto the Luci anists and Epicures and other contemners of God, to speake euill of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion, or to haue it in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, when they shal mocke of the corruptions of the same.</p>
