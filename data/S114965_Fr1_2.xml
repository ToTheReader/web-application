      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know right well, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye men of good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the trueth are of this minde, that they would haue but one, or as few catechismes as might be: and in as briefe and fewe wordes, as with any light the necessary poyntes of doctrine may be comprised. Wherefore I cānot escape some blame, not only for setting forth this of mine after so many: but also for being so large. I should bee of the same minde, were it not that our Church doth consist of diuers sortes of men: and that I haue learned by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the multitude of Catechismes doth not hinder, but bring furtherance vnto the better sorte. If all were as the Prophet saith, as Infantes newe weaned frō the breast, <hi>y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      </hi> in teaching there must be line vnto line, precept vnto precept, a litle here, a litle there: then I confesse, that some one briefe forme were best. If to rest in the wordes or sentences, when a man can repeate them, were so sure a
<pb facs="4"/> way, as to search into the matter it selfe, which is better, and with more iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment attained vnto by manye, then by one: I should also thinke it best. Finally, if all needefull poyntes were handled in any one, then might it seeme a vaine trauel, and lost labour. This therfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my purpose to write of some thinges which are not handled in the rest, I hold my selfe satisfied, If not to profit all, yet to be a furtheraunce vnto some. I craue no more but this of him, whom it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not further: that hee will giue it gentle passage to such as it is sent.</p>
