   <head>THE EPISTLE to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (Christian Reader) I would haue thee to obserue in the three first Chapters, the then present estate of the seauen Churches: and in the fourth and fifth Chapters, the vision of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in Heauen, in what manner hee receiued the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Reuelation from Christs ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vntill his comming vnto iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: in the sixt and seauenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the estate of the Church vnder the Idolatrous Emperours, vntill the
<pb facs="5"/>Christian Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> his time, and the flourishing of the estate thereof by him; and in the eighth, ninth, and tenth Chapters, the estate of the Church vnder the Emperors that were after <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> and the Popes: how men became as cold as hayle in true Religion, and as hot as fire to maintaine supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the shedding of blood: and how the Emperours, signified by the great Mountaine, tooke part with the superstitious, with a burning zeale persecuting those that would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to their superstitions.</p>
   <p>The great Starre that fell from Heauen as bitter as worme-wood, was the falling of the Bishop of Rome from Christ and his word, to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine superstitions, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was exalted of the Emperours aboue all other Bishops: The second Starre is the Popes, which exalted themselues aboue all the Emperours and Kings, and filled the world with
<pb facs="5"/>their mighty Locusts, that is, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, Popish Bishops, and their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Abbots, Friers, and such like: and when these were multiplied, as the sands of the sea, the Diuell that was bound for a thousand yeares, from <hi>Constantine</hi> his time, is let loose, &amp; obtaineth these innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Locusts to take his part, and persecuted the Saints, &amp; by these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Locusts, martyred more then euer hee did by the idolatrous Emperours, yet Christ and his Saints obtaine the victory. And from the beginning of the eleuenth Chapter vnto the end of the Booke, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied againe the very same things of Antichrist: but much more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with other similitudes.</p>
   <p>In the eleuenth Chapter, the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious are called the Courts, and the faithfull the temple, and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> is commanded, not to mete the Courts but to cast them out, and it is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied that they shall tread the holy Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="6"/>which is the faithfull, vnder their feete, <hi>1260.</hi> yeares.</p>
   <p>In the twelfth Chapter, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours which before are called a great mountaine, are heere called a great red Dragon, and are prophesied to be they which shall be the greatest cause of the treading vnder foote the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, all this time of the <hi>1260.</hi> yeares.</p>
   <p>In the thirteenth Chapter, the Popes that were called two Starres before, are called two beasts: the first Beast the Emperours shall set aboue all other Bishops, of purpose to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine superstitions, and to tread the faithfull vnder their feete all the said time of <hi>1260.</hi> yeares, and for this purpose the Dragon shall giue him his power and authority.</p>
   <p>The second Beast which had two hornes like the Lambe, is the second Starre as before, which is the Pope, when hee tooke vpon him not onely to bee the whole ruler in spirituall
<pb facs="6"/>matters, but to bee King of all Kings, as Christ is, and exalted himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Emperours.</p>
   <p>All the other Chaptors vnto the end, declare the manner of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Antichrist, and of Rome, and the flourishing of the Gospell after Rome shall be destroyed vntill Christs comming to iudgement.</p>
   <p>As Christ foretolde the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ieausalem, and truely at his time appointed performed it; so surely bath Christ Prophesied, and as truely in his time will accomplish the destruction of Rome: and as a whole yeare before the destruction of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, there was seene an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Blazing Starre; so the Blazing Starre that now so strangely appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, seemeth to manifest Gods fiery indignation against Rome, which shall shortly destroy it, and to bee a forewarning vnto all men that they flye from her false Doctrines, lest they be pertakers of her punishments,
<pb facs="7"/>and that all Kings and the Children of God should haue their hearts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed like the flaming Starre, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that abhominable Strumpet, to gather themselues to battell against her, and burne her with fire.</p>
   <p>And because euery one of Gods Children must claime by a liuely faith as perticular vnto himselfe all the generall promises of Christ, so we ought to apply the generall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, euery one vnto his owne soule. Let vs therefore examine our hearts whether wee retaine there any Poposh superstition, or sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any of Gods commandements vnrepented of; for against such that will not repent, the Lords anger bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth like the blazing Starre.</p>
   <p>But if wee flie by true repentance and a liuely faith, and catch hold of the blood of Iesus Christ, to wash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our sinnes, and of his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to couer our imperfections; then may wee with ioy looke vpon this bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb facs="7"/>Starre, and prayse God for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his fierce wrath against An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist and sinners, and for hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reuenge the blood of his Saints, and that the time approacheth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large and decke with his graces his Spouse the Church, which shall bee vpon the destruction of Rome, that the number of the elect being ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, Christ may come to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and exalt vs vnto his eternall glory.</p>
   <p>And because the more neere the Diuell seeth his time of eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to approach, the more hee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth against Gods Children: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this flaming starre must certifie vs, that euen now the Diuell by his priuie Counsellors the Iesuites, is most busily plotting and practising the destruction of all Protestant Kings and Countries, and it ought to prouoke vs to earnest prayer vnto our chiefe Captaine Iesus Christ, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found their enterprises, and to destroy
<pb facs="8"/>them in the same suare which they haue laid for others.</p>
   <p>To the Prince of the Kings of the earth, that loued vs and washed vs from our finnes, and made vs Kings and Priests vnto God, to him bee all honour, glory and power now and for euermore. Amen.</p>
