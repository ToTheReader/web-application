      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F nowe by my meanes (friendly Reader) yet in thy behalfe, <hi>Dionisius</hi> may be vnderstood in english, as I iudge, and hope, thou canst not be therat offended. It is long sythence he wrote in the Greeke tongue, and hath bin translated into Latine of late yeares, by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. In whose commendation, if he had needed other than hys owne, purchased by iust deserte, since he firste wrote, I wold not haue wanted to haue done my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoure. But for so muche as he is accompted of all antiquitie, the olde writer, for compendiousnesse and breuity in that he tooke in hand: sufficiēt it shal be in prayse or authoritie to haue yealded to him his owne, &amp; no more. Whiche what it is read <hi>Plinie,</hi> and there vnderstand howe that the author
<pb facs="4"/>
of this woorke beeing borne in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> a citie in <hi>Eegypt,</hi> descended of a moste noble familie, abounding in great welth &amp; authoritie, wrote not only this woorke, whiche wee haue interpreted, The Surueye of the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Worlde in <hi>Hexameter</hi> verses, beeing as yet but very yong: but also many other, both lerned and eloquēt. Who afterward resorting to the courte of Rome, was sent by <hi>Augustus</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, to surueye &amp; report the state &amp; situation of cuntries in the east parts of the worlde, when his eldest sonne was vpon expedition into <hi>Armenia,</hi> to the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Arabians.</hi> What shall I say, that ther haue bin many other worthy men of that name, who haue bē supposed to be the authors of this boke? howbeit, falsly in my opinion, as by farther discourse (at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) not necessarie, I could declare. In my trāslation, I trust I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued all requisite cōditions, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing (so well as I coulde) the intent
<pb facs="5"/>
of the Authour. And for thy commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie adioyning to the names of coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys and other places, in olde tyme frequented, the vsuall names also wherby they are knowne by all tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailers at this day, not omitting of certaine woordes, whiche were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes Latine, and so vsed, to make them Englishe for orders sake, not knowing any cause to the contrarye. As bycause out of <hi>Europa,</hi> wee terme commonly <hi>Europe:</hi> so lykewyse to say for <hi>Asia, Asie,</hi> and for <hi>Africa, Afrike,</hi> with suche lyke what euer. Accepte this the trauaile of vs both thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and if thou receiue any ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or commoditie therby, then haue I for my part, atteyned to my desire.</p>
