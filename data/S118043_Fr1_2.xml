   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had brought this small por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my intended labour to that unpolished perfection which now it is, and loth to let it go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad without a <hi>Mecoenas</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect it, I could not on the sudden resolve, either whom, or where to make my choice. For it is a tenet which may be easily granted, that men of retired lives, and small-grown fortunes, are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome known to many; it being with them as with those in the dark, who see and observe the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to and fro of others in the light, but are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen themselves: which condition, sith it doth little lesse then jump with mine, and reflect with
<pb facs="3"/>
an opposite rade upon me, I could not, I confesse, at the first be setled, untill my second thoughts recalled the happie memorie of your gracious name: unto whom I could not but commit the patronage of this unworthy work; both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that I was then a student in that house, where and when your welcome presence made it glad; as also (if it be not presumption so to say) in that I was directed by one and the self-same tutour with your gracious self. But above all, my especiall motive hereunto, was the never doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought of your kinde good will to students, and encouragement of those whose wishes are well devoted to the Muses. Now then, if it may please your Grace to make this book yours, by protecting it from the detracting crew of <hi>Zoilus</hi> his companie, I shall think my self alwayes too poore to expresse my thankfulnesse. Let it be as the grapes of Babel, who (as the Jews have it in a certain Apologue) sent upon a time to the vine-leaves of Judea, desiring to be oversha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by them; for otherwise they should be consumed by the heat of the sunne, and never suffered to grow up to maturitie. The wings of your favour may be as those leaves to shelter my green and scarce grown grapes; so shall I hope to see them thrive: not as the camomill, by being troden on; nor as the palm, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suppressed: for they be like to such a plant which needeth props, and is cherished by the
<pb facs="3"/>
pearled distillations of crystall dew. And as for your gracious self, my wishes are, that your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and dignities may increase with your houres; and let eternall glorie be attendant on your vertues, to crown them with eternitie: so shall you live, not onely with saints above, but with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>en below; and have the precious memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of your ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>wned name honoured of those, whose times are yet unborn, and beings as yet farre from being. Thus prayeth</p>
