Therfore to burie the hatred growne, both hetweene the seller and the buier, we proposed a possible means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the marchant, satitfie al the retaylers, and to assure the buier and occupier of the goodnes of such spiees without fraud. The meanes are grounded vpon the true knowledge of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

of garbelling of spices, the which is not only the true sifting of the same, but the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the good from the bad, and the putting of them vp in their said deuisions, and vppon the due vnderstanding of the difference of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling vsed in time past, with the time present. And in that difference a iust choise is to bee made, and an ordinance to bee giuen, for the Garbeller to follow, for the benefite of all, the which our intent and meaning is, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all, and in fauour of thee gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to publish, to the end, the practises of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling may be garbelled (we meane reformed) and hir Maiestie and people of this realme bee better serued in such affaires. For whose sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, we labour with hope, crauing of thee the like vtterance of friendship towards vs, and to accept our meaning, if thou finde not this discourse to be quallited to thy liking.</p>
