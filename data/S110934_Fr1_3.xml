   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsidering (gentle Reader) the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table times and miserable daies, that are come vpon vs in this last and weakest age of the world, partly by reason of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monnes and multitude of infirmities, partly by reason of the strangenes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliousnes of diseases breaking out more tediously then heretofore: and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring herewithall how apt and prone the multitude and common people are to affect, nay (which is more) to dote vpon and runne after the painted crew of seeming Phisitions and pratling practisers both men and women, gathering their skill, honestie and most precious secrets, from the rich mines of brasen-faced impudencie and bold blindnes: I could not but admonish thee, as thou tenderest thy health and wealth, to auoide such noisome ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and deepe deceiuers. And on the contrarie, I can but exhort and stirre thee vp to buy and reade this and other such like treatises, that so thou maist be the better prepared, (though not to take vpon thee the cure of thine owne or others their sicke estate) to discerne betwixt the ignorant and the learned, and the skilfull in word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and those which are skilfull in deede. As also that thou maist bee the better able to manifest and make knowne by word or writing the state and true condition of thy disease, vnto the profound and long studied in that profession, who for the keeping of a good conscience and thy welfare, haue not spared their bodies or goods, or refused any good meanes, whereby they might become fit to furnish thee with wholesome counsaile and due reliefe in the daies of thy distresse. Here shalt thou finde by serious suruay, great dimensions within small and narrow bounds. This volume shalt thou finde stuffed
<pb facs="4"/>full of Phisicke, as teaching by the lesser, what is to bee conceiued of the greater: and by a few, what is to bee followed in many. Full of Philosophie, as not resting in the things of the bodie, but deeply and diuinely laying open the nature of the soule. Herein is contained not onely great plentie of precepts, but also many controuersies of great moment and difficultie, sharply and pithily decided: and that with such varietie of authoritie, as is not almost in any other to bee found. This treatise shalt thou finde full of pleasantnes, as both the store of histories, and meanes of dispelling the mournfull fantasies of melancholike moodes, doe giue thee to conceiue: full of delight as maintaining the sight, the conductor and conueier of delights vnto the minde: full of healthfulnes, as teaching the way to auoide the rheume, that pregnant mother of so many maladies. And finally full of instruction and reliefe for the mitigating of the annoyances and inconueniences of drouping old age, as shewing the maner how to square out and piteh downe the firme and durable props of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing and long inioying of strong and lustie yeares. Which if thou striue and seeke accordingly to attaine, then shalt thou be the better able to discharge the duties of thy calling whilest thou liuest, and purchase to thy selfe a million of good witnesses, to reioyce and glad thy hart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the day of thy death and dissolution.</p>
