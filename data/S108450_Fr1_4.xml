      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, with no small contentation of minde, I haue according to your request perused your translation of <hi>Mounsieur Coggnets</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall politicke or rather right Christian dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, in commendation of Veritie, and detestation of her contrarie. And as that honorable Aucthor made most graue ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to handle such matter and subiect as for this time and state of his Countrey was more then necessarie, so can I not but singularly commende your choyce of this stranger, &amp; your endeuour to make him an English Denizon, thereby to transport, and communicate with your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey generally such precious wares as will be founde no lesse hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some &amp; commodious, then delectable and pleasant to all degrees, but especially to the best and most noble. For although Princes and great Estates haue many felicious blessinges, whereof priuate men can not bee pertakers, yet in this one respecte is their estate more miserable, that they seeldome or neuer finde a faithfull friend that sincerely wil or dare <hi>Auriculas teneras mordaci rodere vero.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they reiect often the vnsauorie holesome bitter medicine, that would reduce their health and preserue their strength. And in steede thereof swallowe vp the delicate sweetened poyson that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally workes their helplesse bane and mortall confusion. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue the wise Philosophers admonished Emperours, Kinges, Princes, and other great and honourable persons, that swymme in the Seas of felicitie, by reading Histories and morall politicke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses to enforme themselues of such matters, as their Parasites will not, and honest seruantes or freindes many times dare not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale vnto them, thereby to escape the daungerous downefall of impendant calamities, whereunto the greatest Princes are much more subiect then the most inferiour priuate persons. Since then this treatise (conteyning a <hi>Methodicall</hi> abundance of such godlie graue admonitions for all estates) may aptly be compared to a precious Posie of most fragrant flowers (compendiously for that purpose gathered from infinite varietie of forren gardens, <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Poeticall, Politicke, Morall, Humane</hi> and <hi>Diuine,</hi> grauely, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly and Christianly, conferred and applyed) Depriue not your

selfe of dewe prayse and thankes, for publishing and emparting with your Countreymen so rare a Iewell, whom you shall thereby also suspend in reuerent expectation of more honourable fruits to succede this your first right vertuous blossomes: The true ensignes and very originall cause of right nobilitie: Whereunto with your happie societie of the Muses, I wish and very hartely recommende you.</p>
