   <p>LIke as the almightie eternall God, thre in personnes and one in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce, of his tendre mercye and loue, not onely created man at the beginnyng after his owne symilytude and lykenesse, but also wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>dage: Euen so whan man neither regardyng his wonderfull crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, nor his moost deare redempcyon gropeth in darkenes, in vyce and blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,<note place="margin">The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> goodnes of God</note> lyeth in the deuyls prison, and goeth in the waye of damnacion, God alwaye setteth vp his light before him, sendeth the message of his worde vnto him, sheweth him what case he is in, geueth hym war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, openeth the prison doore, calleth him out of the deuyls seruice, telleth him what daunger it is to be his bōdman, or seruant vnto synne. This doth God alway afore he punishe and plage the worlde. This (I saye) hath bene the propertie of God sens the beginnyng, as the storyes and prophecies of all the holy Byble do testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye. And though we had no writyng of Gods actes in tymes paste, yet hath he practised this same his wonderfull worke of mercye vpon vs. So that lyke as we
<pb facs="3"/>
must nedes confesse that we are created of God, and redemed by his onely mercye in<note place="margin">God hath shewed no lesse kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to vs thē he did to the olde worlde.</note> his deare sonne Jesus Christ. So can we not denye, but we haue hearde his holy message, had no lesse preachynges &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges of daungers to come, then other haue had afore our dayes. Yet euen the same mercyfull God that sente No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> to preache righteous vnto the wicked world, and conuerted the Niniuites by his word in the ministraciou of the prophet Jonas, hath done euen so with vs, in euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion. And some (thankes be vnto him therfore) hath he brought out of darkenes into his wonderfull light, and out of the deuyls seruyce, into the kyngdome of his deare sonne.</p>
   <p>But alas and wo to this vnthankeful worlde. For lyke as a great nombre that be in prison of Satan, wyl not come furth when thei are called and the dore set open, but go on styll stomblyng in darkenes, whan the lanterne of light is offred them: Euen so if any playe a wyse mans part, &amp;<note place="margin">Thei that folowe goddes worde, are laughed to scorne.</note> do as he is warned by Goddes worde, he shall haue a sorte of apyshe people, a nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of desertes and scornefull mockers, whiche, because the man wyll not daunce in the deuyls morys with them, nor kepe theyr companye in the bondage of synne and vice, neither runne with thē vnto like confusyon (as S. Peter calleth it) laugh him to scorne, and bleare out theyr tonges at him, euen lyke fooles and cockescom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes of the worlde. And lyke as whan a
<pb facs="3"/>
poore wretche commeth out of prison, he shal haue mo to stāde gasyng and gapyng vpon him, then to do him good, or to help him to his fees. Euen so now that god of his mercy hath called vs out of Satans prison, and frō the scole of false doctryne, my Lordes foole with his companyo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s standeth staryng vpon vs, and mocketh vs, because we syt not styll with other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners. There goeth a felowe of the new learnyng (saieth one) there is one of these newe fangled gospellers (sayeth another) that is one of the newe brethren (sayth the third) he foloweth the newe fayth. &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Wherfore in consyderacion hereof I<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christes fayth is no newe thyng.</note> haue here set furth this booke: partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it sheweth the antiquitie and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient age of oure holy Christen fayth, and partly to geue occasion vnto all suche as haue receyued it, not to be ashamed of it, nor to shrynke frō it for any opprobrious mockage or scornefull derysyon in thys<note place="margin">1. Cor. i.</note> worlde. The Apostle sayth, that the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng or worde of Chrystes crosse, is fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishenes to them that perishe, and that the thyng whiche appertayneth to the spirite<note place="margin">

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. Cor. ii.</note> of God, is folyshenes to a carnally myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man. Wherby lyke as we may learne that it is no newe thing to be mocked and stared vpon for holdyng with the doctrine that maketh so muche of Christes death, and the true worshippyng of God in the spirit. Euen so may we se (to the syngular comfort of our conscience) that no manne mocketh vs for it, but suche as perish and
<pb facs="4"/>
are earnally minded: And that for all their derision and scornyng. It is yet the power<note place="margin">To vs whiche are saued it is the power of God.</note> of god i. Corinthians. i. And belongeth to his holy spirit .i. Corinthians .i. And is not oure owne doctrine, neither of any other mans makyng. This is nowe to vs a cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and consolacion.</p>
   <p>But because the worlde is angrye with vs for oure fayth, and geueth vs so euyl reporte for teachyng it. It shalbe expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for vs to declare what fayth is, and what fayth we meane, when we make mē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion therof. Fyrst because we may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it after oure owne iudgement, we wyll rehearse the wordes of the Apostle, whiche writyng to the Hebrewes, sayeth<note place="margin">What fayth is</note> after this maner: Fayth is a substance of thynges to be hoped for, an euidence (or certayntie) of thynges whiche do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. By the whiche diffinicion, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfest, that when we set furth or teache this fayth, we meane no vayne fayth, no false opinion of fayth, no fonde ymagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion of fayth, no deade fayth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o ydle fayth: but a substancial thyng, euen a sure belefe of thynges that are to be hoped for, and a profe, experience or knowledge o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> thinges that are not sene. This faith then is the iustrument, wherby we fele and are certayne of heauenly thynges, that oure corporall eye can not se.</p>
   <p>Nowe because none other vertue can so apprehende the mercy of god, nor cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifye vs so effectually of oure saluacion,
<pb facs="4"/>
as this liuyng fayth doeth, therfore hath the scripture imputed oure iustification before God, onely vnto fayth among all other vertues: Not without other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues folowyng, but without any other worke or deede iustifiyng.</p>
   <p>This is the fayth of Christ, whiche all<note place="margin">Ad Roma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nos. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la. Ephe. Jaco. ii</note> the scripture speaketh of. This is the fayth that saint Paul preacheth to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye in the sight of God, as sainct James teacheth, that workes iustifye in the sight of menne, and that it is but a dead fayth whiche hath no workes. This is the fayth<note place="margin">Hebre. xi. Ro. xiiii.</note> without the whiche it is impossile to please God, and of the whiche whatsoeur proceadeth not, is synne. This is the<note place="margin">Actes .xv. i. Peter. v Gala. v.</note> fayth wherby God purifieth our heartes, and whose ende is saluacion. This is the fayth that worketh by charitie or godly loue, and is of value before God. This is the fayth wherby the holy fathers whiche were afore Christes in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

      </gap> eate and drynke and enioy the same mercy of God in Christ, that we are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of.</p>
   <p>To be shorte, this is the same fayth▪ whereby God saued those hys electe, of whom sainct▪ Paule maketh mencion, in the foresayd Epistle to the Hebrues, and<note place="margin">Hebre. xi.</note>

      </gap>eherseth many godly fruites of the same in their conuersacion.</p>
   <p>This then is no newefangled fayth▪ no straunge fayth, no fayth inuented by mannes brayne, but euen the same that
<pb facs="5"/>
Gods holy spirite teacheth in the infally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trueth of his scripture, and that Adam Abel, Enoch and all the other seruauntes of God were saued in. Why do men ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either call it a newe fangled fayth, or reporte euyll of vs, for settyng it furth: Why? I feare me this is one cause: The olde fayth that all those seruauntes of God had whō the Apostle nameth in the eleuenth chapiter to the Hebrewes, and a lyfe and cōuersacion ioyned vnto it, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was riche and ful of all good workes. Therfore seyng there be so many bablers and pratlers of fayth, and so fewe that bryng furth y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> worthy fruites of penaūce, it ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eth to the worlde occasion to reporte of vs, that our fayth is but new fangled. They se vs not fall to labour and takyng of paynes, as Adam dyd: They se not the righteousnesse and thankefulnesse in vs, that was in Abell: They se vs not walke after the worde &amp; wyll of God, as Enoch dyd: They se vs not take Gods warnyng so ernestly as Noe dyd: They se vs not so obedient to the voyce of God, nor so w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap> willyng and content to leaue our frendes, to forsake oure owne wylles oure owne lādes and gooddes at Gods callyng, and dwell in a straunge countre, to do goddes pleasure as Abraham dyd. They se that we chose not rather to suffre aduersitie with the people of God, then to enioye the pleasures of synne for a sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>on: They se vs not esteme the rebuke of Christ (or trouble for his sake) to be greater riches▪
<pb facs="5"/>
then al y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> treasures of this world, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses dyd. To be shorte, they se not in oure garden those swete floures and fruites▪ of Gods holy spirite, whiche were in them that had the olde fayth.</p>
   <p>Ashamed may we be therfore as many of vs as either wryte, teach, preache, speak or talke of the olde fayth, if we endeuoure not our selues to haue those olde heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vertues that were euer plentyfull in all Goddes true seruauntes, in euery one (I meane) accordyng to his callyng. Not that it is euyl to teache or talke of the true olde sayth, but this I say, because that (accordyng to the doctryne of sainct Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes)<note place="margin">Jaco. i.</note> they are but disceyuers of them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, that are not doers of Gods worde aswell as hearers therof. And through suche slender receiuyng of Christes holy gospell, it is nowe come to passe, that like as we haue nede of suche an Apostle as was holy S. Paule, to rebuke this vayne confidence that men put in their workes, and to tel vs that no worke of our doyng (but fayth of Gods workyng) doth iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye vs in his sight. Euen so haue we no lesse nede of suche another Apostle (as was<note place="margin">would to god we had many suche as James the Apostle was.</note> holy sainct James) to rebuke this horrible vnthankefulnes of menne, that professyng thē selues to be christē, &amp; to holde of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes olde fayth, are yet dead vnto all good workes, receyue not the worde of God in mekenes, cast not away all vnclennes and maliciouenes, are swyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

are forgetfull hearers of the worde, and not lyuers therafter, boastyng them selues to be of goddes pure and vndelyled reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and yet refrayne not their tonges from euyl, visite not the poore, the frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and the desolate in their trouble, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kepe them selues vndefyled from this worlde. Reade the fyrst Chapiter of his Epistle.</p>
   <p>What occasion might suche an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle (as holye sainct James was) haue to wryte another, yea a sharper epistle seyng so many pretendyng to be of Jesu Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes old fayth, are yet so parcial, haue such a carnall respecte of personnes, are not riche in fayth, dispise the poore, practise not the lawe of godly loue, talke and ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle<note place="margin">O vnthāk<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful world.</note> of fayth, not hauyng the workes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, clothe not the naked, healpe not the poore to their liuyng, regarde not theyr necessitie, haue but▪ deade fayth, declare not by good and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
