none is more god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
commendable,
nor profytable to
<pb facs="3"/>
the cōmon wealth, then to promote,
and set forthe vnto their subiectes
the pure, and sincere religion of the
eternal God, kyng of al kynges, and
Lord of al Lordes. Then shal iustice,
peace, and concord raygne, the doore
of Idololatrie be shut vp, vi the why<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
hath entred all euyl, and kynges
and kyngdomes fallen into ieopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
as the writinges of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Prophets
do testifie. But the more thys noble
fact is glorious, godly, and princely,
the more difficile &amp; hard it is. For the
enemy of God &amp; of al mankynd, the
Deuyll, customablye is wont to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the princes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world, so that
eyther they vtterly neglect the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the true God as a thynge fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyshe,
and of no estimacion, eyther
prouoke thē cruelly to persecute it.
If he cā bryng neither y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> one, neither
the other of these to pas: he wyll do
the beste de can to preserue a myxte,
and myngled religion, that shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
playnly be agaynst, nor wholye
wyth hym: And so vse the matter,
that partly goddes truth shall take
place, partly the supersticious inuē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of man. The whych myngled
<pb facs="3"/>
and myxed religion is so muche the
more daungerous, as it is accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for pure and good. Therfore it is
earnestlye forbidden by God, as the
examples of the scripture declareth.
Iehu the kynge of the Israelites
when he had remoued all grosse and
sensible Idololatrye: and with the
swerde had taken away all the Ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lolatricall
priestes. iii. Reg. x, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
of God, neuertheles because
he walked not in the lawe of God
wyth all his herte, and lefte not the
wayes of Ieroboam. And againste
these minglers and patchers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
speaketh Elias the Prophet,
iii. Reg. xviii. Howe longe sayth he
wyl ye halt on both sides. If y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Lord
be God, folow hym, if Baal, go ye af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
hym. Euen so we may iustly say:
If y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> priesthod &amp; ministery of Christe
with his notes and markes be true,
holy, &amp; absolutely perfect, receiue it:
in case it be not, folow y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> pope. Christ
can not abide to haue the leuē of the
pharises myngled wyth hys swete
flowre. He wold haue vs ether hote,
or cold, the luke warme he vometeth
vp: and not wythout a cause.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
For he accuseth God of ignorancie
and folishenes, that entendeth to ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>orne
and beutifye his doctrine and
decrees with humaine cogitacions.
What kynge or prince of the world
wold suffer hys statutes, lawes, and
testament to be cut of, and set on at
euery mans libertie and pleasure?
Shulde not the same glory, maiesty,
and honour be geuē vnto the lawes
and testament of Christ, that is sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
wyth hys precious bloude? The
worde of God wherwyth he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
and ruleth his church, is a sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of yron. Psal. ii. and not a rod of
wylowe to be bowed wyth euerye
mans finger, either a rede to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at mans wyll: no, neither a pece
of lether to be stretched and reached
out wyth any mans teth.</p>
   <p>These thynges be spoken of me
most gracious and vertuous kyng,
to commende youre maiestyes and
your moste honorable councels do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges
that seke the glorye of God
and the restituciō of hys holye and
Apostolycall churche. The whyche

honourable and wyse councel, haue

gracyouslye be gon: goddes mercye
in the bowels of Chryst Iesu graūt
you moost gratiously to perfourme.
The people of Englande were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
wyth the vyolente and cruel
tyrannye of Antychryste: darckenes
and ignorauncie occupied y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> mindes
all moost of all menne, so that fewe
knew the true way to eternal salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyon.
And yet manye Prynces and
wysemen delyte and tarye in thys
darckenesse, and can not or wyll not
bare nor suffer the radiant and shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge
beames of the Gospell, more
then the night crow can the beames
of the sonne: but the merciful father
of heauen shall better their syghte
when hys good and mercyfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is. But the Lorde be praysed
your magestye: youre moste honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

what y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> greatest parte, but what
the better dothe, that the lawe of
the hyghe and myghtye God, maye
be knowne to your hyghnes people,
as did Dauid, Iosaphat, Ezechias
and Iosyas. And in your maiesties
so doing, ye bynde not only the true
and lyuynge members of Chryste to
<pb facs="5"/>
geue God thanckes in thys behalfe
but also declare your selfe to be the

of religyon. For those mens fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishenes
(rather I shuld sai malice)
is condemned by the worde of God
that teacheth howe a kynge in hys
younge age wyth hys wyse and
godlye counsell shoulde abolyshe I<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dolatrye,
and sette forthe the true,
&amp; godly religyon of the liuing God.
Thus declareth the notable &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
facte of Iosias that folowed the
relygyon of hys father not Ammon
the Idolater, but of Dauid, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clynynge
to the rightt hande, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the left hand. And destroyed
not onlie the Images of his father,
but also of Ieroboā, &amp; of Solomon.
iiii. Reg. xxii .xxiii. This scuit of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias
holp his godly coūcellers, &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuous
priestes. Euē so Ioas beynge
but a child was holp by his coūcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in the lyke procedinges &amp; refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maciō
of religion. In case y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> princes,
Bishops, &amp; priests had not knowen
it to be the cōmaundemēt of God to
haue obeyed these .ii. yonge &amp; godlye
kynges, they wold not haue consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto his procedinges.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
But we see howe gladde they were
to do it. The Princes and councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
moued no sedicion, the Bishop
and the priestes soughte not for the
defence of their proper doctrine, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to myngle theirs with goddes,
but were content wyth the sole and
onely lawe of God. Ye noble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and councellours, praise be vnto
the liuinge God for your great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and godlye assistaunce in this
behalfe. And the Lorde be magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

and others of this Realme
that haue, and do put to their helpes
and studies to brynge the churche of
Chryste to her olde, and reuerende
perfeccion agayn. And al other that
hynder your maiesties godlye pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
openly, or secretelye, God wyll
douteles reuenge at length.</p>
   <p>The godly and vertuouse begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges,
moste noble Prince, of your

the eyght of a blessed memorie, shall
by your hyghnes godlye be ended,

And a thousande tymes the rather

remoue &amp; take away all y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> monumē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes,

For as longe as anye of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne,
there remayneth also occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of relapse vnto the abolyshed
supersticion of Antichriste. Seynge
I see in the writynges of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
God to require the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of his lawe onely, concerninge
religion: and threatneth all Pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

that neglecte or contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

I can do no lesse, howe soeuer the
worlde shall take my doynges: but
exhorte and pray the magistrates to
brynge the churche to her fyrst per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feccion.
For if I shulde studye to

   <p>Thys kinge raygned but thre mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nethes

      <pb facs="8"/>
Souche as thynke peace and quyet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
shal come to the realme a better

And the same commaunded God, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit

vnmete for a chrystyan man to bare
the Magystrates of God in hande
that incase the doctryne of Chryste,

plausible, and well lykynge ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyes
(that is to speake playnelye w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>

Doutelesse if the Popes members

Moste gracyous kynge and
