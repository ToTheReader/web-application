   <head>TO HIS LOVING <hi>flock of Salt-prestoun who</hi> by the preaching of the Gospel, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and turne to the Lorde.</hi> IOHN DAVIDSON, wisheth increase of Faith &amp; Repentance, with <hi>constancie therin, to the end &amp; in the end, Amen.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat hath beene the drifte of my doctrine sen god placed mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloued in Christe Iesus, yee cannot be ignorant, seing with out excellencie of wordes and all curiositie, in moste plaine sorte ofter my familiar maner, I shew you the Testimonie of God, esteeming, <hi>not to knowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye thinge among you,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<pb facs="4"/>sayeth, <hi>saue Iesus Christ and him crucified.</hi> For the whilk purpose this daye seauen yeare, to wit; the 16. day of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1595. the firste time I spake among you, I made choise of this place of Scripture follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, to bee as a ground of that doctrine whilk thereafter I minded to builde thereupon, during our continuance toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at gods pleasure. The place was this, as ye remember. <hi>The people that sate in darknesse, sawe great light. &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 4.16. First, I opened the true meaning of the place, obseruing some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent notes therupon. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I made some vse thereof by applycation to you for that present, as a people by the sea-coaste, long sitting in no lesse darknesse, then did they of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile,</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>that dwelt by the lake of <hi>Genazareth,</hi> whilk was to them as a sea: shewing therewithall the greate mercie of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde you, in offering to you that day the light of his gospell after sik a rare manner, so that rightly it might be saide ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of new, <hi>A people that sate in darknesse, hath seene greate lighte.</hi> Last, after all this, I gathered some general grounds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion out of that place, as first. The miserable blinde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of man by nature, without Christ. Secondlie, the moste comfortable light of saluation in Christ. Thirdly, that men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue Christ his light by faith wrought by the holy Spirite in the preaching of the gospell. Fourthly, the end, that walking in that light of Christ, we may
<pb facs="5"/>glorifie him that hes transtated vs out of darknes into his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful light.</p>
   <p>Heerevnto in the afternoone the same daye, I added these words of Christ: <hi>Behold, I stand at the dore and knock, if any man heare my voice and open the dore, I will come in to him, and suppe with him and he with mee. Reuel.</hi> 3.20. To serue as a spurre to exhort you to the cheerefull embraceing of so comfortable a ghuest, whilk mooued the whole pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish present, so at that time and long thereafter, that as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaketh of the <hi>Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, I beare you record that if it had beene possible, ye would haue pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out your eyes &amp; haue giuen them to me.</hi> Though nowe and then to some I be-come an enemie for speaking of the trueth. God
<pb facs="5"/>graunt them amendement that offend of simplicitie and not of malice. But we must not bee offended, though one part on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, of the foure parts of ground that the seede of Gods worde lights on, (&amp; seeme for the most part to receaue it,) bee fruitful, for Sathan is a busie Bishop; and persecution &amp; cares of the world with fleshly pleasures, ar not soone ouercome. But with this sorte of people at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I haue not to doe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye with you who obey from the hart vnto that forme of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, wherevnto ye were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered. Whilk yee know hes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bene according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said groundes. For the better keeping in memorie whereof, I haue thought good to put them in writ in diuers formes,
<pb facs="6"/>and set them to printing for your vse as ye see, that nothing bee wanting that maye further the sounde grounding of you, according to your meane ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, in the true Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, so farre as in me lyeth. Wherefore it rests, that yee bee not slouthful in exercising your selues, &amp; your families, in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, learning, and practising heereof. Fare-well in Christ. 16. Nouember. 1602.</p>
