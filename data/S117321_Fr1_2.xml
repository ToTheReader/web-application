lawes, where men doe no benefit, before they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to receive; it is allowed a Canon in moralitie,
where many good deeds are to be lost, that wee may
place one well. No man can dye in debt, that hath
an honest remembrance of his obligation, since death
is to bee reckoned from the first day of our ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
In this confidence I appeare, and being
neither guilty of desert, or power to reward, I must
present the memory of your owne act and vertue to
pay your selfe.</p>
   <p>That which waiteth upon my thankes, is this
handfull of paper imaginations, though below your

upon; they were meant for innocent mirth, and can
bee no prejudice, if they onely serve to set off your
