Plainely laying open those pernitious sleights that hath brought many ignorant men to confusion. Written for the general benefit of all gentlemen, citizens, aprentises, countrey farmers and yeomen, that may hap to fall into the company of such coosening companions. With a delightfull discourse of the coosnage of colliers. By R. Greene, Maister of Arts</title>

   <p>When neyther of these would serue, I had consorts that could verse, nippe, and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>st, so that I had a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall sight into euery profitable fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ultie. Insomuch that my principles grew authenticall, and I so famous, that had I not beene crost by those two peeuish Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, I might at the nexte Midsommer haue worne Doctor <hi>Stories</hi> cappe for a fauor. For I trauelled almost throughout all England, admired for my ingenious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie: till comming about Exceter, I began to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise my art, and drawing in a Tanner for a tame Conie, assoone as he had lost two shillings he made this replie. Sirha, although you haue a liuery on your backe, and a cognisance to countenance you withall, and beare the port of a Gentleman, yet I see you are a false knaue and a Conny-catcher, and this your companion your setter, and that before you and I part Ile proue.</p>
   <p>At these wordes Conny-catcher and Setter, I was driuen into as great a maze, as if one had dropt out of the clowds, to heare a pesant cant the wordes of art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lōging to our trade: yet I set a good face on the matter and asked him what he ment by Cony-catching. Marry (q. he) althogh it is your practise, yet I haue for 3. pence bought a litle Pamphlet, that hath taught me to smoke such a couple of knaues as you be. When I heard him talke of smoaking, my heart waxed cold, and I began to gather into him gently. No no sir (q. he) you cānot verse vpon me, this booke hath taught me to beware of cros-biting:
<pb facs="3"/>
And so to be breefe he vsed me curteously, and that night causd the Constable to lodge mee in prison, &amp; the nexte morning I was carried before the Iustice, where likewise he had this cursed book of Cony catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so that hee could tel the secretes of mine art better then my selfe: whereupon after strict examination I was sent to the gaole, &amp; at the Sessions by good hap &amp; some friend that my money procured mee, I was deliuered. Assoone as I was at liberty, I got one of these bookes, &amp; began to tosse it ouer very deuoutly, wherin I found one art so perfectly anotomized, as if he had bene prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner in our facultie forty winters before: then with a deepe sigh I began to curse this <hi>R. G.</hi> that had made a publike spoyle of so noble a science, and to exclaime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that palpable asse whoso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uer, that would make any pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>-man priuy to our secret sciences. But see the sequel, I smoothered my sorrowe in silence, and away I trudged out of Deuonshire, &amp; went towards Cornwal, &amp; comming to a simple Ale-house to lodge, I found at a square table hard by the fire halfe a doozen countrie Farmars at cardes. The sight of these penny-fathers at play, draue me straight into a pleasant passion, to blesse fortune that had offred such sweet opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise my wits, &amp; fil my purse with crowns: for I coūted all the mony they had, mine by proper interest. As thus I stood looking on them playing at cros-ruffe, one was taken reuoking, whereat the other said, what neighbour wil you play the cony-catcher with vs? no no, wee haue read the booke as wel as you. Neuer went a cup of small beare so sorowfully down an Ale-knights belly in a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty morning as that word stroke to my hart, so that for feare of trouble I was fain to try my good hap a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> square play, at which fortune fauoring mee I wan twenty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and yet doe as simply as I could, I was not onelie suspected, but called Conny-catcher and crosse-biter.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>But away I went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ith the money, and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>mongst the crue, but I heard of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>econd parte worse then the first, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>hich <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>aue mee into such a great choller<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> that I began to enquire what this <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> G.</hi> should bee. At last I learned that hee was a scholler, and a Maister of Artes, and a Conny-catcher in his kinde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> though not at cards, and one that fauoured good fellowes, so they were not palpable offendors in such desperate lawes: wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon reading his bookes, and surueying euery line with deepe iudgement, I began to note folly in the man, that would straine a Gnat, and lette passe an Elephant: that would touch small scapes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and lette grosse faultes passe without any reprehension. Insomuch that I resolued to make an Apologie, and to aunswere his libellous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uectiues, and to proue that we Conny-catchers are like little flies in the gras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
