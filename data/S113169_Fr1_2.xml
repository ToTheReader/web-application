      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Gnorance as Diuines doe testifie, is one of the
plagues put vpon man the creature, for trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing
of the commaundements of God his
creatour from which we are to come, (as the
patient from his disease) by degrees. Mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is likened by Aristotle to the eies of the How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
in the day-light. Salomon sayth: <hi>Dedi cor meum vt
scirem prudentiam, doctrinam, errores{que}, et stultitiam, et
agnom quod in his quo{que} est labor et afflictio spiritus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The fame of our ancestours that diligently laboured to
bring vs, and in many things brought vs from ignorance to
knowledge, shall neuer be forgotten so long as those things
wherein they laboured, be in estimation, and (in mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
so farre forth as we may, we should Imitate the steps of
them, for this plague of ignorance is so great, that neither
did they neither shall we finde so much: but that we must
leaue sufficient, for our posteritie to be found.</p>
   <p>Wherefore seeing sufficiently others to labour and trauell
in other Sciences, I thought good to bestow my labour in
Musicke, seeing that paines might so much preuaile, as by
the fruit of my labour may plainly appeare. I tooke the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in hand vpon this occasion, though it were far distant
from my profession, being desired by a gentleman, to instruct
him in song, I gaue him such rules as my Master gaue mee:
Yet could I giue him no song so plaine, wherein there chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
not some one thing or other, to which none of those rules
could directly leade him. Marking then how in minde, I
did know what by rule I could not teach, I perceiued how
<pb facs="3"/>
vnder the shade of rule, I attained to many things by rote▪
and how pleasant, speedie and sure it is to runne by rule, I
tooke this labour in hand, and brought it to this passe. Olde
Musitions laid downe for Song, manifold and crabbed,
confuse, tedious rules, as for example: though there be in
all but sixe names, Vt, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, hauing amongst
them an easie order, yet could not they by rule declare, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these should bee attributed to euery Note, vnlesse
they had first framed the long ladder or skale of Gam-vt,
to which some added, thinking the ladder too short, some
hewed off a peece, thinking it too long. Then would they
haue the learner be as perfect in comming downe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as in going vp forward, least in his practise he should
fall, and breake his neck. Then must he learne, Gam-vt, in
rule, Are, in space, b my in rule, C faut in space, &amp;c. Then
must he know Gam vt, how many cleues, how many notes.
Are, how many notes, &amp;c. Then must he know b, quadrij,
proper chant and bemul, re in Are, whereby vt in Cfaut,
whereby mi, in Alamire, whereby &amp;c. And when all haue
done, after their long circumstances of time, whereby they
should be often driuen to millibi, for Notes standing in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
places of Gam-vt, haue names that the place where
they stand comprehend not. Touching all the prolixe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
&amp; needlesse difficulties, that they vse, it loathes
me greatly that heere I should write them: &amp; much more
would it grieue the Reader to learne them. Also many
things are vsed in Song, for which they giue no rules at all,
but committed them to dodge at it, harke to it, and harpe
vpon it. Now (Reader) th'effect of my pretended purpose,
and fruit of my finished labor is this, where they gaue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixe
<pb facs="3"/>
rules, I haue giuen briefe rules, where they gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
rules, I haue giuen sure rules, and where they
haue giuen no rules, I haue giuen rules. After all this that
I haue said of their rules, I doe affirme that they deserued
greater commendations aboue mee, for finding out the long
way, then I aboue others for laying down the short way. For
had not they opened the gappe, touching mee, it might very
well hap that I should in no sort enter my selfe, and much
lesse in any sort inuite others: nothing can at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
be persected, and therefore are they to bee holden ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
as the old verse hath:
<q>
         <l>But ere the Painter can sure his craft attaine,</l>
         <l>Much froward facion transformeth hee in vayne,</l>
         <l>By raysing superfluitie, and adding that doth want,</l>
         <l>Rude Pictures are made both perfect and pleasant.</l>
         <l>For such things by negligence are left vndone,</l>
         <l>That by good diligence might be wonne.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>There be sufficient, many, and firme prooues had of this
that I say, which may by my rules be done, of which I will
heere put downe some of them, though I get as little by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beleeued, as I should loose by being belyed.</p>
   <p>In a moneth and lesse I instructed a child about the age
of eight yeeres, to sing a good number of songs, difficult
crabbed Songs, to sing at the first sight, to be so indifferent
for all parts, alterations, Cleues, flats, and sharpes, that he
could sing a part of that kinde, of which he neuer learned
any song, which child for strangenesse was brought before
the Lord Deputie of Ireland, to be heard sing: for there
were none of his age, though he were longer at it, nor any
of his time, (though he were elder) knowne beefore these
<pb facs="4"/>
rules to sing exactly.</p>
   <p>There was another, that had before often handled In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
but neuer practised to sing (for hee could not
name one Note) who hearing of these rules, obtayned in
short time, such profit by them, that he could sing a difficult
song of himselfe, without any Instructor.</p>
   <p>There was another, who by dodging at it, hearkning to
it, &amp; harping vpon it, could neuer be brought to tune sharps
aright, who so soone as hee heard these rules set downe for
the same, could tune them sufficiently well. I haue taught
diuerse others by these rules, in lesse then a moneth; what
my selfe by the olde, obtained not in more then two yeeres.
Diuerse other proofes I might recite, which heere as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
I doe omit, because the thing will shew it selfe. Diuerse
haue repented in their age that they were not put to sing in
their youth; but seeing that by these rules, a good skill may
be had in a moneth: and the wayes learned in foure or fiue
dayes: none commeth too late to learne, and specially if this
saying be true: <hi>That no man is so olde but thinketh he
may liue one yeere longer.</hi> As Aristotle in setting forth
his predicaments, saw many things requisite to be entreated
off: and yet vnfit to be mixed with his treatise: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made ante predicaments, and post predicaments: so I
for the same cause (desirous to abolish confusion) haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to my rules, ante rules, and post rules. Vale.</p>
