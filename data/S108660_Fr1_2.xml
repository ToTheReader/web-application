   <head>An Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not of</hi>
that opinion
(good chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
that I
thinke the
scriptures of
God, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge
the
substance of doctrine contained in them,
be of such difficultie to the learned and
skilfull in the tongues, that they may not,
with the assistance of Gods grace and
meane diligence, easily atttaine to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of them. But for somuch as
God worketh nowe by ordinarie meanes,
and not by miraculous inspiration, as hee
did in the Apostles time, it can not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
but that to the vnlearned reader or
<pb facs="3"/>
hearer that wanteth the helpe of knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and vnderstanding, they may bring
some difficultie, as well for the matter in
sundrie particular places, as generally for
the phrase and maner of penninge farre
differing from other writers. Wherefore
I thought it woulde not be vnprofitable to
the Church of Christ, nor vnpleasaunt to
the Godly, if, for the help and furtherance
of such vnlearned persons, I did set foorth
some briefe and plaine exposition of the
Chapters of the old testament, which vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
are red in the Church on the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
dayes of common prayer.</p>
   <p>Beside the motion of some godly persons,
and other causes, wherewith I haue bene
induced herevnto, one principall is this,
that the aduersaries of the Gospell, when
they are by vs blamed for keeping the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God in ignorance of the Scriptures;
<pb facs="3"/>
and hauinge their common prayer in a
straunge tongue, haue nothing more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
then this answere, that the common
people do not only heare the Psalmes and
other partes of the Scripture euen nowe
that they be in English with as little fruit
and small edefying, as they did before, but
also with some perill of conceiuing erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and false opinions by hearing those
thinges which they doe not vnderstande.
This answere, as it is vntrue in a great
part, (for that we see manye nowe, which
conceiue good instruction and sweete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes
by hearing the Scriptures redde,
where none did before,) so I cannot denie,
but in some it is to true, But surely in such
persons as either vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
mislike the seruice and state of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or else as men giuen ouer to the cares
of the world and lustes of the flesh haue no
<pb facs="4"/>
sense of God or godlynesse. Otherwise
there is no man so simple but that by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Scriptures, although hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
not the whole matter, nor euerye
clause therof, yet he shall light vpon some
partes whereby he may gather both good
instruction of his faith, and profitable les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for the amendement of his life. Yea,
and the verye Godlesse wordling that is
furthest from all true sense of Religion
and holynesse, shall heare those terrible
threatninges of Gods iustice, that when
God shall touch him by sickenesse or other
affliction, bee hee neuer so desperate, shall
make his conscience to quake. But that
the more good might bee wrought in mens
hearts, and the lesse euill conceyued in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious
opinions, I thought some such tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile
as this is might be a very good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and especiallye where they lacke the
<pb facs="4"/>
presence of some learned and discrete mā
to teach them. In this doing albeit my
conscience did beare me witnesse of a good
meaning, and did put mee in hope to doe
some good thereby: yet, to confesse the
truth, I both was and yet am somewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashed
to giue my traueiles abroade vnto
the world. I know how daintie these days
are, and haue felt by experience how wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
and vncharitable many be in scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of other mens doinges, very ready to
shake euery fillable and letter, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any iust cause at all to obiect heynous
and blasphemous crimes. If I please not
such persons (gentle Reader) thou maist
not greatly maruaile, For in dede neither
doe I seke it, neither thinke my selfe hable
to doe it. I write not to them, I write to the
good and modest Christian that deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in reading and hearing of the worde
<pb facs="5"/>
of God, and lacketh those ordinarie helps,
whereby he may the sooner attaine to the
vnderstanding of it. And, this my purpose
considered, I trust, shall bee sufficient to
moue the godlye learned of the Church to
interprete my doinges to the best, and to
take this my small traueile in good parte,
although they finde not in it a number of
things, which are of necessitie to be looked
for in such woorkes, as are layde forth for
learned men to traueile in They shall not
finde here, either eloquence in penning, or
great shewe and varietie of learning, or
curious triall and conference of expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and translations, or large discourses of
difficult matters in controuersie. These
things the wise and learned know are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for mother kinde of writing, then for
this. They shall finde here a briefe and
easie exposition of the texte, whereby the
<pb facs="5"/>
vnlearned reader may not only the sooner
attaine to the true sense and meaning of
the holyghost, the authour of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but also learne some godly instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of the same. If I had written to
the learned, I woulde haue indeuoured to
my power in some other points to haue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
their expectation: but in this I haue
tempered my selfe wholye to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the most simple. My meaning
was before I had published anye part, to
haue written of so manye of the Chapters
as are redde on the dayes of common prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and also of the Psalmes. But forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as my health and some other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
businesses will not suffer me to doe it
with so much speede as my desire was, I
thought it not good in the meane time to
stay from them that nede the help hereof,
so much as I haue presently done. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue
<pb facs="6"/>
as God shall giue mee strength and
leasure, I minde in conuenient time to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe,
and so I leaue thee to the direction
of Gods holy spirite, and these my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to the charitable iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.</p>
