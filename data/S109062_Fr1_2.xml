   <p>Of the first sort, and so of the second, I dare be bold to giue you a taste, though they bee mortall poysons, because I know you are armed with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes and precious preseruatiues against them.</p>
   <list>
      <head>Of the first sort are these.</head>
      <item>1 That an Image of God or Christ is to be worshiped with <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

   <p>These and many others which scarce durst peepe out in former times, are now by the Iesuits made publike and plausible doctrines, and being almost bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed and forgotten, are by them againe reuiued.</p>
   <list>
      <head>Of the second sort.</head>
      <item>1 That God hath made the Virgin Mary partaker of his diuine power and maiesty, <note n="q" place="margin">So teacheth Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Tursellinus a Iesuit.</note> as farre as he may.</item>
      <item>2 That a man shall oft time bee sooner heard at Gods hand in the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Virgin Mary, then of Iesus Christ. <note n="r" place="margin">So teacheth Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomus a Visit. a Cister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and is allowed by Posseuinus.</note>
      </item>
      <item>3 That a man may equiuocate before a Magistrate. <note n="s" place="margin">So teach Azorius &amp; Tollet and all Iesuits.</note>
      </item>
      <item>4 That Heresie makes a man vncapable of a Kingdome, and makes him an Vsurper, that is otherwise a lawfull King <note n="t" place="margin">So teach Marianus Simancha, Bozius and others allowed by the Iesuits.</note>
      </item>
      <item>5 That the Pope hath power not only to pronounce what is heresie, but after that to depriue him of his Kingdome, and to dispose of it as he thinkes best. <note n="u" place="margin">So teacheth Rosseus and others allowed by the Iesuits.</note>
      </item>
   </list>
   <p>With many other, not conuenient heere to bee perticularized which the former times neuer heard of, at least in such manner as now they be holden,</p>
   <p>But seeing they be all of two sorts, either touching the crowne of <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, or the crownes of Kings his deputies on earth, I will desire you to be contented with one example of both sorts. Concerning not such Kings as make not themselues slaues and harlots to the purple whore: thus teacheth a Iesuit too well knowne in Eglnand.</p>
   <p>
      <note n="x" place="margin">See the book called Andrea Philopatris re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsio ad Edictum Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabethae ann. 91. sect. 2 artic. 157. pag. 109. edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis aug. 1592. This man is Arthur Creswell the Iesuite.</note> It is the iudgement of all Catholike Diuines and Lawyers, and it is certaine, and <hi>de fide:</hi> that what Christian Prince soeuer, doth apparantly fall from the Catholike Religion, and would also draw others with him, doth <hi>Ipso facto</hi> forthwith fall from all right, title, place and power of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes or Dominions, by force both of Gods and mans law, and this before any sentence be pronouced against him by the Pope: and that all his Subiects are free from the Oathes they haue made to him. And they may. nay they ought (if they be able) to put him downe and cast him out from all gouernment, as an Heretike, an Apostate, and an enemy of God and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth &amp;c. And this doctrine is certaine, vndoubted and resined &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Alas that we should liue to heare such doctrine taught, especially by an Englishman I but whereas he stiles himselfe <hi>a Diuine and a Priest of Rome,</hi> wee thence conclude that he carried no such learning with him out of England, but found it at Rome.</p>
   <p>Concerning Christ, that which I haue afore set downe is vile and wicked and such as the elper world and misty times of Popery would haue abhorred. But there is one impiety of late broched by one Iesuit, and approoued by all, so horrible and hainous, as I want words to expresse it. <note n="y" place="margin">Clarus Bonarseius a Iesuit, writes it: Posse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine the Iesuit in the name of all other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues it.</note> But this I can say, it is such as the world yet neuer heard of, such as the ages past feared
<pb facs="4"/> not, and the future will not beleeue: nay such as we in these dayes would not beleeue of our very enemies, if the euidence of the fact made it not past all denyall and excuse: for would a man imagine that those who professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the seruants of Iesus Christ aboue other men, should conceiue of him, speake to him, and play with him, as with a sucking child in his mothers armes? Nay that is nothing, they make him an vnderling to a woman, and not his Person only but his bloud and merits, &amp; compare together his bloud and her milke, and vpon comparison finds them so equall, that they mixe them together, and in the mixture finds the milke so excellent, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it afore the bloud, as a thing more precious, and with which, they may not be so bold as with the bloud of Christ, and feare not to affirme that the corruptions of our nature, and sinnes of our soule are healed and holpen as well by her milke as Christs bloud. A blasphemy whereat the Angels will shrinke, and the very diuels tremble, and yet no doubt wee shall finde Iesuites will defend it.</p>
   <p>Hauing obserued this blasphemy 2. or 3. yeeres agoe, I held my tongue, expecting it would bee discouered and reproued by some that could doe it with more authority, but fayling of my hope, I long conceal'd my labours till now, that the necessities of these euill times doth force it from mee: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do heere discouer it, and am bold to send it abroad vnder the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your honorable names, that so all the world may know the state and gouernment of this honorable Citty, to be no approouers, but Censors and condemners of so horrible and hideous Atheisme.</p>
   <p>I am therefore a suter to you all, in mine owne and the name of all my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Clergy of this City, that you looke well to the execution of the lawes, and yet rather against Popery then Papists: For it is the wicked Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery that makes our men Papists, and ill subiects to God and the King: The men would be good enough if the grounds of their religion were not wicked. Therfore we beseech you haue care, that Iustice be so executed as rather the wickednesse of the Religion may bee rooted out, then the persons punished as in his stile, to be <hi>The defender and propogatur of the true Christian Faith.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Honourable and worshipfull, vouchsafe to heare vs in this iust &amp; necessary request, being no lesse then your Religion craueth at your hands: The Clergy and Ministry of England are slandered by the Papists, that wee seeke their bloud, &amp; exasperate the state against them: but they do vs wrong it is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpating of Popery, not the bloud of Papists, that we seeke and sue for: we pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty their persons, and wish them rather all banished then any executed, but we hate their heresies, and wish them censured, condemned, and extinguished as as they deserue: This is the way fully to discouer Antechrist, and to hasten his confusion, for almost all Churches of Christendome haue pronounced him Antchrist, and his Religion Heresie: And this is the sure way to be free from treasons, conspiracies inuations, murders and massacres, from which (as you see) <hi>Denmarke</hi> by this meanes is defended, and many countries well freed as soone as they get free of Iesuits: and by the contrary we see the miserable
