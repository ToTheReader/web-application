      </q> Besides, that Speech (especially my Speech) hath not the benefit that <hi>Printing</hi> hath, of quoting Authors at large, a principall part of these my Lectures, which I could not then in a many respects deliver vnto you so exactly. But my cheefest Motiue of all of committing these vnto the Presse, is the continuall flowing vnto vs of such as you are, some going, others comming and every Yeare some New ones, who since they are to belong to me in respect of my Pastorall charge, faine would I shew my loue vnto my Saviour, by feeding those <hi>New ones</hi> in this sort. A way perhaps some what chargeable, but God that hath giuen abilitie to compasse this, hath giuen a will too (in humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be it spoken) to contemne a world of Wealth towards the furtherance of a Soule. Concerning these my <hi>Lectures</hi> thē, loe they offer themselues vnto you, that which comes vnto you so slightly, let it not be as slightly but regarded.</p>
   <p>One <hi>Schioppius</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">Gasp. Schiop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pii Alexipharm. cont. Plessaum.</note> tels vs of late, of <hi>Paul</hi> the fift now <hi>Pope,</hi> how little hee answered his expectation in a matter not much vnlike herevnto. <hi>If that Gift,</hi> saith he, <hi>were bestowed vpon his Fatherhood indeed, perhaps he no more attentiuely, or curiously obserued it, then hee did an excellent Booke of a certaine Divine, which I my selfe brought vnto him, to the end and purpose to bring the Author of it in favour with him.</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Non modò ab eo non lectum, sed ne{que} certò loco, vbi reperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, mihi{que} resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui pesset, positii fuisse comperi. <hi>Schiop.</hi> Ib. p. <hi>76.</hi> Col. <hi>1.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>For after a few daies I repairing vnto him againe, &amp; asking of him how he liked the Booke, I found that hee had not onely not read it, as I expected, but could not tell where in the world he had laid it.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Pope</hi> of Rome hath other gates matters then Bookes in his head, and therefore <hi>Schioppius</hi> there addeth

         <note n="e" place="margin">Virg. Aen. l. <hi>6</hi>

      <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>fift</hi> who is a Romane by birth, should remember he was to Rule. True: and me thinkes <hi>Schioppius</hi> should haue added withall, that hee should remember to forget that which our Saviour said about Ruling: <hi>Reges Gentium dominantur eorum. Ʋos autem non fic,</hi> Luk. 22.25. But how soever they (it seemes) are not altogether of our Saviours minde, &amp; therefore <hi>Schioppius</hi> commends the <hi>Pope,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he neglected that Book: yet you, Beloued, should you doe the like, are not sure of such an <hi>Homer</hi> as <hi>Schiop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> is, and therefore is it best for you not to followe the Popes example. <hi>Martha, Martha,</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 10.41.</note> saith our Savior, <hi>thou carest, and art troubled about many things. But one thing is needfull.</hi> It were happy perhaps for his Holines, if he were but troubled as <hi>Martha</hi> was, but you, if you please, may be the <hi>Maries.</hi> That <hi>One thing</hi> so <hi>needfull,</hi> loe here in these <hi>Lectures.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Concerning my Methode therein I goe not (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) the beaten way, and it may seeme (I graunt) aboue the pitch of <hi>Catechising;</hi> what hath beene here delivered by me, but presupposing you grounded before in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary course of Catecisme; I meane M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
