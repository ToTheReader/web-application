   <p>SIth that, (gentell Reader) in this our
age we do plainely see many Bookes and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
sorte therof to be setforth, which do not
onely cleane ouerthrowe the mind of the Reader:
But also do allure and drawe thee in, into schismes,
and most pestiferous sectes: Therfore I did think<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
it would be a more fitte worke to renewe the olde
moniments, and workes, of our Fathers, which by
occasion of tyme, and rashnes of writers, haue bene
peruerted, then to setforth any new matter. And such
workes ought most chefely to haue credite geuen to
them, which haue there original of our excelent roote
and stocke: and which doth flowe out of a good
stone, and runne out of a most excellent fountaine or
welspringe, as are those which be drawne out of the
Buttries of the old Catholike Doctors, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the choyse of wordes haue powred (out the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
spirite) in such sorte, that all the worlde maye
easely vnderstand, and chuse an immortall lyfe: as
also knowe what is good, and what is euill, and as
sone as like vnto diligent and paynefull Bees, you
haue drawne out the swete hony more precious then
Rosemarie out of the swete flowers of our holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and hath layed them vppe in the hyue of your
minde, there is no doubte but that you shall haue
floddes of water of lyfe, sesoninge, and with force
watering the poore thirstie Church of our Sauiour
Christ, farthermore euery purpose or Arte hath his
princes of whom it is led by, as of capitaines which
doth most sone and with great expidition bring our
purpose to that effect which otherwise our wittes
would hardly comepasse, as I knowe him which is
setforth or fygured to me by the shape of an other
which goeth or passeth by so in our lyfe we shall sone
<pb facs="6"/>
addicte our selues to followe other mens examples,
as it is sayd of old liuely examples sticketh in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> mind
wherof as Heronimus doth witnes the Romanes
did follow as leaders &amp; capitaynes, the Camillians
the Fabricians, and the Scipians: The Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
hath apoynted maisters of there Arte. Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,
Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. The
Poets do followe Homere, Virgill, Menander,
and Terens, The historians Thucidides, Salust,
Herodatus, and Liuius. The Orators Licias,
Graccus, Demosthenes, and Tullie. The Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or caruers, Appelles, Dedalus, Iason. But
we which labour for and seeke the moste excellent
giftes of the mind and the knowledge of Christian
doctrine, haue so many and so great examples of our
most worthy forfathers that we lacke nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning
to thaugmenting or establishing of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an
lyfe. Sith that therbe an innumerable number of
interpretors or Prophets of the word of God, and
Canonicall scriptures I thought good out of so
great a number to chuse certayne which both by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
and purenes of doctrine by integritie of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
by vehimens of teachinge. By sharpnes of
wtte doth both much affect and delight as also make
vs wel instructed prepared and Armed not that the
doctores themselues would haue vs farther to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
or beleue them then they do agree with the holy
Scriptures, as Augustine doth witnes in many pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces,
but chefely in his booke of (Retractiones) wh<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>
he sayth, I nether can, nor ought to denye. But as
there were in my forfathers, so there are in my, so
many and huge workes many things which by iust
iudgement and without any temeritie may well be
erected, but they haue made Arroes and dartes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
these Antechristes in the Church. For neuer
since the dayes of the Apostles vnto this our tyme,
<pb facs="6"/>
vpon whom the endes of the worlde are come, the
Church of Christ hath bene free from those enemies,
althought continually the truth remaineth inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet falshood doth neuer leaue of taduaunce her
selfe agaist it, if in this world there might be the end
of lying, the Church of Christ should be in quiet.
But this most detestable euill, and sinne, doth neuer
rest to knocke at the harte of man, and with, such
argumentes as one woulde not thinke, to disquiet
the Catholike fayth, therfore it is necessary for the
folowers of the troth, wisely to forsee these captious
Arguments, and being vncouered and brought to
light, with the mallet of veritie and truth to beate
them downe, yea and euen to the death, and bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheding
for verities sake,<note place="margin">Eccle. 4.</note> to fight against them, and
chefely because the holy Scriptures doth admonish
and saye,<note place="margin">Roma. 16.</note> Be not dismayed or asrayd to speake the
word for thy soule, and for the troth euen to death,
for Paule doth desire the Romanes to marke them
which cause diuision and geue occasions of euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the doctrine which they had learned and to
auoyde them, for they that are such, serue not
the Lord Iesus Christ, but their owne bellies, and
with sweete preaching and flattering wordes, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
the hartes of the innocents, it may be that the
Apostle did admonish the Romaines that they shold
not be wauering in faith and in the word, that they
should shonne and put away Heritikes and seducers
of soules. But it is commaunded vnto vs that we
should preach the word, and should stand to it at all
times and seasons, we should correcte, we shoulde
perswade, we should chide and chasten them withall
patience and doctrine, for the time shall come, and
now it is, when they shall not away with true and
wholsome doctrine, but shall get them masters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their owne desires which haue itchchinge
<pb facs="7"/>
eares and which turne their hearing and sence from
veritie and truth, vnto fables. Therfore the Apostle
doth exhorte vs to watch, to labour, and to do the
workes of true gospellers, let that terrible sentence
of S. Chrisostome neuer be out of our eares, saying,
he is not onely a Treatour to veritie, that doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
setforth a lye in stead of troth, but he also that
doth not freely without feare speake the troth. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
saith the like in his Epistle to Casulan: who
soeuer for feare of any power doth hide the truth,
such a one doth prouoke the wrath of god vpon him,
because he doth more feare man then God. But
gentle Readers I do besech and perswade you that
do wisely and simply loue the wordes of troth, that
you do not contemne this treasure that you haue
now in your handes, but both to loue it and set it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
for this one little Booke doth declare that
which being contayned in many volumes, would be
hard tattaine vnto, and this shall lead you to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
and perceaue other hid secretes of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and by thenstruction herof, you maye easely
iudge the scismes and subtelities, of the damnable
companye. This Boke shall wake them that sleepe
shall spurre forward them that runne, and shall
conuerte you withall your harte vnto the
liuing God, &amp; shall after one vnspeakable
sorte, where as nowe you see as it
were in a glasse in the darke,
make you see the troth face
to face: Thus gentle
Reader farwell, &amp;
take in good
parte I besech thee, these
my simple doinges.</p>
