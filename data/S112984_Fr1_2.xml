      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath beene</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
seen (right
Honorable) that
the Peaceableste
Prince hath had
the priuiest enimies, the moste
ciuill gouernment, some vnci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
aduersaries: whose tedious

      </gap>e and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie,
and therefore they were
<pb facs="3"/>
at continuall warre with them,
who established and maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a thing of such excellencie
within their Dominiōs. I need
not trauaile for circūstances, to
approoue what I haue said: for
that it hath beene manifested
heere in our Realme of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
Her Maiestie, vnder
whom we haue been so godlie,
gratiouslie &amp; famouslie gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
her selfe beeing a spectacle
to the whole world, for vertue
and modesty of life: how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
she is defamed, contemned,
and despised therefore, of those
whom iniquitie and error hath
peruerslie blinded, I leaue to
your Honorable iudgements,
my humilitie &amp; vnfained loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie
remembred. But fearing
to intangle my self in any such
matters, as may either seeme
<pb facs="3"/>
tedious to your Honours, or
troublesome to any modest
minde: I betake my selfe to
such a simple course of breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as may discouer my true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and the duetiful reuerence
I owe to so Honourable perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages.</p>
   <p>It is not vnknowen to your
Honours, how not long since I
witnessed my faithfull seruice
to her Maiestie, to the disproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of such, as were bothe her
professed and sworne aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
at which tyme, how nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
they were approoued guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of euerie obiection, bothe

heere to rehearse, for that the
matter is yet apparant.</p>
   <p>Since that time (right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable)

there hath beene cast

and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

in the behalfe of the aforena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
bothe against me, and the
other of the witnesses: as many
haue been inforced to muse &amp;

   <p>Wherefore, at the earnest

      </gap>tcherous
practises, that it maye be seene
<pb facs="4"/>
and knowen, howe falselie and
vntruelie they haue accused
me, and that they maye well
vnderstand, howe I haue beene
in those places, where I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

      </gap> such

   <p>My request is therefore to
your Honours, vnder whose
fauours I cōfesse my selfe bothe

      <pb facs="5"/>
Thus remaining the most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
in duetiful seruice to
her Maiestie, and an humble
