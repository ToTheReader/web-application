   <head>The Preface to the <hi>Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LBEIT, good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices, I haue in this Sermon (as also hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other by mée preached at Paules Crosse) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyghed chiefly against Ʋsurie: it was not for that I did or doe account Ʋsury in it selfe to be the most horriblest vice beyonde all other, but bicause the same vice in this our time, is so vniuersally committed, that not only money men, Merchant men, and Citizens, be Ʋsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: but also Noblemen, Courtiers, Gentlemen, Grasiers, Farmers, Plowmen and Artificers, yea, I would
<pb facs="7"/>
the Clergie were frée.</p>
   <p>So that the vice Ʋsurie, amongst the multitude, is accounted no vice, and thought so necessarie: that without it men (generally) cannot liue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thought good (so speciallye) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the same vice, and to shewe men (if they willl sée) this their fault.</p>
   <p>For though Ʋsurie be but a part (yet a great part) of extortion and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and extortion and oppression, be but fruites of Couetousnesse, and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all these doe spring out of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie and distrusting God, (which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust is the roote of euery wicked act:) yet when such euill fruite shall be so v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersally eaten, as Ʋsurie now is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with gréedinesse and delight: it is more than time to shewe the perill thereof, yea, and that with all diligence. And except we shoulde be content wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglye to sée (as it were) the blinde drowne himselfe in the ditche, and the
<pb facs="7"/>
childe to play with the Serpent, or eate swéete Kattes bane to his owne poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and destruction: we cannot omit to shewe the generall abuse in trades, by Ʋsurie, and so specially to reprooue it, and tell men the daunger of it, namely, that Ʋsurie being a fruite of infidelitie: cannot but poyson the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuer.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, that God forbiddeth Ʋ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, I haue shewed by the Lawe, by the Prophets, and by the Gospell. Also I haue shewed howe godlye men and good Magistrates both Christen and Heathen, haue detested the same vice, &amp; him that committed it: &amp; what punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments some people executed vpon such offenders. And partly, I haue shewed (for I thinke no man can fully declare it) what hurt there groweth by vsurie to the Church of God, &amp; to the common weale. I haue also shewed the abuse of trades by that they are generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb facs="8"/>
with vsurie in this our time: and answered to some obiections of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. And then hauing giuen a taste of honest and lawfull occupying: I finish that matter.</p>
   <p>But before I beginne to speake of vsurie, I haue according to my simple knowledge made plaine the text, and gathered thereon such notes, as I thought apt and profitabe for this our time, plainely according to the plaine speaking of my Patrone and example <hi>Sophonie</hi> without qualifications. For it is not tyme to dallye or sooth men nowe in their doings: no more than it was in <hi>Sophonies</hi> time. And in the latter ende of my theame, where it is sayde, that God will roote out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye such, as neyther séeke after God nor regarde him: there I take occasion to examine by the doings of men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they at this day doe séeke for God and regarde him, or not, for by the
<pb facs="8"/>
fruite the trée is knowne.</p>
   <p>And so amongest the manyfolde fruites of infidelitie inerplicable: I speake perticularly of fewe, but speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye of Ʋsurie, for the reason before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged. Wherin though such methode be not obserued, as some maye thinke perhaps Art requireth: yet I haue kept that course therein, which I haue thought most profitable.</p>
   <p>And though in respect of mine owne weakenesse, and the subtiltie of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, I am not easilye drawne to set out my simple doings to the worlde in print: yet by the earnest procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of sundry worshipfull men, with the speciall requestes of manye my friendes: I haue bene mooued to print the same. And the rather I haue bene moued so to doe, bicause I would here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by eyther stoppe the mouthes of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, and of such as haue priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made childish obiections to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
<pb facs="9"/>
not worthy to be aunswered: or else stirre them to make stronger rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against it, if they can. And also (if they know another truth herein) to set out their mindes in writing to the world, and not mutter in corners. For I woulde willingly be founde a lyer: vpon condition that so manye others might be proued iust dooers. Which I am perswaded will not be, with all the cunning the aduersaries haue: no, thoughe they take the Deuill to helpe them.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, though I haue not kept the very same wordes in writing that I vsed in speaking, bicause words vttered with iesture will not alwayes fit so well in writing: yet the matter and substance I haue obserued fullye and wholy. With some things added in the former part, which through want of memorie were omitted whē I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: and in the latter part I haue of
<pb facs="9"/>
purpose added some thinges touching Ʋsurie, which I spoke in my former Sermons, to the ende, that my minde in this matter of vsurie might the more fully appeare to them, that are desirous to knowe it. And if my trauaile herein shall doe any good: I shall thinke it wel bestowed. And the more good it doth, the more shall be my comfort. Let God haue the glory for euer: and so good christen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der farewell.</p>
