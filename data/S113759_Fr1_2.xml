   <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE LOYALL Hearted Subiects of ENGLAND.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the Author of this small Treatise testifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a true hearted subiect to the Crowne of France, by composing it; J will likewise (in emulation and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his fidelity) approue my selfe to be no lesse to the Crowne of England, by translating it. For sith this bloudy booke of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (ambitiously ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating to himselfe the Title of the
<pb facs="3"/>Popes <hi>Temporall power</hi>) though par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly sent to France, is neuerthelesse meant, and doth concerne all other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Soueraignties and free States whatsoeuer; I thought in honour to God, in alleageance to my Prince, in loue to my Countrie, and in duetie to all, J was bound to dispoile out of his French habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, and to sute in our English attire this iudicious and compendious Treatise, which so worthily opposeth and impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it. Come, nay then run, if not flie hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you loyall hearted English men, and as the choise of the wisest, chiefest and loyallest hearted French haue already, so in religion, in zeale, in discretion and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice doe you now commit and sacrifice to the fire both <hi>Bellarmines</hi> booke, and the thought, much more the practise of those irreligious, vsurping and sanguynat spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and positions therein contained, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="3"/>to the disgrace, preiudice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction both of our Kings &amp; Countries; yea for euer (in your hearts and soules) not onely spit at, but defie the wrongfull, tyrannicall, Jesuiticall and Diabolicall pretence of this (Sophisticall traytor, and treacherous Sophister) <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who (as subtlely as inueterately) aimeth, not to reach at, but to take off the Crownes of Kings, and (iniustlie) to place them vpon the heads of Popes; yea to trample their Scepters and Regall Ornaments vnder their feet, and to bring their Dominions and subiects, both into a wofull desolation and a miserable subiection and slauerie.</p>
   <p>For alas, shall we permit to see, or liue to permit that our Roiall Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (not inferior to anie, but equall with the greatest Kings of the world) should now (through our negligence) be made homagers, subiects, nay slaues vnto Popes
<pb facs="4"/>(Gods mortall enemies, and our deadly professed foes) as was our King <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Fredericke Barbarossa,</hi> the King of Nauarre, and Earle of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse, &amp;c.)</p>
   <p>No, no, illustrious and generous Nobilitie, iudicious and faithfull priuie Counsellors, learned and vpright Judges, reuerend and religious Prelates, valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and warlike Gentry, incorruptible and watchfull Magistrates, faithful and vigilant Officers, obedient and loyall Commons; ioine all in one, yea, let euery mothers sonne (if occasion require) with an vnanime consent, <hi>Viua Voce,</hi> cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and couragiously, with Drummes beating, Trumpets sounding, and Canons roaring, denounce Warre to that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, nay to that Pope, nay to that diuell, which presumeth or durst presume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue either our King of his soueraigntie,
<pb facs="4"/>or our Countrey of her independencie: yea next and immediatly to the zeale of the glory of God, let vs be zealous &amp; watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, watchful and couragious, couragious and resolute, for the securitie and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of King <hi>IAMES</hi> our dread Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and his heires for euer; and for the conseruation and maintaining of the Soueraigntie, both of his Crowne and Kingdome of England, the Paradice of the world, and our sweet natiue Countrie.</p>
   <p>And the more to incite, and powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incourage you in the performance of this your religious and sworne duety; I haue translated, published, and here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you this <hi>Tocsin,</hi> (or <hi>Watch-bell</hi>) that when you chaunce to sleepe in your beddes of securitie, it may arouse and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake you to stand vpon your guard, with Swordes drawne, Muskets charged, Match lighted, and hearts eagerlie sharpened and animated to destroy and
<pb facs="5"/>confound the Pope and his adhaerents, and to subuert and ouerthrow all other hostile enemies whatsoeuer, which shal ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incroach vpon our Temporalitie, or attempt to depriue vs of our Soueraignty; to the end that neither the fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne of our deceased triumphant and victorious warriours (which hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spread it selfe to the farthest and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest parts of the world, and is for euer characteris'd vpon the neuer-dying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of immortality) may not deseruedly taunt &amp; taxe vs with the scandalous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of cowardise, nor our posteritie hereafter, reuile and curse vs for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them inheritors and heires, onely to Tyrannicall slauery, and Presbyteriall seruitude: from the which God of his mercy preserue &amp; defend both our selues and them. And hereunto let all the loyall hearted subiects of King <hi>Iames</hi> clappe hands, and say <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>
