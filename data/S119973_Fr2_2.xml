   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F amongst thy lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
houres, thou
canst spare any for
the perusal of this
discourse, and dost
looke to find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in it which may serve for thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
and benefit: let me then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
thee to come unto it with an equall
minde, not swayed by prejudice, but
indifferently resolved to assent unto
that truth which upon deliberation
shall seeme most probable unto thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and then I doubt not, but either
thou wilt agree with mee in this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or at least not think it to be as
farre from truth, as it is from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
opinion.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
Two cautions there are which I
would willingly admonish thee of in the
beginning.</p>
   <p>1. That thou shouldst not here looke to
find any exact, accurate Treatise,
since this discourse was but the
fruit of some lighter studies, and
those too hudled up in a short time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
first thought of and finished in
the space of some few weekes, and
therefore you cannot in reason ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
that it should be so polished, as
perhaps, the subject would require,
or the leisure of the Author might
have done it.</p>
   <p>2. To remember that I promise only
probable arguments for the proofe
of this opinion, and therefore you
must not looke that every conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
should be of an undeniable
dependance, or that the truth of
each argument should bee measured
<pb facs="4"/>
by its necessity. I grant that some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomical
appearances may possibly
be solved otherwise than here they
are. But the thing I aime at is this,
that probably they may so be solved, as
I have here set them downe: Which,
if it be granted (as I think it must)
then I doubt not, but the indifferent
Reader will find some satisfaction in
the maine thing that is to be proved.</p>
   <p>Many ancient Philosophers of the
better note, have formerly defended
this assertion, which I have here laid
downe; and it were to be wished, that
some of us would more apply our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
unto the examination of these
old opinions, which though they have
for a long time lien neglected by others,
yet in them may you find many truths
well worthy your paines and observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Tis a false conceit for us to thinke,
that amongst the ancient varietie and
<pb facs="5"/>
search of opinions, the best hath still
prevailed. Time (saith the learned
<hi>Verulam)</hi> seemes to be of the nature
of a river or streame, which carrieth
down to us that which is light or blown
up, but sinketh that which is weighty
and solid.</p>
   <p>It is my desire that by the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this discourse, I may raise up
some more active spirit to a search
after other hidden and unknowne
truths. Since it must needes be a great
impediment unto the growth of sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
for men still so to plod on upon
beaten principles, as to be afraid of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
any thing that may seeme to
contradict them. An unwillingnesse to
take such things into examination, is
one of those errours of learning in
these times observed by the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
<hi>Verulam.</hi> Questionlesse,
there are many secret truths, which
<pb facs="5"/>
the ancients have passed over, that are
yet left to make some of our age fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for their discovery.</p>
   <p>If by this occasion I may provoke
any Reader to an attempt of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I shall think my selfe happy, and
this worke successefull.</p>
   <closer>Farewell.</closer>
