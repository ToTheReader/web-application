   <p>THE disfigured face, gentle Reader, wherewith this worke not long since ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the common view, moued that noble Lady, to whose Honour conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, to whose protection it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to take in hand the wiping away those spottes wherewith the beauties therof were vnworthely blemished. But as often in repairing a ruinous house, the mending of some olde part occasioneth the making of some new: so here her honourable labour begonne in correcting the faults, ended in supplying the defectes; by the view of what was ill done guided to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what was not done. Which part with what aduise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into, with what successe it hath beene passed through, most by her doing, all by her directing, if they may be entreated not to define, which are vnfurnisht of meanes to discerne, the rest (it is hoped) will fauourably censure. But this they shall, for theyr better satisfaction, vnderstand, that though they finde not here what might be expected, they may finde neuerthelesse as much as was intended, the conclusion, not the perfection of <hi>Arcadia</hi>: and that no further then the Authours own writings, or knowen determinations could direct. Whereof who sees not the reason, must consider there may be reason which hee sees not. Albeit I
<pb facs="4"/>
dare affirme hee either sees, or from wiser iudgements then his owne may heare, that <hi>Sir Philip Sidneies</hi> writings can no more be perfected without <hi>Sir Philip Sidney,</hi> then <hi>Apelles</hi> pictures without <hi>Apelles.</hi> There are that thinke the contrary: and no wonder. Neuer was <hi>Arcadia</hi> free from the comber of such <hi>Cattell.</hi> To vs, say they, the pastures are not pleasaunt: and as for the flowers, such as we light on we take no delight in, but the greater part growe not within our reach. Poore soules! what talke they of flowers? They are Roses, not flowers, must doe them good, which if they finde not here, they shall doe well to go feed elswhere: Any place will better like them: For without <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia</hi> nothing growes in more plenty, then <hi>Lettuce</hi> sutable to their <hi>Lippes,</hi> If it be true that likenes is a great cause of liking, and that contraries, inferre contrary consequences: then is it true, that the wortheles Reader can neuer worthely esteeme of so worthye a writing: and as true, that the noble, the wise, the vertuous, the curteous, as many as haue had any acquaintaunce with true learning and knowledge, will with all loue and deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse entertaine it, as well for affinity with themselues, as being child to such a father. Whom albeit it do not exactly and in euery lineament represent; yet considering the fathers vntimely death preuented the timely birth of the childe, it may happily seeme a thanke-woorthy labour, that the defects being so few, so small, and in no principall part, yet the greatest vnlikenes is rather in defect then in deformity. But howsoeuer it is, it is now by more then one interest <hi>The Countesse of Pembrokes Arcadia:</hi> done, as it was, for her: as it is, by her. Neither shall these pains be the last (if no vnexpected accident cut off her determination) which the euerlasting loue of her excellent brother, will make her consecrate to his memory.</p>
