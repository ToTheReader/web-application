      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O whom should I dedicate the memoriall of your deceased Father, but to you, in whom he liues? Who (mee thinkes)
<pb facs="3"/>but his Monuments, may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge his commemoration? Besides the life hee was perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally possessed of; you are his deriued life: and he yet liues, (and long may he) though not in himselfe, yet in his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. Yet (alas!) how much rather had you (I know) to haue still enioyed, then thus supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his life? But you are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, how nature abides not alwayes, but succeedes: how God but lends, not bindes your friends to your inioyment. He was giuen you, to be taken from you: yours hee was, to vse, rather then possesse: yours in his life, name, vertues, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to inherit; and not yours, in an earthly being to ingrosse. Therefore had you him, to lose him, and must therefore be contented with his losse:
<pb facs="3"/>yea, ought indeed to reioyce ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that once yee had him; then sorrow, that now ye haue him not. Grant, it cannot bee but a griefe to misse him: so neither but a ioy to remember him. It was an happinesse more delighting, when you might reioyce in his presence: but is an happinesse more lasting, that you may yet reioyce in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. You both (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the common lot and hap) were much, and long happy, in a double Parent: the losse of one now admonishes, yea, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaudes you, to esteeme another Parent, and feare anothers losse. But, I spare from further repetitions of your losse; lest (while I would striue to conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and appease them) I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prooue but to renew your sorrow; &amp; prouoke your feare.
<pb facs="4"/>For mine owne part (who rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon my selfe not the least in his losse) I count it euen as enuy, to bewayle the happy: and but folly, forlornely to sorrow for him; that certainly reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for himselfe. Neuerthelesse (for losse of friends) forbid I no man to mourne, but mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, and despaire. Such our sorrowes, are but the late to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of our loue, and must as wel be moderate, as vnfaigned. Neither should our hearts (in this case) be flinty, nor effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: nor our eyes alwayes dropping, nor altogether dry. For me, I like neither to bee niggardly, nor prodigall of my teares: neither to be desperate, nor ambitious of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. I say no more of this sorrow and losse, because I would not packe them vp, or
<pb facs="4"/>decke them vp in words onely. Thus much haue I written, because I would not that a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate houre should extinguish or ingrosse them. What I haue herein presumed, besides the comfort (I trust) you shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by it: this also shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort mee, that you daigne to receiue it.</p>
