   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Holy Ghost teacheth, that the lipps of the heauenly Spouse, which is the CHVRCH, resēbles scarlate, and the honie combe whence honie distilleth, to th'end that euery one may know, that the doctrine which she announceth consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth of sacred Loue, of a more faire vermiliō then Scarlate, by reason of the Spouse his blood wherin she is dyed; more sweete then honie, by reason of the Beloued his sweetenesse, who crownes her with delightes. So this heauenly Spouse when he thought good to giue an entrie to the publication of his Law, streamed downe a number of firie tongues vpon the Assemblie of his disciples, which he had deputed to this office: sufficiently intimating therby, that the preaching of the Ghospell, was wholy designed to the inflaming of hearts.</p>
   <p>Propose vnto your selues a fine done amidst the Sunne rayes; you shall see her change into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diuers colours, as you behold her diuersly; because her feathers are so apt to receiue the light, that the sunne spreading his splēdour amongst thē, there is caused a number of transparences, which bring forth a great varietie of alterations and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb facs="8"/> of colours; but colours so agreeable to the eye, that they put downe all other colours, yea the enamell of richest iewells; colours that are glittering, and so quaintly guilt, that the gold giues them more life. In consideration hereof the Royall Prophet saied vnto the Israelites.
<q>
         <l>Although affliction rudly d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>ght your face,</l>
         <l>Yet shall your hew henceforth to men appeare</l>
         <l>As pigions plumes, when siluers trembling grace,</l>
         <l>And burnisht gold, doe make their shine more cleare.</l>
      </q> Truly the Church is adorned with an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable varietie of excellent documents, sermons, Treatises, Spirituall bookes, all very comely and pleasant to the sight, by reason of the admirable mixture which the sunne of Iustice makes of his Diuine wisdome with the tongues of his Pastours, which are their Penns, and with their Penns, which sometimes they vse in lieu of their tōgues, and doe compose the rich plumes of this mysticall doue. But amongst all the diuers colours of the doctrine which she doth publish, the fine gold of holy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is especially discouered, who makes herselfe be gloriously enteruiewed, gilding all the sciences of Saints with her incomparable luster, and raysing them aboue all other Sciences. All is to Loue, in Loue, for Loue, and from Loue in the holy Church.</p>
   <p>But as we are not ignorant that all the light of the day proceeds from the Sunne, and yet doe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily saie, that the Sunne shines not, saue onely when it doth openly send out its beames here or there. In like manner though all Christian doctrine consist of sacred Loue, yet doe we not indistinctly
<pb facs="9"/> honour all Diuinitie with the title of DIVINE LOVE, but onely those parts of it, which doe contemplate the birth, nature, properties, and operations thereof in particular.</p>
   <p>Now it is certaine, that diuers writers, haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably handled this subiect; Aboue all the rest those auncient Fathers, who as they did louingly serue God, so did they speake diuinely of his Loue. O what a pleasure it is to heare S. PAVLE, speake of heauenly things, who learn't them euen in Heauen it selfe. And how good a thing it is to see those soules that were nurced in the bosome of Loue, write of its sweetenesse I For this reason, those amongst the schoole men that discoursed the most and the best of it, did also most excell in pietie. S. THOMAS made a Treatise of it, worthy of S. THOMAS: S. BONAVENTVRE, and Blessed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis the Carthusian, haue made diuers most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ones of it, vnder sundrie titles: and as for Iohn Garson, Chancelour of the vniuersitie of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, Sixtus Senensis speaks of him in this sort: He hath so worthily discoursed vpon fiftie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Diuine Loue, which are drawen here and there out of the Canticles, that he alone may seeme to haue hit the number of the affections of Diuine Loue. Verily he was a man exceeding lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, iudicious and deuote.</p>
   <p>Yet that we might know that this kind of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is performed with more felicitie by the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Louers, then by the learning of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it hath pleased the Holy Ghost that diuers womē should worke wonders in this kind. Who did euer better expresse the heauenly passions of
<pb facs="9"/> heauenly Loue then S. CATHARINE of Genua. S. ANGELA of Folligni, S. CATHARINE of Sienna. S. MATILDA?</p>
   <p>In our age also diuers haue wrote vpon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, whose workes I haue not had leasure to read distinctly, but onely here and there so farre forth as was requisite, to discouer whether this might yet find place. Father Lewes of Granado, that great Doctour of pietie, left a treatise of the Loue of God in his Memoriall, which is sufficiently commended, in saying it is his. Stella, a Francis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can made a very affectiue one, and profitable for Praier. Christoph: Fonceca an Austine, put out yet a greater, wherein he hath many excellent things. Father Richeome of the Societie, hath also published a booke, vnder the title of the Art of louing God by his Creaturs, and this Authour is so amiable in his person, and in his singular wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that one cannot doubt but he is yet more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable by writing of Loue it selfe. Father Iohh of IESVS MARIA a discalced Carmelite, composed a little booke, which is also called the Art of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, which is much esteemed. The great and famous Cardinall Bellermine did also a while agoe giue into light a little booke intituled, The little Ladder to ascend vnto God by his creaturs, which cannot be but admirable, cōming from so deuote a soule and so learned a pen, which hath wrote so much, and so learnedly in the Church her behalfe. I will saie nothing of Parenetique that floode of Eloquence, who flotes at this houre through all France, in the multitude and varietie of his sermons, and noble writings, the straight spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb facs="10"/> consanguinitie, which my soule hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>racted with his, whē by the impositiō of my hāds he receiued the Caracter of Episcopall dignitie, to the great happinesse of the Diocese of Belley, and to the honour of the Church, besids a thousand bands of a sincere friendshipe which tyes vs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, permits me not to speake with credit of his workes, amongst which this <hi>Parenetique of Diuine Loue,</hi> was one of the first sallies of the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fulnesse of wit, which euery one admires in him,</p>
   <p>Further, we doe see a goodlie and magnificēt Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace which the R. Father Laurence Paris, a Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine Preacher erected in the honour of heauenly Loue, which being finished, will be a compleat course of the Art of louing well. And lastly the B. Mother Teresa of IESVS, hath written so accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly of the sacred motions of Loue, in all the bookes she hath left vs, that a man is astonished to see so much eloquence, masked in so profound humilitie; so great soliditie of wit, in so great simplicitie: and her most learned ignorance, makes the knowledge of many learned men appeare ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, who after a great tormoile in studies, blushe, not to vnderstand that which she so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily puts downe touching the practise of holy Loue. Thus doth God raise the Throne of his Power, vpon the Theather of our infirmitie, making vse of weake things to confound the strong.</p>
   <p>And be it, my deare Reader, that this Treatise which I now present, come farre short of those excellent workes, without hope of euer cōming
<pb facs="10"/> nigh thē, yet haue I such confidence in that pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>re of heauenly Louers, to whom I dedicate it, that it may be some wayes seruiceable vnto thee, and that there, thou shalt meete with many wholsome cōsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, which thou shouldst not else where so easily find, as againe thou maist els where find many rare things, which are not here. Yea me thinkes, my designe fals not in with theirs, saue in generall, in so much as the glorie of Diuine Loue is all our aimes. But this you shall know by reading it.</p>
   <p>Truly myne intention was onely, simply and nakedly with art or varnish, to represent the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of the Birth, progresse, decaye, opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, proprieties, aduantages, and excellencies of heauenly Loue. And if besids all this thou findest somwhat else they are certaine superfluities which are hard for such an one as my selfe, who write amidst many distractiōs, to auoyd. Howbeit I hope, nothing therin shall be without some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Nature her selfe, who is so skilfull a work wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, proiecting the production of grapes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth withall, as by a certaine prudent inaduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, such an abundance of leaues and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches, that there are very few vines, which are not in the season to be pruined and cut.</p>
   <p>Writers often are handled to harshly, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures that are made of them being precipitated, ordinarily with more impertinencie, then they practised imprudence in taking vpon them to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish their writings. Precipitation of iudgment doth greatly endāger the Iudges cōscience, and the innocencie of the Accused: Diuers doe write foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly,
<pb facs="11"/> and diuers also doe censure grosly. The sweetnesse of the Reader, makes his reading sweete and profitable. And my deare Reader, to haue thee more fauourable, I will here render thee a reason of some passages, which might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture, otherwise put thee out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
   <p>Some, peraduenture, may apprehend, that I haue saied too much, ād that it was not requisite, to bring downe the discourse euen from its heads. But I am of opinion, that heauenly Loue is a Plant, like to that which we call Angelica, whose roote is no lesse odoriferous then the bole, and branches. The 4. first bookes, and some chapters of the rest, might without doubt haue bene omitted to the liking of such soules as onely seake the practise of holy Loue, yet all of it will be profitable vnto them if they behold it with a deuote eye, While others also might haue disliked, not to haue had the whole continuance of that which belongs to the Treatise of Diuine Loue. Certes I tooke as I ought, into my consideration the condition of the wits of this age wherein we are. It doth much import one, to know in what Age he writs.</p>
   <p>I cite the Scripture, sometimes in other termes, then are found in the vulgar Edition. O good God, my deare Reader, doe me not therefore the wrong to thinke, that I would goe from that Edition: ah no; for I know the Holy Ghost hath authorised it by the Holy Councell of Trent, and that therefore all of vs ought to stick to it: but contrariwise I make no other vse of the other versions, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="11"/> to serue this, when they explicate and confirme the true sense therof. For example. That which the heauenly Spouse saieth to his Spouse, THOV HAST WOVNDED MY HEART, is wonderfully cleared by the other version, THOV HAST TAKEN AWAY MY HEART, or, THOV HAST SNACHED AWAY, AND RAVISH<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>D MY HEART. That which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour saieth, BLESSED ARE THE POORE OF SPIRIT is much amplified and declared, by the Greeke, BLESSED ARE THE BEGGARS OF SPIRIT, and so of others.</p>
   <p>I haue often cited the sacred Psalmist in verse, and it was done to recreate thy mind, and through the facilitie which I found in it by reason: of the sweete translation of Philipe de Portes, Abbot of Tiron, which notwithstanding I haue not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely followed; yet not out of any hope I had to be able to doe better then this famous Poet. For I should be too impertinent, if, neuer hauing so much as thought of this kind of writing, I should pretend to be happie in it; in an age and condition of life, which would oblige me to retire my selfe from it, in case I had euer bene engaged therein. But in some places where the sense might be diuersly taken, I followed not his verse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would not follow his sense; as in the Ps. 132. where he hath taken a latin word, for the fringe of the garment, which I apprehended, was to be taken for the coler, wherevpon I translated it to myne owne mind.</p>
   <p>I haue saied nothing which I haue not learn't of others: yet it is impossible for me to remember whēce I had euery thing in particular; But beleeue
<pb facs="12"/> it, if I had drawen any great peeces of remarke out of any Authour, I would make a conscience not to let him haue the deserued honour of it; and to deliuer you of a suspition which you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue against my sinceritie in this behalfe, I giue you to know, that the 13. Chap. of the 7. booke, is extracted out of a Sermon which I made at Paris at S. IOHN'S in Greue, vpon the feast of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of our B. Ladie. 1602.</p>
   <p>I haue not alwayes expressed how one Chapter followes another, but if you marke, you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily find the connection. In that and diuers other things I had a care to spare myne owne labour, and your patience. After I had caused the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiō to a deuote to life be printed, my Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishope of Vienna, Peter villars, did me the fauour to unite his opinion of it, in termes so aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to me, and that little booke, that I dare neuer rehease it; and exhorting me to applie the most of my leasure to the likes workes; amongst many rare aduises wherewith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified me, one was, that as farre forth as the matter would permit, I should be short in the Chapters. For euen as, quoth he, the Traueller knowing that there is a faire Garden some twentie or twētie fiue pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es out of his way, doth easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, for so small away, to goe see it, which he would not doe, if it were further distant▪ euen so one that knowes that there is but a little distance betwixt the beginning and end of a Chapter, doth willingly vndertake to read it, which he would not doe, though the subiect were neuer so delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if a long time were required to the reading of
<pb facs="12"/> it. And therefore I had good reason to follow myne owne inclination in this respect, since it was agreeable to this great Personage, who was one of the most saintly Prelats, and learned Doctours that the Church had in our age, and who, at the time that he honored me with his letter, was the most auncient of all the Doctors of the Facultie of Paris.</p>
   <p>A great seruant of God aduertised me not long a goe, that by addressing my speache still to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lothie in the Introduction to a deuote life, I hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered many men to profit by it; for that they did not esteeme the aduertissements made to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, worthy of a mā. I admired that there were men, who to be thought men, did showe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so little men, in effect. For I leaue it to your consideration, my deare Reader, whether deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not as well for women as men; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weare not to read the second epistle of S. IOHN with as great attention and reuerence which was addressed to the holy Ladie Electa, as the third which he directeth to Caius: and whether a thousand thousand Epistles, and Treatises of the auncient Fathers of the Church ought to be held vnprofitable to mē, for that they are addressed to holy women of those times. But againe, it is the soule which aspires to deuotion that I call Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lothie, and men haue soules as well as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse to imitate the great Apostle in this occasion who esteemed himselfe lyable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, I changed my addresse in this Treatise, and speake to THEOTIME: but if peraduenture
<pb facs="13"/> there should be any women (and such an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie would be more tolerable in them) who would not read the instructions which are made to men, I beseech them to know, that THEOTIME, to whom I speake, is mans spirit desiring to make progresse in holy Loue, which is as well in men as in women.</p>
   <p>This Treatise then is made for a soule alreadie deuote, to aduance her in her designe; and for this cause, I haue bene forced to speake many things lesse knowen to the common sort, which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently will appeare obscure: The bottome of a science is alwayes hardest to be founded; and few Diuers are found, who will, or knowes how to diue for Pearles, or other precious stones in the middest of the Ocean. But if you haue a free heart to diue into this writing, it will truely happen to you as to Diuers, who, saieth Plinie, being in the deepest gulfe of the Sea, clearely discouer the light of the Sunne. For you shall find euen in the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest places of this discourse, a good and amiable light. And verily as I doe not follow those who dispise certaine bookes, which treate of a life su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent in perfection, so would I not speake of this supereminencie. For neither can I censure the Authours, nor yet authorise the censures of a doctrine which I vnderstand not.</p>
   <p>I haue touched many points of Diuinitie; not with a Spirit of contradiction, but simply propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, not so much what long agoe I learned in the schooles, as that which the care I haue had of soules, and the experiēce of 24. yeares I haue spent in preaching, hath made me apprehend to be most
<pb facs="13"/> to the glorie of the Ghospell and the Church.</p>
   <p>For the rest, diuerse men of note from diuerse places haue signified vnto me, that certaine little Pamphlets haue bene published, vnder the onely first letters of their Authours name, which light to be the very same with myne; which made some beleeue that they were my workes not without touch of scandall to such as apprehēded thereby that I had bidden Adieu to my wounted simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to puffe vp my style with words of ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my discourse with vaine conceits, and my conceits with a loftie and plumed eloquence. For this cause, my deare reader I will tell thee, that as such as graue or cut in precious stones, hauing their sight dazled by keeping it continually fixed vpon the small stikes of their worke, doe will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly hold before them some faire Emerald, that by beholding it from time to time, they may be recreated in it's greenesse, and relieue their weakned sight. So in this Presse of businesse, which my function dayly drawes vpon me, I haue still some proiects of certaine treatises of pietie, which at my leasure I looke vpon, to reuieue and vnwearie my mind.</p>
   <p>Howbeit, I doe not professe my selfe a writer; for the dulnesse of my spirit, and the condition of my, life, exposed to the seruice and approch of many, would not permit me so to be. Wherefore I haue written very little, and yet haue published lesse, and to complie with the Councell and will of my friends, I will tell thee what I haue written to th'end that thou maist not attribute the praises of another mans labours to him, who of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb facs="14"/> deserues them not.</p>
   <p>It is now 19. yeares agoe, that being at Thonon a little towne situated vpon the Lacke of Geneua, which by little and little began at that time to be conuerted to the Catholike faith. The Minister, Enemye of the Church, cryed all vp and downe, that the Catholike Article of the Reall Presence of our Sauiours bodie in the Eucharist, did distroye the Symbole and the Analogie of Faith (for he was glad to mouth this word ANALOGIE not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode of his Auditours, that he might appeare learned) and vpon this the rest of the Catholike Preachers, with whom I was, pressed me to write some thing in refutation of this vanitie; I did what seemed fitting, framing a briefe meditation vpon the Creede to confirme the Truth, and all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies were dispersed in this Diocese, where now I find not one of them.</p>
   <p>Soone after his Highnesse came ouer the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and finding the Bailiwike of Cablaies, Gaillard, and Ternier, which are about Geneua, well disposed to receiue the Catholike faith, which had bene banished thence by force of warrs and reuoults, about 70. yeares past, he resolued to reestablish the exercise thereof in all the Parishes, and to abolish the exercise of Heresie: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the one side this great Happinesse had many obstacles, according to the considerations, which are called reasons of state, and yet on the other side, diuers, as yet not well instructed in the truth, made resistance against this so much desired esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, his Highnesse surmounted the first dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie by the inuincible constancie of his Zeale
<pb facs="14"/> to the Catholike Religiō, and the secōd, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie sweetnesse and prudence. For he made the chiefe ād most obstinate be called together, ād made a speach vnto thē with so louely ād pressing an eloquence that in a māner being all vanquished by the gētle violēce of his fatherly loue towards thē deposed the armes of their obstinacie at his feete, and their soules into the hands of the Church.</p>
   <p>Licence me my deare Reader, I praye thee, to speake this worde by the by, one might praise many rich actions of this great Prince, amongst which I see the proofe of his vnspeakable valour, and militarie knowledge, which he makes now admired through all Europe. But for my part, I cannot sufficiently extoll the establishment of the Catholike Religion in these three Bailiwikes, which I haue euen now mentioned, hauing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered in it so many markes of pietie suted with so great a varierie of actiōs of Prudēce, Cōstancie, Magnanimitie, Iustice, and mildnesse. Me thought, I discerned in this little Peece, as in an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all that is praised in Princes, who haue in times past with most feruour striuen to aduance Gods an the Church her glorie. The stage was but little, but the actions long. And like as that aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Artist was neuer so much prized for his great Peeces, as he was admired for making a shipe of Yuorie, stored with all her furniture, in so little a forme, that the wings of a bee did couer it: So I esteeme more that which this great Prince did at that time, in this small corner of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, then many more specious actions, which others extoll to the heauens.</p>

   <p>Now by this meanes the victorious ensignes of the Crosse were replanted in all the wayes and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke places of those quarters: ād whereas a little before, there had bene one erected very solemnely at Ennemassa neare vnto Geneua, a certaine Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster made a little treatise against the honour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, containing a sharpe and venimous inuectiue, to which therefore it was deemed fit to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: And my Lord Claudius de Granier my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessour, whose memorie is in benediction, did impose the burthen vpon me, according to the power which he had ouer me, who beheld him not onely as my Bishope, but also as a holy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God. I made therefore this answere vnder this Title, A Defence of the Banner of the Crosse, and dedicated it to his Highnesse, partly to testifie vnto him my most humble submission, and partly to render him some small thanksgiuing for the care which he tooke of the Church in those parts.</p>
   <p>Now a while agoe this Defence is reimprinted vnder the prodigious tittle of PANTHALOGIE, or Treasure of the Crosse: a Title whereof I neuer dream't, as in truth I am not a man of that studie and leasure, nor yet of that memorie, to be able to put together so many peeces of worth in one booke as it might beare the name of TREASVRE, or PANTHALOGIE, besids that I abhorre such insolent Frontispices.</p>

   <p>In the yeare 1602. the obsequies of the Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Prince Philipe Emanuel of Loraine,
<pb facs="15"/> Duke of Mercurie, who had done so many braue exploits vpon the Turke in Hungarie, that all Christianitie was bound to conspire to honour his memorie, were celebrated at Paris, I being there. But aboue all the rest, Lady Marie of Luxembourg his widowe, did for her part all that her heart, and the Loue of the dead could suggest vnto her, to solemnize his funeralls. And because my Father, my Grand Father, and great Grand Father, had bene brought vp Pages to the most illustrious and most excellent Princes of Martigues, his Father, and Predecessours, she eyed me as an hereditarie seruant of the house, and made choice of me to make the funerall Sermon, in this so great a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britie, where there were not onely diuers Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls and Prelats, but certaine Princes also, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, Marshalls of France, knights of the Order, yea and the Court of Parleament in Bodie. I made then this funerall Sermon, and pronounced it in this so great an assemble, in the great Church of Paris; And for so much as it contained a true a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment of the heroicall feats of the deceased Prince. I did easily cause it to be imprinted at the request of the widowe-Princesse, whose request was to me a law. Now I dedicated that Peece to Madame the Duchesse of Vandome, as yet a girle, and a very young Princesse, yet one, in whom was alreadie apparently seene, the straines of that excellent vertue and pietie, which at this day shine in her, worthy of the extraction and and breeding of so denote and pious a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
   <p>While this Sermon was in the presse, I heard
<pb facs="16"/> that I was made Bishope, so that I came presently hither to be consacrated, and to begin my Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and vpon it, was proposed vnto me how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie it was to aduertise the Confeslariouses of some important points: for this reason I wrote 25. aduertisments, which I caused to be printed, to get them more esily dispersed amongst those to whom I directed them, but since, they haue bene reimprinted in diuers places.</p>
   <p>Three or foure yeares after I put out the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to a deuote life, vpon the occasion, and in the manner which I haue put downe in the Preface thereof touching which I haue nothing to saie to thee, my deare Reader, saue onely, that though this little booke haue generally had a gracious and gentle acceptance, yea euen amongst the most graue Prelats and Doctours of the Church, yet es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped it not the rude censure of some, who did not meerely blame me, but bitterly taunted me in publicke, for that I tell Philothe that daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is an action indifferent in it selfe, and that for recreations sake one may make Quodlibets; and I kowing the manner of these censures, I praise their intention, which I thinke was good. Yet should I haue desired, that they had pleased to haue considered, that the first proposition is drawen out of the cōmon and true doctrine of the most holy and learned Diuines, which I put downe for such as liue in the world, and Court: that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, I doe carefully incultate the extreame dangers which are foūd in dauncing: and touching the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond proposition it is not myne, but that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable king's S. Lewis, a Doctour worthy to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb facs="16"/> in conducting Courtiers to a deuote life. For I beleeue, if they had weighed this, their Charitie and discretion had neuer permitted their Zeale, how rigorous and austere soeuer, to haue armed their indignation against me.</p>
   <p>And to this purpose, my deare reader, I coniure thee to be gracious and fauorable vnto me in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Treatise: and though thou shouldst find the style a little (and a little onely I assure my selfe it shall be) different from that which I vsed in writing vnto Philothie, and both of them much different from that which I vsed in the defence of the Crosse, know that in nine-teene yeares one learnes and vnlearnes many things; that the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the warrs differs from that of Peace, and that a man vseth one manner of speach to young Prentises, an other to old iorneymen.</p>
   <p>My purpose is here to speake to soules that are aduanced in deuotion; for you must know, that we haue in this towne a congregation of young maides and widowes, who being retired from the world, doe liue vnanimously in God's seruice, vnder the protection of his most holy mother; and as their pietie and puritie haue often times giuen me great consolations, so haue I striuen to returne them the like, by a frequent distribution of the holy word, which I haue announced vnto them, as well in publike sermons, as in spirituall confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, yea and that continually in the presence of diuerse Religious men, and people of great pietie, whence I was often to treate of the most delicate feelings of pietie, passing beyond that which I had saied vnto Philothie. And I owe a good
<pb facs="17"/> part of that which now I communicate vnto thee, to this blessed assemblie, because she that is the mother of them, and doth rule, knowing that I was writing vpon this subiect, and yet that scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was I able to accomplish it without Gods very speciall assistance, and their continuall sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, she tooke a continuall care, to praie and make me be praied for to this end, and holily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured me to gather together all the odde ends of leasure which she iudged might be spared here and there from the presse of my incumbrances, and to employe them in this. And because I beare a great respect to this good soule, she had, God knowes, no little power to animate myne in this occasion; I began indeede long agoe, to thinke of writing of holy Loue, but that thought came farre short of that, which this occasion caused to be produced, an occasion which I declare vnto you so nakedly, and sincerely, to the imitation of the Auncients, that you may know that I wite onely vpon occasion, and that I may find you more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorable. The Pagans held, that Phidras neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented any thing so perfectly as the DIVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITIE; nor Apelles, as Alexander. One is not alwayes alike happie; If I fall short in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, let thy goodnesse flie home; and God blesse thy reading.</p>
   <p>To this end I haue dedicated this worke to the Mother of dilection, and to the Father of cordiall Loue, as I dedicated the Introduction to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Child, who is the Sauiour of Louers and the Loue of the saued. Certes, as women while they are strong and able to bring forth their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb facs="17"/> with ease, choose commonly their worldly friends to be their Godfathers. But when their feeblenesse and indisposition makes their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie difficile and dangerous, they inuoke the Saints of Heauen, and vow to make their children be christned by some poore bodie, or by some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uote person in the name of S. IOSEPH, S. FRANCIS OF ASSICIA, S. FRANCIS OF PAVLA, S. NICHOLAS, or to some other of the Blessed, who may obtaine of God their safe deliuerie, and that the child may be borne aliue. So I, while I was not yet Bishope, hauing more leasure and lesse apprehension to write, I dedicated my little works to Princes of the earth; but now being ouercharged with my charge, and hauing a thousand impediments. I consecrate all to the Princes of Heauen, to th'end they may obtaine for me the lig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> the Diuine will, these my writings may haue a birth profitable and fruitfull.</p>
   <p>Thus, my deare Reader, I beseech God to blesse thee, and to enrich thee with his loue. Meane while from my very heart I submit all my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, my words and actions to the correction of the most holy Catholike, Apostolike, and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Church, knowing that she is the Pillar, and soliditie of truth, wherein she cā neither be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nor deceiue vs; and that none cā haue God for his Father, who will not haue this Church for his Mother.
