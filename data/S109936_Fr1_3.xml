      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Nicetas could neuer haue opened his most chast eyes, to this our English light, vnder a more propitious starre then the protection of you (thrice renowned constant Catholikes of England) nor with a more happie presage or nobler priuiledge haue taken this peregrination through our Albion then with your honourable name displayed in the frontispice: Nor could I
<pb facs="3"/>
more mystically intimate eyther his end or myne owne desire, then by this word Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetas, which signifies victorie, to correspond both to Albion, which hath it's denomination from Candour, and to Catholicke, that is vniuersal; hoping he shal vniuersally make his way through al your harts: and should he be so vnfortunate as to find them not so white by purity, yet at least may haue the honour to adorne and embellish them with Chastitie most sutable to the immaculate spouse without staine or blemish; whose faith you so couragiously professe and suffer for. To you therefore the ornament of your Country, the high honour of Catholicke Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (which with hazard of your liues and daylie losse of goods and liberty you so constantly defend) I dedicate this my little booke. To you I present it, rather as an acknowledgement then payment of the debt I owe you. May Nicetas the principal subiect of this deuout booke become the obiect of your imitation in his admirable Chastity:
<pb facs="3"/>
and though you shead not your bloud, yet may you with him for euer be victorious in this combate here on earth, and crowned in Heauen. For my recompence (seeing the labour I haue here taken may exact no more, being of smal worth) I only desire that like feruent Charity as moued me to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it for the good of you (my deare Countrymen) may induce you to offer vp your zealous prayers; that as I haue offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously presented you with this incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable example of Nicetas, I may with you efficaciously imitate his chastity.</p>
