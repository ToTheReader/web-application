Although I conferred oft with diuers Ministers, in diuers parts of England, as also in my trauailes with the best Ministers in Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke and Denmark, and in the Dutch and French churches in the lowe countreys. But our God who did open Lydia, hart to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and beleeue Paules preaching,<note place="margin">Act. 16.14</note> and who calles men home at what houre it pleaseth him: did at last take those fogges and

Now this Gentleman Mr <hi>Barnhere</hi> brought mee commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and a letter from some that had before that, beene my good friends: The effect was to assist him in setting vp the <hi>Geneua</hi> or Scottish presbitory, but when I made knowne to him, my vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dislike of that kind of discipline, as which had giuen the Brow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nists their holde: then he drew me by letters from time to time, to this dispute, which so soone as it was made knowne I lost most part of my old friends, to my vtter vndoing as it is falne out since, (except God be more mercifull to me then men haue yet beene) for I beeing euen from my first looking after Religion, drawne to effect that trouble church, deuise of new discipline, did who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly associate my selfe with men of that minde, and was well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by them, but since I left shooting in their bowe, they haue at least some of them, not onely withdrawne their owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour from me, but perswaded others to detest mee. So that in truth I haue iust cause to giue God thankes, that at this last change of princes, their deuise did not preuaile, for had it, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by things which I haue obserued,<note place="margin">In his 2.<seg rend="sup">•</seg> booke to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce called Bassillicō dowr. pag. 41.42.4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

   <p>I did neuer purpose to publish this dispute, but because they haue giuen out in all places of this land (yea and out of it too) that I haue so abused this minister, as did not become any chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and all that effect that cause beleeued it, I was aduised both by an honorable personage, and by diuers: no small friends to the new discipline to print i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>, (who hauing hard it, pittied to haue heard me so oft abused for it) yet they are in minde that if it will recouer my credit againe with all indifferent men, euen of that sort. For I doe confesse that many who haue and yet doe, will effect that discipline, deserue not the name of Puritanes: for I am perswaded that thousandes of them haue honest harts to God and man, although for a time (as I did, they stumble at this vnhappie stone, I would some among them could so charitably conceiue of such as withstand their weake deuise: and sometimes for distinction sake vse that name: But it is not so; for not long since I hard an angry preacher out of a Pulpit affirme, that whosoeuer called any of Gods children Puritanes should be saued, (what the diuell was saued) a hard sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the ancient and the now present churches of God, if a man might beleeue him, but by his leaue it was the froth of a male-contents zeale: Now I most humbly beseech your Lordship, to shrowd this discourse vnder your honorable protection, the cause why I present your Honor with this, is the want of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matter, and my vnfayned loue vnto your most charitable Lordship: for I shall neuer forget to praise God, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to your Honor, for your exceeding christian compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes mee, when I did deserue your Lordships hard censure: Thus my good Lord, crauing pardon for my presumption: I commit your good Lordship to the protection of the Almighty:</p>
