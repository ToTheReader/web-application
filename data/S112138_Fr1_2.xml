                 <title>Wonderfull prophecies from the beginning of the monarchy of this land : hidden vnder the parables of: Three young noble-men in a fiary fornace. A chast wife, and two old fornicators. The idol Belus and his dragon. Daniel in a den amid lyons. Their agreement with canonical prophecies: also in temperate defence of the apocryphals annexed to the canon of the Scriptures. Together with an essay touching the late prodigious comete; how farre forth the præsages thereof doe accord with such prophecies, as are found to pertaine to these our times. By all which, the discrete and wise in heart may gather touching things to come, what is forewarned vnto men; as for the general and publique, so also for their priuate and particular.

   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE EDMOND Lord SHEFFIELD, Baron of <hi>Butterwyke,</hi> Earle of <hi>Mulgraue,</hi> Knight of the most Noble Order of the <hi>Garter,</hi> and my singular good Lord, <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> from God in the <hi>Loue</hi> of Christ,</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat <hi>Ʋnthrifty</hi> kinde of Spirit is it, that the minde of <hi>the Man</hi> is now so obessed with! For what <hi>notion</hi> so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shall bee offered vnto it, differing but the least point from the <hi>vulgar ayres</hi> which <hi>Praeiudice</hi> hath formerly taken hold off: howbeit there appeare, whether manifest <hi>Argument</hi> of <hi>Necessity,</hi> or strong <hi>Inducement</hi> of <hi>Benefite;</hi> yet it is reproued and rejected onely for this; Because it is <hi>NEW.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb facs="3"/>
on the <hi>Contrary,</hi> let it present vs with <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of <hi>delight,</hi> or <hi>choise</hi> of <hi>idlenesse,</hi> though to the ineuitable <hi>destruction</hi> of <hi>one</hi> and <hi>all</hi> of vs, yet by how much the <hi>Newer</hi> it is, by so much the more is it honoured, rewarded, and <hi>greedily imbraced.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>An <hi>Instance</hi> hereof, may bee the <hi>present</hi> state of this our <hi>Christian world,</hi> in whose greatest part, this is found to be trew, that albeit there be tendered vnto vs, <hi>Stability</hi> of <hi>Estate, Treuth</hi> of <hi>Society, Peace</hi> and <hi>Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> on earth, and <hi>fauor</hi> with God and Man, such, as <hi>greater</hi> the world neuer before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed: yet is there no place of <hi>audience</hi> to be gotten, euen for none other reason but this. That the path is <hi>New</hi> and vntroden; And wee must not bee weained from walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on still in the <hi>spiritual blindnesses,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with wee haue hitherto like Mould-warpes beene holden and delighted, as if it were writen in <hi>Capital</hi> letters for a <hi>Frontispice,</hi> on the Gate of our <hi>common sense [Non intret fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi.]</hi> Let not a good <hi>Obiect</hi> be admitted, nor a <hi>thought</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> be <hi>conceiued</hi> amongst vs.</p>
   <p>Such lot hath this man of God, the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of these Parables, bin forced to passe
<pb facs="3"/>
vnder. Concerning whom, because in men of <hi>former</hi> times, there was onely a <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,</hi> for they were vnto them <hi>(perhaps through their owne negligence)</hi> not yet vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; Therefore the men of our daies will out of a <hi>Preiudicate wilfulnesse,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohn 9.</note> vtterly <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> them, and (as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ) <hi>excommunicate</hi> as many as beare witnesse to any of them, how well so euer they shall be by the <hi>Spirt of God</hi> opened, and how <hi>comfortable</hi> so euer the things contained in them bee found vnto vs. <hi>[Thus doe men loue darkenesse rather then light,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note>
      <hi>least their deedes should be reproued.]</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In the middest of so <hi>desolate</hi> a wildernesse more disordered then the brute sea (for the Ocean hath <hi>kindly returnes</hi> of ebbes and flowes, and his <hi>Decumanos fluctus,</hi> I was by a <hi>Mighty</hi> hand guided, to the taking vp of this our <hi>Prophet,</hi> cast out as condemned to perpetuall exyle, and not worthy the <hi>light of the Sun of Righteousnesse in his Church,</hi> when viewing well, I could discerne in him the life of <hi>Diuine seede;</hi> which I acknowleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my selfe bound by the lawes of <hi>Nature, common to vs both,</hi> to foster and cherish vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="4"/>
full growth, according to the best skill of my <hi>vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>light</hi> in heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Mysteries.</hi> Wherefore I profered him my seruice and helpe, which euen at the very first was so chearefully accepted of him, that he immediately directed me to present him to you my excellent good Lord, with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of good speed therby▪ wherfore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay I hasted to accomplish this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, neither hath my expectation erred for the <hi>Gratious</hi> enterteynment hee found at his first accesse to your Presence: simply clad (as he was) in <hi>Pilgrims</hi> Habit: No more then was sufficient to auow him one of <hi>Gods good Creatures,</hi> and a <hi>Christian</hi> (I meane that <hi>Extemporary Interpretation</hi> of him which some few Moneths sithence it pleased Your Honor to accept at my hands) now since he hath gotten about him better attyre and Language, hath emboldened him to make a Second shew of himselfe, in hope that by Your <hi>Noble Protection</hi> he shall not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer against the vniust and vnworthy <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations</hi> layd vpon him, but be Restored wholy to the possession of his <hi>Original Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor:</hi> Namely; <hi>An Evangelical Prophet of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>Certainly he acknowlageth the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Your <hi>Heart</hi> in vnderstanding the things of <hi>God,</hi> The brightnesse of Your <hi>Light</hi> in maters of Profoundest Search; and the <hi>Ardor</hi> of Your <hi>Spirit</hi> constantly aspiring vnto <hi>Motions</hi> of the <hi>Purest Aire:</hi> Such <hi>Hearts</hi> onely can vnderstand in these: Such <hi>Lights</hi> onely can discerne of them: And such <hi>Spirits</hi> enioy the Comfort of theit <hi>Dew</hi> vse: And because there are so few of such ones; therefore is it that this louely Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath beene so little set by among Men to their owne Reproofe and Losse inualua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. His demands are just, and the profit he tendreth to the Honorers of him <hi>singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> as appeareth by that which is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed out of him. So that the goodnesse of the cause it selfe remoueth all doubt, but that vnder your <hi>Excellencies</hi> countenance he shall assuredly finde plentifull regard, <hi>the Newnesse of his present habit and speech notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>As for my selfe; when I beheld (as I do <hi>dayly</hi>) the <hi>zelous</hi> and <hi>continual</hi> exercise of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> in your owne Person, the gracious pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ise of <hi>Relligion</hi> in your <hi>family,</hi> the singular
<pb facs="5"/>
good <hi>gouernment</hi> of your <hi>house,</hi> whereby the late <hi>dangerous times came not neere</hi> you, to touch you; nor any of yours (though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the middest of them). I cannot but be perswaded, that your <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Pious spirit</hi> will vouchsafe to regard this my ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors (weake that they are) and fill vp the wants with the sweetnesse of your good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, which is wont not to reject any (proceeding from a <hi>single heart</hi>) that is not altogether vnsauory.</p>
   <p>Wherefore my prayers vnto God for you (my Lord) are, that the <hi>Integrity</hi> of your wisdome, your <hi>Relligious learning,</hi> your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and your valor may crowne you with Honours and Richesse, and <hi>graces</hi> and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors both with God and Man, as if with full <hi>Sheffes</hi> the <hi>field</hi> which the Lord will haue blessed.</p>
   <p>These are the vowes which do with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and delight vnspeakable open the light of the Morning, and shut in the sight of the Euening dayly, to your Honours trewly loyal seruant and <hi>Chapellan:</hi>
