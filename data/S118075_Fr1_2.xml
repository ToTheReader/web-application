   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL, <hi>Sir</hi> THOMAS BROOKE of <hi>Great-Oakley</hi> Knight, one of his Majesties Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of Peace in <hi>North-hampton-shire,</hi> and my very gratious Patron. Grace in this world, and glory in the world to come.</head>

      <salute>Right Worshipfull,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Onderfull is the power of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty in the sense of Smelling, and powerfull is his providence in the object of the same, whether corporall or spirituall: for as the first object is double; naturall and artisiciall, so is it a double demoustration of that vigilant care. The first part of this ocular argument is this goodly Theatre, the earth garnished with her glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious garment of <hi>Flora's</hi> fertilities, that admirable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie of fragrant flowers, The second part is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by that <hi>acumen hominis,</hi> which God hath instil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into his reasonable creature, for the refreshment of
<pb facs="3"/>the spirits through the nostrils: for the witty industry of man about the procurement of artificiall smels, is great, as appeareth by his diligence about the Moschat, Sivet,<note place="margin">Conradus Gesner. Hist, of foure footed beasts.</note> &amp;c. But as the spirituall smell of the soule is farr more pretious, so is the Divine Love &amp; Providence in this, farre more great and gratious; the impregnable proofe &amp; pregnant trueth wher of is his eternall word, whence the Redeemed of the Lord doe gather odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous flowers, to prevent the noysome and loathsome smell of impietie; the contemplative smelling of which gratious garlands is the continuall delight of <hi>Davids</hi> Blessed man, Psal <hi>1.2.</hi> &amp; the practique a sweet savour unto the Lord, as in the example of <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen <hi>8.21.</hi> Now out of this sacred Garden (by the blessing of that ever. blessed Gardener) I have gathered a few spirituall flowers, which I present unto your Worship in testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of my thanksulnes for all your constant loves, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly craving that these first fruits of my poore La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours may passe into the world under the shelter of your gratious acceptation; which patronage if I obtaine, then shall this Tuzzimuzzie have its wished and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected smell. Though theresore the mighty <hi>Apolloes</hi> of this Learned generation could have dedicated vnto your W. a farre more odoriferous Nosegay, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject not this simple one.</p>
   <q>
      <l>The Persian Prince tooke in good part</l>
      <l>The water of the well,</l>
      <l>Because he saw the giuers heart</l>
      <l>The givers gift excell.</l>
   </q>
   <p>So let it please your W. to respect, <hi>Non quid, sed quo animo:</hi> for what I can, I offer.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <q>
      <l>For loe I offer at your kindnesse shrine</l>
      <l>This little Incense, or this flower of mine.</l>
   </q>
   <p>And so I humbly take my leave, commending both your selfe, and all yours to the effectuall blessing and grace of the Lord, and to the power of his word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee is able to build you up further, and to give you an incorruptible inheritance among those that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and sanctisied through faith in the Lord Iesus.</p>
