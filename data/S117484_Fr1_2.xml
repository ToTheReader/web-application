      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I could be resolued (Right Christian, and most deare Mother) to handle this Text, I was driuen into a doubtfull meditation, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a double consideration. For considering that I was to speake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great men, in a great Auditorie: I doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it should bee more expedient, to teach from this Text <hi>non-communicants</hi> to forsake their former er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and to renounce their superstitious vanities; or to inuite from another Text all in generall to a Lents Potation. Whereof thus musing and meditating, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in the end resolued, to make choice of this Text ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not onely in regard that the feast of Easter draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neere: but in respect especially, that some euen <hi>ex
<pb facs="3"/> meis intimis,</hi> otherwise vertuously inclined, are not rightly resolued how to eate the Lords Bread at the Lords Table, and to drink of his Cup. Concerning whose wilfull blindnes, and blind wilfulnes, sparing to speake I sigh to see, and rew to knowe, what I fully knowe: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I protest before God, calling in this Sermon both the holie Scriptures, and holy Fathers to witnesse, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is no truth, or else that the points of Poperie (which <hi>non-communicants,</hi> like halting hypocrites, now embrace) are most false. Which rude Sermon and simple, but such as it is, vpon the assurance of your knowne courtesie, and to the end especially that a scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heereby of that religion, which once (O happie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersiō!) you professed, may be taken; I now offer in way of thankefulnesse for vndeserued kindnesses, and in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of great gratitude due vnto your Worship. Accept therefore (right vertuous &amp; euer kind Mother) I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseech you this poore present, and present exercise, as a poore sparke of great good will: wherein if any good thing be found, giue God (I pray you) the glorie; if any fault, impute it vnto me: and pray vnto God, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I neuer speake, or else speake to his glorie. Thus beseeching the God of all grace, the Author, and giuer of all good gifts, to grant vnto your Worship increase of spirituall graces, and continuance of bodily health, with wealth and welfare in this life present and in the life to come euerlasting blessednesse; I leaue you, and your meditation vpon this Sermon, to the guidance &amp; gratious assistance of the Almightie whom I beseech so to blesse you in reading, as that being throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, how to receiue Christs holy Mysteries, you may stedfastly stand in the right profession of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb facs="3"/> and euer wish the prosperitie of them that loue it, and labour for it: which the Lord in mercie grant vnto euerie Christian subiect.</p>
