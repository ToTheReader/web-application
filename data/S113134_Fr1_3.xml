PREFACE
to the Reader, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Author of
this Book; touching the
Contents thereof, and
the Translation of the
same, &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsidering how
many professe
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> few
have attained
the right way
of it: and, those few are so
much employed in labouring
to keep the <hi>Truth</hi> from being
<pb facs="7"/>
smothered among the heaps
of impertinent <hi>Volumes;</hi> and
compelled to spend so much
time in weeding out <hi>Heresies,</hi>
and in discovering the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of <hi>Error,</hi> that they cannot
so improve themselves and
others, as else they might.</p>
   <p>Upon the <hi>Foundations</hi> laid
by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi>
many sacred <hi>Buildings,</hi> were
with comely <hi>uniformity</hi> ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the Primitive <hi>Doctors</hi>
of the <hi>Church;</hi> and, in every
future Generation somewhat
was, now and then, added (by
the <hi>Worthies</hi> of their times)
according to the first <hi>Patterns;</hi>
and upon such occasions or
necessities, as required the
same, to the continuing and
enlarging of Divine <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But, wee in this last Age
have blinded the same with
confused <hi>Opinions;</hi> and heaped
<pb facs="7"/>
upon them so many tedious
<hi>Commentaries,</hi> so many false
<hi>Glosses,</hi> and needlesse <hi>Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi>
that <hi>Students</hi> half outrun
their course, before they can
passe through that <hi>Rubbish,</hi>
which obscures from them
the directest <hi>Paths,</hi> and fairest
monuments of <hi>Truth.</hi> Yea,
some of our later <hi>Paper-works</hi>
are so plaistered, glazed, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and sophisticated, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the vanity of our <hi>new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled-humours:</hi>
and, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
are so durtily slubbered
over, sutably to the homeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our <hi>moderne-fancies:</hi>
that the first insinuates a false
<hi>beleefe,</hi> or a superstitious
<hi>faith,</hi> to the disadvantage and
dishonour of ancient <hi>simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
the later, a prophane neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of all <hi>Piety</hi> &amp; <hi>good order.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>A good meanes (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
to prevent such incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,
is to bring into
<pb facs="8"/>
more frequent view, the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>
of these <hi>Ancients</hi> who
lived so neer to the Apostles,
that they cannot be justly sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
as <hi>favourers,</hi> or <hi>parties</hi>
to the <hi>factions</hi> of these later
Ages. For, many of them, are
(if not altogether unknown)
very rarely perused, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the numberlesse <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties,</hi>
which have wearied
the <hi>Presses,</hi> and filled the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries</hi>
of <hi>Europe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Or, if an <hi>Ancient Peece,</hi> be
accidentally discovered in
this <hi>Wildernesse</hi> of <hi>Inventions,</hi>
(by our <hi>Students</hi> of the later
<hi>Editions)</hi> they seldome bring
it, honestly, to light: But, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mangle it, as they please;
or steale as much of it, as is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
plausible to trim, and
stuffe out those <hi>Volumes,</hi> by
which they purchase an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
opinion of being <hi>learned.</hi>
The rest, they endevour to
<pb facs="8"/>
rake up againe in <hi>obscurity;</hi>
that their Theft may be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
Or, (which is worse) that
those <hi>Truths</hi> which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not, (or favour not)
may be weakned.</p>
   <p>For this cause, it well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
us to revive, now and
then, those <hi>Ancients,</hi> whose
wisedome is usefull to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
our controversies. Some,
have already laboured happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this way. And, I (who
may well enough be reputed
among such as have increased
those <hi>Treatises,</hi> which keep
more profitable <hi>Books</hi> from
being frequently perused) doe
now desire to make some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for the same: and, to
that end, have published in
<hi>English</hi> this <hi>Tract</hi> of <hi>Neme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi>
who was one of the
Champions of the <hi>Christian
faith,</hi> whose Labours have
been famously profitable in
<pb facs="9"/>
former times.</p>
   <p>Though few are, now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
acquainted with him,
you shall find him among the
most ancient <hi>Greek Fathers:</hi>
And, this <hi>Tract</hi> of his (which
is pertinent to every member
of <hi>man-kinde</hi> capable of <hi>Book-knowledge)</hi>
was heretofore so
wel esteemed, as to have been
twice interpreted, out of
<hi>Greek</hi> into <hi>Latine, (viz.)</hi> by
<hi>Georgius Valla Placentinus,</hi>
and <hi>Nacasius Ellebodius,</hi> of
whose interpretations I have
made use.</p>
   <p>This <hi>Author</hi> was as honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in his generation, as
those that are more volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
and more frequently
named: for, he was not onely
so eminent for his <hi>Naturall
Philosophy,</hi> as to be called (by
way of excellency) NEME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIUS
the <hi>Philosopher;</hi> but,
so good a <hi>Moralist</hi> also, and
<pb facs="9"/>
so expert in the <hi>Lawes</hi> of the
<hi>Romane Empire,</hi> that, the most
Reverend, learned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<hi>Father</hi> GREGORIE
<hi>Nazian:</hi> (among whose <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems</hi>
are Verses written to this
NEMESIUS) hath highly
magnified him, both for his
<hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>uprightnesse:</hi> and
left it witnessed, likewise, that
he was dignified with a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidentship</hi>
in <hi>Cappadocia.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>When those <hi>Verses</hi> were
first written to our <hi>Author,</hi> he
had not embraced the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith.</hi> For, hee was by
them invited thereunto: And
their invitation seemed to
have taken so good effect,
that he became a happy <hi>Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi>
an eminent <hi>Champion</hi> in
the <hi>Christian Warfare;</hi> a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
of a City in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the times of the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi>
VALENS and THE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ODOSIUS.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="10"/>
Some have doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were the same <hi>Neme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
mentioned by GREGO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE;
onely, because he was
a <hi>Lawyer</hi> &amp; a <hi>Temporall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate:</hi>
But questionlesse hee
that was once an <hi>Infidell,</hi> and
afterward a <hi>Beleever,</hi> might
aswell have been, also, a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
and a <hi>Bishop,</hi> after he had
exercised the Functions of a
<hi>Lawyer</hi> and a <hi>Iudge;</hi> seeing it
is no new matter, that they
should execute a <hi>double-cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
who have received a
double portion of the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For, in all Ages, (since
<hi>Princes</hi> became <hi>Nursing-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
of the <hi>Church)</hi> it hath
been usuall for <hi>Emperours,
Kings,</hi> and other <hi>Free States,</hi>
to make use of their <hi>Gifts,</hi> in
Temporall <hi>Iudicatures,</hi> and in
other <hi>publike Affaires,</hi> of
whose Wisedome, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
they had experience
<pb facs="10"/>
in <hi>Ecclesiasticall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
yea, and it was no
strange thing for men of say
professions, to be called from
common Affaires, to assume
<hi>sacred Orders.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And (though some are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreetly
offended thereat)
it is not onely both conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and comely, that <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
persons</hi> (who neither
desire, nor ambitiously affect
such Employments) should
be, sometime, invited and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
by their <hi>Soveraigns,</hi>
to joyne unto their <hi>spirituall
charge,</hi> an industrious care of
the <hi>temporall welfare.</hi> But it
so happeneth otherwhile, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that this <hi>double Authority,</hi>
(though it double the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment)
proveth so farre
from being over-burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
or a hinderance to the
due execution of the first <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
calling,</hi> that hee upon whō
<pb facs="11"/>
it is conferred, is thereby the
better enabled to mannage
both for the generall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
And we finde this <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
calling,</hi> to have been so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
so commendably, and so
successefully practised in the
most flourishing times, both
of <hi>Iewish,</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales;
that it may be
still warrantably imitated, so
often as <hi>Soveraign power</hi> shall
be pleased therewithall.</p>
   <p>Our <hi>Nemesius</hi> (whose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
<hi>employments,</hi> and gifts
of the Spirit, have perhaps,
occasioned this digression, to
some good purpose) embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> and
received his <hi>Episcopall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
(as it seemes by circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
long after his <hi>President<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:</hi>
For, as by the words of
<hi>GREGORIE</hi> may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
he had given faire te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
both of his <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
      <pb facs="11"/>
and <hi>Vprightnesse</hi> in that
<hi>Office,</hi> before his <hi>Conversion:</hi>
and his faithfulnes in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment
of that <hi>single talent;</hi>
first vouchsafed, by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
grace,</hi> was rewarded with
a large encrease, through the
<hi>speciall favour</hi> of GOD, as the
sequele hath declared.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Authors</hi> whom he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
(none of them having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
since the <hi>Emperours</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned)
are a probable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of his <hi>Antiquitie;</hi> and
so likewise, is the scope of this
Treatise, and his manner of
handling the same: For, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this command,
<hi>When thou art converted,
strengthen thy brethren;</hi> the
learned <hi>Converts</hi> of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church,</hi> endevoured
to fortifie their <hi>Profession</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the many heathen <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi>
who did then oppose
it) by turning the weapons

      <pb facs="13"/>
of those enemies of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
against themselves; even
by fooling their <hi>carnall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
in their owne logicall
reasonings; and by the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of their own <hi>Philosophie.</hi>
And in this performance, our
<hi>Author</hi> was both faithfull
and painefull; as will appeare
by the following <hi>Tract,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be preserved and peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in all generations.</p>
   <p>For in what age, will the
knowledge of the <hi>humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
bee impertinent, or to
what person of that kinde?
nay, what <hi>knowledge,</hi> save the
knowledge of <hi>GOD</hi> is more
pertinent? Or, how can <hi>GOD</hi>
be well knowne, by him, that
knoweth not <hi>himselfe?</hi> It is
that <hi>knowledge</hi> which this
<hi>Booke</hi> teacheth; and in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
the ignorance of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowing our owne <hi>nature</hi>
is one maine cause of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="13"/>
absurdities, and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
controversies which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
these times, yea, the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
thereof is a principall
cause that so many wickedly
blaspheme <hi>GOD,</hi> &amp; unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
accuse him (without
cause) of being niggardly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them in the Talents of
<hi>nature;</hi> and in requiring that
of them, which hee hath not
given them ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
   <p>Hence ariseth it also,
that some <hi>consequently,</hi> and
some <hi>directly</hi> make our good
<hi>GOD</hi> the Author of all <hi>sinne;</hi>
and MAN, not properly an <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi>
but a <hi>patient</hi> only in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
evill. From this <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
likewise it proceedeth,
that wee neither husband the
gifts of <hi>nature</hi> (which is Gods
<hi>common grace)</hi> nor endevour
as we ought to doe, according
to that ability which we have
<pb facs="14"/>
received: whereas, if wee
knew what were given into
our power, and what not; I
think we should not so often,
(as many of us doe) foolishly
denie our <hi>essentiall propertie;</hi>
but <hi>beleeve</hi> and <hi>worke,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Sanctified reason.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Though our originall <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
were so depraved by
our <hi>first parents</hi> fall, that
wee lost our <hi>Well-beeing;</hi> yet
wee lost not our <hi>Naturall-beeing,</hi>
nor those <hi>Faculties,</hi>
which made us capable of
being renewed by <hi>speciall
grace,</hi> when it should be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
unto us. Though we fell
very low, &amp; were in a <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall,</hi>
in which we should never
have left sinking; and from
which wee could never have
raised our selves, by any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
remaining in our selves;
yet we were not at the lowest
by our <hi>Grand-fathers</hi> offence.
<pb facs="14"/>
For, the <hi>mercy</hi> of GOD, even
IESVS CHRIST, stayed
us from falling so low, as we
had else tumbled; and from
loosing absolutely our <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,</hi>
or any thing essentiall
thereunto, by that <hi>Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Yea, though the <hi>Will,</hi> and
every other <hi>Powre</hi> of the
SOUL were so maimed and
bruized by the first <hi>Adam,</hi>
that, like a broken <hi>Watch,</hi>
their <hi>motions</hi> would have
been still worse and worse,
till they had utterly perished;
and should never have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
rightly of themselves,
(nor by any other meanes)
unless the second <hi>Adam,</hi>
had, at least, benefited us
without our owne <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
as much as the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
harmed us, without our
<hi>personall sinne:</hi> yet, no man lost
by the first <hi>Transgression,</hi> so
<pb facs="15"/>
much, as hee may lose by his
own fault.</p>
   <p>By the first <hi>sinne,</hi> wee lost,
indeed, our <hi>light,</hi> but not our
<hi>eyes.</hi> And therefore, when
GOD sent the <hi>light</hi> of MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KIND
into the World, hee
reprobated those, onely, who
<hi>rejected</hi> it. And why? not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>they saw it not;</hi> but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they loved it not.</hi> For,
that they saw it, is manifest
by that place, which said, <hi>It
enlightens every one which
commeth into the world.</hi> Yea,
the reprobate Jews could not
deny but that they <hi>saw it;</hi> for,
our Saviour told them, that,
if they could have truely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
to have seene this <hi>Light,</hi>
they should not have had
their sins imputed unto them:
which, (under correction) I
take to be the meaning of his
words.</p>
   <p>Now, if they <hi>saw it,</hi> wee
<pb facs="15"/>
may truely inferre that <hi>they
received of his fulnesse,</hi> that
<hi>common grace,</hi> and the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of every <hi>naturall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
so far forth, as might have
<hi>enabled them, to become the
sons of GOD;</hi> whereas, by the
neglect of that <hi>single Talent,</hi>
they became losers of more
then <hi>Adam</hi> lost them; even
to lose the right use of their
<hi>naturall faculties,</hi> and to be of
a <hi>Reprobate sense;</hi> having <hi>eyes,</hi>
that <hi>see not: eares,</hi> that <hi>heare
not:</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> as void of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
as the beast that
perisheth. And, all this comes
to passe through want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,
what is taught in this
<hi>Book,</hi> even for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what <hi>power</hi> wee have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us, and how wee are to
exercise that <hi>power.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Let no man, therefore, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
this meanes of <hi>Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
nor prejudicately conceive
<pb facs="16"/>
(because it may have some
expressions unsutable to their
opinions) that NATURE
is here magnified above
GRACE, or in any measure
equalled thereunto: or, that
any power is thereto ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
derogating from the <hi>free
mercy</hi> of GOD. Far is it from
our <hi>Authors</hi> intention: and for
ever, far be it from me, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an instrument of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
such <hi>Doctrines.</hi> There
is not (in my judgement) one
syllable in this <hi>Tract,</hi> which
tendeth not to the glorifying
of GOD's <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</hi>
For, whatsoever is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
to <hi>man,</hi> as being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
in him by <hi>nature,</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to be the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
gift of GOD: That which
is affirmed to be left in him,
since the <hi>fall,</hi> is confessed to
have been justly forfeited, and
yet preserved in him, by the
<pb facs="16"/>
      <hi>free Grace</hi> of the same GOD:
The good <hi>effects</hi> of all those
<hi>Faculties,</hi> which are affirmed
in <hi>mans</hi> power, were not (in
my understanding) so much
as thought, by this <hi>Author,</hi>
(nor are they so conceived by
me) to be wrought at any
time without the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
assistance of the <hi>holy
Spirit:</hi> neither is the <hi>naturall
power</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> or the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of his <hi>nature,</hi> here set forth
for <hi>mans</hi> owne glory, or that
he should arrogate anything
to himselfe: But, that GOD's
<hi>first</hi> and <hi>second</hi> GRACE
vouchsafed unto us, might
the more manifestly appeare.
And that it might not be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>said,</hi> but made evident, also,
that the <hi>sinne</hi> and <hi>unhappinesse</hi>
of every <hi>man,</hi> is of <hi>himselfe,</hi>
and not of GOD: all which is
implyed (though not directly
expressed) by the scope of this
<hi>Booke.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="17"/>
They affirme in effect, this
blasphemy, that every <hi>sinne</hi> is
GOD's, (though in word
they professe never so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
against it) who will not
allow that MAN (as this
<hi>Treatise</hi> declareth) hath some
things naturally in his owne
power. For, unlesse that be
granted, hee should have as
little <hi>sinne,</hi> as <hi>righteousnesse</hi> of
his owne: and <hi>beasts</hi> or <hi>blocks</hi>
might as well be reputed
<hi>righteous,</hi> or <hi>sinfull,</hi> &amp; as justly
be termed <hi>Reasonable-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
as <hi>men:</hi> yea, and many
other absurdities are belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and occasioned, by the
ignorance of that, which is
here taught.</p>
   <p>Besides that, which is the
maine scope of this Booke,
divers brief testimonies of
ancient <hi>Truths</hi> (lately suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of novelty) are here and
there, occasionally inserted;
<pb facs="17"/>
yea, and to some in these
dayes, that which was the
prime intention of this <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi>
is, yet, as pertinent as
when it was first written:
For, there are not only as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
still ignorant of their own
<hi>Nature</hi> as heretofore; but, the
same <hi>Stoicall Divinity,</hi> here
opposed, and confuted, is, in
some branches, so largely
sprouted up againe, that, they
are supposed to be ancient &amp;
orthodoxe principles of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;</hi>
and so are they cryed
up by a multitude of modern
voices, that few beleeve, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi>
ever mentioned ought
in contradiction to what
they fancie to be the <hi>Truth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To make it appeare other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
this <hi>Father</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> speakes now in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
what he spake in <hi>Greek</hi>
much above a thousand yeares
past: And therefore, though it
<pb facs="18"/>
were true (which as yet, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
not) that some of the
later times have as learnedly
handled the same subject; yet,
because the noblenes of <hi>Truth,</hi>
is other while suspected, when
her Pedigree is obscured, I
thought it not in vaine, to
help to discover her Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
by the publication of this
<hi>Author.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>You have him (if I am not
much deceived) according to
his Genuine sense, though not
every where grammatically
interpreted; for that were but
to play the part of a <hi>Pedant.</hi>
And because a shew of tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,
might make the same
lesse profitable, I have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
caused him to speak as brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and as plainly to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
capacities, as I possibly
could, (which is not easie in a
Subject of this nature) but to
prevent wearisomenes, and
<pb facs="18"/>
render it the more usefull, I
have divided the longest
<hi>Chapters,</hi> into equall <hi>Sections;</hi>
&amp; before every <hi>Chapter</hi> and
<hi>Section,</hi> summed up the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
<hi>Contents</hi> of the same.
Which will bee easefull unto
those who have not leasure to
read out long continued <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses;</hi>
especially when they
have some speedy occasion to
collect the Testimonies of
<hi>Antiquitie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now that I may every way
(as much as in me lieth) keep
my <hi>Nemesius</hi> from being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
misconceived, or misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted;
I beseech my common
<hi>Readers,</hi> to bee very heedfull
in the perusall of him, least
through want of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in themselves, they cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
him to be an Author not
<hi>Intelligible,</hi> (as it hath pleased
them to censure a learned
writer now living) for such
<pb facs="19"/>
halfe witted people, as are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
capable of the mysteries
of <hi>Nature,</hi> nor of such tearms,
as may properly expresse
them, should learne to know,
before they presume to <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:</hi>
which will never bee
attained, without humility &amp;
some diligence.</p>
   <p>Let them please to be heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
also, when this <hi>Author</hi>
speaks in his own person, and
when in the person of others:
for, sometime he bringeth in
<hi>Arguments,</hi> and continued
disputes, out of <hi>Ethnick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,</hi>
(with all their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
to confute their
fellowes; and if it be not well
observed when hee so doth,
some heathenish <hi>proposition,</hi>
(interlaced therewith) may be
wrongfully taken for his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
And, perhaps also a well
meaning expression may bee
misunderstood, contrary to
<pb facs="19"/>
the minde of the <hi>Authour,</hi> by
a little obscurity in the Text,
or by want of heeding, how
his intention may be discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in other passages of the
same <hi>Booke.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Nemesius</hi> hath heretofore
suffred in this kinde, even by
no worse men, then his two
<hi>Latine Interpreters;</hi> and one of
them hath charged him with
being of their opinion, who
beleeved the <hi>Transmigration
of Soules,</hi> whereof hee was
no way guilty, as may be
made probable, not only by
sundry expressions in this
<hi>Tract;</hi> but by those words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
from whence this miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
arose; they being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
as I understand them.</p>
   <p>They are to be found about
the beginning of the seaventh
<hi>Section</hi> of the second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and speake to this effect.
<q>
         <hi>Iamblicus</hi> (saith he) hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb facs="20"/>
in his Booke called
MONOBIBLON, that
the <hi>changing of Soules</hi> never
hapneth from <hi>men</hi> to <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
creatures,</hi> nor from
<hi>unreasonable creatures</hi> to
<hi>men:</hi> but from <hi>Beasts,</hi> to
<hi>Beasts,</hi> and from <hi>men,</hi> to
<hi>men▪</hi> and in so saying, hee
hath not only conjectured
very well of <hi>Platoes</hi> opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but of the <hi>Truth</hi> it selfe.</q>
   </p>
   <p>By these last words, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesius</hi>
hath seemed to justifie
the opinion, both of <hi>Iambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Plato,</hi> touching <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration
of Soules.</hi> Now this
<hi>clause</hi> I have understood as if
it said thus, rather: <hi>And in so
saying, hee hath not only well
guessed, but in my judgement
expressed the very truth of</hi> Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes
<hi>opinion.</hi> Let the learned
judge, whether the Greek
words will not well enough
beare this <hi>Version</hi> (though not
<pb facs="20"/>
in a strict Grammaticall
sense) especially since the
context proves his opinion
concerning the <hi>Soule</hi> to be the
same which is generally belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
among <hi>Christians,</hi> for my
part, till I see more cause to
suspect the contrary, I shall
alway so conceive of it.</p>
   <p>That which is mentioned
by another concerning his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
touching the <hi>Soules</hi>
preexistence before the <hi>Bodie,</hi>
is not a matter <hi>of faith,</hi> or so
precisely decided, as that <hi>he</hi> or
<hi>we</hi> are (for ought I know) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
to be peremptorily for
it, or against it; and therefore
I my self have not yet so much
thought upon it as to resolve
which way to encline: or
what to answer for him. If
any man can assure me whether
part is without errour, that
will I embrace; and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
so would Nemesius
<pb facs="21"/>
have done, if any man could
have proved unto him that
his opinion was erroneous, in
that point; which if others
beleeve of him, (as they have
no just cause to the contrary)
no more needes to be spoken
of this matter.</p>
   <p>If any be offended that hee
argues <hi>philosophically,</hi> rather
then by proofs of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
and citeth <hi>Moses</hi> not as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Prophet, but a <hi>Wiseman;</hi>
Let them consider, that hee
had such to contest withall,
as neither beleeved the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
nor ascribed more unto
<hi>Moses,</hi> or any other, then the
Reasonablenesse of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
seemed to deserve; The
alledging of <hi>Scripture,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to such men, had been to
cast pearles to swine, and
more to the derision, then to
the honour of his cause. This
course was practiced by the
<pb facs="21"/>
Apostles themselves; To the
<hi>Iewes</hi> and beleeving <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
they brought the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Prophets: but to
Unbeleevers, they cited their
owne <hi>Poets,</hi> or convinced
them by <hi>Reason.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Had our Author argued
with</hi> Christians, <hi>the holy</hi>
Scriptures <hi>onely, should have
been Judges of their</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies:
<hi>For he himselfe saith,
Cap. 2. Sect. 7.</hi> To us the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the divine Scriptures
are al-sufficient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but against
those who embrace not the
Scriptures (as wee Christians
doe) we must prove by Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In these times, there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
who though they deny
not the letter of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
yet they doe as bad (or
worse rather) for they deny
the true sense of them, and
make interpretations accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="22"/>
to their owne lusts and
fancies. To these also, the <hi>holy
Scriptures</hi> are impertinent
proofs, till by some reasonable
Demonstrations we can make
them understand and confesse
their true meaning: And some
of these have so long, and so
violently professed against
Reason, as unusefull in the
consideration of the <hi>Divine
mysteries,</hi> that there is little
hope either to work upon
them by a <hi>rationall dispute,</hi> or
to convince them by <hi>divine
Authority,</hi> till GOD shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
their deniall and abuse
of his <hi>common graces,</hi> upon
true repentance for the same;
and restore the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi>
which is worthily darkned
by that sinne: and for enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whereof, this <hi>Treatise,</hi>
may perhaps become help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
   <p>Other things might bee
<pb facs="22"/>
here declared, to prevent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
and to shew forth the
use and profitablenesse of this
<hi>Booke:</hi> but lest they make this
<hi>Preface</hi> over-large, I wil here
conclude, and commit all to
Gods blessing.</p>
