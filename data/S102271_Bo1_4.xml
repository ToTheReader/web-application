   <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is one thing (Christian Reader) which I would haue thee especially to take notice of, concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Principles, or Grounds of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: namely, that nothing is to be receiued for a Principle of Religion, or true and sound doctrine, which hath not foundation in the Word of God, or is not contained therein: for the Word of God (or the Scripture as we call it) is the rule of all truth, and giues vs a perfect direction, both for faith and manners: and whatsoeuer Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and doctrine is necessary to saluation, is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red plainly in the holy Scripture; and therefore in reading this, or any Catechism, you are not by and by to beleeue whatsoeuer is therein contained: but to see and consider how euery thing is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Scriptures; for your faith and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence must be grounded, not vpon the weake and vnperfect speeches of sinnefull men, but vpon the pure and sure Word of God. And therefore at the end of euery answere, I haue quoted some plaine place of Scripture to confirm the same, some few only excepted, which though in plain words they are not to be found in the Scriptures, yet by good consequence they are drawn from the Scriptures. And whatsoeuer is truly and soundly collected
<pb n="72" facs="45"/>from Scripture, is to be beleeued of vs, as though it were expresly written. As for example, when Christ would confute the Sadduces that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the resurrection, he alleadgeth the words of God to <hi>Moses:</hi> I am the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacob.</hi> From hence this truth is strongly collected, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> shall liue, and rise according to their bodies: because God (saith Christ) is not the God of the dead, but of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Therefore now this consequence, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and the Saints departed, shall rise, must bee credited no lesse then that expresse Scripture from whence Christ drew it. And to the end that you may see, that all necessary poynts of faith &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are plainely expressed in the Scriptures, I haue heere in order set downe the summe &amp; substance of Christian Religion, in certaine Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The order of it is this: The true knowledge of God and of Iesus Christ, which is life eternall (that is the way and meanes to eternall life) is to be found in the Scriptures. Therfore first we begin with the Scriptures: then wee come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of his workes, as of his eternall decree of Predestination, Creation, and Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, concerning Angels and men: in which, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence is to be considered, the fall of Angels and man, and the misery that followed therof, namely, sinne and death. Secondly, followeth Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant with man, namely, the couenant of works, and the couenant of grace. Concerning the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of workes, there is shewed the impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of keeping it, and to what end it serues. In the
<pb n="73" facs="45"/>couenant of grace is noted; First, the foundation of it, which is Christ the Mediator. Secondly, the meanes of applying Christ vnto vs. In Christ wee are to consider his person, and office. His office is threefold. The application of the couenant of grace, where is shewed the vnion &amp; communion which the elect haue with Christ. The meanes of the reuealing and applying of the couenant of grace, are eyther inward, as the Spirit of Christ, and faith; or outward, namely, the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, The māner of reuealing it, is our calling vnto Christ. The persons to whom it is reuealed, namely, to the Church. As the benefit we receiue from the propheticall office of Christ, is the reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the couenant of grace, whereby we are made wise to saluation: so the benefit we receiue from the Priestly office of Christ is our instificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before God. The benefit we receiue from the kingly office of Christ is our glorification, which is partly in this present life, but fully and perfectly in the life to come. Our glorification in this life, consisteth in this, that in our condition we are made blessed, and made holy in our nature, which is Sanctification. The rule of Sanctification is the Word of God, euen the Law and the Gospell. The effect of Sanctification, is Repentance. The notes of Repentance, are specially two: A hatred of all sinnes, and the practice of good workes. Among good workes, almes and prayer are specially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs. The speciall helps to prayer, and to the performing of other good workes, are vowes and fasting. Then lastly is to be considered, Gods
<pb n="74" facs="46"/>dealing with man after this life, by bringing all men to Iudgement, which is eyther particular, or generall. And to the end that you may (in reading these Texts of Scripture) perceiue, how one thing depends vpon an other, I haue set downe (ouer the Texts of Scripture) the things whereof the places following doe speake. If therefore you will accordingly be diligent inreading the Texts of Scripture, I doubt not but (by Gods grace assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you) you shall in a short time much benefit your selues thereby, and shall be able (when need requires) to proue any ground of Religion by some Text of Scripture. And so I commit you to the mercifull protection of Almighty God, besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him to endue you with all sauing grace, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory, with exceeding ioy, through Iesus Christ. <hi>Amen.</hi>
