and Countrey Farmers health.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, Countrey men, and kinde
friends, for so I value all that are honest
and enemies of bad actions, although in
my bookes of Conny-catching I haue
discouered diuers formes of colonings,
and painted out both the sacking and
crosbyting lawes, which strumpets vse,
to the destruction of the simple, yet
willing to search all the substance, as I
haue glanncst at the shadow, &amp; to enter
into the nature of villanie, as I haue broacht vp the secretes of
vice, I haue thought good to publish this Dialogue or disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
betweene a hee Conny-catcher, and a shee Conny-catcher,
whether of them are most preiuditiall to the Common-wealth,
discoursing the base quallities of them both, and discouering
the inconuenience that growes to men, through the lightnes of
inconstant wantons, who being wholy giuen to the spoyle, seeke
the ruine of such as light into their companie. In this Dialogue,
louing Country-men, shall you finde what preiudice ensues by
haunting of whore-houses, what dangers grows by daliying with
common hat lottes, what inconuenience followes then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap>
pleasures of vnchast Libertines, (not onely by their consuming
of their wealth, and impouerishment of their goods and landes,
but to the great indangering of their health. For in conuersing
<pb facs="3"/>
with them, they aime not simply at the losse of goods, and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
of their good names, but they fish for diseases, sicknesse,
sores incurable, vlcers brusting of the ioyntes, and sault rhumes,
which by the humour of that villanie, lepte from Naples into
Fraunce, and from Fraunce into the bowels of Englande, which
makes many crye out in their bones, whilest goodman Surgion
laughs in his purse: a thing to be feared as deadly while men liue,
as hell is to be dreaded after death, for it not only infecteth the
bodie, consumeth the soule, and waste wealth and worship, but
ingraues a perpetuall shame in the forehead of the partie so abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Whereof Maister Huggins hathwell written in his Myrror
of Magistrates, in the person of Memprycaius, exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
harlots, the verses be these:
<q>
         <l>Eschue vile Venus toyes shee cuts off age,</l>
         <l>And learne this lesson oft, and tell thy frend,</l>
         <l>By Pockes, death sodaine, begging, Harlots end.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Besides, I haue here lay de open the wily wisedome of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Curtizens, that with their cunning, can drawe on, not only
poore nouices, but such as hold themselues maisters of their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation.
What flatteries they vse to bewitch, what sweet words
to inueagle, what simple holines to intrap, what amorous glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
what smirking Ocyliades, what cringing curtesies, what stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Adios, following a man like a blood-hound, with theyr
eyes white, laying out of haire, what frouncing of tresses, what
paintings, what Ruffes, Cuffes, and braueries, and all to betraie
the eyes of the innocent nouice, whom when they haue drawne
on to the bent of their bow, they strip like the prodigall childe,
and turne out of doores like an outcast of the world. The Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile
hathnot more teares, Proleus, more shape, Ianus more
faces, the Hieria, more sundry tunes to entrap the passengers,
then our English Curtizens, to bee plaine, our English whores:
to set on fire the hearts of lasciuious and gazing strangers. These
common, or rather consuming strumpets, whose throathes are
softer then oyle, and yet whose steppes leade vnto death. They
haue their Ruffians to rifle, when they cannot fetch ouer with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cunning, their crosbiters attending vpon them, their foysts,
<pb facs="3"/>
their bufts, their nippes, and such like. Being wayted on by these
villaines, as by ordinary seruantes, so that who thinkes himselfe
wise inough to escape their flatteries, him they crosbyte, who
holdes himselfe to rule, to be bitten, with a counterfeyt Appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
him they rifle, if hee be not so to bee verst vpon, they haue a
foyst or a nyppe vpon him, and so sting him to the quicke. Thus
he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hat medles with pitch, cannot but be defiled, and he that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainteth
himselfe or conuerseth with any of these Connycat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
strumpets, cannot but by some way or other bee brought
to confusion: for either hee must hazard his soule, blemish his
good name, loose his goods, light vppon diseases, or at the least
haue been tyed to the humor of an harlot, whose quiuer is open
to euery arrow, who likes all that haue fat purses, and loues none
that are destitue of pence. I remember a Monke in <hi>Diebus illis,</hi>
writ his opinion of the end of an Adulterer, thus:
<q>
         <l>Quatuor his casibus sine dubio cadet adulter,</l>
         <l>Aut hic pauper eit, aut hicsubito morietur,</l>
         <l>Aut cadet in causum qua debet indice vinci,</l>
         <l>Aut aliquod membrum casu vell crimine perdet,</l>
      </q>
Which I Englished thus:
<q>
         <l>He that to Harlots lures do yeeld him thrall,</l>
         <l>Through sowre misfortune too bad end shall fall:</l>
         <l>Or sodaine death, or beggerie shall him chance,</l>
         <l>Or guilt before a Iudge his shame inhance:</l>
         <l>Or els by fault or fortune he shall leese,</l>
         <l>Some member sure escape from one of these.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Seeing then such inconuenience grows from the caterpillers
of the Common-wealth, and that a multitude of the monsters
here about London particularly &amp; generally abroad in England,
to the great ouerthrow of many simple men that are inueagled
by their flatteries, I thought good not only to discouer their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies
in a Dialogue, but also to manifest by an example, howe
preiuditiall their life is, to the state of the land, that such as are
warned by an instance, may learne and looke before they leape,
<pb facs="4"/>
to that end kind Country-men, I haue set downe at the ende of
the disputation, the wonderful life of a Curtezin, not a fiction,
but a truth of one that yet liues not now in an other forme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant.
In the discourse of whose life, you shall see how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
such truls be to all estates that be so simple as to trust theyr
fained subtilties: heere shall parents learne, how hurtfull it is to
cocker vp their youth in their follies, and haue a deepe insight
how to bridle their daughters, if they see them any waies grow
wantons, wishing therfore my labors may be a caueat to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men,
to auoyde the companie of such cousoning Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins.</p>
