   <head>❀TO THE RYGHTE honourable and worshhipfull of the Inner Temple.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT OTHERS, with long perswasiōs, sometime all in vaine, Nature and Arte, the warest guides assay to learne: that at this prefēt, the rather to enforce in me, they haue coupled to their authorities, vnauoydable ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cessitie. Namely, to cause me, what I meane to maintain or excuse, first to propose. For, what eyther for necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie could I, or without breache of the comely course of nature &amp; order shuld I, in my preface preferre before the title? Yet again, what weaker? what more impugned? I say not of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious carpers, but euen the patrones of whom iustliest it awaited succour? Whiche notwithstandinge, rather I say as fearinge what I doubte, then foreiudginge my hope. For sith the wise euen with exāple teache, it may perhaps be argument enoughe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall
<pb facs="12"/>that hitherto they accepted none. And whereto chooseth he them (saye some) whome none tofore?</p>
   <p>Hopeth he to reache, what neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny erst? Whom as easye is to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, theyr not accepting, riseth of want of profferynge. For whom suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courles haue they dismissed? Whom reiected? Who remayneth paterne of theyr rigour or crueltye? Patrones not onelye of the learned, but all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted good. Yet my guylt, (if ought) I confesse lesse colourable, for wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Presydente, late at least, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the vnattempted meane. But, if lyke reason forde like lawe, sith sundrie <hi>Pamphlets</hi> soughte and founde succour, in ladyes lappes, in lordes armes, in the Queenes bosome: well maye a Templer hope, to roost in the Temple, vnder the rooffe of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noures and worshyppes names.</p>
   <p>Which notwithstandinge, I clayme not of curtesye, but bothe I proue it my parte to proffer it, and vnseemely and vnsittyng to your honoures, to
<pb facs="12"/>spurne it. For the fyrst, three reasons proffer to acquite me. The fyrste, is the consideration of the bounden du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, whereby I am indetted to thys Noble house. Which, as I want the wyshed meanes to expresse: so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the hart to continue. Rest it ye my lordes, to vnlads by proofe youre affection. Nor yet by vnladinge (as the swollen hearte by the weepynge eye) to asswage the passion. Suffise me, the offer of this myte of fame, to the teasing of greater. To like ende runne, though by farre distant mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the creapyng <hi>Ante,</hi> the rampyng, <hi>Lyon.</hi> As ready and prest am I, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge in my one wheaten graine, to signifye my engraffed pietye: as your honours by conferryng whole reekes Onelye craue I, my deuoyre be no fraude to me. That what I meane simply, ye incerprete not presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. The nexte of no lesse efficacye, issueth from your honoures and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppes. Whose honourable state, as it earneth the prayse, so of dutye clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the patronage of your honour.
<pb facs="13"/>Whom thus linkd and knyt in one, as a corporacion or felowshippe, iuste cause inhibiteth me to terme: so as weighty respect, enforceth to adiudge the most honourable societie, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile bodie of Gentlemen. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hath that highe <hi>Ioue</hi> (to whome worthelye is ascribed the honoure, of fyrst assembling and vniting sondred multitudes) honoured other states: not especially aboue the reste priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this? Famous for all prefermē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes bothe of fortune and vertue, but chiefely, for Cōcord, Continuaūce, &amp; Gentrie. For, what surer or faster league of amitie, then the wrythen band with greene and tender hartes, whych dried with elde, rather bowe then bend? Or what for continuance more lastinge or immortall, then the exempt from death? Whych, if a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poracion be, may these the mayntey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and preseruers of all societyes, not be? But of gentrye what neede I speake? where the whole realme vaū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth her stoare. Some Noble vaunis of their whole house. Some vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
<pb facs="13"/>of their Noble house. Some glorious for both. None moath or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpiller of his parents prayses.</p>
   <p>Where, if eche seuerally ye deny a cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plete gentleman: certes the whole in loue but one, euē in <hi>Momus</hi> iudgemēt, shal mate, I say not the Courtier, but euen this our christian Noble. Eche one so seeming to supplie others wāt as with one voice, thus satisfie they the Courtyer, demaūding what wā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes they best beare: euen those, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our feeres are cloyed with stoare.</p>
   <p>From ye also proceedeth this, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges ye, and of ye they are, whoe fynding me deaffe at then chaunting reasons, wherwith long they sought to charme me, to conceiue of my selfe more then either I ought or mought: at laste, with their vndeniable frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipps so pressd me, as violently they yoaked me to the charge, that thus ladeth &amp; crusheth me. No otherwyse withholding, and lingering, then the enforced to leaue his loued home, per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitteth the directing of his dumpishe coarse, to his vnwelcom guydes: him
<pb facs="14"/>selfe, withe his twyned neck and twi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nned mynde, altogether ententife on the place he parteth fro. Whose Cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yse, had it light so luckelie as it ought nor needed I at this present to pleade my pardon, nor they be accessaryes, yf not principalls, in my vnwillyng crymes. Whose requests, as I vouch not to preiudice ye, so mencion I, to make my blames more excusable, for theyr importunitye. Who empli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this title, are partners bothe of the prayse and infamye, to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof, they pushed forth me.</p>
   <p>So recompenced with as massye charge, that bequeathd them, which sole I confesse my selfe vnable to welde. Ioyne hereto, that onelye the Queenes hyghenes, deserued at first to surname it. Knowynge therefore, by translation it must fall (whych yet onely so much I wishd, as our tonge yeldeth to thother) howsoeuer therin I am maister of my wishe throughe willingnes, at least I meant to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, it shoulde stoope but one steppe in authorising. Which howe it lesse
<pb facs="14"/>may, then by ye: certes I see not.</p>
   <p>Whom, as seuered, some exceede: so ioynt, next her maiestye none. The thirde and laste, concerneth the cause it selfe. Which though nowe stoared with patrones, claymeth yet none so ryghtlye as ye. First, for it is yours, as heritage by your auncestoures, as purchase by your owne prowesse.</p>
   <p>Next, for it is pestred with counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faytes. Whom but ye discouer, and punishe for intrusion, needes must they argue ye of basenes. For two so contrary ympes neuer bred Nobility Thirdlye, for if ye retaine it not, and thother it selfe abhorrre, and obscure it can not lye: (for it coueyteth the statelyest Towers &amp; Sunnye moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes) needes must that lampe of your Gentrie quenche, that Moone of your honoure wane, that Sonne of your glorie clipse. And by reiecryng, eyther condemueth other. Wherof, whether is most preiudicial, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not? Of such importaūce your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is, as <hi>Socrates</hi> wel termed ye, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> cities leuel. Howe crookedly the &amp; all
<pb facs="15"/>amisse shal the meaner sorte iudge of that, whiche though plainely ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne not, yet in withdrawing your maintenance, litle alowe? Whō shal we seeke to shielde it, if ye betraye it? The deuines? They prise no persons nor looke to states but sowles. The commens? They haue declared theyr affection by ofte impugninge it. The Prince? Her feare I to prouoke, by de basing that erst so honourd her.</p>
   <p>Whose elder protection, dischargeth not, but authoriseth ye, to defēd whō your princesse hath receiued to patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. These therfore thus remoued, sith we maye well despaire, to fynde your progenie heires to that ye neuer left theym: who but ye onelye reste, to father orphane honour? And thus heare ye right honourable, the three causes. Which, as they charged me to geue it ye, so I hope, discharge me of presumption in proferyng it. The next, hath for a great part, relaciō to the already prooued. For if it behoue me to proser it ye, sith this relyenge necessitie hath a vent, probable it is
<pb facs="15"/>my constraint of profering, emplieth your necessitie of taking. Hereto ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore collaterallye serueth, what hath bene sayde. But with more force to moue ye, &amp; not neglect any part of my promisse: somewhat meane I to saye, whye ye ought take it. With open mouth loe curtesy, the refuge, roade, &amp; succour of al afflicted, the patronesse of hartye though meanest presentes: fearing stayne in ye in this, crieth ye maye not spurne so humble, so iust, so heartye proffer. Nowe hyeth she to vouche her olde forworne presidētes, of that Noblest prince, that disdaind not the proffered rape. And <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> who so much prised, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> heaued vp hā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of his well wishinge Subiecte, though but filled with water: as he boughte the licour w<seg rend="sup">c</seg> golde. And tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers apple gift, as he plainelye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him one of that sorte, whose bigge hart, were able to swel a Coat to a kingdome. Acknowledginge the minde that sugreth euery present, to counteruaile the most precious iewel She sayeth, the gifte is but y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hartes
<pb facs="16"/>huske onelye the hearte the presented kernell. And most precious present is it, that so noble gifte honoureth.</p>
   <p>For of euery benefite, the receiuours gaine is the hearte. And the affection nameth the gyfte. Yea, of suche force is the geuers mynde, as though <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> accompte the misplaced benefyte losse, yet <hi>Aristotle</hi> aloweth this recom pēce. That were the taker vnworthy the gift is geuen to curtesie. And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wante giftes where wil aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. For, hit is the gifte, what so the signe be. And, who sticketh in the signe, not attendinge the signed: fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, as who not prisinge the Nutie, should sticke in the Nutshale. Nor is here any meane or base gifte offered, (which if it were, no meane prayse of bountye were to stoope to it) but the honourablest &amp; noblest. Yea such, as without discurtesy ye may not frown on. <hi>Tiberius</hi> themperour, in shieldinge naked, miserable, &amp; needye Chryste: in warted the whole <hi>Senate.</hi> And, whē though emperor, through his whole Empire, he preuayled not to deifye him: yet in his owne oratorye, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb facs="16"/>enstalled his image. Though missinge the maner, not yet the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his fayth. And wil ye betray not naked but Noble christ, not beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered christianitye, but honourd chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Nobility? I knowe, some mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile why in a matter of taking, I so longe stande with the good takers of this time. And accompte it all super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous talke, seinge Nobilitye eche where so coueit &amp; coueited: to exhorte any to vndertake, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> magnificēt, &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious title, of tutors &amp; gardens of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
