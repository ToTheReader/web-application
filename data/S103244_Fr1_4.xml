is somewhat
out of ioynt,
when Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
conuersation goes not e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen,
as it ought with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
profession, it is so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
it cānot be denied,
such and so sensible a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as that thereby the
whole bodie is not a little
<pb facs="8"/>
blemished. Those whose
hearts desire is, that Israel
may be saued, and whose
true charity is woont to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
God, for the good of
all, haue not onely lifted vp
humble handes to heauen,
but also endeuoured by
painfull labors, to seeke (as
much as in them lieth, and
so farre-forth as the times
may permit and suffer) the
best redresse in this case
they could: some by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
answering, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
asswaging the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
humors of those men,
whose priuate fancies haue
much hindred higher pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb facs="8"/>
in matters of
faith. Refuted they may be,
and are, quieted they will
not bee: others by deuout
and learned exhortations,
in seeking to make a stay
of those euils, which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme
and want of the
fear of God, would in great
likehoode bring vpon this
declining world, both la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
for their times to
keepe some remembraunce
of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in the
minds of men, before all be
too farre out of square, or
come to vnrecouerable ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.
But here may wee not
demaunde of the diligent
obseruers of our imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="9"/>
abroad, whose maner
is so much to strike vpon
this one string, and by this
defect take occasion to call
in question, nay, to bring in
open oblequie our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
cause, are none fallen at
home from the ancient sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie,
and harmlesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
of former and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ages of the Church?
Some state medling acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
these vncharitable
censures in cleane shutting
out from the housholde of
faith, and hope of life, those
who haue poore soules to
saue as well as others, and
beare as true a loue to
Christ crucified as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<pb facs="9"/>
may put them in
minde, that wee may all
beare a part togither in
that song of mercy; <hi>Asper

vs O Lord. May we not all
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> thinke our selues on both
sides, whether these bee not
the dayes whereof our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ spake, <hi>Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

Was euer that old

trulie verified?<note place="margin">Hilarius ad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantium</note>

<pb facs="10"/>
there is strife in wordes,
while there is question in
innouations, while there is
occasion in doubts, while
there is a waywardnesse in
consent, none is of <hi>Christ.</hi>
This nipping and galling
one of, and at another; this
eger pursuit of the liuing,
and troubling the verie
ashes of the dead, (who can
not answer for themselues)
is farre from that charitie
that <hi>hopeth all thinges:</hi>

what wit and learning is

of these times, as
he shall think some of them
rather discourses to trie
masterie, then otherwise
sincere trauels imployed for
Gods glorie, and his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

mercy grant that once this
frowarde crossing worlde
may drawe to a Christian
harmonie, that wee may
haue lesse fighting and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for religion, and more
<pb facs="11"/>
indeuouring on all partes
to become as we ought,
more religious; that so
this little Arke of Christes
Church may nowe in the

aduise to euerie one, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

let enmitie passe.</hi> And
thus much wee beseech at
their hands, in whose har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
iudgement our cause is
so feeble, that setting aside
all priuate respects, they
would at last considerwhose

gratious protection hath

the staffe of our peace, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

For those busie spirits nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer

gouerne before they haue
well learned to obey, and

taught the worlde, and the
ruine of the East Church,
howe daungerous it is to
saile in a ship, where the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
are of a disposition to
bee quarrelling within
themselues: these mens new
deuises in matters of meere
conceipt, haue long seemed
vnto themselues, better
then all the wisdome of the
world. But may we intreat
them at the last to recount
with themselues their own
follie, in making it as they
haue done, a perfection of
godlinesse, to call and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon

This priuate examining

thinke the skie to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

more common with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
dispositions, which

peace, then to bee conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

this present discourse of
learning to die, shall first
lay before thee (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
reader) how necessary
it is for euerie one to enter
into a serious remembrāce
of his ende. The manifolde
reasons that should mooue
him to this remembrance,
amongst these reasons, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the meditation of his
state, and manifold afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
incident vnto the life
present, should mooue him
herevnto. Correction cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

painfullie to applie himself
vnto h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>s lesson: and so the

      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in this learning: the
meanes that call vs away
from so good a labour are
mentioned, and the maner
how to auoid these meanes
is with all expressed. To
make an entrance into this
so solemne a subiect; I was
sometime since occasioned
by the treatable visitation
and most Christian ende of
that verie woorshipfull
knight sir <hi>Robert South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
whose approued ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
in this Commonwelth,
and good reputation in his
Countrie, is well knowne
vnto manie: but of whose
true heart to God-warde,
<pb facs="18"/>
both in the time of his life,
&amp; at the time of his death,
my selfe can truly relate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others. If there be (as
without doubt there is) a
dutie which wee owe vnto
the faithfull departed, and
a good remembrance to bee
had of those happie soules;
then might I not omit a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerende
mention of him,
whose portion I trust assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
is with God. Looke
what a mournefull minde
during the time of this his
so Christian visitation,
could at times consider of,
and obserue in priuate, I
haue beene since by speciall
motiues drawn on, to make
<pb facs="18"/>
that poore labour publike,
as a discourse proper vnto
the time. For although a
consideration of our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from this world bee a
subiect not vnfitting all
ages, yet seeing we are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into those dayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
manye liue as if they
should neuer die▪ and die, as
if with death al were done;
and when they come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
this world they are so
farre to seeke in a right
disposing themselues to
God, as if they seldome or
neuer entrod into any ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
consideration of the
same. Necessarie are those
manie treatises which tend
<pb facs="19"/>
to the amendment of life,
but because vpon our last
conflict dependeth our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
victorie, against the
professed enemie of our
soules, the well behauing
our selues in this combate,
must needes of all other be
most necessarie. To guide
the ship along the seas, it is
no doubt a good skill, but at
the verie entrance into the
hauen, then to auoide the
daungerous rockes, and to
cast anchor in a safe roade,
is the chiefest skil of all. To
run the race in good order
is the part of a stout cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion;
but so to run towards
the end of his race that hee
<pb facs="19"/>
may obtaine the crowne, is
the verie perfection of all
his paines. Then a good life
what more Christian like,
but after that passed to die
in the faith and feare of
God, what more diuine?
To order aright the vpshot
of our owne time, and fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
from this world, what
more behouefull if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
our selues? but in

they be not a shame to Israel
which Church is a bodie
mysticall: we are all sheepe
of that folde whereof Christ
<pb facs="22"/>
is the sheepheard, we are all
stones of that building,
whereof he was the corner.
We are all braunches of
that Vine whereof hee was
the stocke. We haue but one
God for our father, that
created vs all, one Christ
Iesus to our Sauiour, that
redeemed vs all, one holie
Ghost to our sanctifier, that
doth adorne vs all. We are
but pilgrimes and straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and wee shall one day
find, that a peaceable chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stian
life, with a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from this worlde,
shal stand vs more in stead
then all the world besides,
when after bearing our
<pb facs="22"/>
braines in matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
we shall perceiue
that this charitable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
life is worth all. And
therefore beseech we God,
the authour of all good
giftes, that <hi>Mercie</hi> and
<hi>truth may meete togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that righteousnesse
and peace may kisse
each other.</hi> And his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
dwell in our land, vntil
wee come to dwell in the
land of glorie.</p>
