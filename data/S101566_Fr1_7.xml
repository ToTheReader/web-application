   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN Reader, a louer of truth, all friendly <hi>well-wishes.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendlie Reader, albeit I haue giuen some reason of my omitting to speake of the three first Chapters of the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, for that they seeme to all not to need any great labour to explane thē, and are vsually taken in hand of most that preach out of this prophecie; and also because Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Perkins,</hi> a learned and reuerend Diuine, hath very largely commented thereupon; which I supposed might haue giuen al satisfaction, touching my omission of them: yet by conference with some, I perceiue that men rest not satisfied, but desire to be informed in some particulars, and especially touching an opinion of Master <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> which is this, that the seuen Churches mentioned in the first chapter, vers. 11, and seuerall Epistles written vnto them in chap. 2. and 3, <hi>are so many types representing and containing the vniuersall condition of the whole Church of the Gentiles.</hi> Now what may bee thought of this, is the thing which many stand in question of. Some will haue thē so, and are fully of his mind; some do vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reiect the same, as a foolish fancie, a conceit without ground or reason. I will not contend with either, neither will I presume to be an Arbitratour betweene them, to iudge of either, or to take vpon me to giue either satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for in this I hold my selfe farre too weake, the point not so easie to bee cleered, and mens forestalled iudgement most hardly to be reformed: only I will (as I
<pb facs="24"/> hope I may without giuing iustly either side offence) set downe what I thinke hereof, with my reasons; and so leaue the matter to the indifferent iudgement of euery one, to allow or disallow, as vpon good reason they shall like best, without vncharitable contention, which from my soule I hate and detest.</p>
   <p>What Master <hi>Brightman</hi> hath held, <hi>Iunius</hi> before him in a few words saith as much; <hi>In the number of seuen, the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iun. Com. on cap. 1. vers. 13.</note>
      <hi>slat</hi> (saith hee) <hi>of the whole Church of Christ militant here vpon earth, is represented.</hi> And <hi>Grasser</hi> saith, that the<note place="margin">In his <hi>Plagae Regiae by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis.</hi>
      </note> Apostle in the Epistles shadoweth out a most generall tincture of the Antichristian infection. And to me the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion seemeth probable (for otherwise will I not say of it) and my reasons be these: I. Because the number of seuen is kept here, as elsewhere in this prophecie repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 37 times; and is a number of perfection, seuen put for all of that, whereof the number is giuen: as here seuen Churches, for all the Christian Churches; so seuen stars, all the Angels of the Churches; seuen spirits, all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold graces of the spirit. And from this number, <hi>Iunius</hi> in his Comment. saith, that it <hi>signifieth to vs perfectly and</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iun. on cap. 1. vers. 4.</note>
      <hi>generally the Church of Christ that is conuersant here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</hi> And it may seeme likely that the number of seuen Churches (seeing there were moe besides) was obserued of the Lord for further purpose, then to note out the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state onely and no more. II. Because at the end of euery Epistle, though <hi>Iohn</hi> bee commanded to write to the Angell of that Church, and in him to that flocke; yet the exhortation is, to heare what the spirit saith to the <hi>Churches,</hi> and so by one, teaching all those whereof that is a type: or if you will, so by one, all the seuen, and by them the whole vniuersall Church. III. The things mentioned in the Epistles, (to wit, the allusions to the old time, in these words, <hi>Iewes, Synagogue, doctrine of Balaam,</hi> and <hi>Iesabel,</hi> not mentioned so in other Epistles, nor sound to be in any other Churches, to whom any other of the Apostles did write) may seeme to intimate hereby, that
<pb facs="24"/> some other thing is intended, then the discouerie only of these Churches present state. So in like manner, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of ten daies persecution to Smyrna (which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors are forced to stretch further then Smyrna, when they apply the historie to the text), biddeth vs in this Church so to consider it in affliction, as it also may type out a more generall state of Gods Church. Likewise the prediction of the houre of tentation to come vpon all the world, mentioned to Philadelphia, cannot concerne that Church in particular to haue that exemption from the same, more then the rest of Christs Church then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that houre of tentation, but as it is here a type thereof. Furthermore, why should those Iewes in Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na be suffered to grow to such a height of wickednesse, and must be made to stoupe to no Church, but to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell and Church of Philadelphia? and why (I say) to this, and not to the other, or any of the rest, but that they bee types of the seuerall times of the state of Christs Church, as shall be shewed afterwards? IV. It is said in the end of the Reuelation, after that all future things before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, touching the whole Church of Christ, and of the kingdome of Antichrist, to the full, that Iesus Christ sent his Angell to testifie <hi>these things to vs in the Churches:</hi> which (as may seeme) can no otherwise be interpreted, but that these seuen Churches (for no other is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the whole prophecie) doe type out to vs, what in the rest of the Reuelation is foretold, touching the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches future estate: which words, admitting this sense, make the opinion cleere, that they set out the whole Church of Christ. V. Because there is such an answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablenes of the Antitype to the type in the seuen-fold state of the Church, following so cleerely one vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the beholding thereof may induce a man very much to entertaine this opinion. Which to see more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently, we must first make a seuen-fold state of Christs Church, as there be seuen Churches. Secondly, as these Churches are ordered and set one after another, as first
<pb facs="25"/> Ephesus, next Smyrna, and so foorth of the rest: so one state of the Church followeth another, the first may bee called the Ephesine state; the second, Smyrnean; the third, Pergamine; the fourth, Thyatiran, and so foorth to the seuenth and last. Thirdly, that euery Church is a type of that whole state of the Church, whereof it is a type, and doth not type out any one particular Church, as Master <hi>Brigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>man</hi> would haue it in some, which I take to be herein his mistake, as after I shall shew. Fourthly, These Churches are types of the Christian Church, as the same is troubled with Antichrist in his breeding, rising vp, height, the Churches knowledge of him, departing from him, and preuailing against him, as it is foretold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the rest of this prophecie. Fifthly, that in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches therefore, wee must take notice of two things: first of the same as it is the Church of God, with her graces and defects; and then next, of Satan his instruments in euery of them: that so by the one, Christ and his Church may be typed out, and Antichrist by the other; and the false Church may bee discerned in euery state, as farre foorth as they be mentioned together, which is apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the foure first Churches, but not in the three last. The foure first set out the state of Christs Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and among whom Satan bred vp his eldest sonne An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, till that false Church came to bee Iesabel, that whore of Babylon; the three last set out the three-fold state of the Church, come out of Babylon. For let it bee marked, and the Reader shall see, that in the foure first there is mention made of the instruments of Satan, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising euill, getting strength ouer the godly; but not so in the three last, being not at all in them named, but only once for the ioy and comfort of the Church.</p>
   <p>These things thus being first considered of, I will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my poore abilitie, shew how these seuen Churches type out the seuen-fold state of the whole Church of Christ, the Antitype answering fitly to euery type. The <hi>first type</hi> is <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the Angell of which
<pb facs="25"/> Church is commended for labour, patience, zeale, the vsing of his authoritie with boldnesse and wisedome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wicked, and hating the deedes of the Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and yet at the length did decay in loue. In this Church were such as tooke vpon them the name of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, but were none. The <hi>Antitype</hi> to this is the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine state,</hi> as I may call it, because the one is like the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this is that which we call the <hi>Primitiue Church,</hi> or first Christian Church, during the time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and Apostolicall men, their immediate successors; or, as some thinke, to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great: in which these vertues of this Church of Ephesus did shine, This first Christian Church was full of good workes, Pastors<note place="margin">Iust. Mar. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. 2. Euseb. lib. 3. cap. 33. Iust. Apol. 2. Cyprians Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</note> painfull in teaching, the wicked not tolerated among them, but the censure of the Church passed vpon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, <hi>Tertul. Apologet. cap. 39. Origen</hi> in his treatise on Matth. 35. Hom. 7. on <hi>Iosua.</hi> Great was the patience of the Saints and Teachers in the Church, whom persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could not daunt. Stories are plentifull for this. In which time the deedes of the Nicolaitans were hated, the Church was a pure virgine, from fleshly filthinesse and spirituall fornication, it had not yet waxed wanton with fleshly deuices of humane wisedome. But as the Angell of Ephesus left off his loue at length, euen so this Ephesine state decaied in the first loue, declining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to worse and worse; as may be gathered from <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Epist. lib. 4. 4.</note> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaking of the Church a little before <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesian.</hi> It seemeth to bee like the state of the Israelites, who serued the Lord all the daies of <hi>Iesua</hi> and Elders ouerliuing him, but after fell away.</p>
   <p>Now Satan, in this defection of the Churches loue, slept not; but when she began to be drowsie, hee awoke and rose vp to sow tares. And as Ephesus had counterfeit Apostles, the picture of false Teachers; so had this Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine state detestable Heretikes, <hi>Menander, Ebion, Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> and diuers others. And thus wee see Ephesus, the type; and the Primitiue Church, the Ephesine state.</p>
   <pb facs="26"/>
   <p>The second <hi>type</hi> is <hi>Smyrna,</hi> poore and in affliction, yea and the same foretold to bee greater afterwards, though the time should not be long. This poore afflicted Church is approued of God, as rich.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the <hi>Smyrnean state,</hi> which followed vpon the Ephesine, and was from <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, (if the former extended thither) vnto the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Gratian,</hi> for that so the type and this Antitype a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth. This Smyrnean state was poore and afflicted, more towards the end, then at the first; yet were euen there found such as were, as this Angell of Smyrna, rich in gifts and graces, earnestly contending for the truth; such a one was <hi>Athanasius,</hi> a right Smyrnean Angell. But this state is better seene by considering the false Church, of which much is spoken in the type.</p>
   <p>At this time Satans kingdome was greatly encreased. His false Apostles in the Ephesine state, had so bestirred themselues, as now in this Smyrnean there was a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan; before, onely a sending out of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to gather a false Church, and here in this state it was effected. So as now the counterfeit Christians, and false Iewes, blasphemed the true seruants of Christ, the true Smyrnean Angels; and they onely would bee the true Church. So heere was now Christians (in name) persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Socra. lib. 2. 4. Theod. lib. 2. &amp; 4. Sozom. lib. 3. 4. 6</note> Christians in deed. These <hi>Iewes</hi> in type were <hi>Arian Bishops</hi> and their fauourites in this Antitype, who would be the true Church, but were indeede the Synagogue of Satan, and fore-runners of Antichrist. For from almost the beginning of the Ephesine state in <hi>Iohns</hi> time, were many Antichrists, and the mysterie of iniquitie was in working; and the now Antichrist of Rome his seate was by Satan in these great broyles (yea and bloudy persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) in preparing: when at this time a golden scepter was offered to <hi>Syluester,</hi> then Bishop of Rome, by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Anno 314. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell.</note> which howsoeuer it was refused, yet we may see Satans working, and abusing the Emperors good mind, to get vp, in this Smyrnean state, his sonne of perdition
<pb facs="26"/> into the chaire of pestilence, and high throne, of which in the next Pergamine state.</p>
   <p>The third <hi>type</hi> is <hi>Pergamus,</hi> in a miserable condition, dwelling where Satans throne was, yet holding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly the truth, euen when some did suffer martyrdome for it, and when Balaamites and Nicolaitans were among them, which they too much bare with; so as the throne of Satan was erected, and false waies taught.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the <hi>Pergamine</hi> state following vpon the Smyrnean, which taking beginning from the time of <hi>Gratian,</hi> vnto the Popes, seated in their supremacie at Rome, the Diuels thrones, called the seate of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Reuel. 13. 2. continued a long time after, till neere the time of <hi>Iohn Wickliffe.</hi> In which time there yet were Pergamine Angels, such as held fast the truth of God. And of that Church were holy Martyrs suffering death. Such were Antipases, a sit name to the Martyr in the type to be called <hi>Antipas,</hi> to set out the Martyrs now in this state; who might haue y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> name, either because the whole world went after the Beast, and so they <hi>against all;</hi> or else for that they were against the Bishop of Rome, called <hi>Papa,</hi> and so they <hi>Antipapa,</hi> for contending against the Pope and his pride. Among such Martyrs were the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Florentine, one <hi>Arnulphus, Gerardus,</hi> and <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus Nauarensis,</hi> with others. Yet this was a fault in this Pergamine state of the true Church, that though some suffered, yet the Church is blamed for too much forbearing; this was her weaknesse.</p>
   <p>But now, touching the false Church. In the type at Pergamus, there was Satans throne, the murthering of <hi>Antipas,</hi> Teachers of the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans: so now, in the <hi>Antitype</hi> at Rome, the Pope inthronized in his supremacie by Satan, who, as it was said, in the Ephesine state, sent out his false Apostles; in the Smyrnean, got a Synagogue and false Church; and here in the Pergamine, a throne: in which the sonne of perdition being setled, murthered many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipases,
<pb facs="27"/> and like a false Prophet (as he is called, Reuel. 20. 19, euen another <hi>Balaam</hi>) taught <hi>Balacs,</hi> that is, the kings of the earth, to cast a stumbling blocke before the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel. That is, hee made them to take his part, to vphold his wicked Decrees, Canons, Constitutions, and Popish doctrines, and to force Christians to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the same; to eate things sacrificed to Idols, that is, to allow of his Antichristian Idolatrie, worshipping of Images, and praying to Saints, and so to commit whoredome against the Lord. Yea, such was his filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that the Nicolaitans doctrine must be held, that is, stewes must bee allowed; and rather then some sort of persons should marry, fornication must bee committed, yea and mens wiues abused, being done <hi>cautè,</hi> though not <hi>castè,</hi> as the old saying hath been among them. These things are so knowne, as the very relation, without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of storie, is sufficient.</p>
   <p>The <hi>fourth type</hi> is <hi>Thyatira,</hi> which is commended for loue, seruice, faith, patience, workes, and that the last workes were more then the first: yet herein faultie, in tolerating <hi>Iesabel</hi> the false Prophetesse among them, which Satan had raised to deceiue the people.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the <hi>Thyatirane</hi> state, following vpon the Pergamine, beginning somewhat before the twelfth hundreth yeere of Christ, when certain godly men prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched openly against Antichrist, and many other things in Poperie. In this time were the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> and other moe,<note place="margin">Tripart. hist. &amp; Henr. Monachus Tolosanus.</note> who shewed the commendable vertues of Thyatira; much charitie, seruice, faith, patience, and good workes. Which state increased more and more in weldoing. For God raised vp <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> and after him <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome of Prage,</hi> which greatly discouered the tyrannie, idolatrie, and filthinesse of Rome, so as the Bohemians would no more be vnder the Diuels throne, as they had been. But towards the end this Thyatirane state passed her beginning and middle state, (in which, <hi>Iosabel</hi> was too much suffered of many) when <hi>Luther</hi> with others
<pb facs="27"/> shaked the Popes throne so, as they made him to quake, and his throne to continue tottering vnto this day. Thus much touching the true Church in this Thyatirane state.</p>
   <p>Now for the false Church in the time of this state, when Satan perceiued how now the game went; that the authoritie of his hellish sonne vpon his infernall throne, could not preuaile any further, but that the Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atirane Angels would breake out from vnder his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: to keepe the Kings and inhabitants of the earth still vnto the sea of Rome, hee taught the Romish Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue to act <hi>Iesabels</hi> part, euen to play the whore, the deceitfull Sorceresse, to paint now out her selfe with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious titles of antiquitie, vniuersalitie, consent, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church, the Catholike Church, the seate of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and many other such paintings: hauing also her false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to sooth her vp, as the onely Prophetesse and true Church that cannot erre; yea to worke miracles, thereby seducing the world, and enticing earthly mindes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit whoredome with her, as is at large set out in Reuel. 13, and 17. Which great Whore there, is this <hi>Iesabel</hi> here, whom (as in chapter 18) the Lord threatens to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy: so heere in this place, to kill her children with death.</p>
   <p>The fifth <hi>type</hi> is <hi>Sardis,</hi> which had workes, and gotten a name of life; but in the generall state was dead, hauing onely a few names, which defiled not their garments. In this Church is no mention of false Apostles, Iewes, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan, Balaam, Nicolaitans, Iesabel, or any such; because this is a type of the Church, and the first of the three come out from Babylon.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the <hi>Sardine</hi> state, the first state of the reformed Church escaped from the Whore; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not here either <hi>Balaam,</hi> or <hi>Iesabel</hi> mentioned, but the Church is considered as being come out of Babylon. This begun with <hi>Luthers</hi> time, and holdeth on to the time of the Harmony of Confessions published. In this
<pb facs="28"/> state the Lutheran Churches got a name, in which they seemed to reioyce more, as being come out from Rome; and were no Papists, then, indeed, sound Protestants. For, as it was said of the type, that her workes were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: so may it bee said of these in this Antitype, that their workes are imperfect, as appeareth by their erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous doctrines, and remainders of Popish deuices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Yet in this Sardine state there was to bee found a few names, that is, some particular Churches, which cleerely quit themselues of Popery, so as their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were not defiled therewith, as is sufficiently well knowne.</p>
   <p>The sixth <hi>type</hi> is <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which hath a doore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before her, and none can shut it; and though her strength be small, yet she holdeth the saith, and word of truth; and to her shall the false Iewes bee made subiect, and doe her all honour, as beloued of the Lord.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> state, and is now that wherein we doe liue, and shall continue to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Rome. In this state, the passage of the Gospell shall be no more letted; the doore is open by the power of Christ, and no man shall shut it: though our strength (in the reason of man) be very little, the word shall be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, til the false Iewes (the Romish Catholikes) be made to stoope vnto vs, as wee haue afore time been subiect to Rome. And lest this might seeme incredible, the Lord saith. I, (that is, he himselfe,) will make them come and worship at our feete: it will be his worke, and not mans: neither shall this be done for our desert, but his own loue to vs will bring it to passe; that they may know, that the Lord loueth vs. This is the <hi>beloued state,</hi> this is the <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphian state,</hi> beginning with the Harmonie and sweete consent of Confessions, wherein brotherly loue should abound: which the Lord grant, euen for his Gospels sake, our peace, and the Enemies destruction.</p>
   <p>The seuenth <hi>type</hi> is <hi>Laodicea,</hi> a luke-warme Church, neither hot nor cold, without all praises.</p>
   <pb facs="28"/>
   <p>The <hi>Antitype</hi> is the <hi>Laodician state,</hi> which followeth next vpon this Philadelphian, after the Church of Christ hath gotten full victorie ouer the Enemies, and shall be inriched with abundance of all things, wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; which is that, which breedeth luke-warmnesse. This state then is not yet. For first, in the <hi>Philadelphian state,</hi> the Enemies must be made to stoupe to vs, which is not yet come to passe: then a tentation must come ouer the world, from which mercifully the Philadelphian state shall be preserued; which I take to be the great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell at Armageddon, Reu. 16. 16. vpon which shall come such an Earthquake and alteration, as was neuer, since men dwelt vpon the earth: and lastly, as is said, in the Philadelphian state y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Church must grow to such wealth after these things, and enioy such peace and liue so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, as shall breed that Laodician condition and state, a time like the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> before the comming of the Sonne of man. But here wee must thinke, that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing state shall not bee so of a sudden; but onely by length of daies, after the Church hath florished glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously for a time in a most gracefull state; as the new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, in a very vnspeakable manner.</p>
   <p>These things being so, this sheweth vs Master <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> errour, in making the Church of England to be ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out by the Church of, Laodicea: when wee see, that these bee no types of any particular Church in any one Countrey or other; but are types generall, of a generall state of Christ his Church. And hee himselfe maketh no such particular application in any of the first types; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, indeed, could hee, nor in this ought hee so to haue done. I cannot but blesse the Lord for very many things in his Commentary vpon the Reuelation; as (be it spoken without offence to any) being the best of most before him, that I haue read of, and a labour praise worthie; but for descending to such particulars, as by the text and words of the prophecie cannot be made good. And yet haue I obserued, that for these particular applications, his
<pb facs="29"/> booke hath been more bought vp, then for the rest of his most praise-worthie labour; and the same places so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, most studied of all other: by some for the pleasure they take in them, but without good ground from the text; and by othersome, to carpe so at them, as thereby they may vilifie all the rest of his paines; by which both the one sort and the other might greatly profit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, if they would lay aside their by-respects in their readings, and giue themselues to the best things, and make a right vse thereof, in his and other mens labours. But as their sinister readings on the one side, maketh thē cunning, perhaps, in their picked places; so it maketh them barten in the rest of the prophecie, which I finde many very ignorant of, and yet can name very readily the fore-mentioned places. But I leaue them both, the one sort to their selfe-pleasing fancifulnes, and the other to their ill-bent carping peruersnes, til the Lord teach them a better way to reade godly mens labours.</p>
   <p>Thus (Christian Reader) haue I, as I promised, shewed briefly, what I thinke probably of this opinion touching these seuen Churches. In which (besides what hath been spoken) may bee obserued a gradation of corruption in euery state, as if one came out of another. As, <hi>defeat of loue,</hi> or decay of zeale, in the Ephesine state, brought <note n="*" place="margin">This is implied in the exhort. Reu. 2. 10.</note>
      <hi>feare of man,</hi> in the Smyrnean. This feare brought forth <hi>a forbearing to deale with the wicked,</hi> in the Pergamine. This forbearing brought a <hi>plaine toleration,</hi> in the Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirane. This brought foorth a <hi>meere conformitie</hi> to a bare outward profession, without the life of religion, in the Sardine. And hereto a <hi>superioritie</hi> being added, and peace obtained ouer Enemies, in the Philadelphian, brought foorth <hi>luke-warmnesse</hi> in the Laodician state. And as these may be noted in the states of the Churches; so here may bee obserued certaine steps, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the working of the mysterie of iniquitie in the foure first Churches. Where we may see, how Satan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun it with <hi>subtiltie,</hi> sending out his wicked seedsmen
<pb facs="29"/> vnder the name of Apostles: he increased it <hi>by hypocrifie, &amp; contempt of the godly,</hi> by making men to professe to be that they were not, and to speake ill of other better then themselues: he inforced it by <hi>Tyrannie,</hi> hauing exalted it into a throne: and lastly, hee did vphold it by <hi>wicked sorcerie,</hi> and all manner of deceiueablenesse of vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, by which to this day that Iesabel of Rome yet remaineth, and so shall, till the appointed time come, of her finall destruction. Which Kings and Princes must at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue by the sword; which Preachers must vrge them vnto by the word; and which people must heartily pray for: which I doe; and so (friendly Reader) oughtest thou to doe, and thou verely wilt doe, if thou beest a sound Protestant, a Protestant in good earnest, which I hope thou art; and if thou beest not, I pray God thou maist be, and so I bid thee heartily fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
