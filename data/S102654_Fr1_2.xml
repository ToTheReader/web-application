   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader, I call thee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing thou wilt reade. And I adde <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolent,</hi> to difference a holy Reader, from a prophane derider. I would be loath to prostitute such Pearls to swine. Publike &amp; powerfull Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the preualent meanes to prepare men for reading: and till that hath made way, reading is no more auaileable, then to the Eunuch, without <hi>Philips</hi> guide to the true sence. Such Readers I call vpon to reade this tractate, that they
<pb facs="3"/> may see the effects of Preaching, not onely in the generall separation which it makes between Pagans and Christians: but in that it deuides betweene Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and true worshippers; and between such as haue the forme, and such as haue also the power of godlinesse: yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene such as haue the power onely in Seeking; and such as Walke familiarly with God; and againe, betweene Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, in respect of the babish; or strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er estate; yea, of the Father-hood that is Christ Iesus. And betweene these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and themselues; betweene the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and flesh; the seede of God, and of man; the right and contrary part; the new man and the old; the inward and outward man; the law of the minde, and of the members; Christ in vs, and Adam on vs; the regenerate, and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part; yea, which is most of all, betweene the soule and spirit: If in these any light be yeelded, let God haue all
<pb facs="3"/> the praise: and I wish thee this benefit, that it may discouer thine election, and make it sure vnto thee; either by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thee to be at least a seeker of Gods fauour, a labourer for reconciliation with God; one I meane in the throbs and throwes of the new birth in that first, generall, or vniuersall Repentance that makes way to remission, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for admission,<note place="margin">Mar. 1.4. Act. 2.37.38 Act. 26.18.</note> into the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by Faith in Christ Iesus. If thou be so wounded, thou maist learne hence where to be healed. If thou be healed, and at liberty, it will warme, comfort, cleanse, quicken, yea, renew thy strength. If thou know all this already, I shall haue thy assent, if more, I expect thy best ayde, and humbly, and as hartily desire thee to perfect so weake begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. It was at first prepared onely for one Congregation; if it become profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to more, it is that I desire. And aboue all things, let vs now pray that
<pb facs="4"/> the Gospell so plentifully Preached, may haue these powerfull effects in these frozen, and benummed times. That <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> may be distinctly Preached, and <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> plainely vnfolded. Now is the time to be industrious, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, for vs of the Ministery; to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those whom Sathan hath scattered: and to comfort sad hearts, and confirme weake hands against approaching try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. Oh let vs redouble our paines in Preaching, Catechising, and especially to put vp feruent praiers, with strong cryes and teares, to him that is able to cause our peace to flourish, Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to spread abroad; Antichrists to decay, and come to nought; to disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage Sathan; that so Gods people may be established to stand fast, fight valiantly, and be more then Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in the euill day. And for mee, the least of all Gods Ministers; I desire your Prayers, that I may make full
<pb facs="4"/> proofe of my Ministery, in redeeming the time I haue lost by Sathans wiles. And so I rest for this time and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</p>
