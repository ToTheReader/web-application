   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL Sir PETER GLEANE Knight; and to his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Wife MAWDE <hi>Lady</hi> GLEANE, <hi>all peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE relation betweene the Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sir <hi>Iohn Suckling,</hi> and you both, partly by the nighest coniunction of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as a Sister; partly by
<pb facs="15"/> connubiall copulation, as a Brother in law, hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me to make enrolement of your names before my booke. The inequality that Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> hath of you both, in state &amp; condition, doth not well admit this my compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of you both: but my trust is, that either in his height of humility, hee will not espie it; or else in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall indulgence pardon it. Though the one hath the Rubricke and red letter in this Calender; yet you both may chalenge of me a Saints roome in the same. Well, because I haue no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but sheets of paper for you, and now, through this declination of my bodie through yeares, I haue small
<pb facs="15"/> hope to set forth any more bookes; I could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise satisfie my minde, than thus to thrust you in by head and shoulders, and as the prouerbe is, <hi>Vna fidelia duos parietes dealbare,</hi> that is, with one Carpēters line to white two walls at once. Accept these two mites I cast into your Coffers, all the good will of body and mind: and accept this little Treatise of me, in the same candid sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of minds, as I collate it on you. Weare it &amp; teare it for my sake, for Gods sake, for your owne sake. I leaue these notes with you, as <hi>Paul</hi> did his Velloms and sermon notes with <hi>Carpus at Troas.</hi> Though you be not now to learne how to die, yet the
<pb facs="16"/> best of all may be contented sometimes to bee put in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had commonly serued at their tables, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other their seuerall and sumptuous seruices, the skull of a dead man, to the end, in the middest of their delicates, to be put in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their death. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> commanded his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine euery morning thus to round him in the eare, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou art a mortall man.</hi> This was such a note in <hi>Hieroms</hi> Meditations, as me thinke, so often as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count his speech, I thinke of the Nightingale, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing got a note that likes her well, delighteth in the
<pb facs="16"/> often trebling &amp; quauering of it. <hi>Whether</hi> (saith hee) <hi>I sleepe, or whether I wake, or whatsoeuer else I doe, me think I heare this voice alwaies soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in my eares, Arise yee dead, and come vnto iudgment.</hi> I reade of an ancient Father that should say, that all his study lay in a booke of three leaues, the red leafe of Christs Passion, the white leafe of the blessed Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Saints, the black leafe of the blacknesse of darknesse for euer, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the damned. The often cogitation of death, cannot but reduce to our mindes the three leaues of this booke; and the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereof cannot but be as a Manuel vnto vs of melliflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="17"/> meditations. There is nothing so effectuall to put an end to sin, as the deuout consideration of the end without end. But an end of this, because I speak at large to you of it in my Treatise following. It remaineth that I giue hearty thankes to you both, for the great kindnesse you haue shewed me in my natiue Citie, vnto which I was called a Preacher in the chiefe Parish thereof, not seeking it, nor once thought of it, whereunto I came chiefly for your sakes, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sensible experience of your long continued loues towards me. During which time of my abode now for six yeares, I haue been much recreated by the
<pb facs="17"/> pietie, humanitie, hospitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, societie; as hauing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes to gratifie you withall, than this paper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the pledge of my vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned deuotion to you both. Thus praying to God for a blessing vpon it and you, I commit you to the gratious protection of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, who shall build further, and giue you an inheritance among them that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied through faith.</p>
