   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hatsoeuer things (sayth Cardane) are of Natures tempering and dighting, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the earth his closet or entrayles, or within the water (being all voide of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and mouing) may well bee deuided and sorted into these foure kinds: Earthes Liquors or Iuices, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Mettalles. Earthes, saith Diascorides in his fift booke (as also the same Author abouesaide) haue their difference eyther in colour, in smell, in sauour, or else otherwise in other their vse &amp; purposes. Proper or pertinent to earths are many &amp; sundrie kindes and sorts, as those which either are in house with them, and fare as they fare, as Sande, which Isidore nameth the lightest carth, as others: or those which are neuer absent from the earth but are intermedled with the water, as Alume, which of some is called the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>arth his salt, as salt it selfe and such like. In earthes are diuers dispositions and farre diuers effects (which thing Diascorides pursueth aboundantly) there are also reckned diuers names of diuers kindes: as that of Eretria a famous Citie in the Ile of Eubea, hath his sett and disposition of colour and shew ashie like, and is in his kinde in operation a sore binder, besides this marueilously colde. And that that is plentifull in Chium in Eubea also (for there is of this name besides this, two more, one a Citie of Caria, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in Rhodes by Triopia) in effect and working
<pb facs="7"/>
is farre otherwise, which being aplied or vsed in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, drieth vp and burneth. The like dissent is in porcions of ground with diuers Inhabitants of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite quarters &amp; Climates, which by commō name they cal earthes, as in Samia is a most tough earth like to that natural Lime which is called Bitumen. But let vs come to Brimstone which is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> father of Mettals: as Mercurie or Quicksiluer their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Brimstone saith Harmolaus in Greeke is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Theion. Isidore will haue it called Sulphur, for that it soone renneth on fire. It groweth (as they both agree) in the y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es of Aeolia betweene Sicilie &amp; Italie: that is best that groweth in Melus a towne of Thessalie which Nicius the Althenien captaine, wanne by famishing the inhabitaunts: Further, it groweth within the Hilles of Neopolitane, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of those which be called Leucogei. Harmolous saith, that there be foure kindes heareof. The first which is called Apuron liue Alume, &amp; this is solide and most massey: almost on clottes, which kind one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Phisicions vse. The second which is called Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus a lumpe like mettall. The third is called Egula vsed commonly of Fullers to make their wull and yarne whight. The fourth which is called Cauton which they vse in the wicke of Lampes of Oyle &amp; Candels. Thus much of this.</p>
   <p>Quicksiluer in Greeke is called ydrargyros, it is as Cardane saith, a certaine water made thick not by heate, bycause it is not hardened, neither by colde, for then should it be eyther in the stone his kinde or else in the mettals: but with most thinne and pure yearthy parte. Whereby it commeth to passe, that it is so heauie, so cold, so bright and cleare, so liquide or renning. It is rather mingled or tempered after a certaine sorte, &amp; that his owne, then congeled or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, for as much as it is both liquide and fluxible. The reason he sheweth why this kinde, (as is also the water) are in figure round: for that they refuse
<pb facs="7"/>
in their felowship drought or any mixture of yearth. It sercheth &amp; seketh to the very bottom of ech thing. It is for his rawe mixture, of some called metal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concret. And as it is with yse which dissolueth, then when it vanisheth away, and doth not vanish till it be dissolued: in like sorte doth this (but more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, all metalles) which doe endure well till that they be molten. Dioscorides saith, that this Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluer is most found in siluer quarries or mines: &amp; is then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ound whē Siluer is digged vp: some wil haue it founde in Mines by it selfe. It is best of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and kept in those vessels that be of Glasse, of Lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e, or of Tin and Siluer. All other matter of whatsoeuer kinde it is of, it eateth through &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth. It is a deadly drincke ouerlading &amp; brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in sunder the inwarde partes with his waight, in remedie wherof many haue taken forthwith Wine and Wormewood, and haue bene holpen.</p>
   <p>But nowe to the second part of our first &amp; former deuision. Liquores or Iuices be Oyles, Wines, and whatsoeuer else is watrie or of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> water &amp; aire. They be called Liquores, for eyther being actually moiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or else by powre &amp; possibilitie. ¶ But now let vs speake somewhat ingenerallye (as we haue of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two) of stones, which supplied in our first deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the third rometh. Of Stones some be more base and common: other some more Precious and rare: but the common Stone hath his name and vocable (if I may so say) hurtfoote, for that it is in mouing from place to place &amp; iourneying the footes pain and griefe. The common stone hath almost infinit kinds which offer themselues euerie where, and therefore to speake of them particularly, or in seuerall sort, it were both tedious and without delight: We mought therefore so haue sorted Stones that wee mought haue made some of them both base, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: other some base, but not yet common: lastly of all some neither base nor common but altogither rare
<pb facs="8"/>
and precious. Of the first sort are all these that are so plentifull with vs and without estimation: of the seconde sort is the Pumelse concrete of froth as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidore witnesseth, verie colde of nature and in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so colde as he sayeth, that it beeing cast into a Hoggeshead of Wine and continuing there a while taketh from the Wine his natural heate. Of the last and chiefest sorte are all such as are of greatest price, &amp; for mens estimation spent on them, called Gems or Iewels: as is that which they call Dionysius stone in spots ruddie: and be speckled round about, as that of Phrygia, in colour wanne: in waight heauie: in vertue hid and secret: as that of Arabie, as white as Iuorie: without spot or specke: as likewise the Sanguinarie which in Greeke is called Amatites which being well chafed and rubbed, bleedeth. After this sort it hath pleased Dame Nature thus to dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in eche kinde, thereby to shewe hir cunning. But now let vs go to the last part of our deuision. Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talles and those of the mettalick sort, sayth Cardane lie close for the most par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e in Mountaines, in maner like to the braunch or body of a tree: and are nothing else but the earths hid &amp; occult Plants, hauing their roote, their stock or body, their bough &amp; leaues, &amp; be in all these partes proportionally dispersed: further he sayth, that both Stones and Mettals haue these foure partes as those that be necessarie to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and increase: a Roote, Barcke, substance, and vaines. The Stone his Roote sayeth he, is eyther some other Stone out of the which it groweth, or else the earth: y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Mettals Roote is eyther Mettal, or some thing Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>allick. Their rinde or barck saith he, doth differ manifestly frō y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rest of their substance, both in outward place and hardnesse. Their vaines doe appeare manifestly. But thus much shall suffise vs to haue spoken of the whole as concerning diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now let vs come nigh eche of them, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally touch the best of them, leauing the rest, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb facs="8"/>
as it is our purpose not to seeke in all things what may be saide of all, but espeically and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallye to see what is in them especiall and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall. And therefore we were about to haue named this our Booke the Aegemonie, of Natures thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> middle Daughters: For that in them all, that is sought forth, than the which there is nothing better, nothing more excellent in all the whole kinde: For such is y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Greeke word, Aegemonia, as if you would say Principatus: The best and chiefest of the whole. Those other two, that is yearthes and Liquores, we purposedly omit: onely couetouse to bestowe and employ in this first Booke (but as briefly as we can, and in order as chaunceth) our trauaile and diligence in inquisition after Stones and Mettals: not that which I would, but that which I may for my poore skill &amp; knowledge: not to teach or shew the learned, howe in this point Nature hath wrought (for that were as the prouerb is, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Sow to Minerua:) But to record &amp; repeate in maner of Storie, with the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of men simple &amp; plaine: And I cannot tell how it may somewhat helpe those that be learned also, If they shall espie and consider but the effect and proofe of these. I therefore desire a Reader not learned, but vnskilfull: yet rather learned then immoderate. For the one wilbe an impudent rayler: the other although hee findeth fault, yet shal a man haue him reasonable able herein to stay himselfe. Thus much of this Preface, nowe to the residue of our matter.</p>
