Or if he laboured to embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish these defects by Art, hee should but doe quite contrary to the Beare; for whereas shee giues forme to her VVhelpe with her tongue, hee with his, should but blemish and deforme the same.

Bodyes, of their owne proper nature being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, receiue light from the Highest Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne: no lesse I thought that this my little Off-spring, and defectiue Traueller, now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes, and taking light from the most bright beames of your Highnesse splendor, vertue, demerits, and greatnesse, and so coast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sailing about by the most benigne and happy aspect of so fortunate a Starre, as also bearing in his Frontispice, the most Honoured Name, happie Prediction, and propitious Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge of so great a Prince, I did, and doe hope, his Muse will become fecond, and the thicke troubled waters of his moorish Fountaine will turne pure and cleare; he prouing such an one, as wheresoeuer hee arriueth, eyther with his fame or his body, a large way will be made him not onely of entertainment and acceptance, but further, of approbation. Neyther can a blast of winde disseuer these my hopes, in that I know very well (most famous Heroe) that your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse imitating the Sunne (which disdaines not euen in the humblest vallyes, to send forth the effects of his vigour and comfort) the care of waightier affayres shall not absolutely exclude those, which many times are thought light and

   <p>VVherefore in all dutifull humilitie of heart, I humbly request your Highnesse, no lesse with your gracious Eye and Countenance, to accept, then with you most noble Spirit and Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to imbrace the same: the which as a slender pawne and earnest (I dare presume to say) euen of sworne and deuoted Seruice, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my most vnworthy Selfe, I offer, and in forme of a perpetuall vow, to your Highnesse the same doe consecrate.
