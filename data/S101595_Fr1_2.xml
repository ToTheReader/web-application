      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y very good cosyn, if I should follow the fancies of some writters, who are accustomed in their dedycations, to glorifie the parties whome they haue chosen to be patrons of their workes, with manye strained wordes and far sought for phrases, then in seeking to praise your beau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty. I shoulde borrow colours for your cheekes, from lillyes and red roses, for your lippes cheryes: &amp; pearles, for your teeth, to figure foorth your chastyty, witt and many other graces, I must seeke out <hi>Diana, Pallas,</hi> the Muses and diuers other helpes both deuine and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and thus whilst I might be curious in blasing the perfections of your body, I should vtterly forget the beauty of your soule. Let this then suffice, your beauty is not borrowed, and therefore without blemish; your body comly neither bumbast nor bolstered, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not holpen by arte, for the giftes and qualities of your mind as they are many, so they are such as may wel bee said to bee both vertuous and godly: and nowe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyenge my selfe in your courtious acceptaunce, I haue made bould to present you with this historye, The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures of <hi>Brusanus▪</hi> reade it at your leasure, and what
<pb facs="3"/> you mislike leaue it and blame me, or blame it &amp; chide me, and you shall see that your gentle rebuke shall be of importaunce, either to make me recante and so to aske mercie, or otherwise to satisfye for my misse as it shall please you to inioyne me: I haue sought to shun vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent tearmes, vnfytting for your modestie, and nowe commending alltogether to be censured by your curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye, I can but wish you that happines that your owne vertue doth worthely merite.</p>
