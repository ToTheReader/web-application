   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, that I haue made these my homely Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismes publike, needs no other reason, but that though the world is furnished with other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, euen to satiety and surfet, yet of those which reduce Christianitie to practice, there is (at least) scarce enough: wherein (yet) I must needs confesse, I had some eye to my selfe, For, hauing after a sort vowed this austere course of iudgement &amp; practice to my selfe, J thought it best to acquaint the world with it, that it may either witnesse my answerable proceeding, or checke me in my straying there-from. By which meanes, so many men as J liue amongst, so many monitors I shall haue, which shall poynt mee to my owne rules, and vpbraid mee with my aberrations. Why I haue dedicated them to your name, cannot be strange to any, that knowes you my Patron, and mee your Pastor. The regard of which bond, easily drew mee on to consider, that whereas my body, which was euer weake, began of late to languish more, it would not be inexpedient (at the worst) to leaue behinde mee this little monument of that great respect which J deseruedly

And if it shall please God to reprieue me, vntill a longer day; yet it shall not repent me, to haue sent this vnworthy scrowle, to wait vpon you in your necessary absence; neither shall it be, I hope, bootlesse for you, to adioyne these my meane speculations vnto those grounds of vertue you haue so happily laid: to which if they shall adde but one scruple, it shall be to mee sufficient ioy, contentment, recompence. From your <hi>Hal-sted. Decemb. 4.</hi>
