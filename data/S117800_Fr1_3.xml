      <salute>MY LORD,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Welve years are past, since this
<pb facs="3"/>
Handmaid of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, made her first addresse to your Lordship, and will not now part from you. Indeed shee can not leave you, and keepe her shame, in that she owes her Essence to you, being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of your He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Vertues. He that Converseth with you need not see her; for yow
<pb facs="3"/>
two differ in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, save in the lively Grace which all Originals have above their Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies. If in your Lordships eye she appeares not faire enough, looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to yourselfe, and forme her anew out of your owne bosome, where Perfections dwell, to which I can not penetrate. I could
<pb facs="4"/>
wish too, you would apparell your owne Childe in your owne Phrase, Gentle, and Sweete as your owne Disposition. My Noblest Lord, it is impossible for mee to flatter you, since I can not out-speake my love, or your Merrit. Hee that thinkes I insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, let him in my hearing take
<pb facs="4"/>
but one Syllable from this, and I heere promise, hee shall finde mee a greater Prodigall of life then of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. I pay my God onely Love, Thankes, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for my Creation; and a greater returne, you can not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, whom hee hath made the Noble meane of
<pb facs="5"/>
my Preservation. Of that due Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you may rest Confident; For I can never bee so unman'd as to bee ungratefull. I can onely say, I am tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorry that (for your sake) I am not Master of many Lifes; not that I desire to live long, but to dye often in your service. I am barred further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
<pb facs="5"/>
by the haste I make to professe my selfe</p>
