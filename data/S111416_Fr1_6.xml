   <head>To all young Students OF THE LATIN TONG (for whose onely help
and benifit this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moedie is published) Maurice Kyffin, wisheth encrease
of knowledge, &amp; finall perfection.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow necessarie, the vse and familiaritie of
<hi>Terence,</hi> is for all such, as would attaine, vnto ripenes in
vnderstanding, readynes in speaking, and right iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in writing Latin:
is a thing, so commonly knowen and confessed of all men, as I shall not
néede any reasons to prooue the same. Therefore, for the better
furthering of those, that as yet are vnacquainted with him, I was the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perswaded, to publish this my Translation of <hi>Andria:</hi> wherein,
whither my labour meriteth, ought, or nought, <hi>Aliorum sit
Iudicium.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>My chéefest care hath bin, to lay open the meaning of the
Author, especially, in all hard and difficult places of this Comoedie, and to
vtter the same, in such apt, plaine, and familiar words, as are most
méete, for this low stile and Argument: for, to handle a meane matter,
with high and lofty phrase, were as great ouersight, &amp; lack of
iudgement as could be.</p>
   <p>Touching the interpretation of some places in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</hi>
I was forced to dissent, from some of no small Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and
specially from one very learned man, who occasioned (in a work that he
wrote) to english certaine dispersed phrases of <hi>Terence,</hi> hath
(without offence be it spoken) so englished some, and namely in
<hi>Andria,</hi> as I am faine to forsake the same, and giue other quite
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary englishe vnto them.</p>
   <p>One of those places in <hi>Andria,</hi> hath these words:
<hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid monstri alunt.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 1. Scen. 5.</note> By
him thus englished: <hi>They bring <pb facs="8"/> some monstrous
creature:</hi> And by mée in this sort: <hi>They cloake some
secret fault in her:</hi> which may bee séene, interpreted to that
effect, by <hi>Eras. Roterod.</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling that place in his
<hi>Chiliads.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>An other place, is this, (conteining the answere of
<hi>Pamphilus</hi> vnto <hi>Carinus:</hi>) <hi>Neque pol consilij locum
habeo, neque auxilij copiam:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 2. Scen. 1.</note>
which he hath thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glished: <hi>I neither haue place to take counsaill,
nor helpe of any man:</hi> and by me contrariwise, as thus: <hi>In good
faith, I am neither a meete man to geue counsail, nor yet haue wherewith to
helpe another.</hi> Now to prooue that I haue geuen it a right English: read
that page in <hi>Terence,</hi> and you shall soone fynde, that of
necessitie the sence must so be ment and taken. Some other like
places I could recite, but these shall suffice for a Say: whereof I
thought good to aduertise you, to thend you may sée, that my
dissenting (in these points) from a man of so great learning and
authority, hath not bin without vrgent occasion.</p>
   <p>One thing more I must note vnto you, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in all
bookes of <hi>Terence,</hi> this place of <hi>Andria, [Num quod tuisperas
propulsabo facile]</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 2. Scene. 3.</note> is noted
thus in the margine: <hi>Speras .j. times:</hi> which, put the case,
<hi>Speras</hi> were here so to bée vnderstood (as I sée no
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why it should) yet neuertheles, the sence remaines still very
lame and vnperfect: vnderstand you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that as <hi>Dauus</hi> in that
Scene, counselleth <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> to make answeare to his father that
he will marry: so <hi>Pamphilus</hi> on the other side, (fearing that would
bée a meane to induce marriage betwixt him and <hi>Philume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>) will
not in a good while geue consent thereunto: thinking (as it séemes)
that by not assenting to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will therein, he shall be quite
freed from marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either her, or any other: for hée hoped that no man
would geue him his doughter in marryage, sith his state and condition was
so to be reiected: wherefore <pb facs="8"/>
      <hi>Dauus</hi> perceiuing whereupon
he most insisted: séekes to disswade him from the same,
and among other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons vseth this: 
<q>
         <l>Nam quod tu speras, propulsabo facile,</l>
         <l>Vxorem his moribus</l>
         <l>Dabit nemo: Iuueniet inopem potius quam te corrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi
sinat.</l>
      </q> Which (for your better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) I haue thus
translated by way of Paraphrase:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>For as for that vaine hope of yours (imagining thus with your
selfe, tush it is no danger for mee to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand my father: No man will
marry his doughter vnto a man of my manners) I shall easily put you out of
that hope: hee wil finde out a poore and mean marriage for you, rather than hee
will suffer you to bee sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>t by
Harlots.</hi>
      <note place="margin">In the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this place. I haue
wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed vpon the iudgement of that learned man Muretus, who expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the same to this effect.</note> By this you may see, that it much better
besitteth the woord <hi>Speras,</hi> here in this place, to haue his owne
naturall signification of <hi>Hope,</hi> than that wrested signification
of <hi>Feare.</hi> I know by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that some Scholemasters are to
seeke in these matters themselues, and therefore no maruayll though their
Schollers be ignorant. And here I remember one Scholemaister aboue the
rest: who (notwithstanding hée were maister of Art,) was yet so
blunt and vnskilfull in <hi>Terence,</hi> as (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other errors) he taught
his Schollers to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this place of <hi>Andria [Non tu ibi
gnatum]</hi> in this sort. <hi>Non tu ibi gnatum <hi>supple</hi>
Negasti:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act 1. Scen. 1.</note> whereas it
manifestly appeareth by the next lyne following, that the woord
<hi>Obiurgasti</hi> is there to be vnderstood, and not <hi>Negasti.</hi>
Moreouer, for that the not well vnderstanding of the Argument of this
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moedie, hath in diuers, bred errors and mistakings: I haue therefore bin
carefull herein to explane the Argument at large vnto you: and withall, to
set downe each particular Argument before euery Scene. Lykewyse, by my
notes in the margine, <pb facs="9"/> you shall be instructed (as occasion
is offered) touching any dowtfull spéeches of the speakers: as
whether they speake vnto him that spake last before, or else to the
audience, or to themselues.</p>
   <p>Thus, haue I for your sakes, bin carefull to dissolue all
dowts, and difficulties, in this part of <hi>Terence:</hi> which, if I may
perceiue, that you doo as curteously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from me, as it is frendly ment
for you: I shal bée more willing (if God spare me life and health)
to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you hereafter in a greater matter: In the meane tyme, I commit
you to God, and my selfe into your good loue and frendship.</p>
