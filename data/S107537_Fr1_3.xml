Sir Iohn Cheeke, a man moste experte in all kind of artes and tongues, and of most exquisite iudgment, prosecuted D. Young his Argument more at large, repeating the 24. verse of the 2. of the Actes, after the old Latine translation, on this sorte: <hi>Whom God hath raised, loosing the sorrowes of hell.</hi> The defendant denied y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Translation, and recited the Greeke wordes, &amp; translated them truly, according to the mind of Peter, on this manner: <hi>Whome God hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, loosing the sorrowes of death</hi> To that sir Iohn Cheeke aunswered thus: he did not loose the sorrowes of Death, but the sorrowes of Hel.<note place="margin">It was God that losed the sorowes of death and not Christ▪</note> Not so, saith the defendaunt: for it is in Greeke, Death, &amp; not Hel. Then called Sir Iohn Cheeke for a Greeke Testament, and founde it euen so as the defendaunt had aduouched. Then said sir Iohn Cheeke, the Disputation is at an ende, vnlesse you will graunt for disputation sake, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
      <hi>Infernus</hi> is taken in this place for the Graue: otherwise I haue no scope to reason: contente saith the defendant: for <hi>Sheol</hi> signifieth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> graue.

For we knowe y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> euery creature groneth with vs also▪ and trauaileth in paiue with vs, euen vnto this time.</hi> The time was spent by this kind of reasoning, and such like, vntill that Doctor Perne gaue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, determining that Christes bodye laye in the graue▪ but his soule wente into hell.
