      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLEMEN: Finding my selfe not deceiued in the hope I had of your
kinde entertayning my collected Lute-lessons which I lately set foorth, I
am further encouraged to publish vnto your censures these AYRES, being
collected and gathered out of the labours of the rarest and most iudicious
Maisters of Musick that either now are or haue lately liued in Christendome,
whereof some I haue purposely sorted to the capacitie of young practioners,
the rest by degrees are of greater depth and skill, so that like a carefull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionary,
as neere as might be I haue fitted my Banquet for all tastes; if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
I shall be distasted by any, let them know what is brought vnto them is drest after the English,
French, Spanish and Italian manner: the assay is taken before, they shall not need to feare poysoning.
You Gentlemen and friends that come in good-will, and not as Promooters into a country Market,
to call our viands into question, whatsoeuer here is, much good may it doe you, I would it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for you: for the rest I wish their lips such Lettuce as <hi>Silenus</hi> Asse, or their owne harts would desire.</p>
   <signed>Thine, <hi>Robert Douland.</hi>
