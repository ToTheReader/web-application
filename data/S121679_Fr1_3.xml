   <opener>
      <salute>To the Christian Reader, grace and peace from our Lord Iesus Christ.</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>THere came out of late (good Reader) two books, from one <hi>Mayster Henry Iacob,</hi> a Priest of the Orders of the Prelates. The first was agaynst his Lord, Mr D. Bilson, now Prelate of Winchester, <hi>concerning Christs suffrings and descending into Hell.</hi> The latter agaynst me by name, and others like mynded, <hi>tovvching the Church and Ministery of England.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now although the Prelates could not well be offended at him, for publishing the former agaynst the doctrine of theyr Church, senig (<note n="*" place="margin">In K. Edvv tyme, about 50. Yeares synce.</note> long before him) <hi>Mr Carlill</hi> a learned man had both publikly disputed in Cambridge, and printed a book, agaynst that error of <hi>Christs descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and that with great approbation of the most godly and learned at that tyme: Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fearing the worst, and knowing the hatred of the Prelates how deadly it is, he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after send forth his other book, in defence of the Churches and Ministery of England. So as whatsoever displeasure his Lords the Prelates conceyved agaynst him for the former, there was now some hope that they might sooner be appeased vpon view of the latter. Or howsoever it should fall out, yet what like lyer way could he take, to make all sure on his side, then by the first book to get the forward Preachers and professors to take his part agaynst the Prelates, and by the other to have both them and the Prelates themselves to stand with him agaynst vs?</p>
   <p>Yet I heare some of his owne coat give out, that he hath dealt very simply, in publishing so weak and raw a Treatise against vs. And true it is in deed, that his Treatise is such. In the publishing whereof, no wisedome hath he shewed at all: vnles it be in this, that he hath thus let all the world see, that against <hi>the errors of the Church of England</hi> there is plenty of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be had and vrged, but not a jote to be found for defence of <hi>theyr VVorship, Ministery, constitution, &amp;c.</hi> For (if you mynd it)<note n="†" place="margin">Yet I deny not but he hath scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red some er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors also in that book.</note> in his book against Bilson, about the question of Christs suffrings and descending into Hell, you shall see proof after proof readily brought from the word of God. And on the contrary, in his book against vs, not onely no such proof, but in stead thereof, eyther his owne assertions and comparisons obtruded vnto vs as oracles: or the Names of <hi>Mr Cranmer, Mr Ridley,</hi> and other dead men, opposed to the word of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God: or putting over his cause to the State to be defended, himself being not able to speak one poore word in defence thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such is his latter book, and such are the grounds of it. A very great and straunge difference, between two books, set out by one and the same man, the one straight after the other, and both of them in matter of Religion.</p>
   <p>If I had first published these Replyes and Aunswers which passed between vs, no doubt but many would have had a prejudice thereof, and all would have thought I had done it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely to shew the weaknes of that cause and falsehood of that Ministery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now when he, a member of that Church, yea a Minister of it, even a Priest of the Prelates crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath first published them: albeit the same thing be done, yet it is both without all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and pretended by him for <hi>defence of the Churches and Ministery of England.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Be it, that he hath not done it so well, as many would have it: yet it is the best he could. And what if he thought by this meanes, eyther to stirre vp some others more able herevnto. or at least to shew his owne good will? Doubtles where there is want of ability, a mans good will is to be accepted. And why should any then misinterpret so good a meaning? If any of the Prelates or others of that Church like it not, they may learne by his example iff not to lay theyr hand on theyr mouth, yet to try if they can plead the cause any better. For worse. I suppose they would be ashamed to do it.</p>
   <p>I had thought in this case I should never have seen any more absurd writing, then <hi>Mr Giffards and Bredvvels.</hi> But now to <hi>Mr Iacob</hi> may they well give place. And iff any can be found of all the Priests in England more sencelesse then these, let such for theyr worthynes (as
<pb facs="3"/>
standerd bearers) be Prelates of theyr chiefest Seas. And as for <hi>Mr Iacob,</hi> seing he hath done his best, let all men be content to beare with his simplicity, who otherwise might well note his folly, for vndertaking ius how the defence of that, which yet in deed he leaveth alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether naked and helples.</p>
   <p>By the <hi>title of his book,</hi> it seemeth he thought to carry away the simple Reader, who eyther could not or would not mynd what should follow after it.</p>
   <p>In <hi>the book it self,</hi> he thinketh his plea to be very good, if he can say for the Ministery and other abominations of theyr Church, <hi>They are errors, but not fundamentall: sinnes against the Second commandement, but not vtterly abolishing from Christ, &amp;c.</hi> And this is the summe of his whole book. A plea which he counteth vnaunswerable. Yet in deed no other, but such as openeth a wide doore for all maner <hi>errors and sinnes</hi> to be receyved and nourished amonge them which themselves shall presume not to be <hi>fundamentall, &amp;c.</hi> So that now theyr Church is ready (when they please) to entertayne agayne the offices of <hi>Abbats, Monks, Fryers, Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Cardinals &amp;c.</hi> the doctrines and practise of <hi>Auricular confession: Prayer in an vnknovven toungue: Prayer for the dead: Seven Sacraments: Holy vvater: holy ashes, holy palmes, holy bread: Creame, spittle, oyle, and salt in Baptisme: Consubstantiation: Deniall of the cup to the lay people: Denyall off vvarres and Magistracy in Christians: Denyall of Mariage in Ministers, &amp;c.</hi> For these and many mo errors of the <hi>Papists, Lutherans, Anabaptists,</hi> it is like they hold not to be <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall,</hi> And therefore although theyr Church receyve them, yet is <hi>Mr Iacobs defence</hi> as sound for them then, as it is now: Neyther may any for these or the like separate from theyr Church, worship, or Ministery, if you will beleev him. Yet note, that for proof of this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you must let them take day. For as yet they can shew you none.</p>
   <p>And what now, if any of the <hi>errors</hi> which the Church of England at this day retayneth be <hi>fundamentall?</hi> What will Mr Iacob say to that? Then agayne he is at a flat <hi>Non plus,</hi> and all his book is not worth a rush, save that it yeelds vs the cause, and graunts theyr Church to be a false Church, ād theyr people to be no true Christiās in that estate. For this therefore see what is sayd in the Treatise hereafter following, Pag. 22. 114. 147. 148.</p>
   <p>What also if <hi>D. Bilson</hi> should aunswer <hi>Mr Iacob.</hi> for that poynt of Christs descension into Hell, as he aunswereth vs for theyr Church corruptions, <hi>that though it be an error, yet it is not fundamentall, yea and that they in K. Edvvards dayes held it, Mr Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, &amp;c.</hi> Would Mr Iacob take this of his word, or think it a sufficient warant for the holding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off, or bynd others to be likewise mynded <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But to let this passe, let Mr Iacob mynd well the estate and practise of theyr Church, but in such particulars, as I have named hereafter, <hi>Pag.</hi> 63. 64. 65. and then let him aunswer as before God, Are they lawfull, or vnlawfull? Are they of Christ, or Antichrist? Of God or the Divell? Lead they to heaven. or hell? May they be found in the Word and Churches of God, or in the Popes Churches, Canons, Portuis, Pontificall? May they any maner way be approved and communicated withall, or are they not wholy and with detestation to be refused and abhorred?</p>
   <p>For aunswer hereof I will wayte, till Mr Iacob reply agayne. And in the meane tyme I will now aunswer what he and his Prefacemaker have already published. Where first I desier the Reader, in both of them, and in <hi>Bridges, Bancroft, Bilson, Hooker, Sutcliff,</hi> and all such writers of that Church, to mynd these three things.</p>
   <p n="1">1. That all theyr reasoning and perswasions are no other, but such as may lead men, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther backe agayne to Popery, or the ready way to Atheisme, or at least to receyve whatsoever religion the Prince pleaseth, so themselues account it not to be <hi>fundamentall.</hi> Thus are they all blynd guydes: Thus do they all teach to continew in sinne. Thus do they shut vp the kingdome of heaven before men, neyther entring in themselues, nor suffring them that would enter, to come in.</p>
   <p n="2">2. That they do even set themselues to carpe at the truth it self, and at the mayntenance and practise thereoff. To which end they vse they care not what objections, and abuse they care not whom.</p>
   <p n="3">3. That they never do so much as offer to bring proof from the Scripture for theyr estate and practise. See the particulars afterward rehearsed, <hi>Pag.</hi> 63. 64. 65. And mynd iff there be any of them all, that in any book they have written▪ have brought warrant for them from the word of God. Onely <hi>D. VVhitgift</hi> made an assay for some of them: but he was so taken downe by <hi>Mr Cartvvright,</hi> as he was glad to lay downe the bucklers, which synce that tyme neyther himselff nor any other durst take vp. And now Sutcliffe himselff can tell them, iff
<pb facs="3"/>
Mr Cartwright have the better hand of D. Whitgift, that then <hi>the Church of England is no true Church of Christ,</hi> and that <hi>there is iust cause to departe and separate from it.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Sut. Engl. b. Pag. 228.</note>
   </p>
   <p>These things noted, I do now come to <hi>Mr Iacobs book:</hi> and first to the <hi>Preface,</hi> which his fellow and frend at a need hath prefixed before it. Where I will for more evidence of the truth and stopping of theyr mouths, first set downe his owne words (as I do also Mr Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs afterward in the book it self) and then make aunswer vnto them. He that made or wrote <hi>the Preface,</hi> subscribeth his Name thus, <hi>D. B.</hi> And thus he beginneth it:</p>

               <p>ABout Three Yeeres since, Maister Iacob having some speach vvith certen of the separation before mentioned, concerning their peremptory &amp; vtter separation from the Churches of England, vvas requested by them, briefly to sett dovvn in vvriting, his Reason for defence of the said Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, And they vvould either yeild vnto his proofes, or procure an ansvver vnto the same. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon the Argument follovving this Preface, vvas set dovvne in vvriting by maister Iacob: vvhich the said parties did send to Maister Fr. Iohnson, being then prisoner in the Clinke in Southvvark, vvho made an ansvver vnto the same, conteyning 3. Exceptions and 9. Reasons in denyall of the Assumption: vvherevnto Maister Iacob Replyed. Aftervvard Maister Iohnson defended his sayd Exceptions and Reasons: And finally, Maister Iacob Replyed againe. As by the particulars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves appeareth.</p>

               <p>Novv having vveighed and considered vvith my selfe, the great ignorance and errors, vvherevvith those of the separation aforesaid, are and have bene lately carried avvaye: namely, to affirme. <hi>That all that stande members of the Churches of Englande, are no true Christians, nor in state of salvation,</hi> And such like most vngodly sentences, vvhich vvould grieve any Christian soule once to thinke on, much more to publish to the vievv of the vvorld: And vveighing likevvise vvithall, the greate vveakenes of manie Christians among vs, vvho (through vvant of experience, or due consideration of things as they are) may easelie by theyr delusions be dravvne avvay into those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors vvith them: I haue therefore: (Asvvell in hope of reclaiming of the said parties from their said extremities, (vvhich novv I iudge the most of them, for vvant of meanes see not:) As also for the staying of others from running into the same grievous excesse vvith them) novv published this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the vievv of the vvorld, vvhich hath line buryed in the hands of some fevv.

               <p n="1">
                  <pb facs="4"/>1. And First, (among the rest) to note this, as a token of the strange and obstinate dealing of Maister Iohnson and others of them, viz. That heretofore, (vntill such time as the Argument here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after mentioned, was framed against them,) they neuer denyed, That the doctrine and profession of the Churches of England, vvas sufficient to make those that bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>That none by the doctrine of the Churches of England can be a true Christian, or saved: But that they all worship God in vayne, Are abolished from Christ, Are Babilonians, Idolaters, departers from the faith, worse then Infidels?</hi> And such like most vnchristian sentences, making them all one vvith the Church of Rome, &amp;c.

So far are we from <hi>crossing, denying,</hi> or any way altering <hi>our former judgement and confession:</hi> as he falsely pretendeth. For which see: <hi>Pag.</hi> 177. 178. 179. 180. 181.</item>
         <item>2. That we do not <hi>hate, contemne, and despise</hi> theyr Church which he calleth <hi>the Mother that bare vs &amp;c.</hi> but inasmuch as we have ben members thereof heretofore (in which respect she was then in deed our Mother) but now do see her to stand in adulterous estate: we do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>plead vvith her:</hi> that she may take away her fornications out of her sight and her adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teryes from between her brests: And we <hi>go out of her:</hi> that we may not partake in her sinnes: and that we receyve not of her plagues. Both which things we do: at the commaundement of God and by warrant of his word: wherein he hath straitly charged all his people, thus for to walk. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18, 4.</item>

            <pb facs="4"/>3. That even of the Church of Rome it may in some respect be said: The doctrines and profession of that Church are sufficient to salvation: <hi>viz.</hi> if the truths they hold be considered alone and apart from theyr errors and corruptions / and these other also not imputed vnto them. For confirmation whereof / see in the Treatise following / <hi>Pag.</hi> 47.

         <item>4. That this D. B. himself hath heretofore held and witnessed, <hi>that the Church of England standeth in Antichristian estate: vvorshippeth God in vayne: putteth from her the truth and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Christ: is in her constitution a daughter of Babylon the Mother of vvhoredomes &amp;c.</hi> and therefore if now he deny it (as he hath begun) is both runne headlong into an intolerable sinne and extremity / without all warrant of Gods word / and besides giveth just occasion to be called a fearfull Apostate / in so wholy falling (and that advisedly / for advantage sake / as it seemeth playnely to appeare) from so notable a truth which before he embraced and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.

               <p n="2">2. Secondly, I would desier the Reader not to be caried away with the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of corruptions, from the Question or matter in hand, (viz. Whether the good doctrines of the Churches of England are sufficient to salvation in them that in simplicitie of heart beleeve &amp; imbrace them, notwithstnding the multitude of errors and corruptions which Maister Iohnson repeateth to the contrary:) But to have an especiall regard vnto the same. Which is the maine poinct that hath &amp; doeth altogeather deceive them, viz. To have an eye to the corruptions in the Ministery, worship, &amp; governement of the Churches of England; But never to looke vnto the nature &amp; force of them, whether <hi>simply</hi> of their owne nature, they overthrow faith &amp; Christianity, or whether they be held of obstinacy &amp; a convicted conscience, or not. Therefore I pray you marke &amp; examine the errors which they reckon vp, (&amp; I desire the same also of them, for whose good especially I published this Treatise.) And after due consideratiō, see if those errors are simply of that nature which before we have noted. If they be not, (as Maister Iohnson nor all the men in the world, shall ever be able to prove they are:) Then do they gett no aduantage by those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, to this purpose which they vrge them for, although they were Thrice as many<note n="*" place="margin">Notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stāding they are to many already.</note> more as they are. Thus they may see how they have all this while ben deceived, &amp; are now to seeke a new for defence of their separation. For I hope they will not say, That every error, held in simplicitie by Christians, doth cut them off from salvation in Christ; Then should they condemne themselves,
<pb facs="5"/>
vnlesse they hold Anabaptisticall perfectiō, which surely though I thinke they hold not simply in their consciences; Yet in their practize (by condemning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers so peremptorily, that jump not even with them in every poinct) they come very neare it: But let this passe; wee see then, That of necessitie, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the errors must be regarded, Euery sinne is not alike. Me thinkes then, that they should affoard that favour to others, which they would have others affoard vnto them: namely, That as they would be accompted true Christians, through their faith in Christ, notwithstanding their errors (which they must acknowledge<note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 19.12. 1 Cor. 13.9.12.</note> are infinite many in this life.) So they should accompt of others in the like case: which even common sence &amp; humanitie would require them to graunt.</p>
               <p>To impresse this thing a little better in their myndes, I will a little turne my speach vnto them. And I would pray them, to call to mynde the many errors &amp; corruptions which they beare with amonge themselves, &amp; lay them &amp; the errors with vs togeather, &amp; they shall see their equality.</p>
               <p>Some of you, hold it vtterly &amp; simply vnlawfull, to sweare by a booke, to prove a will, take an administratiō or sue in the Ecclesiasticall Courts: To shut vp your shops vpon Holly dayes &amp; Festivall dayes, &amp;c. And that these are the inuentions of Antichrist, &amp;c. And others of you, hold these things al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawfull, &amp; have &amp; doe put them in practise, with many other such like things which I could name. But these shall suffice.</p>
               <p>Now the thing which I would frō hence note is this. Can you among your selves beare with such weighty poinctes as these, which you say are the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; traditions of Antichrist that man of sinne, which (in your accompt) are the<note n="‡" place="margin">I vvould you knevv the marks of the Beast a litle better.</note> marks of the Beast,<note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 14.</note> which whosoever receiveth, shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, &amp; shalbe tormented in Hell fier for ever? And will not your stomackes serve you, to beare with the Churches of England, in the like, or rather in far lesser matters? what equitie is there in this? Surely you are (for the most part) so wholy given, &amp; bend your wits &amp; myndes so much, to looke into the estate of other men &amp; other Churches, &amp; to apply the scriptures to them: As you sildome or never look into your owne estate, or apply the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures to your selves: But looke vnto it, it will be your decay in th'end. You may fee then by your owne practize all errors are not alike:<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                  </label> But yet, will some say, <hi>are not all the scriptures &amp; commaundements of God fundamentall, &amp; to be obeyed alike? &amp;c.</hi> Let such consider of this scripture 1 Cor. 3.12.15. amōgst many other: which plainly proveth,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ansvver. </seg>
                  </label> that many errors (so they be not of obstinacy) may be built by a Christian vpon the <hi>fundation</hi> Christ Iesus, &amp; yet be a true Christian still: For which see further Maister Iacobs answer in pag. 192. Againe there are errors <hi>simply fundamētall,</hi> which of their owne nature cleane abolish frō Christ such are the errors of the <hi>Arians</hi> concerning the Deitie of Christ: of the <hi>Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptists</hi> concerning his humanitie: of the <hi>Papists</hi> cōcerning Iustification by workes, praying to, &amp; trusting in Saincts, and such like, which directly raze the very foundation. But that any one, or all, of the errors in the churches of Englād are of this force (as you would seem to hold by all your 9. Reasons) is most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
<pb facs="5"/>
and vngodly to affirme: And as Maister Iacob very well noteth in his answer to every one of them: You therby overthrow the Martyrs in Queene Maries dayes, from being christians, who held the very same corruptions in their ministery, worship, &amp;c. which is now held in England: But say you, <hi>the Martyrs saw ne further.</hi> Then you confesse against your selves, that our errors doe not simply abolish from Christ (as you every where affirme most vngodly, especially in defence of your 7. Reason.) But that if men in these things see no further, they are in the same estate with the Martyrs. Now if you would have your Reasons hold, you must prove the churches of England all conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in conscience, which I hope you will not go about to doe.</p>
               <p>Thus much concerning the nature of our errors, whether they be of obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie, or against the fundation directly: which is the Second note I desier to be observed.</p>

      <label>The Aunswer.</label>
This second note of his, is as foolish, as frivolous, as contumelions, as the former. See it here, in his chaunging of the question between vs: in his lessening of theyr corruptions: in his mismatching of things vnequall: in his abusing our difference of judgement, and reviling off vs: in his perverting the Scriptures, and example of the Martyrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="1">The <hi>Question</hi> between vs, is not as he pretendeth, but thus: First concerning them, <hi>VVhether the good doctrines of the Church of England being joyned together vvith theyr Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian errors and corruptions, do make theyr Assemblyes and people in that estate to be true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Christians.</hi> Then concerning vs, <hi>VVhether notvvithstanding the good doctrines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed in theyr Church, vve may and ought to separate from theyr Antichristian Ministery, vvorship, confusion &amp;c.</hi> That thus the question standeth between vs, themselves cannot deny: though they seek to alter and turne from it here and every where. Therefore do we also desier thee (good Reader) to mynd it well and not to be carryed away (with the view of theyr good doctrines alone) from the question and matter in hand: but alway to have an especiall regard therevnto.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding if the question were as here he pretendeth, perthen both his owne and all <hi>Mr Iacobs</hi> defence of the Church of England is even thus also quite ouerthrowen. For now it appeareth that both of them do vnderstand theyr Argument following, as if it were thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded:</p>
   <p>Whatsoever is sufficient to make a particular man a true Christian and in state of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that is sufficient to make a company so gathered together, to be a true Church,<note place="margin">Mr Iacobs Argument: as it is novv vnderstood by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the multitude of errors and corruptions retayned among them.</p>
   <p>But the whole doctrine, as it is publikly professed, and practised by Law in England, is sufficient to make a particular man a true Christian and in state of salvation. <hi>viz.</hi> such a one as in simplicity of heart beleveth and embraceth it): And the publik Assemblyes of England are in theyr estate companyes so gathered together (that <hi>is,</hi> they do in simplicity of heart so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev and embrace).</p>
   <p>Therefore it is sufficient to make the publik Assemblyes of England true Churches, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the multitude of theyr errors and corruptions.</p>
   <p>The Argument then being thus propounded, as by this note of his it must needs be, marke (I pray you) what followeth herevpon. 1. That as it hath ben propounded hitherto, it concludeth not the Question, but is lame both in the <hi>Proposition</hi> and <hi>Assumption:</hi> as I have noted more particularly hereafter. <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. 10. 12. 13. 93. 97. 99. 106.</p>
   <p n="2">2. That in theyr estate we must mynd, not theyr good doctrines alone, but theyr errors and corruptions withall. Of which there is never a word in all theyr Argument. See it, <hi>Pag.</hi> 3: 4. 63. 171. 172.</p>
   <p n="3">3. That the falsehood both of the <hi>Proposition</hi> and <hi>Assumption</hi> is now so manifest, as the very propounding of them thus, is sufficient to refute them. But for this also see further, <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. 11. 12. 13. Now to speak here but of the latter braunch of the Assumption onely, let them tell vs, iff themselues think theyr Assemblyes and members thereof, do in simplicity of heart beleev and practise the good doctrines of theyr Church. Nay, will they say that the Prelates (the chief officers and pillars of theyr Church) do so embrace them? Not to speak of the many
<pb facs="6"/>
thousands of theyr Church, who do not so much as know the doctrines of truth retayned and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> them. So far are they from professing and practising them in syncerity. And yet are they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as the best, members of theyr Church: partakers of theyr Sacraments: Ministers, Governours, copartners, of theyr Worship, Assemblyes, procedings <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="4">4. Finally, mynd that the Argument and Replyes following speak of the profession and practise of all theyr Assemblyes and members thereof, as they stand according to Law. <hi>Pag.</hi> 3.6. But here he speaketh onely of such among them, as do in simplicity of heart beleev and embrace theyr good doctrines: and therefore neyther of all theyr Assemblyes, nor of all the members of them. See then here how insufficiently they have reasoned, and how deceitfully they have dealt all this while. Besides, the question being of a visible Church, he speaketh onely of such as may belong to the invisible. Which is not to the poynt in controversy. For the profession and practise according to Law (spoken of in the Argument) may be knowen and discerned of men: the simplicity of the heart (here spoken of) God onely kooweth. Thus with wynding in and out, they have lost both the question: and themselves too (I feare) if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne not in tyme and with simplicity of heart vnto the Lord.</p>
   <p>The nature and force of theyr corruptions (derived from Antichrist the deadly enemy of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ) is purposely handled in the discourse following, in the 1. 2. 3. 6. 7. and 9. Reasons. The Apostle saith, that even<note n="*" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.1.2.3.</note>
      <hi>the forbidding of Meats and Mariage, is a departing from the faith.</hi> Mr Beza speaking particularly of the Church of England, and but of fower or five off theyr corruptions, <hi>viz, plurality of benefices, licences of Non-residency, licences to marry, and to eat flesh,</hi> saith that<note n="‡" place="margin">Bez. Epist. 8</note>
      <hi>the Antichristian Church hath not any thing more intolerable,</hi> yea that <hi>the retayning of these is not a corruption of Christianity, but a manifest defection from Christ.</hi> Now if fower or five of theyr corruptions: yea if two of them, be a manifest departing from the faith of Christ: what may we think of theyr whole Hierarchy and multitude of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian abominations retayned among them besides?</p>
   <p>Yet this mans conscience is so feared, as he feareth not to say though they were thrice as many as they are / yet they are not to the purpose for which they are vrged, that is: to convince the Antichristian constitution of theyr Church, and to warrant separation therefrom. Which is as much as if he should say, more plainely, Let the Apostels say of it what they will: and let Christ himself commaund vs never so straitly to separate from such, and to towch no vnclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne thing at all: (1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.2.3. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.) Yet it is to no purpose, if <hi>D. B.</hi> and <hi>Mr Iacob</hi> with theyr consorts agree otherwise.</p>
   <p>The Anabaptisticall perfection then, whereof he dreameth, he may well apply to himself and his fellowes: who will be perfit and holy in theyr way: if theyr owne faucyes perswade them so: albeit they stand in never so many knowen errors: and those also of Antichrist: yea and peremptorily condemne all such as partake not in theyr sinnes: but separate from theyr Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian worship and Ministery / as Christ hath commaunded.</p>
   <p>The way ād cōstitutiō of our Church, is according to the Testamēt of Christ. Weakly in deed ād with much imperfectiō do we walk therein by reasō of sinne that doth so compasse ād cleave fast vnto vs. Neyther was there ever in the world any Churches or Christians: whose case was not such. Nor can we ever look for other vpon the earth. Even the Prophets and Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les have thus acknowledged of themselves. <hi>Esa</hi> 64.6, 9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.12.13. and 103.10. <hi>Iob.</hi> 9.30.31. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 1. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17.18. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.8.9.10. and 2.1.2. But should we therefore be perswaded to abide in knowen errors: or to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy such Churches as stand in the way and constitution of Antichrist? Common sence might teach to reason otherwise, and to discerne between things that differ so much, as these doe, one from another.</p>
   <p>For our difference of judgement in some things, if it were as he saith, yet it would no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing availe them. The<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 11. &amp; 15. and 21. Chap. Rom. 14. ch. 1 Cor. 8. and 10. chap. Phil. 3.15.16</note> Christians in the Primitive Churches differed in iudgement amōg themselves in divers waighty things, some concerning Iudaisme: some concerning Paganis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And synce that tyme:<note n="“" place="margin">See the Acts and Mounuents &amp;c.</note> the Martyrs in Queen Maryes dayes and former ages did in sundry things (and those of great moment, and concerning Antichrists religion) differ in judgement one from another. Should these therefore have approved and taken part with the Iewish, Heathnish, or Popish Churches in theyr other errors: wherein they did joyntly see and witnesse the truth against them? Or will he say: there was therefore no equity in theyr dealing: because they did it not? Or that they were <hi>so vvholy given and bent theyr vvits and mynds so much, to look into the estate of other men and other Churches, and to apply the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to them: as they seldome or never lookt into theyr ovvne estate, or applyed the Scriptures to
<pb facs="6"/>
themselues?</hi> Yet thus absurdly and vnconscionably doth this man reason against vs. Off which more hereafter.</p>
   <p>Now for the particulars here mentioned: the first which is of swearing by a book: is an impudent vntruth: so far as ever I knew or heard of any among vs. Not onely some but all of vs hold it simply vnlawfull to sweare by a book. It is<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 6.13.</note> the Name of the Lord onely, by which all men ought to sweare. Thus we do all professe and practise. In deed about the ceremony of laying the hand vpon the book (thereby to signify that we do take the oath) there hath ben question some thinking that it might be so done, as<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 24.2.3.9.</note> Abrahams servant (when he took an oath) put his hand vnder his Maisters thigh, and persware vnto him onely by the Lord God of heaven and earth: or as Abraham did himself lift vp his hand to the Lord, when he sware or vowed vnto him as we read: <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22. Others thinking that because it hath ben superstitiously abused: and still may nourish in the ignorant the error of swearing by the book: that therefore it should not be done. 1. <hi>Thes</hi> 5.22. And notwithstanding this difference yet all of vs (for the reasons last alleadged) think it better to be left then retayned still, and some other ceremony free from such pollution and daunger (as the lifting vp of the hand to heaven: or such like) to be vsed instead thereof.</p>
   <p>For <hi>probates of vvils, taking of administration, suing &amp;c.</hi> some it may be think: that the things themselves being in theyr nature meerly Civill: and the ordering of them being put over to the Doctors and Professors of the Civill Law: they might thus far be admitted. And this so much the rather: because if all the Popish Hierarchy and Canons were quite abolished out of the Land (as they ought to be) Yet an order for these things notwithstanding were still to be had, and such as are skilfull in the Civill Law might be employed thereyn: aswell as any other of the Common wealth: being by the Prince and Magistrae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s appoynted therevnto. Others thinking / that inasmuch as these causes / Courts / ād Officers are now in theyr estate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Prelates (whose functions are meerly Antichristian) that therefore they should not be admitted at all. Yet here agayne / all of vs agree in this / that the whole Hierarchy with whatsoever belongeth thereto, is wholy to be abandoned and refused, and no spirituall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to be had therewith at all.</p>
   <p>For <hi>shutting vp of shops on Holy dayes and Festivall dayes &amp;c.</hi> (as he doth Popishly terme them): What if some think / that our bodyes / goods / and lands: being subiect in the Lord (as they ought) to the Magistrates, that therefore they may at theyr appointment then shift by theyr shops, as they do on the Queens day or such like solemnityes? And others think, that forasmuch as theyr Holydayes both are popish dayes and popishly vsed for theyr divine worship that therefore they should not shut vp theyr shops on these dayes more then any other. Yet all agree in this, that these dayes (though the Prince commaund it never so straily) are no more to be set apart or vsed for publik worship, then any other of the sir week-dayes: Also, that they need not leave theyr work any more on those dayes, then any other whatsoever.</p>
   <p>These are the particulars he nameth. If he could have mentioned any other of greater moment, you may be sure they should not have ben omitted. Let him know then, that we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o and ought to account it among the mercyes of God towards vs that our difference in jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement is but such: specially considering, that there is so great a mostery of iniquity in the religion of Antichrist, throughout al the parts thereof, as (iff it were possible) the very elect should be deceived: that we are as it were but newly and as per weakly come out of that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Babylon: that the particulars here obiected were never publikly debated and disenssed among vs: that as the Primitive Churches, so ours have ben exercised not onely with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other questions and controversyes but with sundry perverse, hypocriticall, contentious, and fantasticall spirits which have much troubled vs and caused the truth to be evill spoken of: they cree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ing in at first vnder a show of Holones, and so for a tyme continewing, vntill God by one meanes or other discovered them, and in his tyme cast them out from among vs: finally that than the best on earth know here but in part,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9.12.</note> and therefore no marvell, if discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but according to the measure we have receyved, and this measure bring divers in every one, our judgements many tymes and in sundry things differ, vntill God reveale more and further. Besides, that even by this meanes, we might learne to beare one with another: and if any will yet be contentious, that they might know we have no such custome, nor the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God.</p>
   <p>The vse then that we are to make of such difference of judgement, is not that we should therefore abide in knowen errors our selves or approve knowen evill in others, or joyne with any false worship and Ministery in the service of God, or refuse any truth revealed vnto vs
<pb facs="7"/>
(wherein we do all agree in one): but that being delivered out of the power of darknes, which is in the Kingdome of Sathan and Antichrist, we should walk together as children of the light / holding forth the truth wherevnto we are come, joyntly and faithfully, agaynst all adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes thereof, and wayting with pacyence till God reveale further for the more vniting of our mynds wherein any shall yet differ one from another. And this doth the Scripture teach ād warrant vnto vs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5.6.</p>
   <p>But now if any erring in theyr judgement, do not so rest in peace, but will needs proceed further to spread theyr difference among the brethren, to vrge and pursue the practise thereoff, to disquyet the rest that are contrary mynded, to refuse communion with the Church vnles they would ioyne or consent vnto them therein: then are such being first convinced and remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning obstinate, to be further proceded withall by the Church, as the case and theyr cariage shall requier. And that so, as if any be found but to be contentious, they are euen therefore to be reproved, and (if they cease not) to be cast out and removed from the Church: For which see, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.13-18. Thus we are perswaded, and thus we walk and practise.</p>
   <p>Now let the Reader iudge, how frivolous this his obiection is: seing there may be sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things wherein the brethren of the same Church may differ in iudgement among themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and yet notwithstanding walk togeather in the same faith / testimony / and fellowship, wherein God hath vnited theyr mynds: none of them being contentious, to disquyet the Church or the members thereof: and all being ready to receyve the truth, which God by his word shall further make knowen, whatsoever it be. And this I dare boldly say, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall not thus hold and walk, they shall not onely condemne the Apostles, and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches / together with the Martyrs (whose examples I alledged before): but shall fynd by experience that neyther any Churches, neyther so much as two or three men, shall ever be able to keep fellowship any while together among themselves. Note also, that when such please themselves most in theyr contentions and confusions: thinking they do God service the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein / even then they do most displease him, who is the God not of confusion / but of peace / as we see in all the Churches of the Saints. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33.</p>
   <p>This I thought needfull to write (being thus occasioned) concerning this poynt. I could also put him in mynd of the manifold and vnreconciliable difference of iudgement which is in theyr Church and the members thereof, between the Prelates, Reformists, Newters and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo-dexters / with the like. But I will not stand vpon it. Mynd but here what Mr Iacob professeth openly in the Treatise following,<note place="margin">Pag. 69.</note> viz. <hi>that the things vvhich the State of theyr Church holdeth to be Christs ovvne, he holdeth to be Antichrists.</hi> Then which what can be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? Will they now therefore affoard that favour to the Papists▪ Anabaptists / and other Antichristians / which they would should be affoarded to themselves, namely: That as they would be accounted true Christians / through theyr faith in Christ / notwithstanding theyr errours (which they must acknowledge are infinite many / euen in theyr Church-constitution / so they should account of the aforesaid Antichrists and others in the like case? Or will he now say / <hi>that euen common sence and humanity vvould requier them to graunt this?</hi> When he is at leysure to write such an other Preface in defence of Mr Iacob and himself / as he hath done this in defence of theyr Churches / then it will be tyme ynough to impresse this thing a litle better in theyr mynds. In the meane tyme / this may suffice to shew how senceles and vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable theyr reasoning and dealing is.</p>
   <p>By <hi>the marks of the Beast</hi> (spoken of <hi>Reu.</hi> 14.) we vnderstand: the defection and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the man of sinne / spoken of 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.3-12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.2.3. And that for these causes: 1. Because these Scriptures speak of one and the same estate ād apostasy of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Beasts marks are in <note n="“" place="margin">Rev. 14.9.12.</note>this place of the Revelation directly opposed to the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God and faith of Iesus. So that as Gods commaundements for his people / so the ordinances of Antichrist also / for his / are as signes and marks / by which such as receyve or refuse them / may well be discerned and knowen. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.7.9.10.12.16. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.18. <hi>vvith Rev.</hi> 14.9.12. 3. Because the Apostle to Timothy nameth in particular <hi>the forbidding of meats and Mariage</hi> (which are part of Antichrists constitutions) as vndoubted marks of that departure from the faith. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.3. 4. Because the many particulars concerning the apostasy of the Man of sinne / mentioned in the Epistle to the Thessalonians / are such as are both opposed to the ordinance of Christ, and evident marks of the defection and body of Antichrist. 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.3-12. Towching which / and other Scriptures (<hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.1.3. <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Ioh. ver.</hi> 7.9.10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.8.25. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11.) describing also the marks of the Beast, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ:
<pb facs="7"/>
I have written in<note n="*" place="margin">A treatise of the Min. of the Char. of Engl. Pag. 7. 12. 26. &amp;c.</note> another Treatise more purposely: which may there be seen.</p>
   <p>Here I will onely annexe the testimony of one of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> a good while synce / when An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist as yet was but a litle discovered: in respect as synce that tyme he hath ben. One of the Articles against <hi>Iohn Claydon,</hi> who was burned at London in Smithfield: in the yeare 1415 was this, <hi>That the Bisshops licence for a man to preach the vvord of God, is the true character of the Beast, that is Antichrist.</hi> Where marke / that albeit a man preach the word of God / yet he sayth <hi>the Bishops licence</hi> so to do / is the Beasts marke. <hi>Act. and Monum. edit.</hi> 5. <hi>Pag.</hi> 588. <hi>b.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thus much I thought to write here also concerning this poynt. Yet if D. B. or Mr Iacob for him (who do both of them receyve and carry daily the Beasts marks in theyr fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads and hands, and therefore may well have sure knowledge thereof) can shew them any better from the word of God, I shall willingly heare it. And seing that here he wisheth we knew the marks of the Beast a litle better / we do also entreat him (if his leasure and ability will serve) to make them a litle better knowen vnto vs.</p>
   <p>But I doubt, it will now be found in him and the rest of them at this day: as Mr Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley (that faithfull Martyr) found and complayned in his tyme: saying, I feare me (nay it is certayne) the World that wanteth the light of the Spirit of God (for the world is not able to receyve him / sayth Iohn) neyther doth nor shall know the Beast, nor his marks, though he rage cruelly and live never so beastly, and though his marked men be in number like the sand of the sea. <hi>Act. and Mon.</hi> 5. <hi>edit. Pag.</hi> 1618. <hi>b.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To conclude this matter then / may I not well returne <hi>theyr ovvne speach</hi> vpon themselves and say, Surely they are (for the most part) so wholy given, and bend their wits and mynds so much: to look into the estate of other men and other Churches: and to apply the Scriptures to them: as they seldome or never look into their owne estate, or apply the Scriptures to themselues. But let them look vnto it, it will be theyr decay in the end.</p>
   <p>That <hi>all errors are alike</hi> is a fancy of his owne. We did neuer imagine it. We know and professe otherwise. To give but one instance, The Iewes, the Arrians, the Papists, the Mungrell-protestants, the Lutherans, the Anabaptists <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do all of them at this day erre very greatly concerning the Person or Office of Iesus Christ, who is<note n="“" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note> the onely foundation of the Church. Yet we know, theyr errors are not all alike. Some are greater, some lesser: some in one poynt, some in another. But this we say, that all theyr errors are such, as every faithfull Christian ought to eschew them, and to witnes the contrary truth against them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, as they will aunswer to God at that day.</p>
   <p>His obiection likewise of <hi>all the commaundements of God to be obeyed alike &amp;c.</hi> is of his owne coyning. I do not think that ever he heard it of any of vs, or that he did ever see it in any of our writings. If he did, he may shew it. We know / that Christ speaking of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of the first Table: sayth: This is first and the great commaundement. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.39. And that therefore the du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>es of the second table must alway give place to the first / as to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (<hi>Math.</hi> 10.37.39. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.24.) Except, when the mercy commaunded in the second / is to be preferred before the ceremonyes required in the first, and such like. <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.6. <hi>vvith Mat.</hi> 12.1-7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.14.17. We acknowledge also there is difference in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of the first Table, when they are compared together one with another. And in the commaundements likewise of the <hi>Second.</hi> And consequently therefore in the dutyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in both: for our obedience. These things are so well knowen, as they may learne them of very children.</p>
   <p>Note withall, that we are bound to keep not onely the greatest of the commaundements of God, but even the very least (notwithstanding any perswasion / prohibition / or persecution to the contrary) because they are all from one and the same God: with commaundement to obey them all and every one: and that vnder payne of damnation. Therefore also Christ sayd / The Second is like to the first and great commaundement / <hi>Math.</hi> 22.39. Now iff any in this sence do say that <hi>all the Scriptures and commaundements of God are fundamentall and to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed alike,</hi> it may well be vnderstood according to that saying of our Lord Iesus before alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.38.39.40. Otherwise there is difference to be put (as is aforesaid) in the dutyes both of the two Tables themselves / and of the severall commaundements of each of them.</p>
   <p>His inserting of these two words / the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>fundamentall</hi> (when he saith, <hi>that all the Scriptures and commaundements of God are fundamentall and to be obeyed alike</hi>) I will not now further stand vpon. It seemeth he did it for some evasion: Which I doubt not but
<pb facs="8"/>
his next Reply (if he be not already at a <hi>Non plus</hi>) will make more manifest. Till then / let this suffice which hath ben said.</p>
   <p>The place of (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12.15.) both he and Mr Iacob do misvnderstand and misalledge. The Apostel speaketh not there / of any false doctrine or errors built vppon the foundation / but of the entising speach of mans wisdome and vayne eloquence off words. By which it came to passe / that although they taught nothing but the truth and so buylt vpon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation Iesus Christ / yet they did it vnworthily / and not as became the simplicity of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Christ. That this is the true and playne meaning of the Apostles speach / appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thus:</p>
   <p n="1">
      <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. &amp; 3 chap.</note>1. First / by comparing together the second and third chapters of this Epistle: Where all may see / that he speaketh not a worde of any error or vntruth that was taught, but of the simplicity (on the one hand) and of the ostentation of speach and humane wisdome (on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) which was vsed by the Teachers of Corinth in theyr building vpon the foundation / that is / in theyr teaching of the truth of Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p n="2">2. Secondly / for that the very terme<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.10.</note> here vsed by the Apostle / concerneth directly the <hi>maner</hi> of teaching or building vpon the foundation / not the <hi>matter</hi> taught or built vpon it. His words are these: <hi>Let euery man take heed</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>hovv he buildeth vpon it.</hi> The word which he vseth here is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>hovv,</hi> for the manner: not <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>vvhat,</hi> for the matter.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Thirdly / because for the matter taught / the Apostle doth els where give another rule concerning all teachers of errors and false doctrine (though they should be Angels from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) <hi>viz.</hi> to give them no countenance at all / neyther to have any communion with them / but to separate from them / and hold them accursed. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6 3.4.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17.18: 2 <hi>Ioh ver.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18.19. Note also / that of the teachers spoken of to the Corinthians / the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith <hi>themselues shalbe saved:</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.15.</note> albeit <hi>theyr vvork</hi> (of affected eloquence) <hi>do burne</hi> and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish away as smoke: Whereas contrarily of the teachers of erroneous doctrine he saith, They <hi>haue not God: neither serve the Lord Iesus: but are accursed.</hi> For proof whereof / see the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res here alleadged before.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Finally / because the Apostle writing els where to the same purpose and to the same Church of Corinth / doth himself playnely declare that this is his meaning: As namely in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.13.17.19.20.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.3.4.5▪ 6 For which cause it may well be thought / that the Spirit of God in this place did in great wisdome and of purpose compare theyr entising speach and vayne eloquence / to <hi>vvood: hay: and stubble:</hi> which are combustible ād cannot abide the tryall of fier: that whereas they did much glory in this course / they might euen by this resemblance now see and consider the vanity thereof / and how vnworthy it was to be suted with the foundation / which is Iesus Christ. As on the contrary / he resembleth the teaching of the Gospell in simplicity and playne evidence of the Spirit / to <hi>gold and silver</hi> / which will abide the fier / and to <hi>precious stones</hi> which are of great valew: to teach them by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison / that albeit such maner of teaching seemed base in outward sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap> and were of small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with men / yet it is in deed precious / such as will endure the tryall / and is accepted with God / as being the right handling of the word / and sutable with the foundation / Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p>Thus much I thought to write here / for the clearing of the true sence and meaning of this Scripture. Which by reason of misunderstanding / is perverted not onely by the Papists to mainteyne theyr feyned Purgatory: but by many Protestants also / partly to vphold such er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors annd doctrines as they hold against the word of God / partly to defend theyr estate / not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that such errors and false doctrines be retayned among thē. Now by this which hath ben said / the Reader may see / both how ignorantly this Scripture is misapplyed by Mr Iacob and his Scribe: and that being disappoynted hereof / they have not so much as the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any one Scripture to alledge in defence of theyr Church-estate. But it comes well to passe (as<note n="*" place="margin">Beza in 1 Cor. 3.10.</note> one sayth of Purgatory-fyer) that theyr <hi>Church constitution</hi> is built of stubble wood and hay / so as the flame of God being now kindled agayne / there is no marvell that in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory it is for the most part already set on fyer.</p>
   <p>For Mr Iacobs aunswer in <hi>Pag.</hi> 192: As also for the exceptions he bringeth here / of <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors simply fundamentall &amp;c. of the Martyrs: of the Church of Englands conuiction: obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy &amp;c.</hi> For these (I say) because they are all borrowed from Mr Iacobs Replyes follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing (whither himself referreth vs) I have there purposely handled them / and therefore will I not here stand vpon them / but thither refer the Reader for them. As namely / for Mr Iacobs Reply in <hi>Pag.</hi> 192. to the aunswer therof in <hi>Pag.</hi> 203. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>These are the very mayne grounds, on vvhich theyr separation is builded, vvhich being duly vvei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghed vvith the scope of the text, you shall very easely finde, that not one amongest them all, vvill hold in proportion vvith this time, nor beare the separation they gather from them. First because either they concerne such times and states as the people that liued in them, vvere professors of, or subiect vnto, open grosse Infidelitie, &amp; either Heathē or Antichristiā Idolatry, not in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler customes &amp; outvvard ordinances, but in the vvhole body and povver of Heathen &amp; Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion, such as could not possibly stand vvith true faith and religion at all: VVhich can not be said of these times &amp; present standings, vvithout open vntruth. 2.

<pb facs="9"/>
that sort, they affoard no such absolute separation at all but only from <hi>wilful / rebellious / and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate</hi> disobeyers, &amp; euill speakers, and from apparant grosse corruptions, but not from the vvhole publike body of those assemblies, nor from the lavvfull and good things vsed in such times ād stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings as have not vvholy svvarued from the faith, though there vvere divers grievous faults, both in doctrine and practise, suffered among them. As by the example of the Ievvish Churches in the times of the Prophets, especially of Christ himselfe, may plainly appeare. The Euangelistes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke mention in diuers places, <hi>That they worshipped God in vayne / teaching for doctrine mens preceptes. They made their proselites the Children of Hell two fold more then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They made the commaundements of God of none effect by theyr traditions / such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in Christ they excommunicated.</hi> &amp;c. Yet vvere they a true Church, notvvithstanding these and many other grievous enormities: vvith vvhom Christ himself and his Apostles, had communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fellovvship, sometime in those good things that vvere among them. And so might they vvith the Churches of England, vvithout iustifying or allovving these things, vvhich they see to be euill. All vvhich things doe more fully appeare in the conference it selfe, as it follovveth hereafter.</p>

May it not fitly be said and applyed to <hi>D. B.</hi> in this case / which Christ hath spoken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all such: How sayest thow to thy brother / Suffer me to cast a mote out of thyne eye / and behold / a beame is in thyne owne eye. Hypocrite / first cast the beame out of thyne owne eye / and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brothers eye. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.4.5. Even the very last thing / yea and all the show from Scripture that he brought for defence off theyr Church-estate / what is it els / but the wresting and misapplying of that Scripture to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians (<hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12.15.) as before may be seen in his Second note? And now agayne for those Scriptures which here in his Third note he setteth downe eyther as alledged by vs / or noted by himself out of the Evangelists for defence of theyr estate: what other thing doth he in aunswer of the one / or allegation of the other / but onely pervert ād misapply them / against the true sence and purpose of the Spirit of God therein? Yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>.</hi> 19.1. Therefore will I here both shew the vprightnes of our walking / and withall convince the foolish abuse of his lips.</p>
   <p>First then note / that there are three things specially for which we alledge these and many other Scriptures which he concealeth. Namely / 1. That in the constitution of every true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church / even from the beginning of the world / this hath alway ben one speciall thing to be observed / that it was separated from the world and abominations thereof. Neyther other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise could there ever be any true visible Church vpon the earth. And yet with the Church of England it is not thus / in theyr estate.</p>
   <p n="2">2. That the Church of England now standing in confusion with the world / and subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Antichrists Ministery / worship <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we therefore (as all other the people of God) are bound to separate and depart from it / because otherwise we could not but partake in her sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / and so be subiect also to receyve of her plagues.</p>
   <p n="3">3. That being thus separated from them / we are bound to ioyne to the true Church of Christ in the communion of his Gospell / to keep all his ordinances / whatsoever he hath in his word prescribed for his Church / notwithstanding any persecution or exception of Man to the contrary.</p>
   <p>These three things are so evidently and vndeniably taught in these and the like Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res throughout the book of God / as it is straunge and lamentable that any having them thus applyed / should yet be so piteously blynd as not to see it / or so impudently bold as to deny it, For other the like Scriptures therefore / teaching the same things / see these also / <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.1.4.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.12-16. <hi>et</hi> 35.2.3. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.22.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.25.26.27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.8.9.24.25.26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.5.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.4.5.6. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.3.5.6.11. <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.30. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 119.21.113.128. <hi>Esa.</hi> 2.2.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.12-18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 44.5. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.18 <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.12.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 50.4.5.8. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.44. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.26. <hi>Micah.</hi> 2.10 <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.21.22.23. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6.7.8.12.13.14. <hi>ct</hi> 2.8.9.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.16.17.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.1 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41.47. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.26.27.28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.4.7.34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6.7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.5.27.28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.2. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8.22.23. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.3-12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3.4.5.13.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1.2.3.13.14.15. 2 <hi>Ioh. ver.</hi> 9.10.11. <hi>Iude, ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.9.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.

9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.4.6. and 21.7.8.27. and 22.10-19. The words of these and the like Scriptures / I need not here set downe. The godly Reader will search them (I doubt not) after the example of the Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eans / so much commended by the Spirit of God / <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11.</p>
   <p>Next I aunswer / that the Apostles do themselues so alledge and apply the Scriptures to the matters which they handle / as we after theyr example do in this. For proof hereof / see but these places following, and mynd them well, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. and 9.9.10. and 10.7-18 and 14.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.25.26.27, 28.29. and 10.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 13.14. and 3.7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 12.26 29. and 13.2.5.6. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.8.9.10.21.22.23. and 4.5.6. and 5.16.17.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. and 2. <hi>to</hi> and 3.20.21. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>ch. Ioh.</hi> 19.36. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.12.15. <hi>Iude, ver.</hi> 5.6.7.11.14.15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.8. Now compare herewith the places in the old Testament from whence these are borrowed / and you shall fynd that divers differences might be noted between the one and the other. Shall we therefore say / that they are wrested or misapplyed by the Apostles? God forbid. To give an instance or two. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle Paul alledgeth that against fornication / which by Moses was first spoken of lawfull mariage / 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>compared vvith Gen.</hi> 2.24. And in the same Epistle / albeit the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians which were of the Church there / did not worship God by the Idols of Corinth / but did onely eat at the feasts in the Temple / which were after the sacrifices done: yet the Apostle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth agaynst them the example of the Israelites, who both made a golden calfe / and by it worshipped the Lord. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. and 10. <hi>chap. vvith Exod.</hi> 32.5.6. And the Apostle Iames / speaking but of one particular breach of the Law / <hi>viz,</hi> the accepting of mens persons / alledgeth and applyeth against it, the summe of the whole Second Table. <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.8.9.10 <hi>vvith Let.</hi> 19.18. And Iude / agaynst Apostates / Schismatiks / disbounders of themselues / raylers / murmurers / malicious / covetous / presumptuous / lascivious / hypocriticall / vnstable / discontended / and such like persons / alledgeth the Prophecyes / Scriptures / examples / which were before / of them in Enochs tyme / of the vnbeleuing Iewes / the Sodomites / evill Angels / Cain / Balaam / Corah / <hi>&amp;c. Iud. Epist. vvith. Gen.</hi> 3.1. <hi>and</hi> 4.3-16. <hi>and</hi> 19.1-25. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. <hi>and</hi> 16. <hi>and</hi> 22. <hi>chap. &amp;c.</hi> Now in these / as in the rest and many other so alledged in the Scriptures / may divers differences be observed. Yet are they all notwithstanding / fit and pertinent for that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they apply them. Neyther can any be ignorant / but that there will be difference eyther of time / place / cause / sexte / persons / things / maner / or such like circumstance / in any allegations / and yet they be pertinent nevertheles.</p>
   <p>It is not materiall then / though some differences might be noted between the case of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land / and theyrs of whom those Scriptures speak: seing notwithstanding they do fitly prove that / for which they are alledged. Let the Reader also mynd here / an old Popish shift / whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby they labour to turne away the evidence of any Scripture that is vrged against theyr cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions / <hi>viz,</hi> by noting some difference between theyr case and such as the Scriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged speak of. This you may see every where in theyr Rhemish notes on the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment / and in all the rest of theyr books and defence of theyr Church and religion.</p>
   <p>But now further / to make the abuse of his lips yet the more manifest, marke that the very Scriptures here mentioned by himself / speak not onely / <hi>of the vvhole body and povver of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Antichristian religion</hi> (as he pretendeth) but of every particular ordinance and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane thing belonging therevnto. For thus they speak expressely. <hi>Tovvch</hi> no <hi>vncleane thing: Keep all myne ordinances and all my iudgements: Be ye cleane: Partake not in her sinnes, &amp;c.</hi> By all which is most plainely forbidden all maner of partaking not of the whole onely / but of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parcell of Antichrists or any other false worship whatsoever.</p>
   <p>As to the second difference which he noteth here / of <hi>theyr vvilfulnes: rebellion: obstinacy: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking vvith the lavvfull and good things vsed among them &amp;c.</hi> it is handled and answered in the Treatise following. <hi>Pag.</hi> 42. 43. 88. 108. 130. 132 161. 170. 171. 175. 180.</p>
   <p>The particulars which he citeth out of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> towching the Iewes / are the speaches and testimony of reproof / given vnto them by Christ / whē now he threatned to take away from them his kingdome / because of those sinnes and other the like among them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. This man himself knoweth / we never doubted but true Churches might fall into errour / and the members thereof walk corruptly (in which respect they are subiect to be reproved) And yet notwithstanding the Church constitution and functions be lawfull and ioyned withall / vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they refuse the voyce of Christ and will not be reclaymed (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 3. <hi>Math.</hi> 21. <hi>and.</hi> 23. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>and</hi> 13. <hi>and</hi> 17. <hi>and.</hi> 28. <hi>chap.</hi>) Wherevnto when once they come / then are all taught to separate and save themselves from such a froward generation. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.40. <hi>and</hi> 13.46.47. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.9. <hi>Esa.</hi> 8.12.-16.</p>
   <p>Now if we may separate from such as have ben true Churches / when they so fall into sinne
<pb facs="10"/>
and persist as is aforesayd / notwithstanding that otherwise they professe many Doctrines of truth: how much more may and ought we to separate from all false Churches which stād in the apostasy of Antichrist / that Man of sinne / howsoever they professe some truth withall? 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.3-12. <hi>vvith Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.44. But of the difference both of the estate and dealing with true Churches and false compared together / as also of the weaknes and falsehood of this mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reasoning which here he vseth / I have other where spokē sufficiently / both in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise following to which he referreth vs (<hi>Pag.</hi> 92. 161. 195.) and in another already published <hi>viz.: A Treatise of the Ministery of England: Pag.</hi> 45. 61 62.</p>
   <p>Note withall / that none of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> / neyther any other Scriptures do shew / that Christ or the Prophets did at any tyme communicate with the Iewes in any evill / but alway reproved them. Whereas it is not possible / that any should communicate with the Church of England (though it be in theyr best things / even of the Ministery of the Word / Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments / Prayer / etc.) but they must needs partake in evill: As namely / with the Hierarchy / Leiturgy / confusion / and other sinnes of Antichrist / that sonne of perdition. Let him shew the contrary in any one thing among them / iff he can. And of this also see more hereafter / <hi>Pag.</hi> 170. 171. 180.</p>
   <p>Finally / let him tell vs if he have said any thing here / which they in K. Henry the eight his dayes might not have alledged / when the Popes supremacy with much of his religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides / was cast out of the Land / and yet they oppugned the truth in many things / and became drunken with the blood of the Martyrs notwithstanding.</p>

If vve should examine the same, vve should finde that it vvas as greatly altered and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, as is the constitution of the Churches of England. Tvvo high Priests having by simonie crept in at once, vvhich vvas vnlavvfull and contrarie to Gods ordinance, (notvvithstanding their gloses in their other<note n="‡" place="margin">9.

Pag. 50.</note> (Ergo not tvvo as here vvere) the rest vvere indeed inferior to him: And yet amongst those, there vvas a chiefly also, vvho vvere called, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Second Priests, or Priests of the Second order. 2. King. 23.4. and sometimes chief Priests, Math. 27.1. These Scriptures being compared vvith those in the margin by them cited; doe make it more plaine. Novv, if the chief offices, vvere so corrupted and altered through couetousnes, as the Histories make mention: It is not likely, that the inferior offices did remaine sound, but vvere asmuch or more altered: The Priests (generally) being such couetous vvicked persons, theyr offices beeing very gainefull: and besides they liuing vnder the authoritie of the Heathirish Romans, vvho ruled ouer them. All these things considered, it is very likely that the offices &amp; outvvard consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution (on vvhich they so much depend) vvere vvholy altered from the right institution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vvould make nothing for them. As for theyr allegation of Mat. 23.1. VVhere they say, Christ testifieth that they had true offices, by saying they satt in Moses chaire: It vvill not help them, any vvhit at all. For Moses vvas no Priest, as they vvere, but a Magistrate: and therefore Moses chaire must be vnderstood of somevvhat else: &amp; themselves<note n="‡" place="margin">Mr Barrovv &amp; Mr Greē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvood, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Letters and Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> have vnderstood it heretofore, of Moses doctrine.</q>

Do not they erre that imagine evill? And doth not a deceyver speak lyes? <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.22.25. What then may we think of him that counteth it a small thing to lye against Man, if he do not also open his mouth against heaven and give the lye to the holy Ghost himself?

   <p>Against vs (and I feare against his own conscience) he forgeth a lye / when he sayth, <hi>vve do vvholy depend on their outvvard constitution &amp;c.</hi> For he knoweth / we obiect against them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides

and separate from them, for much false doctrine publikly taught and mainteyned among them: and for theyr wretched persecution of the truth and Martyrs of Iesus. (Therefore do we not wholy depend on theyr outward constitution: From which (it is to be noted, that) he severeth theyr publik doctrine, as himself sheweth in the next Section: and so therefore here we speak accordingly.) And that he knoweth these things / appeareth both by this Treatise first published by himself, where we have declared it in divers particulars (<hi>Pag.</hi> 66. 108. 157. 158 159. 160.) and in that himself hath seen and alleadgeth in this very Section / another treatise, written in answer of Mr <hi>A.

   <p>To the holy Ghost he giveth the lye / yea and maketh Christ our Lord a sinner, in that which here he speaketh first of <hi>the constitution of the Ievvish Churches.</hi> For the Scripture teacheth that the constitution of that Church was a true one / and that Christ did himself / communicate therein with them.

How shameles then is it to say as here he doth, that theyr constitution was as greatly altered and corrupted as that of the Churches of England, which to this day stand confused of all sorts of people (aswell the prophanest as the best among them) and have no other Ministery or Leiturgy, but such as they have receyved from Antichrist the man of sinne, and from Babylon that mother of whoredomes and abominations of the earth? <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.5.</p>
   <p>And further, if the Iewish Church had ben thus corrupted (as he feareth not to affirme) how could Christ have communicated with them as he did, but he must needs have sinned ād that highly against the Law of God: <hi>viz.</hi> if he had (as it is now in England) joyned to such a Church as were vnseparated from the World: or had partaken with a false Ministery: or had sent others to a straunge Priesthood and Service: or had approved by word or deed any other ordinances then those which God had commaunded <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Scribe then must eyther approve the Church-constitution of England by the word of God: or els confesse that it and the Iewish Churches are in this poynt nothing alike, or (if neyther of these) that then Iesus Christ was a sinner: Of whom the truth itself and work of our redemption testify / that he knew no sinne at all, but was like to vs in all things / sinne excepted. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.26. This man then doth thus also both blaspheme the Sonne of God / and make the holy Ghost a lyar.</p>
   <p>But there were (he saith) <hi>tvvo high Priests at once, vvhereas by the Lavv of God there should be but one.</hi> 1. If it were so, albeit thus they offended in the number yet still there was that office and function of Priesthood which God had ordeyned / not a new one of mans devise as is the whole Hierarchy of England / from the hyest Archbishop to the lowest Parish Priest. And so there is no comparison between these two.</p>
   <p n="2">2. This was the personall sinne of the men / not the constitution of that Church / neyther of the Offices wherein they were. See it in another example: Iudas an Apostle of Christ / yet betrayeth him. Doth it therefore follow / that his office of Ministery wherein he was set by Christ himself / was vnlawfull? Nay / that was the sinne of the Man not of the Office whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein he was. What is this then to the question in hand / when as the Ministery of England is charged to be straunge / vnlawfull / false / in the very offices and functions thereof? Yea and this man himself doth here by the whole course of his speach graunt as much.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Is there any thing here said for the Priests and constitution of the Church of England / which the most popish Priests / Prelates / Monks / <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may not aswell alledge for theyrs? Is theyr Ministery or constitution therefore such as man be ioyned withall?</p>
   <p n="4">4. See how straungely these men forget and contradict themselves.<note place="margin">T. G. first Reply. Pag. 83 84.</note> Mr Cartwright wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against D. Whitgift saith / If <hi>the vvhole practise of the Church vnder the Lavv be looked vpon, it shall not be found that any other ecclesiasticall Ministery vvas appointed then those orders of hy Priests and Levites &amp;c. vvhich vvere appoynted by the Lavv of God.</hi> And further, <hi>that as
<pb facs="11"/>
it vvas not lavvfull to bring in any straunge doctrine, so vvas it not lavvfull to teach the true do &amp; ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, vnder the Name of any other function then vvas instituted by God.</hi> Yet this man with an who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res forehead shameth not to perswade, <hi>that the offices and outvvard constitution of that Church vvere vvholy altered from the right institution.</hi> Thus the truth of God is with them become Yea and Nay / so as they may seem to say any thing for defence of theyr Churches estate.</p>
   <p n="5">5. And from whence proveth he that which here he speaketh of <hi>tvvo hy Priests at once &amp;c.</hi> Doth he shew it from the word of God? No. But he saith / <hi>the Historyes make mention</hi> of it. So then from the Scriptures he can not bring proof for that he saith. For indeed by them we fynd (euen in the corruptest tymes) but one at once to be by Priest: Albeit that of old also there were two which were chief over all the rest, the one being principall / the other Second. See for that of one hy Priest in such tymes / these Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.57.62.63.65. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.53.60.61.63. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.50.54. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.49. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.13.24. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.3.4.5. And for the other poynt / these, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.18. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.2.3. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.17. <hi>vvith Numb.</hi> 3.32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.16.18. Yea this is so cleare and certayne / as for any thing written in the Scripture thereahout, this man is driven himself (when he looketh thither) to confesse and confirme it too: As here may be seen in Scriptures which himself hath noted downe.</p>
   <p n="6">6. Why also doth he not name <hi>the Histories that mention these things,</hi> together with the Persons / time / place / and such like circumstances as might give light to the poynt in hand? Is it because he would walk in the dark / and hide the truth as much as he can? Or is it for that he seeth / if these particulars were mentioned / there might yet more be answered concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter?</p>
   <p n="7">7. Finally / what maner dealing is this / when he knoweth that I have other were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of this very poynt (yea and here alledgeth both the<note n="♣" place="margin">Ansvver to Mr H. Pa. 50</note> book and page) yet not to aunswer any one of all the particulars: which there I haue noted out of the Scripture / towching this question? To that Treatise therefore (till it be aunswered) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> may and do refer him in this behalf.</p>
   <p>Next where he saith, <hi>If the chief offices vvere so corrupted and altered through covetousnes, it is not likely that the inferior offices remayned sound &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>It is very likely that the offices, &amp; outvvard constitution vvere vvholy altered from the right institution &amp;c.</hi> First I wish the Reader to mynd his maner of reasoning. A litle before / he sayd <hi>he doubted not plainely to take avvay that vvhich vve obiect of theyr outvvard constitution.</hi> Yet behold the yssue of his first and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest proof is all come to this, <hi>It is not othervvise likely: It is very likely, &amp;c.</hi> Thus his playne demonstration (if it fitted his turne / yet) is no other but a meer likelyhood and presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: And that also gathered from other writers / not from the Scriptures. Is not this thē (think you) as playne a taking away of our obiection, as it is a sound defence of theyr Church-constitution? Neyther barrell / better herring.</p>
   <p>But what now, if by the Scriptures it be not onely likely / but indeed certayne / that it was otherwise with the Iewes, then here he saith concerning <hi>theyr offices and outvvard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution?</hi> How hath he then plainely taken away our objection / as he pretended? Let him search therefore / and he shall fynd that they were so farre from admitting any straung func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among them / as they<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn. 1.19-23.</note> vrged Iohn the Baptist to shew warrant for his Ministery from the word of God: And besides, by theyr silence to Christs question about Iohns baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me / do plainely testify that<note n="‡" place="margin">Mat. 21.25 26.</note> themselves judged no Ministery lawfull / but that which is from heaven: that is / such onely as is of <hi>God,</hi> not of <hi>Men.</hi> If here now we would vse his manner of reasoning / how great likelyhoods might we justly alledge from these Scriptures / to the contrary of that he sayth.</p>
   <p>But to put the matter out of all doubt / the Scripture witnesseth of Zachary / Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists father / that he being then one of the Priests / <hi>executed the Priests office, and vvalked in in all the commandements &amp; ordinances of the Lord vvithout reproof. Luk.</hi> 1.5.6.8.9. Which how could it possibly have ben / if the offices and constitution of that Church had ben wholy alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: as this man here pretendeth? Note also / that all the Priests then / were of the tribe of Levi / of the posterity of Aaron / consecrated to their functions / sitting in that seat which God by Moses had appointed for the Ministery and regiment of that Church. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.6 <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2. <hi>vvith Deut.</hi> 33.4.8.10.</p>
   <p>Finally / Christ himself giveth testimony to the lawfulnes of their Ministery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution / when he said to the clensed Leper, <hi>Go shevv thy self to the Priest, and offer for thy clensing as Moses hath commaunded. Luk.</hi> 5.14. By which is most playne / that they had at that tyme both the true Ministery and ordinances which God by Moses had appoynted.

   <p>Of their true offices / imported by <hi>sitting in Moses chayre,</hi> I have<note n="*" place="margin">A treatise of the Man▪ of England. Pag. 54. 55.</note> els where spoken / and proved it by divers reasons and testimonyes out of the word of God: To which D. B. can fynd no aunswer, but yet is loth to yeeld to the truth. Moses (he sayth) <hi>vvas a Magistrate.</hi> What then? Therefore <hi>Moses chayre must be vnderstood of somevvhat els.</hi> But why so? Doth he not know, that Moses in that his governement of Israel, even by the commaundement of God / appoynted Aaron and his sonnes to the Priests office, for the burning of incense before the Lord / <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherevppon also when Corah and his company did afterward murmure / ād presumed to take the Priests Office vpon them / it is sayd they rose vp and gathered themselves together not onely against <hi>Aaron</hi> (to whom it belonged) but agaynst <hi>Moses</hi> also / who from God had appoynted him and his sonnes therevnto. <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. <hi>chap. vvith Numb.</hi> 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. <hi>chap.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Note withall / that Moses a litle before his death blessing the tribes of Israel, when he had the heads of them assembled together, spake thus of <hi>Levi</hi> (turning his speach vnto God), <hi>Let thy Thummim and thyne vrim be vvith thyne Holy one &amp;c. They shall teach Iacob thy judgements and Israel thy Lavv: they shal put incense before thy face and the burnt offring vpon thyne altar &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 33.4.5.8.9.10.11. With which Scripture and speach of Moses / if we compare that of Nehemiah / where he speaketh of<note n="♣" place="margin">Neh. 9.3.4.5. &amp;c.</note> the <hi>Levites stayre or hy seat, and theyr standing vpon it vvhen they taught the Lavv &amp;c.</hi> And that of Christ where he sayd,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 23.2.3.</note>
      <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses chayre, observe therefore vvhatsoever they speak &amp;c.</hi> And that of Iohn / where he sayth: <note n="‡" place="margin">Ioh. 1.19.24.</note>
      <hi>the Pharisees vvich vvere sent to Iohn Baptist about his Ministery vvere Priests &amp; Levites:</hi> Iff (I say) we consider and compare these Scriptures together / how playne is it and vndeniable that Christs speach of <hi>sitting in Moses chayre &amp;c.</hi> doth necessarily imply the true offices and functions which God by Moses ordeyned for the teaching and guyding of Israel in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and service? Thus also may <hi>Moses doctrine</hi> which they taught in those offices / be fitly vnderstood ād comprised in the same speach. And what variety then is there betweē this exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / and that which vnderstandeth it of Moses doctrine / as he saith some of our selves have done heretofore?</p>
   <p>Finally how ignorant and frivolous is it / that here he pretendeth against this, <hi>viz. that Moses vvas, no Priest, as they vvere, but a Magistrate:</hi> Whenas all the Scriptures aforesaid do reach that God by Moses appoynted them to this function and service? And that so / as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses himself though he were not a Priest ordeyned by solemne rite / yet by the appointment off God did annoint not onely the Tabernacle and all that was therein / but Aaron also and his sonnes / consecrating them to the Priests office, and offring all the sacrifices appertayning the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revnto: Which afterward belonged onely to the Priests for to do. <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. <hi>chap. &amp; Psal.</hi> 99.6. <hi>vvith Heb.</hi> 5.4.</p>
   <p>But perhaps there is a pad in the straw / more lurking in his speach then all men are aware of. For what if by these words <hi>(Moses vvas no Priest, but a Magistrate, and therefore Moses chayre must be vnderstād of some vvhat els)</hi> he insinuate that it is meant of the Magistrates authority and seing Christ inferreth vpon the sitting in Moses chayre / <hi>All therefore vvhatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do,</hi> that all people therefore are bound to keep whatsoever the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates do commaund them? Will not his words here beare and import thus much? Yea may not his vnderstanding it, of some what els) joyned with the <hi>Magistrates authority,</hi> seem direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to imply it? and that so, as what they commaund / he thinketh it is to be observed, be it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or vnlawfull? Which if it be his meaning / hath he not here then covertly sowē most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable doctrine / both shamefully helping Christ himself, ād wickedly crossing the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and practise of the faithfull in all ages?

               <p n="2">2. Secondly (to let their constitution passe, vvhich yet as I have said, vvould be found as badde or vvorse then ours) vve wil examine their corruptions in doctrine: Wherein I would knovv of them, vvhich are the greater sinnes, of these two sorts, viz. 1. A false and corrupt outward constitution: 2. Or false and corrupt doctrines. I thinke they vvill say, the corrupt and false doctrines are the
<pb facs="12"/>
greater, as they are indeed: For that they doe vvound, fester and corrupt the very conscience, and doe deceive the hearers thereof, Whereas the errors in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Church, (especially in some circumstances (as the errors with vs are) and those of no small controversie, in matters also not fundamentall) are nothing nere so hurtfull: by hovve much the Tithing of Mint Annis, &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, are of lesser force then the other vveightier matters of the lavv. Novv from hence, I Reason thus.</p>
               <p>If the greater sinnes (namely in doctrine) doe not simply ouerthrovv a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of Christians, from being a true Church: Then much lesse vvill the lesser sinnes (namely in the outvvard constitution, &amp;c)</p>
               <p>But the false doctrines (which are the greater sinnes) themselves confesse by the example of the said Churches doe not. Therefore neither will the lesser.</p>
               <p>For the better explayning of this poinct, I would pray them resolve me of this question. What if a company of <hi>Arians, Anabaptistes,</hi> or <hi>Papistes,</hi> should bee gathered and established in a true outward constitution, &amp; still reteyne their fundamentall errors before<note n="*" place="margin">Sectiō. 3</note> named: Whether should their outward constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion make them a true Church, yea or no? I thinke they will say no. Thus I hope then it appeareth, that the outward constitution whether falty or true, availeth nothing to the ouerthrowing or making of a true Church, vnlesse other doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the foundation, either false or true, doe concurre therewith. And thus their Obiection of the Iewish constitution, is (I trust) fully ansvvered: So that still their peremptory separation and condempning of the Churches of England, for some outvvard corruptions, remayneth still a grievous sinne vpō their heads for vvhich (vvithout harty repentance) they shall one day aunsvver before God, vvhich vvill be too heavie a burthen for them to beare.</p>

That which Christ sayd to the Scribes and Pharisees / <hi>VVo be to you blynd guydes vvhich say, VVhosoever svveareth by the Temple, it is nothing: but vvhosoever svveareth by the gold off the Temple,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 23.16.17.</note>
      <hi>he offendeth. Ye fooles and blynd, vvhether is greater, the gold, or the Temple that sanctifyeth the gold, &amp;c.</hi> May it not in this case also fitly be applyed to this Scribe? Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially / seing the Church in the constitution thereof (if we sever it from the doctrine, as here he doth) may in divers respects be compared with the Temple / and the doctrine of truth taught and vpheld in the Church, with the gold of the Temple: As both by these Scriptures doth plainely appeare (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.17. <hi>vvith.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.5.6.19.23.24.25.33. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.4.4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1.2.) And by this also, that God hath made the promise of his presence and blessing to his Church (as to the Temple wherein he will dwell) it being so constituted, and walking / as he hath commaunded. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.11.12. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.17.18. <hi>Esa.</hi> 52.11.12. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 37.26.27.28. <hi>&amp;</hi> 48.35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. Yea and this man himself did<note n="*" place="margin">Section 3.</note> here a litle before alledge, that by <hi>gold and siluer</hi> (spoken of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12.) the Apostle meaneth true doctrine. Which if it were so there / then by his owne exposition may that saying of Christ to the Pharisees / well be applyed to him in this case.</p>
   <p>Secondly I aske / Doth not <hi>the constitution</hi> (be it true or false) alway include the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church, whereas <hi>the false Doctrine</hi> is often found but in some members thereof? This may be seen in the Churches of Israel / Corinth, Galatia / Pergamus / etc. In which respect also the false and corrupt constitution may be of greater waight and more danger / then the false and corrupt <hi>Doctrine:</hi> inasmuch as the wounding and infecting of the whole body is far worse then of some parts onely: and because the parts so infected, if they cannot otherwise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden / may be cut of / and yet the body preserved: Not contrarily. For the better expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof / let him resolve me which of these propositions is the truer, <hi>viz. VVhere there
<pb facs="12"/>
is in a Church false doctrine, there is a false Church:</hi> Or this, <hi>VVhere there is a false constitution there is a false Church.</hi> And contrarily.</p>
   <p>Thirdly I aske / Is not the Hierarchy and Church constitution of Antichrist / the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable anarchy of Sathan that ever was? And doth not Sathan far more commonly and readily part with his false doctrine / then with it / when he must needs part with the one,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.9.</note> and yet can retayne the other? He is subtill and of long experience / he can mynd and knoweth full well that so long as he holdeth his owne constitution of a Church / he can quickly (vppon any opportunity) bring in his doctrine agayne / even with a trice. For why? He hath both the people ready for the receyving of it / being yet still in the confusion and bondage of Antichrist: and his owne Ministery also to be imployed in the publishing and serving thereof: theyr Offices / Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings / Ministrations / Maintenance / being all ready at hand and fit for the purpose. Whereas on the contrary / when the false constitution is abolished / then false doctrine wanteth both hee woonted place of receipt, and her nimble wings by which she should spread and fly abroad. And here I could alledge for proof hereof / the prefer Ministery and estate of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which being of Antichrist Sathans graundchild / and he now having spyed his tyme / and found some opportunity / beginneth apace by this meanes to bring in agayne such doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his / as had for a tyme ben suppressed: As namely / <hi>Free-vvill, Auricular Confession, Christs soule to descend into Hell: The Church of Rome to be a true Church, &amp;c.</hi> Witnesse the Books and publik Sermons of <hi>Bilson: Bancroft: Hooker: Androes: Harsenet: Barret:</hi> and other the Priests and Prelates of that Church / the Marchants of these and the like wares off the Beast / in Court / City / Countrey / Vniversity / and where not?</p>
   <p>The same thing you may mynd also thus / So long as the house standeth still / and is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with servants and Ministers / it is ready for the implements and furniture (though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved for a tyme) to be brought in agayne / and soone to be set vp in theyr woonted place. And if you would see an example of these things yet in memory / look but at the Churches estate in K. Edwards and Q. Maryes dayes compared together. The popish constitution of the Church being not abolished in King Edwards tyme / how soone was the Popes doctrine / yea and his supremacy / in Queen Maryes dayes spread and acknowledged throughout the Land? Yet the same doctrines of truth were in K. Edwards tyme published and receyved / which now are in England. And very like also that it was then with more zeale and love of the truth / thē now it is: specially considering the generall coldnes of men / and the cruell persecution of the truth / to which this age synce is come.</p>
   <p>Mynd further / that the Offices / houses, and maintenance of the Fryers and Nunnes being before (in the time of K. Henry the eight) quite taken away / they were not able in all Q. Maryes raigns to reare them vp agayne. No, albeit they iudged them lawfull and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary aswell as the other poynts of Popery / and did also very earnestly desier and labour to have them reestablished. So great a matter it is to have a thing abolished in the whole consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution thereof: Even as when an house is rased and pulled downe to the very foundation.</p>
   <p>And here / vpon this occasion let me also aske, Whether if the Callings and Livings of the Prelates and Priests / together with the Idoll Temples / and confusion of all maner people in the body of the Church / now had in England / were so dealt with / as the Abbats / Monks / Abbeyes and Nunryes then were: there would not fewer Iesuites and Seminaryes come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land: Popery lesse increase: treason against her Maiesty be lesse attempted: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally / all the meanes and hope for the full replanting of Antithrists religion agayne in that Church / be vtterly removed and taken away?</p>
   <p>Let this Scribe then go and perswade such as himself / that the outward constitution of the Church is but as <hi>the tithing of Mynt: Annise, and Commin, &amp;c.</hi> Whosoever have theyr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> exercised to discerne good and evill / will playnely see / that notwithstanding any thing he pretendeth / yet it is and ought to be accounted among the waighty matters of the Law of God. Yea, that it is of far other importance and consequence, then most men think or will yet be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded: albeit even experience (the Mistresse of fooles) might in all this tyme and tryall have taught them sufficient / if ynough were ynough for men / In cases of Religion.</p>
   <p>Now for <hi>his Reason</hi> here / any may see by that which hath ben sayd that it is very frivolous and of no waight at all. The Proposition (or first part) hath nothing for the ground of it, but that which is in question, and neyther is alway true nor can be yeelded vnto for very great and waighty causes here before declared. Vnto which adde these also: 1. That many errors in doctrine are and may be far lesse / then the errors of the outward constitution / when they are truly compared together. 2. That the true outward constitution of the Church alway im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
<pb facs="13"/>
both a separation of the people from the World / and the joyning of them together in the fellowship of the Gospell / and both these to be voluntary. Which particulars being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with the former / will teach him not barely to set downe / but duly to prove the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his next Reply.</p>
   <p>The Assumption (or second part of the Reason) is in some fence true, in some sence false: and in both, against himself and their Churches estate. When Churches are set in the constitution and way of Christ / if afterward they fall into some errour of doctrine / they are notwithstāding for the former to be reputed true Churches, vntill being admonished they refuse to heare the voyce of Christ and to yeeld to the truth. Thus the Assumption is true / and of vs confessed, by the example of the Churches of the Iewes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when theyr case cometh to be such, as they will rather abide in errour then obey the truth and voyce of Christ / this so wilfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting simply overthroweth such a company from being a true Church in such estate. And thus the Assumption is false / and so proved to be / by the example of the said Churches. And both wayes it is agaynst him and theyr Church: as will yet further appeare by that which is now to be spoken of his question wherein he would be resolved.</p>
   <p>He asketh, <hi>VVhat if a company of Arrians, Anabaptists, or Papists should be gathered and established in a true outvvard constitution, and still retayne theyr fundamentall errors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore named: VVhether then their outvvard constitution should make them a true Church, Yea or no.</hi> I aunswer / 1. Not onely false constitution / but false doctrine also retayned, make a false Church. If it were so then / that they could have a true constitution as he supposeth / yet by reason of theyr false doctrine they should be a false Church.</p>
   <p n="2">2 I aske also of him / Whether these companyes of whom he speaketh / were true Churches when they fell into those errors (as were the Churches of Galatia / when the errors about Circumcision and the Law crept in among them): Or whether they were Hereticks, Sectaryes or the like (such as were Hymeneus, Philetus, Alexander, the Apostates of Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) falling from the true faith and Churches of God, when they came to be gathered and established as he fancyeth. If they were of the former sort, then they are to be estemed and admonished as true Churches, till by despising the voyce of Christ / the Kingdome of God be taken from among them <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>vvith.</hi> 5.2.4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.33.43. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>vvith</hi> 15.12. <hi>Rev</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> If of the latter then are they no true Churches at all but false and detestable Synagogues of Sathan whatsoever truth in constitution or otherwise they shall pretend. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.30. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8.23. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.3.7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19.20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.20.21. <hi>and</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17.18. <hi>and</hi> 3.5.6.13. <hi>and.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38.39. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.2.3. <hi>In de. ver.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18, <hi>chap.</hi>

   <p n="3">3. In a true constitution must alway be mynded, a calling by the word of God: a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the world: a joyning together in the fellowship of the Gospell, and that by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary profession thereof, and submission therevnto. Now these things considered / how is it po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that the Arrians, Anabaptists, or Papists retayning theyr errours, should yet be gathered and established in a true outward constitution?

               <p>Lastly, concerning our corruptions: As we cannot iustifie them to be no corruptiōs, (but must needes acknowledge, that there are many yet remaining in our land, which vvere left by that man of sinne &amp; are as thornes vnto our sides, vvhich vve hope God will in time abolish):<note place="margin">Iudg. 2.3.</note> So dare vve not runne into your extremities, to condempne our Churches for such corruptions, but waight the appointed time of God for the redresse thereof. Yet in the meane time, so longe as those most excellent truthes and doctrines of salvation, (for which God make vs thankfull) are still reteyned and held, as soundly as by any Church v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the face of the earth (the other errors not simply ouerthrovving the same, beeing not held of obstinacy, and being also for the most part, of great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie and disputation among the learned:) So long I say, communion in things lavvfull, is to be kept with them, as before is noted in the example of other Churches: Othervvise, it vvill come to passe, (by reason of the<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 25.13 10.23.</note> dieuersitie in opinions and iudgementes vvhich by the corruption of our nature vve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in, in this tabernacle, as hath<note n="‡" place="margin">Lev. 4.

               <p>These observations beeing considered, I doubt not but the Lorde vvill adde a blessing to this vvorke, That such as are simple hearted, and have exceeded in eagernesse of zeale: may see theyr extremitie, in so rashly and vnadvisedly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from, and condempning the Churches of England, sometymes theyr Nurses and Mothers, as before is noted: Whereby God may have the glory, &amp; themselves the comforte, euen the salvation of theyr soules through Christ.</p>

Now at length <hi>D. B.</hi> yeeldeth the cause himself. So great is the truth / and so greatly it prevayleth against every oppugner thereof. To omit that he confesseth / <hi>they cannot justify theyr corruptions</hi> (and yet they can abide in them): he sayth also, <hi>they must needs acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they have many corruptions remayning, vvich vvere left by that man of sinne, &amp; vvhich are as thornes vnto theyr sides.</hi> Blessed be God / which maketh the enemyes themselues bring glory and testimony to his truth. They are so convinced / as he sayth plainely <hi>they must needs acknovvledge it.</hi> Now therefore let him name them in his next: or confesse those to be of them which I have noted hereafter / <hi>Pag.</hi> 63. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Till then, I will onely inferre this herevppon that seing they are such as himself here graunteth them to be / <hi>viz, corruptions of the Man of sinne / and thornes to theyr sides,</hi> even therefore are all bound to separate from them as being condenmed by the word of God. For hath not the Lord commaunded all his people, wholy to leave the Man of sinne with all his corruptions / not to partake in any of his sinnes / not to rest in any of his vnrighteousnes, neyther to towch any vncleane thing at all? 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>

It is not then the yeelding vnto them / but the witnessing against them / by which we can hope it faith for the abolishment of them. Neyther do we doubt, but they being thus discovered, God will also stirre vp the hearts of Kings and Rulers of the earth (as already in part he hath begun) to hate that whore of Babylon with her abominations, and to make her desolate and naked. (<hi>Rev</hi> 17 16.)

   <p>Therefore dare not we runne into theyr extremityes, to allow eyther by word or deed the corruptions of Antichrist that Man of sinne / to receyve in our forehead or hand the print of his Nauie or marke of his ordinances, to pursue to death the witnesses of Christ, or any way to approve thereof <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we wayte the appoynted tyme of the Lord / for the full abolition and redresse of all these impietyes.

   <p>To that which <hi>D.

Here onely I aske, First what one lawfull thing they have, that we have not? Secondly / in what one thing which he counteth lawfull / we can have communion with them in that estate, and not sinne against God by partaking withall in the apostasy of the man of sinne? Of all other things it is most like he will say / that we might heare many comfortable truths taught by theyr Preachers / and many good prayers conceyved by them. Yet such is their case / as we can not do this neyther / but we must needs partake with the Ministery of Antichrist: all theyr Preachers (even the best) being Priests and Deacons / so made by the Prelates. Of which see more in the latter Treatise following, <hi>Pag.</hi> 188. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not to speak here any further of it: or of theyr Book-worship / taken out of the Popes Masse-book, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which they administer the Sacraments / marry / bury / pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or of the compulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all maner people / even the most wicked / to be members of theyr Church: or of theyr Church discipline, being in the hands of the Prelates / and by the Canon Law: or finally / of the severall offices / entrance / ministration / maintenance / of theyr whole Hierarchy. To none of which can any joyne or submit / in any part of Gods worship / but they must needs partake in evill / even in the sinnes of Babylon / and of Antichrist that sonne of perdition. Such is their constitution / and such is the standing of all that continew therein.</p>
   <p>Of his last pretence, <hi>tovvching diversity of judgement,</hi> by reason whereof he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade to keep communion with them / I have spoken<note n="*" place="margin">In the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svver to Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 3.</note> here a litle before.

   <p>This then is not rightly to vse <hi>that diversity of judgement,</hi> wherevnto in many things all Churches and Christians in deed are continually subiect here on earth / but ignorantly to abuse it. But herevnto (it may be)<note n="‡" place="margin">Da. Buck.</note> this man was driven / eyther by weaknes of iudgement in himself, or by eagernes of contention and malice agaynst vs: of whome he hath sometymes ben / but now for his revolting from the truth and so persisting / is (according to the<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.4.5.11.12.13. 1 Tim. 1.19.20. Mat. 18.17.18.20.</note> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures / and ordinance of Christ) cast out from among vs / and delivered vnto Sathan / for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the flesh / that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord. Which mercy the Lord Almighty vouchsafe him in Christ / from whom he hath declined vnto Antichrist. And this is all the harme I wish vnto him or any such, even theyr repentance and salvation in Christ Iesus.</p>
   <p>Hitherto of the Preface prefired to Mr Iacobs book. Which I have answered, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what largely / from poynt to poynt / rather for the satisfying of others / then for any waight I judged to be in it my self.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="15"/>Now it is tyme that I returne to Mr Iacob himself / and deale with him in particular: by whom I am spoken vnto and challenged by Name / almost in every page of his book: As if he had forgotten the old Proverbe which sayth, Let not him boast himself that girdeth his harness / as he that putteth it off. Here then seing that this discourse came first from him to the view of the world, and that also without my aunswer to his last Reply, let the Reader call to mynd that which is written / <hi>He that is first in his ovvne cause, is iust: then cometh his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and maketh inquiry of him. Prov.</hi> 18.17. So as he now having told his owne tale / first / and seming to some (no doubt) to be iust therein / it is nedefull that I therefore come in the next place / and make inquiry of him.</p>
   <p>Which I do in the Treatise following: submitting it now to the judgement of others / to be examined of all by the word of God.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.12-16. 1 Thes. 5.21.</note> By it therefore do thou (Christiā Reader) try all things therein / and keep that which is good. Have no prejudice (I pray thee) eyther of Mr Iacob or my self: but heare vs both speak / and then consider what is spoken on eyther side / from poynt to poynt. And the Lord give thee vnderstanding in all things.</p>
   <p>There is but one way / of truth / to life eternall. And that is in no other but the Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.6.</note> who hath said, <hi>I am the vvay, the truth, and the life,</hi> If therefore the Churches of England (as now they stand) be in that good and old way prescribed by Christ / wherein the Primitiue Churches were planted by the Apostles / then doubtles then are in the way of truth / that leadeth vnto life. (Yet this hath not Mr Iacob shewed in all his discourse.) <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.16. But now on the contrary / if the Churches of England in theyr estate / have in the Ioynes off the Church of Rome and with it departed from that auncyent and good way of Christ / and do even vnto this day stand in the apostasy of Antichrist / and that in theyr publik / Ministery / worship / ordinances / confusion of people <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then can they not so standing / be assured by the word of God / that they are in the way of truth which leadeth vnto life / but in the by-wayes of errour which cary headlong to death and perdition. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.3.10.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.3 <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.1.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.18.19. <hi>vvith Exod</hi> 20.4.5. For which cause / all the people of God are bound to separate from them / and not to partake in any of theyr sinnes / least they receyve also of their plagues. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4.</p>
   <p>And if it be well mynded / Mr Iacob himself (howsoever he pretend otherwise / yet in deed) yeeldeth thus much / when he is driven to confesse that theyr constitution is such<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 37. 61 69. 70. 84. 154.</note> as they stand <hi>in error:</hi> and that <hi>of Antichrist: against the Second commaundement: in vayne vvorship: depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from and denying the faith, in their Ministery, &amp;c.</hi> But for these and all the rest / thou mayest see / and I pray thee (good Reader) well to mynd the Arguments / Replyes / and Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers following. From the reading whereof I will not not now any longer hold thee.</p>
   <p>The God of peace tread Sathan vnder thy feet / and by his word and Spirit lead thee into the way of truth / to the conservation of thy soule vnto life eternall. And if thou reapest any fruit of my labours / give prayse vnto God / and pray for me / the weakest of his servants / and vnworthyest of the witnesses of Iesus. The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with thy spirit. Amen.</p>
