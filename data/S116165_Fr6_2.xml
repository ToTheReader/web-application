   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, Sr <hi>IAMES STANLEY,</hi> KNIGHT OF the Bath, Lord STRANGE, Sonne and Heire apparent to WILLIAM Earle of <hi>Derby,</hi> one of the most ancient Knights of the Illustrious Order of the Garter.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first time that I had the honour to see and know your Lo. was in <hi>France,</hi> when you then began your travels, accompanied with your <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Generous</hi> youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother <hi>Sir Robert Stanley,</hi> (like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Knight of the Bath) who now lives with God: And (if my fancie deceive not my Iudgement.) it is equally worthy both of my thoughts, and of your Lordships memory, to see how propitious God hath since proved to your content, and remaines to your felicity, in so highly recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this your losse of a <hi>Noble Brother,</hi> with the rich gift of a <hi>Vertuous Wife▪</hi> your Right Illustrious Lady who is
<pb facs="293"/>
descended from no meaner house than the famous Dukes of <hi>Tremouille</hi> by her Father, and the Victorious <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Orenge</hi> by her Mother, and who being transplanted from <hi>France,</hi> and (in the Sacred Bonds of Mariage) here matched and incorporated to your Lordship, hath (by the <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of God) in a few yoares brought you many sweet <hi>Olive Plants</hi> and <hi>Branches</hi> to perpetuate your ancient <hi>Name,</hi> and most Honourable <hi>Family</hi> of the <hi>Stanleyes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And what are all these benefits of <hi>Nature,</hi> and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of <hi>Grace,</hi> which God hath so opportunely sent, and graciously given you, in and by them, but such, and so sublime and transcendent, that they are strong proofes of his <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse</hi> towards you, and I doubt not but (in a pious resolution) your Lordship reciprocally makes them the cause of your eternall gratitude and thankfulnesse to his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Majesty</hi> for the same.</p>
   <p>And indeed who can possibly have, or conceive a different thought, that observes how your Lordship conducts all your actions by <hi>Reason,</hi> and not by <hi>Passion:</hi> That as you esteeme <hi>Vertue,</hi> to be the chiefest earthly <hi>Honour,</hi> so you likewise value <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Godlinesse</hi> to bee the best and most Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne <hi>Vertues.</hi> That you are confident, that in <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Soules</hi> which are well and fairly endowed, <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi> should still be Twins, or inseparable Companions and Individuals, because the former without the latter, is but as fire of straw to the Sunne-shine; and to shut up this point, that your Honour gives the chiefest functions and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of your <hi>Soule</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and the second to the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and service of your <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Countrey,</hi> that being the true markes of a Religious Christian, and this of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Subject, and Honourable <hi>Patriot.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And this (my good Lord) was the Originall cause, and
<pb facs="293"/>
these are the prevailing Motives and Reasons, why I trench so farre upon your Lordships <hi>Greatnesse</hi> and <hi>Goodnesse;</hi> in proffering up this my Sixth and last Booke of <hi>Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge against Murther;</hi> to your Noble <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Patronage;</hi> not that your Lordship is the last in my <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> and <hi>Zeale,</hi> much lesse in my <hi>Respects</hi> and <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance:</hi> But that I could give no satisfaction to my selfe, before I had prefixed your <hi>Illustrious Name,</hi> to this my unpolished Worke, and before I had given a publike testimonie to the whole world in generall, and more especially to our little world <hi>England</hi> in particular, what place and power your Honourable <hi>Birth</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> have deservedly taken up in my heart, and worthily purchased in my most reserved and entire affection.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Histories</hi> which this Booke relates, are memorable and mournfull, and to give your Honour my opinion of them, they are as lamentable for the bloudy facts, as memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for the sharp, yet just punishments inflicted for the same; wherein Gods sacred <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>ustice</hi> and <hi>Revenge</hi> (with equall <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Glory)</hi> triumphed ore their wretched Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators. I have cast them in a low Region of language, and therefore if they come short of your Lordships accurate Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, my <hi>Presumption</hi> in this my <hi>Dedication</hi> to you, hath no other hope of excuse or pardon, then to flie to your Lordships innate <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> and to appeale to your knowne and approved <hi>Generosity</hi> and <hi>Candor,</hi> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it your Honourable <hi>Ambition</hi> to cherish <hi>Vertue</hi> in all men, and to defend it against unjust scandall, and malitious detraction.</p>
   <p>Proceed my Lord, as you have fairly and fortunately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne, in the happy excercise and progresse of <hi>Piety, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> and <hi>Honour;</hi> and as the hopes are now ours, so may the happy fruits and effects thereof, infallibly still prove your
<pb facs="294"/>
Lordships hereafter, untill it have perfected and compleated you to be a most <hi>Illustrious Patterne</hi> of <hi>Goodnesse</hi> in this world, and a glorious Saint in that to come, the which none shall pray to God for with more true <hi>Zeale,</hi> nor desire with more unfaigned <hi>Affection,</hi> then</p>
