To conceale the Truth, is to burie
gold, and therby to depriue not only others,
but our selues also, of the benefit and vse
thereof. Wherefore Saint <hi>Austen</hi> sharply
censureth such as would challenge a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
interest and propriety in this, which is
the true common treasure of Gods Church,
saying, <hi>Veritas nec mea, nec tua, nec
illius est, sed omnium nostrum, quos
ad eius communionem publicè vocas;
admonens nos, vt nolimus eam habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
priuatam, ne priuemur ea:</hi> The truth
is neither mine, nor thine, nor his, but all
ours in common, whom thou (O Lord) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
publikely to the communion thereof;
dreadfully admonishing vs, not to desire
to haue it priuate, lest we be depriued of it.
Now, of all truth this day in controuersie,
there is none more sought after by some,
than the visibility of the true Church,
which retained the purity of the Apostles


<pb facs="3"/>
doctrine, vnmixed with dregs of errour
and superstition, especially in the gloomy
and dark Ages before <hi>Luther.</hi> As for
higher times, and neerer the Apostles, such
was the clarity and splendour of the pure
Church, that in a manner it obscured the
Sun. But, in succeeding and degenerating
times, after the number of the name of the
Beast, 666, it began much to be obscured
and clouded with ignorance and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and in the thousandth yeer, in which,
Satan was let loose, and much more after,
euen till the happy reformation in these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Ages, it was so eclipsed, especially in
the Western Parts of the world, that some
confidently affirm, it was quite extinct.
The Woman, clothed with the Sun, hauing
the Moon vnder her feet, was now fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Wildernesse, and had but a fewe
Stars to discouer her. By the conduct and
lustre wherof, yet many Wise-men follow'd
her obscure track, and found her. Among

This Treasure of Antiquitie fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into my hands, and finding it hard to

Image of their Mother, the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Church, partly blubbered with tears,
partly smeared with bloud, by the cruelty
of the Man of sinne, and his Complices, in
former Ages. About which dolefull Image,
we may fitly write these words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Micah,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Micah 7. 8.</note> for a Motto: <hi>Reioyce not

a Light hee hath been Before, and In our

to his promise; til he shall dispell all dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and consume the Man of sin with the
Spirit of his mouth,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.</note> and destroy him with
the brightnes of his Comming. Euen so
come, Lord Iesu; come quickly.</p>
