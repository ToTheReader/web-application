   <p>THe truth when it hath ben hydden a longe tyme, com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth out at the length, the which hathe aproued trewe in these oure dayes as concernynge thynges y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> belonge to relegion. For how the pope blynded oure fathers eyes it is not unknowen / and how many haue bene blinded in our dayes by winchesters gospels it nedith no probacyon. The whiche caste such a myst before mens eyes that they were not able to discerne chal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke from chese. For when the lyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worde of God was taken from men, there was nothing left wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by theyr feates myghte be tryed whether they were of God or no. And to thentent that theyr drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes myght more commodiously crepe into mens cōscience and not be utterly reiected, they threatned the people with sic volo, sit iubeo, and
<pb facs="7"/>the authoritie of the churche. But nowe (thankes be to God, whiche hath deliuered vs frō theyr thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) theyr authorities, without the scripture is nothynge worth. For we haue nowe free passage to the scryptures, that we maye trye whether it be chaffe or corne, that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> pope w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his noynted shauelyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges haue taught vs. And where as God cōmaūded them to speake nothynge of theyr owne brayne, the most part that they taught is deuylyshnes, and nothynge but deuylyshnes, in somoch that that sayenge of Christ in Mathewe is verefied of them. ye breake the or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinaunces of God to kepe youre owne tradicions. God ordayned that Christ shulde be a full and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonly sacrifice for mans synnes, but they say no. God sayth in Esa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ye, I alone haue troden the wyne presse, but they say no. And in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus,
<pb facs="7"/>I am, I am, he my selfe whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che taketh away thyne iniquities and synnes for myne owne selues sake, but they saye no. The Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les teacheth there is none other waye to be saued then by Christe, but they saye no. And why? mary (saye they) oure mother the holy churche whiche can not erre, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs that our masses are a ful sacrifice ex opere operato for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> quicke and the dead. Our mother the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly churche teacheth that men by gyuinge of vestmentes, copes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terstones, platers, crosses chaly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, cruettes, and suche other beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie, deserue forgyuenes of syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and worship God. Our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the holy church teacheth that the true worshypynge of sayntes is to cal vpon thē, to paynte their ymages, to set candels before thē, to bowe downe to thē, and make them mediatours betwixte God
<pb facs="8"/>and man / althoughe the scripture be manifestly agaynst it, as ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the fyrste epistle vnto Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothe in the seconde chapter. Therefore as often (good christen reader) as the authoritie of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che is layde agaynste the, marke whether it be grounded vpon the scrypture or no, yf it be grounded vpon the scrypture receyueit, for Christe sayth my shepe heare my voyce. But yf it be not, remembre what saynt Paule sayth. yf we or an angell from heauen preached you a gospell besydes that we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue preached you, let him be acur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as we sayd before. So I now saye agayne, yf any man preache you a gospel besydes that ye haue receyued let him be acursed. Then yf he that teacheth an other gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell be acursed, why shall not he be acursed that receyue it? Relyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queshed therfore and forsake suche
<pb facs="8"/>toyes as haue ben inuēted by mā contrarie to gods wyl &amp; testamēt. And to thintente thou mayst for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them the soner I haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated these treatises ensuenge. Of whome the fyrst teacheth playnly that the papisticall Masse is no sacrifice, but rather a blasphemie of Christes passiō inuēted by mā. The next techeth how God must be worshypped aryght. The third how sayntes ought to be worshyp ped. The last what is Christianly bextie. And although their be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thinges cōteyned in thē, yet these be the chefe &amp; pryncipall maters which the aucthor toke in hande purposely to teache, whom reade thou with desyre of the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And I doubte not but God wyll call the by them from many grosse errours, and encrease in the knowledge of his wyll, that &amp; maist be partaker of the toyes pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared for the by christ. So be it.</p>
