      <salute>WORTHY SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our earnest request, to have a <hi>Transcript</hi> of this rude and raw <hi>Discourse,</hi> sodainely conceived, and sorrily cemented, out of your affection to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whom in speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it concerned, could not but prevaile with me, to recollect it, while it was yet fresh in memorie, and to commit that to writing, as well as I could call it againe to mind, whereof I had no more then some generall <hi>heads</hi> and briefe <hi>notes</hi> scribled in a loose paper before:
<pb facs="3"/>
mine obligations to you, and your interest in me, of right affording you power to command from me a greater matter then that your request amounted unto. And how <note n="*" place="margin">Quod est potentissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randi genus; rogabat, qui jubere pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, Auson. Idyl. 13.</note> powerfull <hi>requests</hi> are, backt with such <hi>engagements,</hi> it is both commonly well knowne, and generally acknowledged. But since your request therein satisfied, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it backe againe from you, with significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the importunitie of divers friends, who out of that respect they bare to the partie decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, while she lived, and desire of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the memorie of her with them, have beene no lesse earnest suiters unto you, to have <hi>Copies</hi> from you of the same. Which being a worke over-troublesome, to make so many <hi>Transcripts,</hi> your second request was, that with my consent it might be made more publike. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose also, you had remitted it to me, that I might, if I were content to condescend thereunto, upon review of it, adde or alter in it what I should thinke fit, ere it came out. Now howsoever it was never intended by me for the <hi>Presle;</hi> nor indeed have I at present any desire or purpose, to adde ought in this kind to those things that I have published alreadie; nor did your former motion to me concerning it, extend it selfe any
<pb facs="3"/>
further, then to have it as a <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, that is, as I understand it, <hi>a private Monument,</hi> to <hi>lye</hi> by you as <hi>a memoriall</hi> of her, whom not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good ground you so entirely affected; nor can I yet deeme it (being so indigested a Piece) such as may be exposed to so publike view, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some kind of censure: yet to give satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to your selfe, whom I owe so much to, and those friends of yours, that seeme so much to desire it, I have layd a Law upon my selfe, setting all disswasives aside, to give way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, if your mind shall continue still bent that way. And upon occasion hereof, I have indeed reviewed it, but altred nothing at all of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the maine body of it; that those who were present at the deliverie in the Pulpit, might not reade any other then what they then heard: Onely the <hi>quotations</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and such <hi>shreds</hi> or <hi>parcels</hi> of <hi>exotike Language,</hi> as might be some rub to an <hi>English Reader,</hi> but had beene indifferent to your selfe, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into the <hi>Margine,</hi> and set on a little more <hi>Lace</hi> there, to make the <hi>Piece</hi> somewhat sutable to the rest of my <hi>Works,</hi> that are in hands abroad alreadie. So onely fourbished, I returne it againe entire to you, as by free <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
your owne formerly; <note n="*" place="margin">Sive tegen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da habeas, sive legenda putes, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. ad Dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan.</note> to be disposed of by you, either for your owne <hi>private</hi> use, (which would best like me) or for the <hi>publike,</hi> as your selfe shall please. And thus with heartie wishes of all <hi>health</hi> and <hi>happinesse</hi> to you, as well in your present condition, as in the alteration of it also, if any hereafter shall ensue, I take leave, and rest</p>
