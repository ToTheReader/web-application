<pb facs="3"/> wolues to deuoure their soules. The which warning was neuer more necessary then in these our daies.

      </gap>ed of, then such to whom the Lorde doth geue the spirite of wisdome to open and impart this treasure vnto vs: So on the other side, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more daungerous and infectious to the children of God, then corrupt &amp; false doctrine, and no persons more to be hated and speedily auoyded, then wicked and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teachers, whom Sathan thrusteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church to blemishe that pretious pearle and means of our saluation. Heare not (saith God by Ieremy) the woordes of the Prophets,<note place="margin">Ier. 23.16.</note> that prophecy vnto you, &amp; teach you vanity: They speake the vision of their owne heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lorde.<note place="margin">Verse 26.</note> And againe, howe long doe the Prophets delight to prophecy lyes, euen prophecying the deceit of their owne heart? Sathan himselfe the father and founder of al lying and false teaching vsed the same course in Paradice: For when God had said vnto Adam:<note place="margin">Gen. 2.17 &amp; 3.4.</note> In what hower soeuer thou shalt eate of the fruite of this tree, thou shalt dy the death. the
<pb facs="3"/> olde crafty serpent (seeking to seduce man from God) said nay you shall not die the death, but you shalbe like vnto God. By which glose &amp; false interpretation of gods word, he pulled them cleane from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Gods holy will and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to their own vtter ouerthrow &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uy iudgement. By such like falsehood hee tempted Christ himselfe to make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue ouer great confidence of the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God towardes him,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.6. Ps. 91.11.12.</note> It is written (saith he) that he will giue his Aungelles charge ouer thee, and with their handes they shall lift thee vp, least at any tyme, thou shouldst dash thy foot against a stone By like craft of lying, and by false sence peruerting the word of God, he from time to time instructeth his Messengers and false Proph. to abuse &amp; deceaue the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people of god, that be not wel taught by his holy spirit how to withstand them. The which false proph. (to the end they may be discouered and taken heed of): it greatly behoueth all Christians (that looke to be sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued by the death of Christ) to bewar whō they beleue, &amp; to haue recours to the rule &amp; touchstone of the holy scriptures, which is the perfect directory wherby all truth of doctrin is examined &amp; wherby we may try and proue the spirits whether they bee of<note place="margin">1. Io. 4.1 2. Pe. 1.20</note>
      <pb facs="4"/> god. For why the whole scripture (as saint Paule saith) is giuen by inspiration of God, &amp; is profitable to teach, to cōuince to correct and to instruct in righteousnes that the man of God may be absolute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made perfect to al good works. Search the scriptures (saith our sauiour Christ) for in them ye thinke to haue eternal life and they are these that testify of me.<note place="margin">Io. 5.39.</note> Thy worde is a lantern vnto my feete (sayeth the Prophet),<note place="margin">Ps. 119 i05 Pro. 30.5.</note> and a light vnto my paths. Euery word of God is pure, saith Salomō, he is a sheeld to those that trust in him. We find not any thing in this world (how pretious soeuer it bee) that is worthy to haue the word of God compared vnto it: for it surmounteth (infinitely, and beyond reason) all things which are and may bee imagined to be excellent and pretious: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so there is nothing in this world (how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious soeuer it be) but doth participat with earth, and needeth to be purged &amp; clē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed frō his drosse &amp; superfluities, before it cā be pure, but the word of God is clean of it selfe &amp; neither hath, nor cā haue any dros for it procedeth not frō a furnace but frō the mouth of God, which neither cānor will bring forth any woorke, but it shalbe so perfect as it ought to bee, and wherein nothing may bee amended. Hee
<pb facs="4"/> that is of God, (saith our sauiour) hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Gods word. And again,<note place="margin">Io. 8.47. Io. 10.27</note> My sheepe heare my voice, &amp; I know them, &amp; they will follow me, a stranger they will not fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low. Now if the aduersaries of the gospel (I meane the Papistes) would willingly (as becommeth Christians) submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to this tryer of all truth of faith &amp; holinesse, which is the worde of God. If they would as Christes sheepe heare the voyce of their shephearde: Then should they know that nothing is to be added, or taken away from the word of God:<note place="margin">Deu. 4.2 31 Io. 20.51.</note> Then would they say with S. Iohn, so much is written, that if we beleue, we haue salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the name of Christ. Then woulde they say with S. Paule, that the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res can make vs wise to saluation:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. Ambrose</note> And then would they (with Ambrose) condēne all newe doctrine which Christ hath not taught, because Christ is life to all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. But because they haue eares &amp; hear not, eyes &amp; see not, hearts and yet cannot vnderstand the truth, nor find the way of saluation: therefore they keepe the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in an vnknowen tongue from the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people: &amp; make it little lesse thē he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy to haue it in their tongue: therefore they so greatly disgrace &amp; discredite the Scriptures as vnsufficient to saluation,
<pb facs="5"/> and not conteining al necessary truth, but that there are many articles of necessitye to be beleeued which are not conteined in the scriptures. For so saith one of their champions.<note place="margin">Lindan. li. 1. c. 10.</note> The Apostles (saith he) would not commit certaine principall pointes of our religion to paper and inke thereby to perish, and to be forgotten: but they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to the faithful harts of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. As though those things remained more sure which be cōmitted to the fraile memory of feble men in this sinful world: then those things that by the spirit of god are put in writing. This is the cause why they blasphemously cal the sacred written word of God,<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</note> a dead writing, a dumbe Maister, doubtfull and vncertaine, A black gospell, dead inke, inkie diuinitye, A nose of waxe, a leaden rule, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>This is the cause why they say that the scriptures take authoritye of the church,<note place="margin">Frier So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> and that without the authority of the Church, the scriptures haue no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
   <p>As though the Maiesty of Gods wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and his trueth conteined in the scriptures, depended vppon the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of man. For though the Church bee neuer so holie, yet it consisteth of men, which oftentimes haue and do erre, when
<pb facs="5"/> they leane not to the word of God.<note place="margin">Petrus de palude. de potestate Papae. Art. 4. Herueus de potest. Papae.</note> If they would hearken to Gods worde, then would they not say, that the Popes onely power passeth all the power of the whole Church besides: And that the Pope by vertue and power is the whole church: and so conclude theruppon, that there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy ghost, nor interpretation or sense of the scriptures, but onely in the Pope. Indeed it is true, that as the Scriptures were written by the spirit of GOD:<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.20</note> So must they be expounded by the same. For without that Spirit, we haue neither eyes to see, nor eares to heare.</p>
   <p>It is that spirit that openeth and no man shutteth: the same shutteth,<note place="margin">Ma. 11.15 Reu. 3 7</note> and no man openeth.</p>
   <p>The same spirit prepared and opened the heart of Lidia,<note place="margin">Act. 16.14 Io. 6.45.</note> that she should geue eare to, and consider the things that were spoken by S. Paule.</p>
   <p>And in respect of this spirit. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Esay saith:<note place="margin">Esa. 53.13. Ier. 31, 33.</note> They shalbe all taught of God.</p>
   <p>But God hath not bound himself that this spirit should euermore (of necessitie) dwell in Roome:<note place="margin">Esay. 62.2</note> but vpon the lowly and humble hearted, that tremble at the word of God.</p>
   <p>Chrisostome saith, they that speake of
<pb facs="6"/> themselues:<note place="margin">Chrisost. de sancto. &amp; ado. spi</note> falsly pretend the holy ghost. And againe, if any thing be brought vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to vs (saith he) vnder the name of the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ghost besides the gospell, let vs not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it. For as Christ is the fulfilling of the law and the proph. so is the holy ghost the fulfilling of the gospel. Now with what spirit the Bishops of Rome haue expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs the holy scriptures) it is so manifest and apparantly knowne, that we need go no further but to their owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings &amp; canons sufficiently to proue that the Pope is Antichrist,<note place="margin">1. Io. 2.22.</note> and that his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats and disciples are the spirituall wolues of whom Christ in his gospell geueth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.15</note> though they couer themselues neuer so closely vnder the clothing of Christes true sheepe.</p>
   <p>Christ was humble and lowly. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in his owne person speaketh of him: I am a worme and not a man: ashame of men and the contempt of the people. And S. Paule saith he humbled himselfe,<note place="margin">Ps. 22.6 Phil. 2.8.</note> and became obedient vnto the death, euen the death of the crosse.</p>
   <p>Behold his parents, his birth, his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: beholde his life, his disciples, his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and his death: All were witnesses to his humility. He saith of himself the son of man hath not whereon to rest his head.
<pb facs="6"/> And to his disciples he saith,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.20.</note> The Kings of the Gentils raigne ouer them, &amp; they that beare rule ouer them are called gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Lordes: but you shall not be so.<note place="margin">Luk. 25.22 Ma. 11.29</note> And againe Learne of me that I am meek &amp; lowly in heart, and ye shall finde rest vnto your soules. Now on the other side, if wee consider the condition of Antichrist, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde his birth, his place, his chaire, his estate, his doctrine, his disciples and al his life. there shal nothing be seene but pomp and vaine glory: he is proud in life,<note place="margin">The i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Antichrist</note> proud in doctrine, proud in word, and proude in deedes. He is like vnto Lucifer, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himselfe before his brethren, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nations and kingdomes. He maketh kings and princes to kisse his feete, to cary his traine, to hold his stirrop. &amp;c. He clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth power ouer heauen and earth. Hee saith, he is Lord ouer all the worlde, the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings: that his authority reacheth vp into heauen &amp; down into hell: that whosoeuer he blesseth, is blessed, and that it is cursed whatsoeuer he curseth. He selleth merits, the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes, the sacrifice for the quicke and the dead. He maketh marchandise of the soules of men, He remoueth Kings &amp; deposeth the stats &amp; princes of the world.</p>
   <p>He taketh vpon him the authority and
<pb facs="7"/> name of the liuing GOD which made he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auen and earth,<note place="margin">Extrauag Io. 22.</note> euen the name of GOD the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ. And in this pride hee exceedeth all others that haue bene wicked. But some will perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture reply, that the Pope at this daye is not called GOD, but that hee abaceth and writeth himselfe by a title of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and is called so the seruant of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts. Thus (indeede) he is written: but marke how much the matter is amended.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Extra. de Maior &amp; obedien.</note>This seruaunt saith, I doe make holy the vnholy. I do iustifie the wicked. I doe forgiue sins. I open and no man shutteth. This seruaunt can say, that whosoeuer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth not him, shall be rooted out: and that he may dispence for any commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the old or new testament.<note place="margin">9 Que. 3. cuncta pet. de pal de pot. pa. Art. 4.</note> No man may iudge this seruant. For (they say) the Pope is exempted from all law of man, &amp; again, neither all the clergy, nor all the wholeworld, may either iudge or depose the Pope. Such a power this seruant of seruāts claimeth to himself, what greater power may be geuen vnto God? And this power the Pope at this day challēgeth as proper to his seat: that he hath the authority which is due vnto Christ ouer his Church none may say he doth erre, or aske why hee doth so.</p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p>Now the first Sheepes clothing (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall the false Prophetes and members of Antichristes schoole doe vse to hide and couer their deuelish hypocrisie) is fasting, prayer, almes deedes,<note place="margin">The first sheeps clo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing wherwith the false Prophets doe hide thēselues.</note> and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde holinesse of life. The which things when they are don syncerely by Gods true ministers and faithfull children: then are they (in deede) the right clothing of his sheepe: but when such false teachers do put on the same: then are they counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite clokes to deceaue the simple. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may perceaue, that outwarde holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life is not the onely true token of Christianitie.<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</note> Secondly they doe hide themselues vnder the sheepes clothing of ordinary power and authoritie, long suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession and lawefull calling, to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, vnder the which title, (like wolues) they haue crept into the Church, and from time to time most cruelly persecuted Gods good people, and the doctrine by them taught.<note place="margin">The third.</note> Thirdly they are hid and couered vnder the goodly name and title of holy Apostolical &amp; Catholike church; to the ende they might make men beleeue, that all their doctrines, traditions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises of newe worship proceeded not from themselues, but were established by the perpetuall consent of the church, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb facs="8"/> by the sentence and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy counselles, fathers &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and yet (beeing rightly and truely examined) it is nothing so.</p>
   <p>They tell vs that they haue their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Masse, their half cōmunion &amp; their trifling ceremonies frō the Apostles. And all this (God knoweth) they proue by full simple coniectures, because Christ saide to his Apostles:<note place="margin">Io. 16.12. 1. Co. 11.34.</note> I haue yet many things to say vnto you, but ye cānot beare thē now. And because S. Paul said to the Corinth. Other thinges will I set in order when I come. And although it were true that they haue not deuised these things of thēselues but haue receiued thē al frō the Apostles and holy Fathers (which thing their owne conscience knoweth to be most vntrue) yet notwithstanding the same things so recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, they haue fowly defaced with sundry their superstitions. They haue made them necessary to saluatiō: they haue bound the people no lesse to them, then to the lawe of God: &amp; so haue they made thē snares for Christian consciences. And therefore if it were so that the thing it self came frō the fathers, yet the abuse thereof came from themselues: and for the same they haue taught the people to breake Gods cōman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demēt.<note place="margin">Esay. 1.22.</note> Thus haue they mingled gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb facs="8"/> wine with their puddle water:<note place="margin">Mat. 23.24 Mat. 16.6.</note> thus haue they strained gnats &amp; swallowed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels: this is the very leauen of the Scribs &amp; Phariseis which Christ calleth hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie. Therfore if so be the thing it selfe, they haue thus receaued (in respect of substance) be al one: yet being thus abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed (in respect of their superstitions and deformities) it is none one.</p>
   <p>Furthermore as a Lyon is discouered by his clawes (what garment so euer he haue vpon him) euen so these spirituall wolues (though they be couered with the clothing of Christes true sheepe:<note place="margin">The claws of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall wolues.</note> yet) if you looke vpon their clawes, you shall quickly espie thē what they are.<note place="margin">The first</note> One of their clawes is cōfidence in the holines of their life, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they do not only aduance themselues as iust before God &amp; the worlde: but also contemne &amp; despise al other. Such a claw had the Pharisei that Christ speaketh of, who in disdaine of the poore sinful (but yet repentant) Publican, maketh his vaunt in this manner:<note place="margin">Lu. 18.21.</note> I thanke shee (O Lorde) that I am not as other men are, extorcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, vniust, adulterers nor as this Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can &amp;c. Such are these religious men which in these dayes make their vaunts, that they are not only able so far to fulfill the law of God that they may be accōpted righteous themselues: but also that they
<pb facs="9"/> haue their workes of supererogation and merites which may be solde and applyed to the benefite of other. This is knowen to be the common doctrine of the church of Rome at this day.<note place="margin">A second clawe.</note> Another clawe of these countrfeited wolues is a certaine peculiar holinesse, consisting in the obseruation of mans traditions and deuises: of which cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they make greater account, then of the commandementes of God. Such they were whom Christ sharpely reproueth say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:<note place="margin">Mat. 15.3.</note> ye transgresse the commandementes of God by your tradition. Such they are which account themselues holier then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and (aboue all other) take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the goodly cloke of religious men, because they liue after the rule of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicke, Francis, Dominicke &amp;c. or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they weare this or that fashion of apparell, abstaine from this or that kinde of meates, obseruing the choyse of dayes, vowe of single life, and diuers other like fancies of mans brayne, in comparison whereof the commandementes of God are smally or nothing among them regarded.</p>
   <p>The Phariseis sought to please men and to deceaue the people they taught them to walke in the wayes of their forefathers, to beleeue as they beleeued, to do as they had done. They flattered them and saide, you
<pb facs="9"/> are the church of God:<note place="margin">Mat. 23.14. Luk. 20.47. Eze. 13.2. &amp;. 34.2.</note> you are gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: you are the sonnes of Abraham: you cannot erre, you cannot be deceaued. The Scribes and the Phariseis deuowred vppe widowes houses vnder pretence of longe prayers: They gaue almes and made mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of their almes giuing: They fasted and made money of their fasting. This did the Scribes and Phariseis, the which although are dead, yet their doinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue still: their name is taken away, but their profession abideth, As they made gaines of their prayers, of their almes and fasting; so doe the Papistes make great gaynes and waxe rich vnder pretence of holinesse. They haue brought in a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of wilful chastitie and forbidden ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in some whole estate of men. They haue forbidden to eate certaine meates vpon certaine dayes: whereas God hath left meates as free to the choyse of man, as hee left his sunne to shine freely to the vse of all men, asnd they make free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie for money to eate what euery man liketh. They make money of purgatorie, money of pardons, &amp; money of their mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. They make money of Peter, and of Paule: of the Apostles and Martirs &amp; of Christ himselfe. These are they of whom S. Peter speaketh,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.3.</note> Through coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes
<pb facs="10"/> shal they with fained words make marchandise of your soules. If they be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked frō whom they had their Masse, their inuocation of saincts, prayer for the dead, images, their Deifying of Sainctes, their erecting of alters vnto them, their torches candlelights, pilgrimages, &amp; al the rest of their beggerly trash: they are neuer able to aunswere one iot for the maintenance thereof out of the worde of God: but wee will follow (say they) our fathers &amp; their traditions.<note place="margin">Beholde the groūd of Popish religion.</note> God giue them grace (if it be his will) that they may see their owne va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: that they may know that they are but miserable &amp; mortall men, &amp; that a time shall come, when their hypocrisie shall be disclosed: that they may become godly, &amp; be (in deede) the ministers of Christ, &amp; disposers of the secrets of God: And that they may serue God in truth, in holines, &amp; righteousnes all the dayes of their life.</p>
   <p>And now to returne to your worships. I most humbly beseech you to accept this my poore labour, which I offer (vnder your names) to the whole church of God. The which as I know it commeth vnlooked for, not only in respect of your selues, but also of diuers other that knowe me (aswel) in that countrey where I was born, as also in other places: so also it may seem very rash
<pb facs="10"/> and needles. For who am I, that I should take vpon me to publish any thing? The vnworthiest of many hundreds, &amp; the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablest of many thousands. And yet seeing many things more simple, lesse needful &amp; profitable, are both permitted and suffred to come abrode: I am not altogether dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, neither hath any man iust cause to accuse me in this my simple enterprise. I knowe these be the dayes of learning &amp; knowledge &amp; that there be great store of learned deuines in our land (whom I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech the Lorde to blesse.<note place="margin">Mar. 12.42.43. Luk. 21.2.3.</note>) and yet the two mites of the poore widowe cast into the treasurie (amonge the great giftes of the welthy) are not to be refused. The causes that moued me to dedicate this first fruit of my simple trauaile vnto your worships (aboue al other) are these. First your great goodnes from time to time shewed towards me and my friendes: the which called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee contitually to shewe some token of thankefulnesse for the same. For I must needes confesse that it hath vttered it selfe many and sundry ways, and that not without a certaine friendly or rather fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care of my well dooing. Secondlie, that it might be a meane, (through the assistaunce of Gods spirite) to kindle and inflame your heartes with an earnest
<pb facs="11"/> zeale to the glorious gospell of the sonne of God, by dayly and continuall exercise and practise wherein you might be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently furnished with spirituall armur to endure constantly vnto the ende (as good souldiers of Iesus Christ) against all the assaults of Sathan and his wicked instruments which (doe or may) come in sheepes clothing to deceaue you and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray your soules from the way of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For of this am I certaine, that there will not want false prophets entycing you from Christ, and that many stumbling blockes wilbe cast (namely and especially in your way Master &amp; Mistresse I efferis as once hertofore I presumed to aduertise you priuately by letter) to the ende you might be discouraged from the way of the Lorde. But beware (I beseech you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine) of their Angelicall or Seraphicall shewe of heauenly life. Haue not by and by their doctrine in admiration but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looke vnto the clawes of these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wolues and indifferently (without affection) examine the grounde of their profession, by the rule and touchstone of the worde of God: and you shall prooue that they deale deceitefully &amp; with guile: that they be false Apostles and deceitefull workers: that they goe about to beguile
<pb facs="11"/> your senses and to blinde your eyes: that they call you to worship an Idoll in steed of the true and liuing God: and that they would lead you out of light into darknesse: from truth into error: from knowledge vnto ignorance.</p>
   <p>If you shall vouchsafe to reade this little booke, and to examine it throughly &amp; indifferently by the word of God: and then (it beeing effectually confirmed by the same) to make your profit according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and (as it is committed to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: so) to maintaine and defende it: I shall not onely be satisfied and thinke my payes sufficiently recompenced: but also be greatly encouraged hartily to pray vnto the Lorde to encrease the giftes of his holy spirite in you, that you may goe forwarde more and more to performe that dutie in obedience which he requireth at your handes: that you may ouerleape all the lets that Sathan can cast in your way &amp; continue in the certainty of true faith: and that you may be fully setled vppon the death and passion of our Lorde Iesus Christ being assured that the same onelie is of sufficient abilitie to drawe you out of the dungeon of death.</p>
   <p>And I beseech your worshippes, that as God in aboundant measure, hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
<pb facs="12"/> endued you with all thinges neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for this life: (whereof many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes feele the want) so without ceasing you would prayse and magnifie him for the same. And as you are so nearely ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, not onely by reason of your possessions, but especially by the bonde of mariage that you are brethren &amp; sisters: that so you would ioyne togeather in the sincere profession of the glorious gospel of the sonne of God, and so goe forward more and more in practise therof: that the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel (being rooted in your heartes) it may bring foorth sanctification, the true seale of your adoption, that you may feele his goodnesse in the assurance of that euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and heauenly truth. Beware of these two cankers I beseech you, that corrupt the whole world, I meane, pride and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse: Let them not once be named among you as becommeth sainctes.<note place="margin">Eph. 5.3. Col. 3.5.</note> A day will come, when the Lorde will fill your hope with better things then al this world can giue you. Stande fast in his trueth in these slippery dayes, and aboue all, let his glorye, and the aduancement of his worde, be deare and precious vnto you. In Gods matters, let his will bee the rule thereof, and not your owne wisedome and affections, Examine your selues often by
<pb facs="12"/> it, and neglect not the pure preaching of the same. Delight in the lawe of the Lord and be good examples to others. Care not for the contempt of the worlde, but holde fast a good conscience, that you may be approued of God. And our Lorde Iesus Christ giue you the forgiuenesse of all your sinnes, and the peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of your conscience. The Lorde let all his blessinges fall vppon you, that you may see the riches and treasures of his mercie: that you may be filled with all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with the spirit: that you may behold the glory of the kingdome of god, &amp; those thinges be reuealed vnto you by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, which hee hath prepared for them that loue him. Amen.</p>
