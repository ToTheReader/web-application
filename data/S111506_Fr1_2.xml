A <hi>Glasse</hi> of Steele, farre truer then that <hi>Mathematicall one,</hi> whereby some haue proiected to discouer with more then Humane Spectacles <hi>Another World in the Moone; of Seas, Lands,</hi> and <hi>Woods,</hi> like Ours, before it was lately dis-robed of this latter Ornament by the greedinesse of a few Iron <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

   </p>
   <p>The maine Cause of their Destruction proceeded from their Carnall matches, <hi>The Sonnes of GOD, with the Daughters of Reprobates,</hi> where we trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse

      </gap> contrary to our <hi>Christian duties,</hi> who haue bin now enlightned for the space of these foure score yeares. Here likewise you may find <hi>preseruatiues and Cures</hi> both to preuent the imminent plagues, (which we haue worthily deserued,) as to heale the most disordred, both Bodily and Spiritually, (if they be not past Grace;) yea, and to dispossesse them of Diuels, without prophane <hi>Holy Water,</hi> or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish <hi>Exorcismes.</hi> But before these, as a <hi>Frontispice</hi> vpon a Gate, I haue fixed the foure first Verses of purpose, that once a day at least, you may repeat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

And for the rest, if you read them once a Weeke, I doubt not, but you shall receiue thereby some spirituall Comfort among other Helpes to <hi>Deuotion,</hi> which are not wanting in your <hi>House.</hi> Howsoeuer, I am assured your <hi>Cogitations</hi> shalbe somewhat rouzed vp to looke about you, and to make some doubt, that you haue not many yeares yet vnexpired of your <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> here on <hi>Earth.</hi> For our worst part must rot, before it rise vp to <hi>Immortality.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The thought of <hi>Death,</hi> I confesse, is terrible, and hath perplexed many, specially, <hi>Great persons,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> of famous <hi>Memory,</hi> albeit in all other matters an incomparable religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Princesse,</hi> and adorned with masculine Vertues, yet <hi>She</hi> could not endure to heare of <hi>Old Age,</hi> nor <hi>Death.</hi> For when a Learned <hi>Bishop</hi> of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance had in a zealous <hi>Sermon</hi> admonished her to thinke on her last <hi>End,</hi> by reason of her great <hi>Age,</hi> which few <hi>Princes</hi> had attayned vnto, and of the <hi>Climactericall</hi> yeare of her Life, which hapned at that time, <hi>She</hi> tooke it so impatiently that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>

for his good intentions, was not only distasted by her, but put for a time to some trouble. Yet <hi>God,</hi> who neuer forsakes them, that quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues like <hi>Men</hi> in his Seruice, did euer sithence, vntill his Decease powre downe many Worldly Blessings vpon him, so that I thinke few <hi>Bishops</hi> of this Kingdome left behind them to their Wiues and Children such faire <hi>Estates,</hi> as be left vnto his Wife and Children. The which questionlesse were conferred vppon him, to let the Cowards and Claw-backes of the times vnderstand, what a sweet smelling Sacrifice in his sacred Presence is <hi>Magnanimity grounded on Faith and piety;</hi> as well appeares by those <hi>Martyres in Queene</hi> Maries <hi>dayes,</hi> for whose glorious sakes <hi>the Eternall Maiesty</hi> at the intercession of those <hi>Martyres Generall, his dearely beloued Sonne,</hi> did by shortning of those <hi>Marian dayes</hi> restore that <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> to this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> which hath chased hence those <hi>False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who set to sale the Bodies and Soules of Men,</hi> togither with the Rabblement of <hi>Idolaters, Abbey-Lubbers, Fayries,</hi> and <hi>Hob-Goblins;</hi> and doubtlesse will continue the same vntill the Worlds end: Notwithstanding these our Present and last Conflicts with the <hi>Spirituall Dragon,</hi> and with those Spirits, which issued out of his mouth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we haue much a do to escape their Ambuscadoes, Quirkes, and socret Stratagems practised by our Schoole-men, which are farre more dangerous then their open Violences, being such, as it is Written, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deceiue the very Elect, if it were possible.</hi> But to returne where I haue digressed, the <hi>Remembrance of Death</hi> will prepare vs for th' other World What can be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   </p>
   <p>Seeing that <hi>Death</hi> brings with it so great <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> I hope you will not be offended with me, it by Calculating our <hi>Ancestors Yeares, for these three last D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>s,</hi> I seeme to put you in <hi>Minde,</hi> that you ought not to expect much longer time, then they enioyed. <hi>Our great Grand father,</hi> Hugh Vaughan, <hi>Gentle-man Vsher to King</hi> Henry <hi>the 7th</hi> who is Famous in our <hi>English Chronicles,</hi> for the <hi>Iustes in Richmond, before the sayd King,</hi> agaynst Sir <hi>Iames Parker,</hi> about our <hi>Ancestors</hi> Armes and Scutcheons: Where the sayd Sir <hi>Iames</hi> lost his life, in the first Encounter. Our sayd <hi>Great Grand-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> dyed before he was fifty yeares old. Our <hi>Grand-father,</hi> who built our House, nay yours by Birth right, (called <hi>The Golden Groue,)</hi> dyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the fiftieth sixth yeare of his Age. Our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> likewise about those yeares, payd <hi>Nature</hi> her Debt. Why then should we expect for a greater Lot? We want not aboue three or foure yeares of theirs. But suppose we should arriue to seauenty, or eighty, or by the helpe of this <hi>Dyet,</hi> which I here discouer, to the long Age of the <hi>Swethens,</hi> it would but augment our sinnes and sorrows. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs liue mindfull of that, which cannot be auoyded.</p>
   <p>For which purpose a <hi>Pagan King</hi> vsed euery mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to haue a <hi>Dead mans Skull</hi> brought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him, that he was a mortall Creature. So in like manuer we see in our dayes many Persons wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Rings with a Deathes Head engrauen in the seale:</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
Others with a Posie on the inside, including the Remembrance of Death. <hi>Memento mori.</hi> But because this Subiect breeds sadnesse, I haue added some more plausible <hi>passages</hi> to profit the <hi>Body,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as the <hi>Minde.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now hauing discharged the <hi>part of a Brother,</hi> in this necessary point, whereto all <hi>Adams Posterity</hi> are subiect, <hi>Sooner or Later:</hi> I will now shew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I entituled this Diminutiue rapture, <hi>The New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers Cure,</hi> more for others satisfaction, who know me not, and yet may by our <hi>Free Charter of Election, and the illumination of Gods working Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> meete with some <hi>passage</hi> in this <hi>Cure,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them sure in their <hi>Christian Calling,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps mooue some to lend their helping hands to the Building vp of our <hi>New Church,</hi> in that remote <hi>Countrey,</hi> then for any desire I haue to reiterate a matter of <hi>Tauetology,</hi> like the <hi>Cuckoes Song,</hi> vnto you, who from the beginning haue bin acquainted with my Actions in this kinde. About thirteene yeares past, being interessed by Patent in the <hi>South part of New found Land,</hi> from our late King of happy memory: I transported thither certayne <hi>Colomes</hi> of Men and Women at my owne Charge: After which, finding the Burthen too heauy for my weake <hi>Shoulders,</hi>

in this Kingdome, for the setling of my priuate Fortunes, which for ought I see, I must chiefly relye vppon to supply me there, vntill the <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be better strengthned, and fearing the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> who threatens those, which causelessely looke backe at his Plow: I sent forth, (like <hi>Noahs Doue)</hi> my late Workes, called <hi>The Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fleece,</hi> and my <hi>Cambrensium Caroleia,</hi> to stirre vp our <hi>Ilanders</hi> Mindes to assist and support for a time our <hi>New-found Ile,</hi> which rightly may besti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Great Britaines Sister,</hi> or <hi>Britanniol,</hi> in regard that for these fourescore yeares and vpwards, She hath furnished vs with Fish and Traine, which by Exchange returne vs sundry kinds of Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
   <p>In like manner to let the World vnderstand, that my Zeale to <hi>New-found Land</hi> is not frozen. I tooke her for my <hi>Gossipto</hi> this Pigmey infant, which now is named <hi>the New-Landers Cure.</hi> But why should I among so many thousands of Greater Power aspire to such an <hi>Atlanticke Waight,</hi> which is able to crush into the Earth another <hi>Sutton?</hi> It is the <hi>Lord of Heauen and Earth,</hi> whose Powerfull Presence O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-lookes all the foure Quarters of the Earth, who preferres sometimes the most simple to His Workes of Honour, before the Grand <hi>Epicures</hi> of the World, As the <hi>Lillies of the Fields, before the Royalties of Saiomon,</hi> euen our Mighty <hi>GOD,</hi> who is so wonderful in all his Deedes, made ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   <p>For this cause, and also to edifie my Country with those <hi>Bookes,</hi> which from time to time, euen from my Youth vp I Published, hath He bestowed
<pb facs="5"/>
a double Talent vppon me. For these <hi>Ends</hi> it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>His Sacred Maiesty</hi> to reserue my Seruice for the Publicke <hi>Good,</hi> by preseruing my Life most <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously</hi> aboue the ordinary sort of men from Fire and Water, and twice from his Pestilentiall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</p>
   <p>Vppon a <hi>Christmas Day</hi> 1602. In <hi>France</hi> at a Passage of two Leagues broad betwixt <hi>Tremblado</hi> and <hi>Marena</hi> falling ouer board a Ship, in a most terrible Tempest, I floated amidst the Waues of the raging Sea, being ignorant of Swimming, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a quarter of an houre: Onely with an Oare in my hand, which casually fell vnto me, by what meanes to this present, I cannot tell. And which is most strange to Humane sense, the Storme calmed suddainly, during my aboad in this perplexity, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Barke, from which I fell, found leasure to turne about, and take me vp being ouer-wearied, and at the very point to throw away the Oare, and perish. Assoone as I was taken vp, the Storme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne againe so suriously, that the Mast brake within a foote of the But, and with the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ll had like to ouer-turne vs all.</p>
   <p>In <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1608. I was stricken with a sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dampe, my <hi>House</hi> was battred about my eares with Lightning and Thunder, the <hi>Artilleries of Gods Glory,</hi> in that fearefull manner, as your Selfe beheld the next day, after the ruines of the Catastrophe, not without great astonishment and admiration, how miraculously I escaped.</p>
   <p>In <hi>August</hi> 1603. in the hottest time of the <hi>Sicknesse,</hi> in my returne from beyond the Seas, I was not affraid to stay a while in <hi>London.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
And during the last and greatest Pestilence, 1625. I frequented the <hi>Citty</hi> from the beginning, to the latter end, as our famous Country-man Sir <hi>Thomas Button,</hi> and our vertuous Cousen his <hi>Lady,</hi> in whole House I continded the most part of that <hi>Summer</hi> can beare me Witnesse, when you and others of my Friends wondred at my Boldnesse. By which Extraordinary deliuerances I gather, that his <hi>Omnipotent Maiesty</hi> hath ordayned me, as a Fire brand so often taken out of the Flames, for some glorious seruice of His, eyther to do some good vnto my <hi>Follow Christians</hi> by my Publicke <hi>Writings,</hi> or else to aduance this hopefull <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by my personall paines and industry. And if I faile in my Presages for this last, I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that I shall no tlight vpon a worse <hi>Fortune</hi> then chanced vnto a <hi>Gentle-woman</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> who hauing her destiny told her by an <hi>Astrologer,</hi> (as that Sexe like <hi>Eue</hi> is ouer-credulous,) that she should be married to a <hi>Prince,</hi> she refused many good Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in hope of her Princely preferment, vntill after many yeares expectation in vaine, fearing, as the Prouerbe is, <hi>To lead Apesin Hell,</hi> she consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at last to marry with the <hi>Principall of an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity,</hi> who in that place had the Title of <hi>Prince.</hi> If I misse in my actuall performance for <hi>New-found Land,</hi> it lyes not in the power of Flesh and Blood, to take away my Zealous intentions, nor can my Foes (if any such at all haue) deny, but that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ueaner men then I, haue had the Lucke to be married to the <hi>Muses:</hi> As also the mightiest <hi>Lords</hi> of the earth haue thought themselues graced to be entertained their Seruants and <hi>Woers.</hi> The truth is, I am ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted both to the <hi>Muses,</hi> and <hi>New-found Land.</hi> And
<pb facs="6"/>
I could wish, that I had that Command ouer some <hi>Misers</hi> Purses, or of theirs, who may dye without <hi>Issue,</hi> and leaue their Fortunes to thanklesse World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, for the benefit of <hi>New-found Land,</hi> as <hi>Marke Anthony</hi> had at <hi>Athens.</hi> For when the Citizens had cologuingly presented him with the <hi>Image</hi> of their <hi>Goddesse Minerua,</hi> because he wanted a Wife: He answered, that he kindly accepted of their Offer; and therefore he must needes haue 1000. Talents of them, as a Dowry fit for so great a <hi>Princesse.</hi> The charge certainely is great now at the first, yet if there were but twenty such Persons but of my poore meanes and resolution, I would not doubt, but before seauen yeares, our <hi>New-found Land</hi> should not onely double those sayles of Ships, which Trade thither at the present, but likewise the yeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gaines, which our Marchants doe reape from that Country, for these many yeares togither, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be aboue 200000. pounds a yeare. Indeed there be some Hopes that the <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Bristow</hi> Marchants will now after these late stormes settle there some <hi>Iron-workes, Glasse-houses,</hi> and for the making of <hi>Salt.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And likewise that my Lord of <hi>Faulk and,</hi> and our Noble Brother in Law, Sir <hi>Henry Salubury</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet, with some <hi>Gentlemen of North-Wales,</hi> will the next Spring proceede to doe somewhat in that Country, which with open armes awaites for their comming. And also there be others out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to whom I haue freely as I haue receiued, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed <hi>Grants,</hi> which haue faithfully promised to <hi>Plant</hi> in their seuerall Diuisions. The which, if they performe, my costly Cares for <hi>Sacrifice</hi> would be the lesse.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>
But because my Experience teacheth me, that we oftne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> meete with backe-sliding and inconstant men, like Worldly <hi>Demas,</hi> then with bountifull Conuerts, like that <hi>Terentiam Demea,</hi> I cannot build my Foundation on such slippery mould, but must resolue with my owne poore Estate, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue what I haue long since fruitlessely begunne.</p>
   <p>After this sort those renowned <hi>Monsieurs, De Monts,</hi> and <hi>Poutrincourt</hi> were deluded aboue two yeares, by some Courtiers at <hi>Paris,</hi> and therefore they concluded atlast, no more to trust any but themselues, for the Erecting of their <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> in <hi>Canada,</hi> two hundred Leagues beyond our <hi>New found Land.</hi> Hap what hap may, I haue broake the Ice, I haue past the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicon.</hi>

   <p>In the meane time, let me intreate you to conceiue charitably of our <hi>New-Land Plantation,</hi> which by one hard Winter, among many more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, is like to suffer; and to regard this Little <hi>God-child</hi> of hers.
