      <hi>T. P. To his louing freend</hi> Mayster Clowes.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>IN tempests safe by Pylots skill we sayle,</l>
      <l>In flattering snares true friendship vs vpholds:</l>
      <l>From loathsome greese good comfort doth vs bayle,</l>
      <l>These three in one, <hi>Clowes</hi> Booke to vs vnfolds.</l>
      <l>He stirres the helme, and friendly comfort lends,</l>
      <l>When surges rage, when snares, when griefe off ends.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>When outward sores as boystrous waues do swell,</l>
      <l>When venime hid, as flattring tongues do sting,</l>
      <l>When both as greese each hart with torments quell,</l>
      <l>When naught but death doth seeme releefe to bring,</l>
      <l>Then <hi>Clowes</hi> thy Pylot can from Sea to shore,</l>
      <l>From payne to ioy, from sicke to sound restore.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Once <hi>Aesculapius Theseus</hi> sonne did cure,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Machaon</hi> once did <hi>Philoctetes</hi> saue,</l>
      <l>Their prayse for this vnsteyned doth endure,</l>
      <l>Such iust reward good skill and knowledge haue:</l>
      <l>Whome fame, vnsought for, followeth at the last.</l>
      <l>Which sought for, by vnskilfull, flyes as fast.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>Clowes</hi> as <hi>Apollos</hi> sonne, by Art is sayd,</l>
      <l>Not one, but sundry <hi>Hippolites</hi> to saue,</l>
      <l>And <hi>Banester Machaon</hi> seemes, whose ayde,</l>
      <l>As many <hi>Phyloctetes</hi> dayly craue.</l>
      <l>How then, shall these not liue in trumpe of same?</l>
      <l>Since thousands cured shall extoll their name?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Amongst which sort, my selfe although the last,</l>
      <l>Yet not the least part of their cure did find.</l>
      <l>Whose arme past cure, an Atrophy did wast,</l>
      <l>And sinewes shronke contracted out of kind,</l>
      <l>Which past all skill, vnskilfull Surgeons thought,</l>
      <l>To health by skill these skilfull Surgeons brought.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="16"/>
      <l>But as the sweetest cloath the moathes do eate,</l>
      <l>And freshest Rose the cancker seekes to spill.</l>
      <l>And as the statelyest towres the winde doth beate,</l>
      <l>And fretting lightning strikes the loftiest hill,</l>
      <l>So enuy seekes the deadly foe of fame,</l>
      <l>By slanderous toongs to hinder their good name.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The Dogs their vomit loues, the Goates their crags,</l>
      <l>The Swine delight to tumble in the mire,</l>
      <l>Our common prouerbe telles that scuruie nags,</l>
      <l>Are fittest for to please a scabbed squire.</l>
      <l>No maruell then though folly such embrace,</l>
      <l>Which seeke by lyes these skilfull mens disgrace.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Yet they shall shyne as gold that rusteth not,</l>
      <l>When these as drosse with shame consumd shall lye,</l>
      <l>Repining much that no report may blot,</l>
      <l>The rightfull prayse which of these twayne shall flye.</l>
      <l>So Momus shall with these compared fleet,</l>
      <l>As doth the Beetle vnder Roses sweet.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Feare not therefore these slanderous toongs reports,</l>
      <l>Which strike the best, but bad vntoucht do saue.</l>
      <l>Of your good names they batter not the forts,</l>
      <l>But hating skilfull, shew what skill they haue.</l>
      <l>Continue fast, strange cures procure your fame,</l>
      <l>Do good, and none but bad will touch your name.</l>
