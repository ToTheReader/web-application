      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the great wisedome and care of our Honourable and religious Lord, now trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from Earth to Heauen,<note n="a" place="margin">Made about three yeares before his death.</note> in his last Will and Testament, to giue directions in seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall passages vnto vs, who are the Actours in this last Sceane, of his decent and Christian Burialls.</p>
   <p>First for his blessed soule, that he voluntarily resignes and bequeathes into the mighty hands of GOD his Creatour; into the gracious armes of GOD the Sonne, his Redeemer; and into the comfortable fellowship of GOD the Holy-Ghost his sanctifyer: Three persons, but one GOD, blessed for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uer.</p>
   <p>His blessed soule thus bequeathed to be admitted into the Congregation of the sacred Trinity; into those celestiall and euerlasting habitations. Then hee commends the care and charge of his body to his surviuers with these ensuing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in many circumstances.</p>
   <p>First, for the <hi>Vbi</hi> or place, where it should rest, Secondly, for the manner <hi>(How)</hi> it should bee brought to its place of rest: And then, hee directs vs in this sacred businesse, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I meane, the preaching of this Sermon.</p>
   <p>For the first circumstance, the <hi>Vbi,</hi> or place of rest, it is in the wombe of this holy ground;<note n="b" place="margin">Braynton Church in Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</note> and more punctually, in that honourable and rich Monument with his elect Lady, &amp; beloued Wife; whose Christian death &amp; dissolution divided their bodies, not their soules:<note n="c" place="margin">He liued <hi>a</hi> Widovver 30 yeares.</note> witnesse those many yeares he hath spent as a mourner of her Funerals; witnesse that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall Monument for them both, to testifie to the world, that happie vnion, of which, neither life, nor death could cause a disiunction. Thus did the sparke of his neuer-dying loue, guided by a diuine providence, kindle and inflame his heart with a desire, not only of dying in the same bedde on
<pb facs="5"/>earth, but also of lying in the same bed vnder earth: where they might dwell together againe, as in a house of safety and peace, vntill they rise jointly to a joyfull and glorious resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
   <p>And as we are thus confin'd to the <hi>Vbi,</hi> or place of rest: so are we restrained in the manner <hi>(How)</hi> he would be brought thither, not in the pompous traine of Heraulds, and glorious Ensignes, nor in dumbe ceremonies, and superfluous shewes, but in a decent &amp; Christian manner, without pompe<note n="d" place="margin">These are the vvords of the Will.</note> or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie.</p>
   <p>And as we are thus confin'd in one Circumstance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd in another: so are we prescrib'd in the third place for the preaching of this <hi>Sermon,</hi> in the face of this Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whilst he wils a <hi>Sermon,</hi> not a Panegyrick cloath'd in the colours of Rhetoricke, nor yet a Funerall Oration, to blazen his Honours, to hyperbolize in his praises, or to draw a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious line of Progenitours. No. <hi>Mallet precibus in coelum ferri, quàm plausibus;</hi> as his soule went vp to Heauen in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: so he had rather his body should bee entomb'd in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, then in vniust and ouer-praising. Therefore he wills a Sermon for the advancing of Gods glory, a Sermon for the instruction of his Children, and friends in the feare of God, and to stirre them vp to<note n="e" place="margin">These are the vvords of the Will.</note> liue wel, and dye well: which by the grace of God we shall doe, out of the</p>
