   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>WHen first I entertained thoughts of composing a few lines, for my own private use, (having opportunity, more than enough, without begging, or borrowing from other occasions) I did not intend that any (unlesse it were
<pb facs="6"/>
some familiar friend) should so much as see my melancholly Muse in her closet, much lesse to see her in an open market, especially in so meane a dresse, (it being no other, but that which shee was wrapt in at her first breathing, without altering matter, fashion, or trimming.) But because I kept her not so close, as I might have done, some, which I call friends, have betrayed her, and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me in my purpose: for shee was seene walking abroad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my consent. Thus when I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb facs="6"/>
that when I gave her an inch, she did take an ell; I sought to restraine her. But ever when she was faultie in this kinde, shee came not home alone, but brought one or other to excuse her, and to plead for her libertie, and so being backt by her acquaintance (which she had got in a short time) shee grew bold; then I conceived, that if I did not give her leave, shee would take it unaskt; then part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for feare, that she might be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and partly by perswasions, whether willingly, or unwillingly,
<pb facs="7"/>
I gave consent that shee might come and goe at her pleasure, But withall, charging her that shee should keepe a good decorum, that I by her meanes, might receive no blame.</p>
   <p>I suppose it is not expected, that she should goe in gaudy attire, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I desire, that shee should take up any upon trust, nor borrow much, for she hath no necessitie of it; I have not mounted upon Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles wings, nor pierc'd the clouds for words to advance her worth, but in tearmes nearest at hand,
<pb facs="7"/>
such as I am best acquainted withall, and as any indifferent Reader may well understand. Shee is not adorned onely with leaves, but she beareth fruit too, is blacke frosts hinder not, or wild beasts crop not the branches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come to maturitie, or a worme ingender in the root; from envious tongues to cause it to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
   <p>If she meet with any that will not afford her a good word, yet let him vouchsafe her a good looke, aud shee will not die in his
<pb facs="8"/>
debt: wherein she failes (if thou be able to judge) take it in the best sense, she gives occasion, to use thy charitie in conception, in that she sung in winter, her throat might be hoarse, and being the first time that she sung, she would not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine her voice; I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, but she can answer for her selfe, to give satisfaction to any reasonable man.</p>
   <p>But because I have knowne her from her infancie, and seene her behaviour, being alwayes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, temperate, sober, loving, and
<pb facs="8"/>
honest, not apt to flatter or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble, nor yet to hide the faults of her friends, neither censorious, or harsh to any, but to such as doe more than deserve it.</p>
   <p>I cannot but commend her; and I could wish that shee were grafted upon a better stock: that her fruit might be more pleasant.</p>
   <p>Shee began to plucke at the wings of Time, but seeing the feathers fal so fast of themselves, she stept upon vanitie, which shee found to be nothing but the ruines of time, so staid not there; then
<pb facs="9"/>
beeing cloathed in mourning weeds, and in a melancholly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, with a sad tune, shee sings a Tragedie of Darknesse; but Light comming in, she changeth her note, putting on fresh gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, falles in love with him, and sings his praise. But hee proving somewhat inconstant, here could not make a match, but remaines in promise for after times. But Life being the thing that hath gained such report, and so much desired, she tunes a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie; but finding the miseries
<pb facs="9"/>
of it breake in here upon her, and that it is not the thing that it is taken for, being full of changes, her concords falls into discords; Then shee sets her selfe against Sinne, the cause of all disorders, having assistants which beares their parts, and the burthen of the song, with the heavenly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and hell is forced to sing the base: then being in triumph, she ventures upon Death as a party with Sinne, and gets the day. But finding the day of execution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed, she frames her songs of
<pb facs="10"/>
degrees for her friends; to take off their hearts from those dying comforts, and sets them in a way, that they might not out-live their happinesse.</p>
   <p>The Verses are various in kinde as the subjects are, each one hath his severall. I need not shew, how those that are interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, doe agree with the bases, and how the couplets are entire, &amp;c. For such that know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them already, and for such as doe not, let time and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, teach them; Let those
<pb facs="10"/>
that are wise, affect matter more than words, but chiefly, that which tends to raise the soule in her flight heaven-ward, which my Muse in her songs desires. Now <hi>I</hi> leave her with you, use her well: shee hath undergone a heavie Presse to gaine your acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, shee will beare her owne charge, she will bee constant to you, her acquaintance will bring you profit, if you turne her not out of doores; howsoever she will speak the best, or say the least of her ill usage.</p>
