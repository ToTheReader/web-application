   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>OVGHT not, can not, and therefore will not omit (prouoked by the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the matter, compelled by the fast friendship of the Author (whome I haue long, and much loued,) and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by my owne priuate knowledge of the Gentlemans Intent, and trauailes) to publish my priuate good liking, Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and commendation of this booke: As, a testimoniall of my thankefull good will vnto him: A Seale of our vnfained friendship vnto others: and lastly, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte discharge, and satisfaction for my selfe. Which duely considered I haue burst out into these few rude lines, not to th'Ende I am able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasle praise vnto th'Author, (Because the lesse can not authorize the greater) but that I may gaine commendation to my selfe, onely for shew of a thankefull, and well willing minde. Seeing therefore of necessitie I must needes speake somewhat, this is my conceiued opinion: that, in this booke you shall feede your vnderstanding with a most delicate and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> foode, containing in it a sweete ioyce, and rare Quintessence of the best framed <hi>Monarchie:</hi> wherby the poore of vnderstanding in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of state may be enriched, and the riche of vnderstanding somewhat therin the better confirmed: and all sortes of men with an admiration of her <hi>Maiesties</hi> most Royall person, and perfect gouernement not a litle ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished: wherunto th'Authors whole intent onely directeth it selfe. And albeit his Diseourse be but small in quantitie, yet it exceedeth in qualitie. For that his writing is not obscure, but cleere: not forced, but free: not roughe or harshe, but smoothe, and pleasaunt: not out of order, but well vnited, methodicall, briefe, fullfraited with vatietie of matter, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all affected: briefly it is not painted with any glorious colours, but naked, (like the truth,) and in all pointes it is like vnto him selfe: who coueteth rather to be in this his Countrey as a tree in a garden to beare fruite, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>n as a tree to make a shew and shadow onely. Imploye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (I beseeche you) your leasure, to reade with a purged iudgement this his rare Enterprice, and by your good, and iust commendation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seeke to spurre others to treade these his good steppes: then by your discommendation to clippe their winges, which else of them selues would make the like slight. Which if you doe, (as if you paye your selues with reason you must needes doc,) you may incourage both him and many others to be your Creditors hereafter for the like, or greater Enterprises, Fare you well.</p>
