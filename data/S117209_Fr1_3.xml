   <p>
      <hi>Right Honorable,</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough such Ladies as your selfe, are either compared to rich Caskets, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning within thē more richer Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, or resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to precious Diamonds, made the more glorious by
<pb facs="3"/>
enameling, and the cunning of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: yet, I protest, beeing an eye-witnesse of your constant resort vnto wisedomes Feast; and apprehensiue, that you loue Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion meerely for Gods loue: that alone hath incited mee to select you the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this Discourse, whereby, I make no doubt, you shall not onely runne with <hi>Zacheus</hi> to the top of a Figge-tree to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold IESVS: but bee glad in your very soule, that your foot-steps are fixed in the way of saluation, and that you are now going on in the path, that will conduct you to new Ierusalem.</p>
   <p>The Worke it selfe is the Discouery of the vnswept corners of Popish Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: The Instrument wherewith it is done, though it bee not the Prophets Lanterne and Candle to search the great Citie: yet it is the opening of a Booke, wherein you may reade such loathsome particulars against Papistry, that in your friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, you will doe, as wee were wont to doe in <hi>England,</hi> euen spit at the naming of the Diuell: and in your owne, lift vp
<pb facs="3"/>
your hands to Heauen with thanksgiuing, that God hath blessed you with a better knowledge.</p>
   <p>The Author, is I confesse, no Diuine, but a penitent sinner, and one that would faine striue to be a doore-keeper in the House of GOD, who hath taken this mercy vpon him, to welcome him home with better acates, then to feed with the Hogges at the troughs: My name you shall sure finde at the last, which if it carry an vnpleasant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, oh bee thus honourable, to admit of one good qualitie, as the mirrour of his time Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> was wont to say. For a great many haue none, and no man hath all.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Your Honors humbly deuoted,</hi>
   </p>
   <p>T. G.</p>
