   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Neither haue, or can
forget (VVorship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
&amp; my very good
Friend) the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
entertainement
you gaue to my Booke, entituled
<hi>A Godly exercise for Christian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi>
neyther may I (without
iniurie to your good nature, and
impeach to my poore credite) let
slip opportunitie, wherein I may
shew my selfe thankefull for so
<pb facs="3"/>
great and vndeserued fauour. But
wading into the very bottome of
all my habilitie, and finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
sufficient to counteruaile
such kindnes: I am like the poore
<hi>Persian,</hi> who desirous to shew him
selfe thankefull to <hi>Alexander</hi> for
sparing his life, &amp; finding nothing
worthy to be giuen to so great
a Monarch, died with very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of sorow. Euen so worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Sir, the very conceit of my
want, though not able to stay me
as it did this <hi>Persian,</hi> yet striketh
me with such a confounded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
as closeth vp the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>wes
and arteries of my present iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
did not hope encourage me
with some better hap to come.</p>
   <p>Vntill which time my VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull
good friend, let this small
argument of a farre greater good
will, excuse my insufficiencie, and
win acceptance in your woonted
<pb facs="3"/>
affable nature: perswading your
selfe, that I liue, in hart and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
affection, next vnder God and
the Queene my gracious Mistres,
to do you the vtmost deuoire and
seruice I can.</p>
   <p>Now a little to informe you as
concerning this small Treatise, in
the iudgement of the learned, it
hath been commended for a very
godly and comfortable labour: in
that it discourseth of the most
high argument that may be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in writing, euen Loue, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and ende wherof, no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
wit can comprehend. And
one thing shall not bee amisse for
your worship to marke, that this
Booke being written by Friers,
men of no smal reckoning among
the Papists: yet how they write
against their own idolatry, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
and trumperie, &amp; inueigh
at the great follies and disorders
<pb facs="4"/>
among themselues, is to be noted,
which was some cause why I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
it at this instant, when men
of that coat and cognisance, grow
to so many wicked and rebellious
attempts. If they will read this
Booke, <hi>I</hi> thinke they may finde
matter enough to fal out of Loue
with their blind ignorance, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
themselues to the true &amp; liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
image of Loue, euer God and
his Church, which <hi>I</hi> desire they
may, if God haue not altogether
giuen thē ouer: or els to confound
them &amp; what they intend, to the
hurt of his trueth, and our most
gracious Queene. Thus leauyng
further to trouble your VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
<hi>I</hi> remain deuoted to you and
yours in all hartie and humble af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
