   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, it is not unknowen, that when Thomas White published his Book, called <hi>A Discoverie of Brownisme,</hi> (as now againe of late, Christopher Lawne &amp; others with him have done theirs) that there was an Inquirie &amp; Answer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of written by the Pastour of this Church, wherein he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the particulars from point to point. In which regarde it may be thought lesse needefull to write any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this latter Book, being of like matter and argument with the other. Yet in some respects, we have thought it not amisse, now to give thee this short advertisement, and the few observations following, about the contents of this latter Book also, especially about that poynt of the division made lately among us, and the articles given out therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Concerning which there was not such occasion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, eyther in that Answer to <hi>Thomas VVhite,</hi> or in any other of our writings, to publish somewhat thereabout, as there was about the other matters cōteyned in this Book of theirs. And therefore for thy better stay and informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the advertisement following now given thee about these things: where they are more at large (though yet but briefly) spoken of. Which thou shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> do well to consider of indifferently, and be not caried from the truth or against it by any sinister meanes used to that purpose, but remember what hath ben the lot of the truth and servants of God in all ages. And as thy love is to the Lord Iesus Christ, so let
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>it appeare in the imbracing of his truth revealed, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> giving witnesse unto the same. And the Lord our God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in thyne hart, the riches of the full assurance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to knowe the mysterie of God,<note place="margin">Col. 2.2.</note> even the father, and of Christ, and to rejoyce in the faith and order prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in his word. And he give thee to discerne thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, that the entiseing words of mans wisdome, deceive thee not: but goe <hi>to the lavv and to the testimonie, if they speak not according to this vvord, it is because there is no light in them.</hi> Esa. 8.20. So mayest thou soundly judge of things that differ. And the Lord give thee understanding in all all things. <hi>2 Tim. 2.7.</hi>
