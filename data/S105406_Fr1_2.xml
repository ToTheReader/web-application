   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE opinion, which vpon diuers occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions you haue
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, you had of the excellencie of this smale worke; and the great
esteeme wherin you kept it alwayes by you in spanish, enboldned my
vnskilfulnes, to bestowe vpon <pb facs="3"/>it an English beeing: such
assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are you able to giue of the worth of whatsoeuer you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to prise, or prayse. Now if as your word went before the presse, so
it may please you to permitt your noble name to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the Frontispice;
and to take it into such a degree of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, as to stand betwixt the Saint
and Censure, I dare promis he will be looked on and liked by the most, yea
euen by the best vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings be iudged to speake excellent truthes with
profitt and admiration; and herin you shall still adde to the high rate the
world putts vpon the riches of your mind: which makes you your countries
admiration and pride, and the enuie of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who would iudge it no 
<pb facs="3"/>crime to mistake you for one of theirs; did you not by the
fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and feruent testimonies of your incomparable zeale, loue, and
affection to serue our best King and Countrie, put them out of that dreame.
But what doe I doe? I dare not giue sayle into the Ocean of your vast
soule, which is capable of all things from the highest to the lowest, in
perfection. Not that I dread cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of flatterie, where euery one is readie
to subscribe, if I could find any end; or to write them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, of they
could find any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of your prayses (plentie making vs all poore in
this too plentifull a subiect) But that your obligations haue made me too
much your seruant, to be willing to obscure what I am <pb facs="4"/>not able
to illustrate. I will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therfor, giue my long impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned thoughts
leaue to appeare in words, confessing with all sinceritie and truth, that
for my part, I neuer mett with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnanimitie matched with such mildnes:
such admirable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg accompayned with such hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie: so great
abilitie atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with such affabilitie: nor so perfect courtshipe in
coniunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with so great pietie. In a word the Court meets with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more polished, more oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, more endearing: The Armie with nothing more
generous, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and vndaunted: The schoole with nothing that ether
makes more deepe and strong cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions; or more happie and gracefull
productions. And yet <pb facs="4"/>that which is iustly most admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and
beloued in you, is, that that Pietie which you teach the world to practise,
teacheth you to make frequent and faire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treates, from thence to a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Cell or solitude, which seemes indeed to be the Center where your soule
reposeth; and where, being remoued out of the noyse of the world, you
better discerne what God speakes to your hart. Please Noble S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. to admit
this trifle, as a signe of gratitude; till tyme present something,
whose bulke may be better able to beare your prayses: ād permitt that I,
in the interim, may honor myself with the title of</p>
