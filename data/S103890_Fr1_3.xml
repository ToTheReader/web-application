   <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>IF a man, Christian Reader, liuing in Rome, Spaine, or any other kingdom, where the truth is in any point oppressed, should to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince and conuert his nation, be desirous to set out a booke on that subiect: he would easely conceiue, that by making himselfe publick he should nothing benefit the cause, he might fall and perish in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition before three men could come to reade it: and that therefore it were better to liue obscurely, and get it secretly printed and dispersed: who could for this either blame him, or vnder nice pretences, reiect his proofes fairely deducted out of Gods word? So, if I, considering that I haue liued an obscure life, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> smale and of no reputation, that in this case to make my self publick would doe no good, but rather raise against me many mightie and vndeserued ennemies, &amp; get my labour in Christs, cause the sooner suppressed, haue therfore tooke a like priuate course, to the ende that Gods Truth might finde the more vnpreuentible passage: thinke not, that it will excuse any man, to say of me, he is a libeller, or as the Pharises did of our Lord and Sauiour, <hi>As for this fellow vvee knovv not vvhence he is.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioh. 9.29.33.</note> But if God, by so weake a meanes as I am, open thine eyes in a point of any consequence, say rather of the poore seruant, as the man borne blinde of the Lord and maister, <hi>If this man vvere not of God, he could doe nothing.</hi> Let me not be reckoned an<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 4.16.</note>
      <hi>enemie</hi> for manifesting Gods truth: but remember that herein thou shewest thy<note n="*" place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.3</note>
      <hi>loue</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> if his doctrine, <hi>his commandements be not grieuous vnto thee</hi> For his sake therefore reade this smale treatises and hereby thou maiest see a reason, why many learned ministers do not or will not know or regard the truth in this point: why the most in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are so vnwilling to know any thing thereof, seast it should hinder them from subscribing, and hauing of a good liuing, or cause them to be put to silence, if they should either preach, write, or speake against the gouernment of the Bishops.</p>
   <p>If I haue proued that it makes greatly to the saluation of the Church, and the preseruing of the faith it selfe, in that puritie and simpliciue, wherein it was left vnto vs by the Apostles and Prophets, that the Truth of God, be well knowne and manifested, in this point: remember it is thy duty, not to haue that blessed Truth <hi>vvith respect of persons:</hi> but in a right receiuing of it,<note place="margin">Iam. 2.1.</note> to <hi>Kisse the Sonne least he be angrie,</hi> and euen to crie mightely to God,<note place="margin">Psa. 2.</note> to reforme that Church, by whose power, any part of his Testament, lies darkened vnder a corrupt glosse, or being cleered, is forced to seeke corners. And thus hopeing that God will raise vp many friends to his owne cause, and giue them hearts to vse all ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
