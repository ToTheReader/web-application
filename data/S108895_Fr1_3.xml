      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>NDERSTANDING by good intelligence, of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall well liking, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acceptation, that your Honors and Worships haue had, of the <hi>Booke of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> of the Reuerend Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Father <hi>F.

   <p>And truelie, the Methode &amp; order that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath taken therein is so excellent, and the doctrine and instructions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o singulerly wel treated, for direction both of the learned and vnlearned in
<pb n="2" facs="3"/> spirituall life, (wherin the Author hath very discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly framed his stile to serue both their capacities, and especially of the vnlearned,) that diuers god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned Diuines intending to treat in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the same arguments, haue plainely, &amp; with great humility confessed, that he writeth with such a rare vertuous spirit, and hath such a singuler gift in explaning his instructions, and in pearcing the hart of a Christian reader, with his zelous god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduises, &amp; perswations, that they haue therefore eyther a bridged or translated his bookes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them vnto diuers noble vertuous persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that requested them to treate of those matters.</p>
   <p>And for mine owne opinion, hauing read a great number of spirituall bookes in diuers languages, (all worthy certainly of great commendation,) yet could I neuer find any, whose spirit and wise or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of writing hath so well liked my taste, and iudgement, as this godly Authors books, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie this <hi>Memoriall of a Christian life.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In which booke he is greatly to bee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for that in treating therein of the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of our liues, and consequently of the whole Christian State, he hath followed the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order of proceeding of S. Iohn Baptist,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 2.6.8 <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.5.15. <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.1.5 <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.47. <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Act.</hi> 19.18. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.</note> and of our Sauiour Christ, &amp; of all his Apostles, Bishopes and Priests, in founding the Christian religion in all countries, that haue bin conuerted to the faith of Christ: I meane by preaching to the people, to doe Pennance for their sinnes, and to Confesse them, &amp; to shew fruits worthy of Pennance, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing austere painefull workes of Satisfaction for them.</p>
   <p>And would God, that the late Apostatas, <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Caluin, Beza,</hi> and other their Schollers, pretending now to be reformers of
<pb n="3" facs="3"/> Christs Catholicke church in this our corrupt age, had followed the same godly order of proceeding in their manner of preaching Reformation.</p>
   <p>For in my simple iudgement, the right assured way to reforme christendome, being at this present so far corrupted in euery country, is not by force of Armes, nor by terrour, and constraint of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous penall lawes, for feitures, confiscations, and executions, with terrible deaths: because the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian common wealth in such a generall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all estates cannot by any other meanes bee duely reformed, maintained and preserued,<note place="margin">The right assured way to reforme christēdome</note> but by such as it was at the first founded, and increased. As by the Bishops and Pastors preaching of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, contempt of the world, mortification of the flesh, and giuing themselues apparant good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof to the common people, and shewing more christian charitable zeale in their deeds, than in their words, which was the godly order of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Apostles, and auncient holie Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops their Successors, in founding and increasing the christian religion in the Primitiue church.</p>
   <p>And the like godly order of proceeding for Reformation of the christian State, hath in some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges afterwards bin vsed by <hi>S. Benedict, S. Barnard, S. Dominicke, S. Frauncis,</hi> and by all the saints, which haue in their times by their wonderfull extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary godly example of leading holy penitentiall liues, in vtter contempt of the world, &amp; mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their flesh, by continual fasting, watching, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wearing of haire cloth, disciplining and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their bodies, and other austere vsage thereof, conuerted many thousandes in euery countrey of christendome, some from Schisme, and Heresie, and some from their dissolute licentious carelesse liues, whereby the whole christian State that seemed in

         </gap>f Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note>Verilie, for all catholike countreys all godlie wise men be there perwsaded, that whatsoeuer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, pietie, &amp; Religion, haue beene by the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauour of God preserued in the Church in this corrupt age, the same for a great part is to bee ascribed vnto the Godly vse of Sacramentall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of our sins vnto our Ghostly Father. And of this point we may al assure our selues, that in case it were not of such inestimable profit for the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our soules, and such a principall approued bulwarke &amp; defence of vertue among Christians, as it is, Satan the enemie of all mankinde (who cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie enuieth, and endeuoreth to hinder our saluation) woulde neuer haue labored so malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie, and earnestlie, by his hereticall ministers, as he hath done in this wicked time, to depriue al christians of the Godlie vse &amp; benefit therof</p>
   <p>Now for conclusion, I must humblie desire your
<pb n="27" facs="14"/> honors, and worshipps, not onlie diligentlie to reade ouer, but also earnestlie to followe the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie instructions conteyned in this notable vertuous booke. Wherin the Godlie Awthor hath excellēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie wel taught vs, how to be sorowfull for our sins, and howe to confesse them, and make satisfaction for the gilte of temporall payne dewe vnto them, and with that dewe Preparation and order wee must receaue the most blessed Sacrament of the Aulter. And he hath also geuen vs very notable good christian rules for the better direction of our liues. And withall I haue annexed &amp; dispersed in some partes of this boke diuers additions, collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the best learned catholike bokes I could finde. The which additions in regard of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent generall infection of our countrey with manie pestilent heresies, are not onlie in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in the graue Iudgement also of other more wise, and learned men, thought verie necessarie, for the better explaning, &amp; vnderstāding of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches doctrine, concerninge confssion, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, &amp; diuers causes of conscience. The additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are printed in a distinct seuerall letter from the Awthors booke, sauing that certayne deuout pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers onlie of the Awthors be printed with the same distinct letter. And whatsoeuer commendations is to be geuen for the additions, is to be referred vnto diuers godly diuines, that haue assisted me therein, with their graue learned aduises, and corrections.</p>
   <p>I beeseche almightie God to blesse, direct, and confirme all your honers, &amp; worships with a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall spirit, that ye may so liue and die in the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Catholicke Faith and Religion of our Holie Christian forefathers, that yee may raigne also with our Sauiour Christ and with them, in euerlasting glorious felicity in the kingdome of heauen, where
<pb n="28" facs="15"/> neuer yet came, nor can possibly come, any of the <hi>Lutheran, Zuinglian, Caluinian, Puritan,</hi> or other damnable Hereticall Sectes, that haue died vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant therein, out of the vnitie, and obedience of Christs Catholicke Church. From Roan, vppon the Holy Feast of the conuersion of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> in the yeare of our Lord. 1599.</p>
