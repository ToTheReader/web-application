   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Erusinge a certaine booke lately set foorthe in the name of M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge,
and weighinge the substance, and parcelles of the same, good
Christian Reader, I called to minde these woordes spoken sometime
by Socrates the Philosopher, touchinge his Accusers, in his owne defence before
the Iudges:<note place="margin">Plato in Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Socratis.</note>
      <hi>My Lordes, in vvhat sorte your affections haue been sturred vvith
mine Accusers eloquence, vvhile ye hearde them speake, I cannot tel. But vvel I
vvote, for mine ovvne parte, I mee selfe, vvhom it toucheth moste, vvas almost
persuaded to beleeue, that al, they saide, vvas true: yea, although it vvere against
mee selfe. So handesomely thei can tel their tale: and so likely, and so smoothely
they conueigh their maters. Euery vvorde, they spake, had appearance of truth.
And yet in good soothe they haue scarcely vttered one vvoorde of trueth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thus then saide Socrates of his Accusers. Euen so may I say now of M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
For bothe in trueth of mater, and also in probabilitie of vtterance, they are
muche alike. Aristotle, touching the darckenesse, and doubtefulnesse of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
worldly thinges, saith thus, <hi>Quaedam falsa probabiliora sunt quibusdā
veris: Certaine fals heades (by meane of good vtterance) haue sometimes more
likelyhoode of Trueth, then Trueth it selfe.</hi> For Trueth is many times brought
in simple, and naked, in poore araye. But Falsheade must needes apparel, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiere
her selfe with al her furnitures. Thus, many times wee are deceiued, and
embrace Falsheade in steede of Trueth. And this is the miserie of the Simple.
For neither are they hable to teache them selues: nor haue they, where with to
discerne their teachers. There was neuer, neither errour so horrible, but the
Simple haue receiued it: nor poison so deadly, but the Simple haue dronken it. In
this sorte S. Hierome saithe,<note place="margin">Hieronym. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trae Luciferiae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos.</note>
      <hi>Infidelitie vvas sometime published, emonge the
Simple, vnder the name of Faithe:</hi> And Antichriste shalbe adoured, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in steede of Christe.</p>
   <p>Touchinge the state, and issue of the mater, where as I, vpon iust occasion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
and onely in regarde of the trueth, sometime saide in great audience, that
in any of these cases here mooued, our Aduersaries are not hable to allege, either
any one sufficient clause, or sentence out of the Scriptures, Councels, or Ancient
Fathers, or any certaine vsage, or example of the primitiue Churche, M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
hath here alleged, and published, not onely one, or other, but, as he him self
saith, and as it is thought of many, great numbers of suche Authorities of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Councelles, and Doctours, bothe Greeke, and Latine, and many anciente,
and euident examples to the contrary. The places are noted: the woordes are
cleare: It cannot be denied: and, as it is supposed, al the worlde is not hable to
answeare it.<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 span">
            <desc>〈…〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> It seemeth now an vndoubted trueth, that as wel these, as also al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Doctrines, and Orders of the Church of Rome, haue beene deriued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
from Christe him selfe, and his Apostles: and haue continued the space of
<pb facs="3"/>
fifteene hundred, and thertie yeeres at the least. Therefore some haue wisshed,
my woordes had been more warily qualified, and vttered with more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection.
Euen this is it, that Aristotle saide, <hi>The shevv of trueth beareth often
more likelyhoode, then truth it selfe.</hi> There is no way so easy, to beguile the
Simple, as the name, and countenance of Ancient Fathers. The Arian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
alleged for them selues the Ancient Father Origen: The Nestorian here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
alleged the Councel of Nice: the Donatian Heretiques alleged S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian:
the Pelagian Heretiques alleged S. Ambrose, S. Hierome, and S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine:
Dioscorus the Heretique alleged Gregorius, Cyrillus, and Athanasius:
and complained openly in the Councel, euen in like sorte, and as iustly, as M.
Hardinge dooth now: <hi>Ego defendo dogmata Santorum patrum. Ego
illorum habeo testimonia, non obiter, nec in transcursu, sed in ipso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
libris posita.<note place="margin">In Concil. Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon▪ Action. 1.</note> Ego cum Patribus eiicior. I mainteine the Doctrine of
the Holy Fathers. I haue their vvitnesses, not vttered by chaunce, or by the
vvaye, but vvritten in their bookes. I am excommunicate, and cast out, and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisshed
vvith the Fathers.</hi> If the Diuel can shew him selfe, as the Angel of
light: and if False Prophetes can come in the name of Christe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> muche more may
some others come in the name, and vnder the coloure of certaine Fathers.</p>
   <p>But, good Christian Reader, for thy better vnderstanding, least happily thou
be deceiued, it may please thee to know, that these Authorities, alleged here by
M. Harding, are neither new, nor strange, nor vnknowen to any man of meane
learning but haue beene bothe often brought in, and alleged by others, and also
weighed, and examined, and thorowly confuted longe a goe. In deede M. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hath added of him self some bewtie of his eloquence, and maiestie of woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des▪
and yet not so much, nor suche, but it may easily be answeared, although not
with like eloquence, whereof in these cases there is no neede, yet at leaste with
more trueth. I trust, by indifferent conference hereof, thou shalt soone see
the Ancient Fathers, Some that neuer were, by M. Hardinge surmised, and
countrefeited: Some vntruely alleged: Some corruptely translated: Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly
expounded: Some vnaptly, and gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>efully applied: Their woordes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

<pb facs="3"/>
Kinge Agesilaus, when he vnderstoode his Enimies of policie, to coouer the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and weaknes of their bodies, had bomebasted, and embossed out their coates
with greate quarters, that they might seeme bigge, and mighty men, and that his
souldiers therewith were muche dismaide, after he had ouerthrowen, and slaine
them in the fielde, pulled of their coates, and stript them, and left them naked: and,
when he had caused his Souldiers to beholde the poore, lither, sclender, wearishe
bodies, nothing like that, they seemed before, then saide he vnto them: <hi>Lo, these
be they, of vvhom ye stoode so muche afraide: these be their greate bodies: these be
their mighty boanes.</hi> Euen so, good Reader, if thou stande in feare of these
M. Hardinges Authorities, and Argumentes, and thinke them terrible, and inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
for that they are embossed, and wrought out by arte: take them, rippe them,
open them, searche them, weighe them, strippe them naked, shake them out, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
them with the places, from whence they were taken: consider the Causes,
and the Circumstances, what goeth before, what commeth after: marke the Storie
of the time: examine the Iudgemente of other Fathers: and thou shalt marueile,
wherfore thou stoodest so muche afraide, or euer thoughtest them to be inuincible.</p>
   <p>It were aboue al thinges to be desired of God, that his Heauenly Trueth might
passe foorth without these contrarieties, and quarrels of iudgementes: and many
godly wise men are muche offended, to see it otherwise. But thus it hath been euer
from the beginning. Cain was against Abel: Esau against Iacob: The Kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Darkenesse was euer against the Kingedome of Light: The Scribes, and
Phariseis were greeued with Christe: Celsus, Prophyrius, Iulianus, Symmachus
were greeued with the Glorie of the Gospel. Christe him selfe is the stoane of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense,
laide to the Resurrection, and ruine of many. But through these offenses,
and contentions the Trueth of God breaketh out, and shineth more glorious.</p>
   <p>Blissed therefore be the name of God, that hath offered this occasion. For I
haue no doubte in God, but of this necessarie conflicte, through his mercie, there
shal issue some sparkle, to the glorie of his holy name. For as Moses Rodde deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Roddes of the Sorcerers, euen so wil the Trueth of God deuoure Errour.
Darkenesse cannot stande before the light. Tertullian saithe, <hi>Scriptura diuina
Haereticorum fraudes, &amp; furta conuincit, &amp; detegit: The Holy Scripture
discloaseth▪ and confoundeth the suttle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>ies, and robberies of Heretiques.</hi> And Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemias
saith,<note place="margin">3. Esdr. 4.</note>
      <hi>Greate is Veritie, and preuaileth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But M. Hardinge threatened afore hande, that mine Answeare (be it true, be
it false) shal soone be answered. How be it, if he wil not dissemble, but deale plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and laye out the whole, and answeare the whole, as, he seeth, I haue dealte with
him, perhappes it may require him some longer time. But if he dismembre my say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ulle out my woordes, and take choise of my sentences, without regarde,
what goeth before, or what cometh after: or, if he sende vs ouer suche pretie Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flettes,
<pb facs="4"/>
as he lately printed togeather, and ioined with the Turkish Newes of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
I warne him before hande, I may not vouchesaue, to make him answeare.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding, before he addresse him selfe to his seconde Booke, I would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
him, first, to consider better the ouersightes, and scapes of his former Booke: and
further, to thinke, that, what so euer he shal write, it wil be examined, and come to
trial. And let him remember, it is not sufficient, to cal vs Sacramentaries, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques:
or to condemne our Bookes for pelfe, and trasshe, and fardles of lies, before
he see them. For these thinges wil now no lenger goe for Argumentes. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
al thinges, let him write no moe Vntruethes: For thereof he hath sente vs ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
already: Let him nomore wreast, and racke the Scriptures: Let him nomore
neither misallege, nor mysconstrue, nor corrupte, nor alter the holy Fathers: Let him
nomore imagin Councels, and Canons, that he neuer saw: Let him nomore bring vs,
neither his Amphilochius, nor his Abdias, nor his Hippolytus, nor his Clemens, nor
his Leontius, nor any other like childishe forgeries: nor his Gheasses, nor his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
nor his Dreames, nor his Fables: Let him nomore bringe one thinge for
an other: And, to be shorte, let him bring no moe Contradictions in his owne tales,
nor be founde contrarie to him selfe. Otherwise, the more he striueth, the more he
bewraieth his owne cause.</p>
   <p>Now, good Christian Reader, that thou maiste be the better hable, bothe to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
thine owne Conscience in these cases, and also to vnderstande, as wel, what is
saide, as also, what is answeared of either partie, I haue laide foorth before thee M.
Hardinges Booke without any diminution, fully, and wholy, as he him selfe gaue
it out. And to euery parcel thereof, accordinge to my poore skil, I haue laide mine
Answeare: whether sufficient, or insufficient, thou maiste be Iudge. To thee it is
dedicate: and for thy sake it is written. Here muste I say vnto thee, euen
as S. Hierome saithe to his Reader in the like case: <hi>Quaeso, Lector, vt memor
Tribunalis Domini,<note place="margin">Aduersus error. Iohā. Hierosoly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitani.</note> &amp; de iudicio tuo te intelligens iudicandum, nec mihi, nec Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersario

that as thou doost iudge, so thou shalt be iudged, thou fauer neither mee, nor mine Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that vvriteth against mee: and that thou regarde not the personnes, but onely the cause.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>God geue thee the Sprite of Vnderstandinge, that thou maiste be hable to iudge
vprightly: God geue thee eies to see, that thou maist beholde the comfortable, and
glorious face of Gods Trueth: that thou maist know thee good, and merciful, and
perfit wil of God: that thou maiste gròw into a ful perfite man in Christe, and no
lenger be blowen away with euery blast of vaine Doctrine: but maiste be hable to
know the Onely, the True, and the Liuing God, and his onely begottē Sonne Iesus
Christe: To whom bothe with the Holy Ghost be al Honour, and Glorie for euer,
and euer: Amen.</p>
