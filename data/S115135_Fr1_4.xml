      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Esus Christ our Lord, who is the Truth,
<note place="margin">Ignatius, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, &amp; Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian euerie where. Math. 19.8.</note> (as auncient writers declare vnto vs) not Custome, aunswered to the Pharisies and Doctors of the Law. In the beginning, (that is to say, at such time as God accomplished the worke of Creation) <hi>It was not so.</hi> The question was aboute the law of diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a lawe ordayned by <hi>Moses,</hi> by authoritie giuen him by God, a law practised amongst the people for the space of sixteene hundred yeares and more, without any checke or controlement: euen amongst the people of Israell, and Church of God, and yet notwithstanding the Sonne of God, not waighing eyther the prescription, or the continuance of toleration, calleth them backe to the consideration of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and condition of the thing at the creation, and to the first institution of the same. <hi>God</hi> (saieth hee) <hi>made them male and female: what God hath ioyned together, let not man put asunder.</hi> Thus likewise let vs learne to aunswere, according to the example and commaundement of our Lord, but vpon much more vrgent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, whensoeuer the inuentions and deuises of men shall bee set before vs, to the defacing of Gods ordinance and institution: yea when any shall goe aboute to foist in humaine fansies, to the abrogating and thrusting out of his holie word. It was not so from the beginning, not from the creation of Christes Church: not from the institution of Christ, not from his Apostles, not from their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, not from the obseruation of the Primitiue Church, not from any decree or determination concluded by the saide Church her first councels: what God hath once appointed and ordayned, let not vs cast off and reiect: what the Son hath spoken vnto vs by his owne mouth:
<note place="margin">Iohn 14.26.</note> what hee hath taught vs by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: that sonne, concerning whome the Father hath giuen this charge, <hi>heare him.</hi> Those Apostles of whome the Sonne hath thus saide vnto vs, <hi>I will sende the holy Ghost which shall teach you all thinges:</hi> Him let not vs forsake for anie other thing that may come, for anie faire &amp; goodlie shew or appearance that possibly it can haue, for anie authoritie, prerogatiue, or prescription of time that it may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. By thus framing our selues, we shalbe able easilie to agree with euery soule that hath anie taste of godlines, and which hath in reuerence God his holy word and ordinances. But the question shall bee at this time, whether there bee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses brought into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the preiudice of his holie seruice and worshippe, and of his holy ordinances contained in his worde: of the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Primitiue church, seeing that a verie strong preiudicate opinion hath seazed the spirites of the greatest part, that nothing is done now a dayes in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but after that sort &amp; maner, that to require any reformatiō ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is nothing else but a longing after nouelties, and a remouing of the ancients their markes and limittes: and lastlie, seeing that they which make their aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of such abuses, are not without store of colours, thereby corrupting and
<pb facs="17"/>disguising the olde and auncient monumentes and writinges, and besmoking the new and latter ones, that so they may carrie the greater shew of antiquitie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which, that of making, as to receiue the thinges for olde and auncient, which haue meerelie regarded the succeeding times of the church, is verie newe and latelie hatched. This I say, is the taske and text which we are now to finish, and make plaine by the grace of God, that so wee may prouide helpes for the strengthning and supporting of some simple men, and preuent the malice of the contrarie minded, to the end that antiquitie may shew it selfe antiquitie, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie may appeare to bee but noueltie: and also to the end that the superstitious and long obseruation of some ill established noueltie, may not carrie away the title of antiquitie from olde and auncient veritie,
<note place="margin">That truth which is of all other most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, may not grow out of date by reason of the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof. That the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements in religion are for the most parte aboute traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the warrant of the word.</note> carelesly and negligentlie loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto: <hi>Ne, inquam, antiquissima illa veritas, vel ipsa antiquitate antiquari vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deatur.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Certainelie, hee that shall weigh and consider with sound and vpright iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the controuersies which are at this day in christian religion, shall not finde them to be anie such things (for the most part) as are founded vpon any doctrine that is trulie auncient: vpon anie doctrine (I say) that is taught or mentioned in the holie Scriptures: notwithstanding, that the Scriptures bee the true and proper boundes of whatsoeuer may fall into mens fansies, and the olde and authentike Registers and Maisters of the church, to line and square out what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is the proper due and true possession of any one. And further, we doo freelie declare &amp; testifie, that whosoeuer shall dare to remoue the same, though neuer so little, shall worthilie fall into the curse pronounced by the Prophet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, which remoue auncient boundes and markes. But the question is of Traditions, which haue insinuated themselues, and are sprung vppe together with the time by the industrie of men, and that to the choaking of the true plantes of Christes fielde. Of Traditions, which by the reading of Antiquities, wee see and behold first in the bare and naked seede, then in the bud putting forth, growing and rising vp into a stalke, bearing fruite, ouergrowing in the end the good corne, ouerspreading the earth, watred with the vanitie and ordinarie curiositie of men, manured and fed with the ignorance of the most darke and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uershadowed ages. Of Traditions, one marke or step whereof, for the most part we cannot espie or finde out eyther in the holie Scriptures, or in the Primitiue church: but which from age to age we finde and see to haue sprung vp of some crosse or ouertwhart word, or else of some vnexpected action, as hearbes cōming by chance, &amp; wherof there is no great regard or reckoning made: or else to grow by a priuation, or negatiuelie in some doubtfull question, from thence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into some affirmatiue not well and firmelie grounded, and finally ending in a full and absolute conclusion, from whence is drawne within some space of time after, and so throughout euerie age, such strange increase and ouerrunning measure, such consequences so far differing from the first steps and footinges, as that they which first cast the seede into the grounde, not thinking of any such haruest, would not bee able (as it falleth out with the fowles of the aire, letting fall some nut or acorn) euer to auouch the same for theirs, if they should returne to beholde them, yea which would rather haue smothered and stifled them in the birth, if they had foreseen anie shew of such monstrousnes to haue eusued. And finallie of Traditions, which smoothlie conuey themselues vnder the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite of indifferencie, and a certaine kinde of pretended seemlines into thercome
<pb facs="17"/>and place of profite, of necessitie of subiection (yea and that greater then any Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicall seruitude) and of the Articles of faith: Articles I call them, seeing that men now a dayes (such as are our aduersaries,) are farre more tenderlie affected and deeplier doting vpon their owne inuentions, then vpon faith it selfe. And for the which they let not to stand and contend a great deale more in the church of Rome, to maintain the same, then they do striue and seeke to root out Atheisme, notwithstanding it iet vp and downe like a Lord, and spreade it selfe into euerie coast and quarter vnder the name of Philosophie, priuilie vndermining, and thereupon forciblie ouerturning the foundations of the church of Christ, the holie Scriptures, and the holie Sacramentes. Articles againe, for the strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof they are not ashamed, to weaken so much as lieth in them the force and authoritie of Gods word: and for the procuring of authority thereunto, they defend the sufficiencie, integritie and simplicitie of the same, they make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to call the ministerie of death the ministery of our life, and to pronounce as imperfect and vnsufficient vnto Saluation the Scriptures, whereof the essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all worde did say vnto the Iewes (and then by a stronger reason to vs:) <hi>Examine the Scriptures diligentlie and carefullie, for you thinke to haue eternall life by them: and they are those that beare witnes of me.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now it were no hard or difficult matter to demonstrate and shew foorth the same throughout all the Articles which are in controuersie, and indeede the matter hath beene performed by diuerse alreadie. But I will rest my selfe for this time in shewing the truth thereof, in the matter of the Masse, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances thereof: because at this day it occupieth the principall place of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Seruice in the church of Rome: because it seemeth vnto them the badge &amp; cognizance to distinguish betwixt the good and euill Christian: because that in not going thereunto, or in going thereunto, is (as they hold in their opinion) to worke a mans damnation or saluation: And lastly, because that it containing &amp; comprising in it, eyther the doctrine or the practise of the principall pointes which are in controuersie betwixt vs, it shall stand for a full reuew of the whole bodie of their religion, or not want much thereof, if it bee throughlie examined and sifted. If then it be of such moment and importance vnto saluation, as they would make vs belieue, we need not to doubt anie thing at all, but that we shall finde it so most clearelie and euidentlie by the holy Scriptures: as also that wee shall bee able to deriue it from the first and purest ages, wherein the sacred foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of mans saluation continued and stood in his vnspotted puritie and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site bringhtnes, not hauing beene as yet troubled with our humaine inuentions, not hauing been as yet defiled with the superstitions which the preposterous i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitarion of Iudaisme, or the vnaduised skill of fashioning themselues after the manner of the Gentiles, did together with the time, draw in huge and massie heapes vpon them. For otherwise certainely if we can neither become acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it by the holie Scriptures, nor finde out anie markes or tokens of the same to haue beene vsed in all that space of pure and vncorrupted Antiquitie; but rather that not so much as the name thereof is therein specified, and that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seruice was then offered vp to God: let vs bee bolde to say, that then the misterie and price of our Saluation lyeth not therein, seeing that Saluation it self hath not instituted or ordayned the same: as also that the Seruice to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the church, doth not consist therein, seeing the Primitiue church did neuer know it. But then may we well see and perceiue, that it is some bastardly
<pb facs="18"/>broode and intire and vniuersall corrupting of Christ his institution, and of the first and auncient manner of seruing of God, transformed and changed by little &amp; little from an abuse of words, into an abuse of matter and substance, from a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to a sacrifice, and from a sacrifice eucharisticall, to a propitiatorie sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and from the commemoration or remembrance of the onely sacrifice of Christ, into a pretended reall and dayly killing and offering vp of himselfe, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that this saide Masse which we see now a dayes is nothing else but a collection and patched thing of many ages, &amp; a composition incorporated by many Popes, for the more precisenes whereof, there haue not beene admitted thereunto anie other ingredientes from time to time, then the abuses which Sathan, men and the iniquitie of time, haue beene able to bring in, eyther of pretended malice, or through carelesse negligence, or through ignorance into the church. In so much as that finallie, the holie Supper of our Lord, cannot there retaine anie thing to be knowne by, neyther hath it anie thing so contrarie, opposite or repugnant, as the Masse: which from this lawfull and legitimate issue (as some of the old Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue called it,) is changed into an illegitimare and bastardly thing, from a publique into a priuate, from the communion of the faithfull in the same Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, into a particular celebration by one priest, and (to be briefe) from a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditation of the death of our Lord, into a colde and ridiculous representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same, from a real and effectual participation of that flesh, giuen for the life of the world, and of that bloode shed for the remission of our sinnes, into a dumbe and doltish ceremonie, and that to be therewithall such a ceremonie, as which assisting &amp; aiding vs (a thing neuer heard of in any of the former times) there is more hope and helpe to be expected. I say not then from the holie sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord, administred according to his institution, nor then from all the Sacramentes of the Church of Christ: but then from the verie sacrifice which the Lord hath once offered vppon the tree of the Crosse, for the saluation of mankinde.</p>
   <p>Now therefore for the clearer handling of this matter, I will diuide this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise into foure partes. The first shall bee of the originall and proceeding of the Masse according to all the partes thereof, and the second of the circumstances, &amp; whatsoeuer is depending thereupon, which is all that which properlie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the historie thereof. The third shall declare how it is to be considered and tried according to the nature and quality of a sacrifice: and the fourth, how in the nature and qualitie of a sacrament: being that which commeth neerest to the touching of the doctrine thereof. And I beseech all those that loue the truth, and are feruentlie touched with an earnest care of their owne saluation, that they would open their eyes, and bring them to the sight and view of this matter, clean and purged from all manner of preiudice, of whatsoeuer forestalled opinion: as likewise I pray God that he would giue me the grace of comming vnto this work with a true and sincere affection and vnfained defire to see the church of Christe reformed according vnto true antiquitie in these our daies, &amp; purged from al no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties, which degenerate from the same, reformed according vnto that antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie I say, which hath for his foundation the doctrine of the Sonne of God, &amp; the practise of his Apostles gouerned by his spirite, but purged from that noueltie which can alledge nothing for his maintenance, but the dreams of men, &amp; those, such as are alwaies younglings and babes in things concerning God, yea rather alwaies brutish (as sayeth S. Paul) in that which concerneth his seruice.</p>
