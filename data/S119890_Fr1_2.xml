   <head>TO THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, RICHARD LORD BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHOP OF LINCOLNE, MY Honorable Diocesan.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Reuerend Father, it were no small happinesse to the Christian world, if true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion might reigne as a law, vnthwarted and not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and the Orthodoxe faith, being obscured by no questions and cauils, were onely published and not disputed.</p>
   <p>For Religion and Faith may not vnfitly be resembled to streams, or wels of water, which of themselues being pure and wholesome, become muddie when they are troubled: so the former are made lesse pure, and many times defiled by tumult and contention. And euen as in inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of waters, fields and meadowes adioyning are turned into mire: So when contention (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb facs="3"/> by Salomon to the ouerflowing of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Pro. 17.14.) ouerspreadeth the greene pastures of sacred truth, sundry parts of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse are laid waste, and some filth of error clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to the same.</p>
   <p>Contentions in Religion produce many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, whereof these are remarkable. First, while people are rapt into factions by heat &amp; humor of contention,<note place="margin">Publius Mimus, Nimium alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cando veritas amittitur.</note> the very grounds &amp; maximes of Religion vse to be shaken, and scarce any thing is left setled and indubirate (so farre as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie and pride of mans wit can preuaile.) Next, whiles one partie hastily opposeth another, it falleth out so, that each of them looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the aduerse Tenet, do proceed to some contrary extremitie of doctrine, as dangerous many times, or perhaps more then that which they oppugne. And in this case it is verified which S. Augustine saith<note n="*" place="margin">De Gen. ad lit. lib. 9. cap. 8.</note>: <hi>It is difficile or hard for men, whiles they auoid one extremitie not to run peruersly into another.</hi> Also, discord reprocheth and disgraceth Religion: and exposeth Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith to the opprobrie and derision of the world. By reason of that distraction which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about the heresie of Arius, the Fathers
<pb facs="3"/> report that Christian Religion was brought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the stage, and made ridiculous to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans<note n="*" place="margin">Euseb. vita Constantin l. 2. c. 60. &amp; l. 3. c. 12. Greg. Nazian. apol. fugae. Socrat. hist. ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. l. 1. cap. 3. Sozomen. hist. l. 1. cap. 15.</note>. And Chrysostome saith<note n="*" place="margin">Chrys. in Gala. cap. 1.</note>: <hi>For this cause are we become a reproch to Iewes and Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Church is rapt into a thousand factions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The same also hath caused States and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths more vnwilling to harbour Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Libanius the sophister, and other Pagans, tooke occasion to incense Iulian to the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christianitie, because the Empire was so much molested by the contentions of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And Ammianus Marcellinus<note n="*" place="margin">Hist. Rom. lib. 22. num. 8. pag. 253.</note> reporteth, that the same Iulian was wont to say in reproch of Christians: <hi>That no sauage beasts were so cruell one to another, as Christians were among themselues.</hi> And vpō this occasion also was he the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged against thē. And Kingdoms &amp; Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths are sometimes embroyled and shaken asunder by discord happening about Religion. In the daies of Hildebrand, who raised a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious schisme in the West Church, a Popish Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop (alledged by Auentine) saith as followeth. <hi>All right is confounded, &amp; lawes are perished;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Auent annal. Boior. l. 2. pag. 547.</note>
      <hi>there is no faith among men, no peace, no humanitie, no shame, no securitie, no gouernment, no rest from euils: All
<pb facs="4"/> the world is in an vprore and together by the eares, Cities and Countries are in armes,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Otho. Frising. chron. l. 6. c. 36. p. 127.</note>
      <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Otho Frising. (a credible historian) reporteth: that <hi>the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world was inuolued in so many miseries, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyled with such mischiefe, oppressed with so great perils, and consumed with so lamentable destruction, arising from Ecclesiasticall tyrannie and discord: that nothing could be added to the present calamitie, and the horrible confusion of the times might well haue bene compared to the darknesse of Egypt.</hi> And our countreyman Thomas Walsingham in his Chronicle saith,<note place="margin">Tho. Walsingh. hist. Angl. in Henric. 4. p. 420.</note> that <hi>two hundred thousand people were slaine in the garboile which followed vpon the schisme of Popes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And besides the former euils of contention, these which follow are not to be forgotten. First, Religion and faith, which of all other things should be most certaine and indubitate, whiles it is questioned beginneth to be doubted off: and discord in Religion nourisheth certaine seedes of Atheisme. Secondly, as plants which are often remoued, cannot take roote and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; so points of faith and pietie, being remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of their old standing, or bended this way and that way, begin to lose their reuerence
<pb facs="4"/> and stability in the soules of men. Thirdly, as in building, so in contention, one opponent gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying another, plucketh downe that which by a common labour and consent hath great need to be builded vp. Fourthly and lastly, as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to follow guides whose backes are each to other, and their faces looke a contrarie way: so Gods people, whose right is to be led by their spirituall guides, in one beaten path of faith &amp; godlinesse, are with perill of their saluation di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, (not knowing what to do) when their leaders call them contrary waies.</p>
   <p>In regard of these and many other the like effects, it were greatly to be desired, that vnitie &amp; concord, the chiefe badge and ensigne of true Christians, Ioh. 13.35. and the maintainer of the safetie and prosperitie of the Church, might by some godly meanes or other, be established in the Christian world.</p>
   <p>There is in these our dayes a grieuous diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and a wall of partition among the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the Westerne Region. The Pontificians of the one partie, and the reformed Churches of the other, are in hostilitie: and it cannot be denied, but that the same threatneth perill

      <pb facs="5"/> Church; to wit, That the Popes iudgment is infallible: That he is Lord ouer the whole Church, &amp;c. That the publike Seruice of the Church doth best edifie in an vnknowne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: That lay men may not without Papall licence reade the holy Scripture, &amp;c. The Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicall Councell of Ephesus<note n="c" place="margin">Concil. Ephes. edit. Peltan. to. 4. cap. 10.</note>, writeth in this manner to the Emperours, Theodosius and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian: <hi>Your maiesties desiring that pietie may be cōfirmed, haue enioyned the holy Synod to make a more exact proofe of the doctrines propounded, &amp;c.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth, that in those dayes, not onely particular Bishops and Popes, but the whole bodie and state of the Clergie were so farre sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to Princes, as that these had externall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to enioyne and command them to serue Christ Iesus in their callings.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Many of our aduersaries opinions are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, vnreasonable, and absurd. <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (saith Cardinall Cusanus<note n="d" place="margin">Cusan. Epist. 2. ad Bohem. pag. 834.</note>) <hi>hath no greater authoritie to binde or absolue the faithfull, then the Church will. The definition of the Pope</hi> (saith Gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar) <hi>is as authenticall as the sacred Scripture</hi>

And yet in this case the Church is not gouerned by new reuelation.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="4">4. Some of our aduersaries (more ingenuous then their fellowes) confesse, that we beleeue and hold the foundation, the summe of pietie, or maine and vitall matter of Religion.</p>
   <p>Now in regard of the premises, it appeareth that our aduersaries haue no iust cause to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broile and disturbe the Christian world, and in hostile and barbarous manner to deale with vs for matter of doctrine: considering that if they do not falsifie our Tenet<note n="*" place="margin">They lay to our charge, that we hold: God to be the author of sinne. That a regenerate person hath not freewill. That iustifyed people, are not inwardly clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from mortall sinne by grace. That Sacraments do not conferre grace. That the Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant is a Platonicall Idea. That euery priuate and vnlearned Christian is a iudge of controuersies, and an interpreter of Scripture. That the true Church visible hath no authority to determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies of faith. That the Eucharist is onely a figure of Christ his presence, and an empty signe. That good works are not meanes of saluation. That we yeeld no honor to the blessed Virgine, and other Saints, &amp;c.</note>, and impose that vpon
<pb facs="6"/> vs which we are free from. We maintaine no publike doctrine, but such as hath formerly bene reputed orthodoxe and Catholicke: and is either necessarily, or at least wise with greater probabilitie and apparence of truth, deriued from sacred Scripture, and from the Primitiue Councels and Fathers, then the aduerse Tenet defended by them.</p>
   <p>The matter then, which principally &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out present hope of reconciliation deuideth Christendome, is the pride and vsurpation of the Pope. And no doubt other doctrinall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies are subtilly kept on foote, to be a stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king horse for this.</p>
   <p>When these maximes and theorems ensuing be considered, let each impartiall Reader re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolue with himselfe what is the true cause of the discord whereof I speake.</p>

   <p>And Papirius Masson saith: <hi>The Pope being transported with vehement hatred</hi>

   <p>And from hence it may appeare, that the proper and adequate cause of the discord and diuision of the Westerne region of the world in matter of Religion, is the ambition of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Pontifex, and the pernitious doctrine of his fautors and parasites<note n="*" place="margin">Papir.

   <p>There be some which forbeare not to censure Diuines of our part, for continuing the breach in Christendome, and maintaining controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies in Religion. But I entreate these censors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to consider. 1. That the truth which we maintaine is the common right of all Gods
<pb facs="8"/> people as well as our owne, and that in defence thereof we passe not the bounds of our calling. 2.
