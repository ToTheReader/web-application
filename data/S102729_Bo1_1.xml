   <head>A Preface or Introduction <hi>to the Supplication.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>THere is a common saying among ours and Gods enemies the Papists, that <hi>the Christian Church must be knowne by these Characters, Visibility, Antiquity, Vniuersality, and Consent:</hi> but the Spirit of God sayes, that all these are the marks of the Beast; and persecution and paucitie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible signes of the true Church: thus began the first prophesie, <hi>I will put enmity betweene thee and</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note>
      <hi>the woman, and betweene thy seed and her seed;</hi> thus it continued in <hi>Iohns</hi> Reuelation, <hi>Then the Dragon</hi>
      <note place="margin">Apoc. 12. 17.</note>
      <hi>was wroth with the Woman, and went and made warre with the remnant of her seed, which keep the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God, and haue the testimony of Iesus Christ.</hi> And thus could we spread the testimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture like a mantle exposed to your view, full of delicate resemblances, wherein you might behold how the true Church of God hath been euer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any cessation subiect to scornes, opprobry, the malignant circumstances of time, or fearfull perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. But withall we pray you remember, that we make not our approches from <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> heating the oven seuen times hotter, but the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons <note place="margin">Dan. 3. Apoc. 12.</note> watching the Woman, the Man that sitteth in the Temple of God as God, those that be in <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, such as were invested with <hi>Aarons</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
and in plaine termes the continued per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution which we meane must arise out of the hate and malice of Christians; yea Preachers themselues, that are opposites to zealous professors, and this we complaine of.</p>
   <p>Oh reade, reade for Gods sake the story of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> and marke his persecutions, and who were his greatest enemies? <hi>Shemaiah</hi> a false Prophet, and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaniah</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ch. 29.</note> the chiefe Priest in stead of <hi>Iehoiada;</hi> yea if you step a litle further you shal find, that the king <hi>Zedekiah</hi> durst not iustifie his conference with <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ch. 38. 24.</note> as being afraid of the Princes and Priests: so that in truth he had no friends but <hi>Baruch</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> the Moore. And as it was with him, so it continued with all the rest, vntill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, and then wherfore did he call them <hi>generation of Vipers?</hi> or who were those <hi>hypocrites</hi> that Christ exprobrated, but the <hi>Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> who sat in <hi>Moses chaire,</hi> and at last condemned the Sauiour of the world to an ignominious death: so that it is apparant, here was nothing but perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. And for <hi>visibility,</hi> did not <hi>Eliah</hi> crie out, he was alone, and those that were the true seruants of God, durst not iustifie their profession? And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, he that was the Author of all truth, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted an impostor and deceiuer of the world.</p>
   <p>Oh marke what the Apostle saith: <hi>For I thinke that God hath set forth vs the last Apostles, as men appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to death: for we are made a gazing-stocke vnto the</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 9.</note>
      <hi>world, vnto the Angels, and to men.</hi> Which place of Scripture driues vs to amaze, when we consider the disparitie betweene the flourishing Churches,
<pb n="3" facs="3"/>
ambitious Prelacie, exalted Bishops, and maiesticke glory of Clergie men in Europe, and the pouerty, persecution and disreputation of the true Church of God indeed, as either it was in the time of the Apostles, or must be (according to this prophesie) to the worlds end. Reconcile vs then (we pray you) whether the Apostle onely meant the present time, or from the Spirit of God by way of prediction had reference to after ages, yea the end of the world? but doe not come too neare our eyes to dim our sight, or deafe our eares with the fearfull sound of the prerogatiue of Princes, the high command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voices of authoritie, or the seeming flourishes of the orders of a Church; but plainly out of cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Scripture, rectifie our vnderstanding in this point. For if the Apostles haue prophetically set downe, and indefinitely concluded, that this must be the estate of the true Church of God; we shall neuer beleeue, but that outward pomp, pride, wealth, eminencie, and the ill sounding accent of <hi>supereoritie ouer their brethren,</hi> can decipher any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing then <hi>Antichrist;</hi> and so must loue such in our soules, as either out of <hi>Pauls</hi> humilitie content themselues with that portion which God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted, or <hi>Dauids</hi> patience endure the <hi>Micols</hi> of the world to call them fooles.</p>
