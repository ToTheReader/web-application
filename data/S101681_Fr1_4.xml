   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is hard to say, whether boldnes, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance bee predominant in the Writer of the Pamphlet, stiled, <hi>The Gagg of the new Gospell.</hi> In his <hi>Thrasonicall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> he braggeth, that our owne Bibles are so cleare to all the World, for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing of the Romane doctrine, and condemning our owne, that nothing is needful thereto, but that a man <hi>know to reade, and haue his eyes in his head, to behold the same at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of our Bible.</hi> And yet among the differences betweene them and vs, this (not the least concerning the deciding of controuersies) is maintained and orged by him, that the Scripture is obscure and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, shut vp with many seales, subiect to contrary interpretations, not to be cleared by conferring place with place: and therefore that the people ought to be restrained from reading of them. If so, how can his Catholique Reader at the first sight, by the same, refute our doctrines? How needeth he nothing, but to haue <hi>his eyes in his head,</hi> when by their owne law, he may not vse his owne eyes without the Popes spectacles?</p>
   <p>He deploreth, or rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>ffeth at the multitude and varietie of our Translations, and Editions of the Bible in English: and yet in the
<pb facs="5"/> while will not remēber the manifold swarmes of their transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, corrections, &amp; editions of their owne vulgar Latine, euen since the making it authentical by the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi> Had we, as they, aduanced, beyond and aboue the Originals, any of our authorised Translations, attributed infallibilitie to euery tittle of any of them, or in diuersitie of varying Copies come neere the <hi>Romish</hi> for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, such imputations might be laid against vs, but not by <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Like a doughty daring Champion, or grand <hi>Goliah,</hi> vpon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing his banner of manifold Scripture-proofes for the Romane cause, he proclaimeth of and against our partie, that <hi>all the packe of them put together, is neuer able in their defence to doe the like, that is, to produce so many places in number, so expresse and cleare, and for so great a quantitie of controuersies.</hi> I wish that this <hi>Thraso</hi> had to the 276. places by him cited out of our Bible, added but this one, <hi>Let not him that girdeth on his harnesse,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Kings 20. 11.</note>
      <hi>boast himselfe, as he that putteth it off.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Among this packe (as he is pleased in his peddling eloquence to stile vs) I acknowledge my selfe to be of the meanest and coursest stuffe, farre inferiour to most of my learned and iudicious brethren, who are able with one finger, not only to gagg, but also to choake this babbler. Yet should I thinke my selfe vnfit to beare the name of a Minister in this Reformed and Renowned Church of <hi>England,</hi> if vpon one cursory view of some parts of the Scriptures, I were not able to obserue and ranke out more pertinently, and with better conscience, and directer consequence, many more authorities and arguments for the defence of our Church, and beating downe Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then he hath pretended to doe on the contrary.</p>
   <p>True it is, that my principall calling and daily endeuour is (like <hi>Dauids</hi> in his minoritie) to keepe and attend sheepe in the Countrey, my furniture is rather the Crooke and Scripp, then the Sword or Sling. Yet if wilde beasts range and rauage among our flocks, we are awaked to stretch forth our hands, and rescue our Lambs. And well may wee answer with <hi>Dauid: Thy seruant kept his fathers</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Sam. 17. 34.</note> She<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>pe: and there came a Lyon, and likewise a Beare, and tooke a Sheepe out of the Flocke: and I went out after him, and smote him, and tooke it out of his mouth.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>Plaine Shepheardly <hi>Dauid,</hi> had he trusted in his owne strength, and not rather in the goodnesse of his cause, being Gods quarrell, might easily haue been discouraged not onely by the braues and threats of the <hi>Philistine,</hi> but much more by the checks and snappes of his elder brother <hi>Eliab;</hi> who (perhaps being better furnished with abilities both for warre, and for Court) thought to frowne his rurall brother out of the field. But God is pleased to aduance his truth and cause the rather by plaine and weake meanes. For my part, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath moued me to this encounter, but the zeale of Gods truth, and desire to instruct the meaner sort, and establish our lesse learned Christian brethren. As for curiosities and subtill contemplations, I leaue them vnto others, or rather to be left of all others, so farre as they tend to engendring of strife among our selues, and preiudice to our Church. And accordingly in pressing the passages of Scripture, and vindicating the same from violent and absurd interpretations, I haue laboured to deliuer the plaine, true, and natiue exposition, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing out of the literall sense, and naturall context, together with the circumstances thereof. Which manner of interpretation, as most sound and solid, hath in all ages, and will find approbation with the iudicious.</p>
   <p>As for the stile and words of Scriptures, I desire (as this aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie dealt with vs by way of repercussion,) so to repay him in coine of his owne stampe: and therefore I still pleade out of their owne vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar English Translation of the whole Bible, written and perfited by the Seminary Priests at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> as appeareth by the first words of their Preface to the New Testament printed there. Though the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part thereof, being the old Testament, was afterward printed at <hi>Doway,</hi> and thereupon is commonly called the <hi>Doway Bible.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The <hi>Rhemists Priests,</hi> for making any Translation at all of the Bible into the English tongue (though out of the vulgar Latine, though obscured by affected phrases, and distorted by their corrupt Annotations) yet are said to haue bin beshrewed by their owne more subtile Masters and Superiours, as hauing thereby layed open to the people the nakednesse and deformitie of their Romish doctrines. And therefore haue I the more willingly produced the same against themselues; the power and lustre of Gods Word, though clouded and disguised by their purposed obscuritie and improprieties, yet
<pb facs="6"/> competently shining forth, for their conuiction, by this vnwilling wounding of <hi>Rome</hi> by the out-workes of <hi>Rhemes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Vnto the places cited out of their <hi>Bible,</hi> I haue added not onely (sutably to the Gaggers proofes) the testimonies of diuers ancient Fathers and Doctours of the Church: but also, for ouer-measure, the consent of diuers moderne Writers very passable, and laudable in the Romish Church.</p>
   <p>Lastly, in handling this <hi>Popish Gagg</hi> (varyed and furbished in diuers Editions) I thought it not worth the while to goe thorow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular question: some being friuolous, or of small moment, or weake and naked enough of themselues, but haue rather chosen to insist vpon those which are most pertinent and weightie. The discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing whereof might tend to seasonable edification. The iudgement of which my poore labours, I humbly submit to our Reuerend and blessed Mother the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And so, Christian Reader, I commit my endeuours to thy chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table acceptation, and withall desire to haue my part in thy deuout and brotherly prayers, resting</p>
