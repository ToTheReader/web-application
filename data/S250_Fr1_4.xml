   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N Epistle</hi> to the Reader is as ordinary before
a new Book, as a <hi>Prologue</hi> to a new Play; but
as Plaies are many times exploded, though the
Prologue be neuer so good, and promising; So
(<hi>Reader</hi>) if thou findest not stuffe, in this <hi>Poem,</hi> to fit
thy humor: If the wit with the fashion, hold not some tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
proportion; this Enducement (though nere so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
and obsequious) would little preu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ile with thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
but thou wouldst coniure my <hi>Ghost</hi> downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
before his time, or torment him vpon earth, with
the Hell-fire of thy displeasure. Therefore it matters not
whether I humor thee with complement, or in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>inuate with
glozing <hi>Epithites.</hi> I know (in a play or <hi>Poem</hi>) thou lik'st
best of <hi>Satyricall</hi> stuffe; though perhaps thou seest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thine own <hi>Character;</hi> and not without some shew of
Reason are things bitter, the better: For the Gluttonous
Sences (the Eye and Eare) so cloi'd and surfeited, with


<pb facs="5"/>
variety of effeminate pleasures; the rough <hi>Satyre</hi> doth
sometimes not vnfitly enterpose such Courtly delight,
which growing a Burthen to it selfe, his entermixt vaine
with the others vanity, giues entermission to the humor,
and proues no lesse tastfull to the <hi>Gallants</hi> iudgement,
then tart sauce to whet his dull'd appetite. And of this
kind I haue enterlaced something, naturally rising out of
my subiect; where (by way of preuention) if any shall obiect
that I haue not amplified the <hi>Legend</hi> to the full scope
of the <hi>Story;</hi> I answere; I should then haue made the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
too great, to the discouragement of the Buyer, and
disaduantage of the Printer; let it suffice I haue the
substance, if not the circumstance; and when I vndertook
this I thought with my selfe: That to draw Arguments of
Inuention from the <hi>Subiect,</hi> new, and probable, would
be farre more plaucible to the time, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> by insisting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
narrations (made so common in <hi>Playes,</hi> and so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
among all men) haue my Labour slighted, and
my Pen tax't for triuiall. The Generous Censor (as hee is
Ingenious or Ingenuous) I reuerence; likewise the <hi>Crit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
(as he is knowing, and learn'd) but when his censure
shall be leuell'd with neither of his good parts, but fauour
more of Spleene, then Braine; of Disease, then Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb facs="6"/>
I doe hartily appeale from him, with all of that
faction; And though many did inly wish, that this (not
the meanest Issue of my Braine) might haue prou'd an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortiue,
and seene no comfortable light; Yet they see it is
borne, and (without preiudice to Nature) with Teeth too,
to oppose theirs, that shall open their lips to depraue mee;
but whether to lye vpon the Parish, or the Printers hand
that rests in clouds; howsoeuer, I haue got sheetes to lye
in, (though they be but course) and am sure to be cherish't
in good Letters▪ if I be entertain'd in the world, and
proue a companion for the many, I know I shall not be
much chargeable; if not, yet this is my comfort, there
will be some vse made of me in this land of waste; In
which Resolution, I set vp my Rest.</p>
