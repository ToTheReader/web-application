   <p>SVch is the miserie of these latter daies, through selfe loue, and coldnes of charity (as Christ foretelleth) that every man envying other, aspires by reproching his neighbours godly workes and good exercises, to get him selfe a name, so that no mans workes, howe godly soeuer, lacketh some one or other detestable calumniator and envious reprocher: Neither look I more, than others more learned to escape the same. To thee therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, misliker hereof, and opponer against this work, I haue thought good to direct this gentle admonition, crauing thee earnestlie, in the fear of God, Reade ouer, ponder well, print all in minde, confer places, leaue off partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. So trust in God you shall finde in the same nothing either greatlie, worthie of blasphemous reproche, or able justly to be-refelled: For first, as touching the opponing against these presents, by blasphemous reproches: because that raylings, reproches, and invectiues, exceedes the boundes of brotherly loue &amp; Christian charitie, I trust you, nor no Christian professor will borrowe these manifest dartes of the Deuill, and armour of Sathan to fight against any man, euen not against a reprocher, and far lesse against me, who reprocheth no man that euer wrote hereof: but judging them al to haue done faithfullie as they could, doth therefore but simplie, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to them, set out this my present worke, confirming the same by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of scripture expreslie, (as the Lorde knoweth) to glorifie God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and to profit thee, O Reader, in repelling of errours, and discouering the trueth, without partial loue to Protestant, or hatred to Papist, as to this houre, neuer hauing receiued worldely injurie of Papist, nor fleshlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie forbeing Protestant: yea, I spare not in this work to blame, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of such professed Protestants, as in these daies are waxed cold, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and without charitie: as againe, I spare not to purge and excuse the Pope and Papistes of some texts in this booke, which others applies against them: namely, in that (contrarie the opinion of many learned) I purge the Pope from being the Apostat of the fift trumpet: And wheresoeuer I accuse the Pope in this work, by admonishing of his errors, &amp; threatning the decay of his sect, seate and kingdome: I do nothing more thereinto, nor the very euidence of the text, harmony of other scriptures, and the truth of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth me vnto. This doing then being offensiue to no good man: I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> no professed Christian, will by blasphemous reprochings, raylings, publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> slaunders, priuat backbitings, or such other dartes of the Deuill oppone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this book. But if secondly, leauing these Ethnick invectiues and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, thou thinkest by pretended arguments, to refute this worke and forme of interpretation therein contained: be sure, that canst thou not just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor by no good reasons perform, seeing the grounds and substance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="148"/>
ar prooued, both by sure testimonies and very probable arguments: by sure testimonies (say) both of scriptures interpreting scripture: whereof, our whole Paraphrasticall exposition, and diuers notes are composed and made vp: And also by the testimony of vnsuspect writers, euen of Papistes, where they wrote of themselues, &amp; of Ethnicks, where they wrote of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and of these vnsuspect histories (verely credible against themselues) is the historicall application of this worke composed, and diuers amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions amongst the notes made vp. Then resteth our propositions and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones that are among the notes, and these I say we prooue by very probable arguments: yea, euen by arguments as necessarie, as true religion (which falles not vnder the capacitie of man, nor necessitie of mans reason) will suffer and permit: For these arguments are founded vpon the most evident reasones, clearest tokens, and plainest scriptures, and thereafter euery argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment followes one another, frō the plainer text, to the obscurer text, til the whole be discouered. So then of our Propositions, Paraphrasticall expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Historicall application, Notes, Reasons, and Amplifications: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, of this our whole worke, nothing is mine, or of my only assertion, to God be the glory, true testimonie and reason yeeldeth all: Think not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to refute the veritie, for strong and mightie is the protectour thereof. And whereas I haue saide, that our Paraphrasticall exposition, is not onely grounded vpon the present text, but composed of the conference of many texts and scripturs interpreting others: that haue I purposely &amp; by al means possible pressed to do, expreslie, becaus many interpreting the present text onely by it selfe, and according to that sense that to them seemed most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in that place, they haue greatly erred, for to others another sense doth seeme more proper, and so infinite and repugnant interpretations do arise: for as in the disciphering of cyphered letters, hee who judged such a marke or Character to signifie such a letter, for that it so agrees and spells in some one place, he may be deceiued, and therefore he must take that Character for such a letter as it spells and agrees with, not onely in that one place, but in all places where it is founde throughout that whole Epistle. Euen so in Prophecies, who by an onely texte judged such a propheticall tearme or phrase to haue such a sense, for that it so appears there to agree, he may be deceiued: and therefore he must take that propheticall tearme in such a sense, as not onely doth agree with that one present text, but with diuers other texts where the same tearme is to be found, and so shall all interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters agree, and no man varie from other: for scriptures interpreting scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, furnisheth one onely veritie, and though sometimes diuerse interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, yet not disagreeing nor repugnant, but in a manner all one: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner of interpretation do I proceede, so farre as God hath giuen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> judgement, memory, and sight of scriptures, referring the rest to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God doth blesse with moe talents and greater benefites. If then thou O Christian Reader hereof, first laying aside blasphemie, invectiues, and reproches against me: secondly, casting of all captious sophismes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the trueth, doth now think this forme of Paraphrasticall interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by scriptures interpreting scriptures, after the maner of disciphering

      </gap>scouer the mysteries of this holy Reuelation (as in trueth tis) and yet doth think that I haue not so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatly followed that order my selfe, as I haue here prescribed t to others: Then and in that case, I am not onely conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>owledge myne own imperfection, euen my tender memory and hard vtterance: but sure I am, &amp; experience shall declare, that whosoeuer by this most perfect way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of exposition shall proceed, he shall fal vpon the same interpretation in substance, that I haue here set downe, and though now thou disagreest, yet then shalt thou accord herewith in one veritie without any substantial diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in effect or matter. I graunt indeede, and am sure, that in the style of wordes and vtterance of language we shall greatlie differ: for therein I do judge my selfe inferiour to all men▪ So that scarcely in these high matters could I with long deliberation, finde wordes to expresse my minde: but this imperfection, seeing God perchance sendeth it, to make the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Finally, by this my brotherly admonition, I hope you wil not giue place vnto thy first conceiued wrath: so, that howsoeuer you at this first approching disdained these presents: yet now at thy more resolued revewing hereof, I hope, and also protesteth, that in the feare of God you casting of all blasphemous reproches against me, and all captious sophismes against the trueth, must either yeeld to the assured veritie of this worke, or then thy selfe set out the better exposition hereof, vpon these or more su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer grounds: And I beseech the Almightie, the God of trueth and vnitie, to blesse that thy godly enterprise, and to vnite it with his trueth: So shall we also please one an other, and ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
