      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O render thee a reason (Christian reader) of publishing this shorte Treatise: It is in a worde the contrary to <hi>Isocrates</hi> answer vnto a question out of time, saying; <hi>Quae ego noui, temporis huius non sunt, quae verò exigit tempus hoc, ego nescio:</hi> Those things which J know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not vnto this time, and those which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto this time, I know not. But we say, the things which belong vnto this time, wofull experience hath made vs for to know, and the things which we know, the misery of this time commaunds vs to report. For are not these the dayes whereof our Sauiour Christ, and his Apostles so long agoe forepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied, wherein charity should wax colde,<note place="margin">Math. 24. 2. Thes. 2. 2. Tim. 3.</note> and faith should so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">

      </gap>appeare, wherein men should be slide backs from Christ, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states from his true religion, wherein they should be louers of themselues, couetous, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed speakers, disobedient, vnthākeful, vnholy, true-breakers, false accusers, despisers of them that are good, traitors, headdy, high-minded,
<pb facs="3"/>louers of pleasure more then louers of good, hauing a shew of godlinesse, but haue denied the power thereof: yea wherein men are become, Ʋsers, Newters, Temporisers, Athists. And the principall cause hereof must needs be the corrupt nature of man bending too too much vnto Papistry. For compare these times with the dayes of yore, when Papistry swayed the scepter, and you shall see the effects of both times to be alike. About the yeare 363. at what time the world began to decline; <hi>Anthony</hi> saw in a dreame, as it were Hogges, which trode vnder the feet their altars: &amp; waking said, that the Church shalbe once againe spoiled and dispersed by whoremongers, adulterers, and monstrous men, which prophesie <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> noteth to be against the leacherous and voluptuous life of Priests and Monkes. This prophesie began to take effect about the yeare 604. when papistry did preuaile, the Popedome flourish, and true doctrine lost her puritie. For about the yeare 688. <hi>Theodore</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Rauenna</hi> was greatly hated of the Cleargie, because he sough to keep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Peter</hi> in feeding the flock: as Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth oftentimes confessed. Now began <hi>Peter de Blois</hi> to call the Popes officials hellish Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, and the cleargie <hi>Syria, Edom,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Anno. 1240.</note> Calues of <hi>Bethel,</hi> Idols of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the fat of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> and earnestly exhorteth to depart out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Then complained <hi>Peter de Vinea</hi> of the insaciable couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Pope, and the filthinesse of the Clergie. <hi>Guillame le Orfeince</hi> prooued the Pope to be Antichrist, <hi>Rome Babylon,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Anno. 1260.</note> and the Prelates the mēbers of Antichrist. Now was there a booke found <hi>De pericu'is</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>made of the dangers of the world. Now stood vp <hi>Peter Casiodorus</hi> vexing his soule for the wickednesse of those times. So did <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias Parisiensis, Iohn Wicleffe, Iohn Hus,</hi>

Were these then and such like the effects of Papistry in former ages, and shall we behold them againe to enter vpon the world, and not labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue the cause? God forbid. The conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration therefore of these lamentable times hath wroong from me this briefe Treatise. Wherein thou maiest behold the very map
<pb facs="4"/>of Papistrie: a doctrine turning the truth of God into a lye, and religion into superstition: perswading men to all vngodlinesse, and yet ouershadowing all with the shew of religion: Arming the subiect against the Prince,<note place="margin">See the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Ireland.</note> and yet defend it by the beastly Bull of Popish excommunication. Sowing sedition and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the land, yet dare appeare vnto the Lords of the councell as men blamelesse and religious, as did that Machieuillian Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish practiser (as the Priests of his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession doe terme him) <hi>Parsons</hi> that Iugling Iesuite: whereas they meane nothing els, but the vtter subuersion of religion and the state, as plainly appeareth by the workes of Sir <hi>Francis Hastings</hi> and <hi>D.

Way then the end of this shorte
<pb facs="5"/>Treatise, and let vs be more thankefull vnto God for the riches of his reuealed truth. First it vnmaskes the Politicians, that sute religion after the fashion of their pollicie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly it forewarnes and so forearmes thee against these popish charmes that now flye about the land, least vnwittingly thou be inchanted with them. Thirdly it giues thee a taste what benefits thou shalt receiue by entertaining Papistry, namely heresie, polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, supersti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ion, Atheisme, and all vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. Fourthly it desciphers vnto thee the enuious, murdering, and cruell nature of a right Papist, that hangs his whole religiō vpō the Popes sleeue,<note place="margin">Lipsiusvbi prius.</note> namely to be such, <hi>qui ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iiciunt culos saepe ad hanc patriam, quā è faucibus ereptam dolent, qui vexil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum purpuratae Romanae belluae (O Deus immortalis auerte quaeso hoc omen) in media defixuros se minitantur, qui non praedam sed vitam, non seruitutem, sed sanguinem concupiscunt: quibus nullus ludus iucundior est, quàm cruor, quàm caedes, quàm ante oculos trucidatio inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centium.</hi> Which often cast their eyes vpon this our countrie, which they greatly sorrow is by Gods aide deliuered from their swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb facs="5"/>in the midst whereof (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) they threaten one day to display the banner, and set vp the Ensigne of the purple Romish beast, who desire not our good, but our bloud, neither thirst after our liuings only, but also our liues: in whose eyes there is no play so pleasant, as to beholde massacres, heare of murders, &amp; see the slaughters of silly innocents. Lastly, it armes thee with truth by vnfoulding of the contrary, which truth God graunt vs to embrace to his glory, our health, and the countries good, which God no doubt begins to visit for the sinnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but especially for the sinne of Apostasie, backsliding, and forsaking the ture religion,<note place="margin">Note the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse of the moone, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uēb. 29. 1601. and of the sunne Decemb. 14. Yea two other Eclipses of the moone are to happen this yeare. Thunder and lightning very common this Christmas. Socrat. hist. 3.</note>to vphold the kingdome of Satan, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the doctrine of Antichrist: which grieuous sinne (especially after so long sunne shine of the Gospell) the Sunne blusheth to looke vpon, and the Moone is ashamed to behold. The heauens roare and thunder to consider, and the ayre sindeth forth his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and threatneth with his lightning to wound from heauen all such as with the Apostate <hi>Iulian</hi> reuolt from their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and vndermine the faith of Christ.
<pb facs="6"/>Yea the Earth,<note place="margin">An earthquake 1601. Decemb. 24.</note> the stable earth begins now to quauer, and to shake, as being ouerburd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with our sinnes, and too weake to beare the waight of our iniquities, especially to support this sinne,<note place="margin">Histor. Tripart. lib. 4. cap. 10.</note> this heauie sinne of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie and irreligion, giuing vs warning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it open, as sometime it did <hi>Antioche</hi> ready to receiue the heresie of <hi>Arius,</hi> that if we leaue not off betimes to welcome Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and to entertaine his armio of heresie and Atheisme, it will one day swallow vs vp quicke for conspiring with the enemies of Christ,<note place="margin">Num. 16.</note> as sometimes it did <hi>Corath, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> God graunt that other mens harmes may teach vs to beware.</p>
