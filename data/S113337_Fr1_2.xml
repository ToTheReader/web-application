   <head>To the Right Worshipfull, <hi>Sir</hi> John Garrard, <hi>Baronet;</hi> The blessings of this life, and that which is to come.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>THe end of mans creation was the service and worship of his maker; this (after the fall)
<pb facs="3"/> began first in Sacrifice, whether by mans ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Gods ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not revealed: certain it is, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods approbation and gracious acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for in the universal deluge, when an end of all flesh was come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: he made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for his service by Sacrifice, in giving order to <hi>Noah</hi> to take into the Arke of every clean beast by sevens. <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 2.</p>
   <p>This manner of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb facs="3"/> the light of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reason did teach the Gentiles, and Gods owne blessed ordinance continued amongst the Jews, which did serve them as it did others, not only as a testimony of their obedience to God, and dependance on him but (God so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing) as a Type of that most perfect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to be offered by Christ on the Crosse: this once offered, at the last put an end to all that went before, and
<pb facs="4"/> in this one they all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, all Levitical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, but other sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices there are, and these the Gospel still retaines, there in the law, and here in the Gospel, oblations in <note n="*" place="margin">Oblatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes enim illic, obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem &amp; hic Iraen. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. haeres. Vali. l. 4. c. 34. p. 429.</note> both: amongst the people of the Jews, &amp; in the Church of Christ, sacrifices in both: they and wee, the Jew and the Christian agree in this, that God will have Sacrifice; those holy offices of pietie to God and charity to
<pb facs="4"/> man, are termed Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, so that I shall not feare to say there is a Christian <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and yet of this of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians (as of that of Jews) how quickly God growes weary, if the Heart be wanting. The heart is the salt that seasoneth, and the incense that perfumeth the sacrifice; &amp; makes it an odour of a sweet smell, acceptable and pleasant unto God: and that our Religious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice may be a Christian
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> there must concurre with an holy action, a devout affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for admit a strict and precise observation of all circumstances in the action, if there be a faile in this, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is but lost in that: this is chiefly accepted of God, that serving to make a way of discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for man: and for mans sake, God takes no notice of this without that; dissembling his knowledge of the inmost intentions of the heart,
<pb facs="5"/> &amp; seeming not to know what it is impossible he should be ignorant of: untill by some outward expressions, it be made knowne unto man. It is not then the inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection only that (in the Heart) God calls for; as if he excluded the outward action, but the affectionate action, to doe what is to be done heartily: what is to be done, I say! for it is not left arbitrarie to the heart, to choose what shall be done, or
<pb facs="6"/> left undone, admitted or omitted: but the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction determined, in the well-managing thereof, is required the sincere intention, and dearest affectió of the heart: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting also the ground as well as the end: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in a duty of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: makes it an effect of heady zeal, not hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die obedience, for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is a Relative: and ever referres to some precept, Canon, Rule, decree, constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="6"/> or injunction: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, or at least sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission whereunto; is that wee terme obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and obedience is better then sacrifice, or it is the best sacrifice; for hee that obeyeth, makes a sacrifice of his own heart, and a mans heart is himselfe <note n="*" place="margin">Per obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiam voluntas propria mactatur. Greg. in ult. mor. Aq. 2. 2. Q. 104. ar. 3. resp.</note> this is the Christian <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> the project of the ensuing discourse: which I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to expose to the view of this censorious age: where I must not
<pb facs="7"/> thinke to speed better; then better then my selfe have done before me: from the learned I cannot expect that any worke of mine should merrit praise: yet doubt not, but at their hands I shall find or pitty or pardon: of others, I shalbe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured as every man stands affected; but I passe not of their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: so long as in conscience of obedience to God, I strive in my calling to edefie his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="7"/> Church: this is my prime aime: And next to this is to tender un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you some token of thankefulnesse for your many favours, <hi>qui be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficia invenit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes invenit,</hi> bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are of a binding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a kindnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived obliges an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious nature to requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; but where it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds requital, the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged must not come short of acknowledgment, &amp; a verbal acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a poore returne
<pb facs="8"/> for a reall kindnesse: 'tis all wee schollars can, our wealth is in words., and words are swift, no sooner loosed from the tongue, but lost by the eare; they may touch on the fancy by the way, but vanish before they recover the understanding: here then the pen must as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the tongue, and words once spoken, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to the more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate view of the eye: remaine as monuments
<pb facs="8"/> in the mind; where they admit a review, untill the judictous be fully informed. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the disadvantage is mine, in stepping from the pulpit, to the presse; for faults which in <hi>transitu,</hi> are not espied: at gase are easily discerned; yet here againe is my hope, to meet, as with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent eares, so with favourable aspects: and then patience and connivence will salve all defects, and so
<pb facs="9"/> mine infirmities will be either not seene, or not censured: Besides I may say with the Orator, <hi>causa ago deorum,</hi> I speake in Gods cause, not mine owne: and so in his name (whose cause I undertake) may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge acceptance.</p>
   <p>And thus much I dare boldly say, I have not by wilfull neglect betrayed the cause in hand; but have studied <hi>omnem movere lapidem;</hi> and
<pb facs="9"/> to follow <hi>Solomon</hi> so far as my wits would serve, in his plea for God: which howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver some doe take (which doe usually mistake what they doe not understand) I am confident of your favorable acceptance, whom I know so far a freind to Learning, and lover of Religion, that what so relishes of either, finds kind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment with you.</p>
   <p>Go on, Noble Sir, and season the flower
<pb facs="10"/> of your yeeres with the timely fruits of grace and vertue.</p>
   <p>You want not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements in the way of goodnesse, nor need you to looke fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then your owne house: even to him, that immediatly went before you (your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased * <note place="margin">Sir <hi>John Garrard,</hi> Knight &amp; Baronet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed by his last will to the poore of the parish of <hi>Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamstead</hi> 20. l. <hi>per annum</hi> for ever.</note> Father) who made you the executor of a large legacy to the poore. And left you the heire of a faire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state in Lands and Houses: and that
<pb facs="10"/> which is the chiefest ornament of your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion house, a most beautifull Chappell, a continuall and visible <hi>memento,</hi> to put you in mind of your daily dutie to the God of heaven.</p>
   <p>And let it not be thought presumption in me, that to these I have added this as a helpe to your Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to this mine uncessant prayers for the prospering of your good beginnings: And
<pb facs="11"/> for the welfare and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting happinesse of your selfe, your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous good Lady and whole familie; shall never be wanting, the hearty desires of</p>
