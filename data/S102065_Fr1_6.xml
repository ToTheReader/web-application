      <hi>To the Authour, on his</hi> Love-Melancholy.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>LOve,</hi> who, till now, was loosenes and hot Flame,</l>
      <l>Js here made warmth; &amp; joyes he is grown Tame.</l>
      <l>The Wanton's sober, here: this Artist brings</l>
      <l>The Boy, as comely still yet clip's his wings.</l>
      <l>Looke on his Blushes, his Cheekes modest fires.</l>
      <l>There's the same Rose, only 't hath lost the Briers.</l>
      <l>He, still his Jvory Bow, still keepes his Dart:</l>
      <l>Shootes here too, but with Judgement, and more Art.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>He is not not now call'd <hi>Lust,</hi> or Amorous staines:</l>
      <l>(As if the <hi>God</hi> i'th' shrine, were <hi>Sinne</hi> i'th' Veines.)</l>
      <l>Nor yet a perfect Birth: he must not shine,</l>
      <l>Blind, in his Mothers armes, yet see in Thine.</l>
      <l>Thus, th' Authour Iudge 'twixt us and <hi>Cupid,</hi> hee</l>
      <l>Nor takes from man, nor slatters Deitie.</l>
      <l>But, like an equall Flame, doth light impart,</l>
      <l>To shew the Beauty, yet not hide the Wart.</l>
      <l>For, had he made Love, Good, and our Desire,</l>
      <l>Without our reason, or wills awe, Entire:</l>
      <l>Then Ʋertue had been Nature; and We, been</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="11"/>
Good without praise; 'cause without pow'r to sin.</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Lucrece</hi> had lost the merit of her Care,</l>
      <l>Were she as eas'ly Chast, as she was Faire.</l>
      <l>Ice, had been rank'd with Ʋertue: we should know</l>
      <l>Chast Ʋirgins, Chronicled with coldest snow.</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Romans,</hi> that story Beauties free from sin,</l>
      <l>Had search'd their Gardens, and put Lillies in.</l>
      <l>Roses had then heard, modest: and one line</l>
      <l>Made <hi>Vesta's</hi> Blushes, and her Rubies joyne.</l>
      <l>And the dejected Goddesse weep, to see</l>
      <l>Her Christalls, Pure, and Ʋertuous, as she.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>No such Position then. For here our Love</l>
      <l>May be, or that o'th' sparrow, or Chast Dove.</l>
      <l>The Flames here drawne, nor Good, nor Bad: but are</l>
      <l>Apt, or to shine a Comet, or a starre.</l>
      <l>They are themselves, Indifferent: and may</l>
      <l>Rise to a raging Blaze, or temp'rate Ray.</l>
      <l>The Picture, doubtfull like the Face, may prove</l>
      <l>In thy breast, either Divell, or God of Love.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>No <hi>Galen</hi> here, that may confine the soule</l>
      <l>To th' Temper; and call't Vice, when the Bodies foule</l>
      <l>Potions might so make honest men; and awe</l>
      <l>Our Crimes, like scarres; and plaisters stand for law</l>
      <l>Fevers, and lust, were One, and both would heale</l>
      <l>By Iuleps; and men take Pills, not to steale.</l>
      <l>The Iudgement's subt'ler, here; and hath allow'd</l>
      <l>Some parch'd <hi>Moores,</hi> chast: light, wrap'd in that black clowd.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="11"/>
Here <hi>Scythians</hi> breasts of hot desire have sense:</l>
      <l>Nor, with their Furres, still put on Innocence.</l>
      <l>Yet, he still grants, these Flames may sooner grow,</l>
      <l>Jn Easterne sulphur, then in Northerne snow:</l>
      <l>And, that chast thoughts in <hi>Italy</hi> are rare:</l>
      <l>And, that each Turtle, proves a Phoenix there.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>He envies no Climes Vertue, as none's sin:</l>
      <l>Yet knowes, that some an easier Conquest win.</l>
      <l>All may be chast, for him: yet, 'tis well knowne,</l>
      <l>This Iewell is some Climats common stone.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Thus the wise Authour makes his Iustice sure:</l>
      <l>Allowes all Rich, but those that will be Poore.</l>
