      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Remonstrance</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands East India</hi> Company, hereafter in the first place following, was by the same Company presented to the <hi>Lord States Generall,</hi> of the vnited Provinces: in <hi>November, Anno 1624.</hi> for Answere of the Relation of the <hi>English East India</hi> Company, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vnjust, cruell, and barbarous proceeding against the <hi>English</hi> at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and for justification of that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous processe, the Coppie of which Remonstrance being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the sayd <hi>English</hi> Company, they forth with writ the subsequent Reply, and sent the same to be presented to the said <hi>Lords States Generall,</hi> for a counter-poyson a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against the said Remonstrance: At that time the <hi>English</hi> Company intended not to have publisht it in Print, thereby to make so many Iudges of the cause as now they must, but vpon faire hope then given them out of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> trusted (by the justice of the <hi>Lords States Generall,</hi> joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with that of their owne Soveraigne) to obtaine an is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue of this cause, according to the merits thereof. But the Ambassadour of the said <hi>Lords States</hi> being here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in <hi>Iune 1625.</hi> and moved by his Majestie for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the lives of his subjects, that were so treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
<pb facs="3"/>
but chered by theirs at <hi>Amboyna,</hi> as also for resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of their goods so made forfeit, and recompence for the damage of the <hi>English</hi> Company, by this and other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vsed such excuse and cullor (as it seemeth out of the ground of this Remonstrance: (which after many provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall disputes finally concludeth for delay of tryall) that at the last, in <hi>September</hi> the same yeare, they obtained of his Majestie a respit of 18. moneths for the calling home of the Governour <hi>Harman van Speult,</hi> and the rest of the Iudges in the sayd bloudy processe, from out of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> to answere the matter here themselues, and for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all the other Complaints of the <hi>English</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. To whom although this respit was irkesome, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready borne so long delay, in a cause of such impatient na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as also having a suspition of the sinister intent of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Companie: in this new respit; neverthelesse consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that this was a favour craved by the said <hi>Lords States</hi> in their first Ambassage to his Majestie, and their very congratulations of his happy successe to his rightfull Crownes, they held it their duty to conforme themselues to his Majesties grace herein. As also the same <hi>English</hi> Company having confidence in the sincere dealing of the <hi>Lords States Generall,</hi> whose Letter of the 31. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember. 1624.</hi> for calling home of the sayd bloudy <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi> and others, was committed to their conveyance, and by them sent into the <hi>Indies,</hi> hoped that their remedy though slow and long, would yet at last be sure, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous▪ and so they put on a new patience, and expectation of some issue of this likely course. But having waited out this respit, which expired, some years now past, they finde all things fall out contrary to their hope so grounded vpon the <hi>Lords States</hi> promise and Letter, but altogether veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb facs="3"/>
their suspition of the drift of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany before mentioned. For the said Letter of the <hi>Lords States</hi> being by the <hi>English President</hi> at <hi>Iacatra,</hi> safely delivered to <hi>Carpentier, Governour Generall</hi> of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> he (when <hi>Harman van Speult</hi> the late <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and head of the bloudy treachery against the <hi>English</hi> there) arrived at <hi>Iacatra</hi>) received him with great honour, yea with triumph, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of sending him for <hi>Europe,</hi> to answere the complaints of the <hi>English,</hi> according to the direction and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Lords States,</hi> by their sayd Letter; made him cheife Commander of a fleete of ships, sent from thence to <hi>Surat,</hi> and other Northerne parts of the <hi>Indies.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> President and Councell at <hi>Iacatra,</hi> in vaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing here-against, and vrging his remission to <hi>Europe,</hi> in consequence of the Letter of the <hi>Lords States</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd. Neither haue the Officers of the sayd <hi>Netherlands</hi> Company in the <hi>Indies,</hi> in all that respit of 18 moneths, nor in all the time since, made any restitution or reparation to the <hi>English</hi> as was promised and pretended, nor any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration thereunto, but rather haue added new grievances. So that it now plainely appeareth, that the sayd <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands East India</hi> Company, in their earnest suite to the <hi>Lords States,</hi> to procure his Majestie to giue respit for the due tryall of the cause of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> inserted in the latter end of this ensuing Remonstrance; intended nothing lesse then such a true tryall, but a cooling and blunting of the edge and zeale of the <hi>English</hi> Company, in pursuing of their due remedies, hoping (as it is in the fable of him, that vndertooke to teach the Asse to speake) that in long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and respit of time something might happen, vtterly to elude and frustrate the reall performance: In the meane
<pb facs="4"/>
time, besides the goods of the <hi>English</hi> that they detaine, they enioy the whole trade of the <hi>Mulluccoes, Banda,</hi> and <hi>Amboyna,</hi> the true, though wretched motive of their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable processe, against the Innocents, and haue raised the Nutmegs, Maces, Cloues, (being by this meanes solely in their owne hands) to more then double the price of that they were at, in these parts, when the <hi>English</hi> had their share in them. Whereby it appeareth how sincerely this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Remonstrance</hi> slighteth this matter as a poore end, though it so much enrich the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company; as likewise how much, not onely the whole Realme of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> but even all the Kingdomes and Common wealths in <hi>Europe,</hi> that are thus served with those Spices at such high rates, are interessed in this cause. And yet besides all the premises, the <hi>English</hi> Company finde another and more proper cause of their recourse to the presse at this present, otherwise for all the rest they could perhaps attend other remedies. But they finde that in this Interim, of the cause and motives whereof the world could take no notice, many not onely of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but <hi>English</hi> also, begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue worse of the <hi>English</hi> cause: presuming that if it had beene such as the discourses formerly published in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument imported, they thinke certainely, ere this, to haue heard of some exemplary punishment vpon so execrable a fact, or at least of some serious preparation thereunto. In particuler the <hi>English</hi> Company vnderstand, that some of the bloudy Colledge of Iudges, being returned into the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and living free, and well countenanced there, have of late, vpon confidence (as it seemes) of the effectuall working of their elusory Artifice, craked and vaunted, that they will justifie their processe of <hi>Amboy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> even to the face of his Majestie, (which are their owne
<pb facs="4"/>
facing words) although the same parties at their first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ivall in <hi>Holland;</hi> kept themselues close, and were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>owne where to be found, when the Ministers of this state sought after them. Which bold face being put vpon this bad matter, hath so farre countenanced the same, as that some of our owne Nation there, allied to the <hi>Dutch,</hi>

         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ue in private stept vp in defence of the sayd barbarous butchery, and seeme at least to thinke the matter aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above the true desert, Wherefore least the poore innocent <hi>English</hi> that haue already suffered so many and so grievous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>rtures, and afterwards a reproachfull death, should now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>aine after death, suffer in their good names also, which is, or ought to be, dearer then life it selfe, least also the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish East India</hi> Company, that haue likewise suffered too many indignities, and such damages from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> should seeme to haue made a great cry without as just a cause; They now finde it high time to vindicate their owne reputation, and the fame of their innocent servants and Country-men, by accquainting the world with the true state of the businesse, as also to defend and maintaine their former true relation from the exceptions taken against it, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
