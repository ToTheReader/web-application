      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou haue heer (deer Christiās) the labours of Thomas Louell (a faithful minister of Chrste, and disposer of Gods secrets) vveerin he hath shevved himself godly, painful, and learned. Godly, in seeking to set foorth Gods glory, in suppressing (yea rather rooting out) of vice, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncing of vertue: in laboring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Saboth or dayes of rest, to their right vse: in striuing to stoppe the cours of vvanton youth in Christians▪ in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the office of a good Pastor, not only in ministring of spirituall foode to the sheep of his ovvne folde: but also in vvriting, vvhich may be profitable to the vvhole flock that Christe hath bought vvith so deere a price. Painful he hath shevved hīself, in that he hath doon this in a dialogue or talk betvveen tvvoo, vvherin is obiected, and fullie aunsvve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red vvhatsoeuer the fleshly minded is or
<pb facs="11"/>
can be able to obiect agaīst that vvhich he taketh in hand to teach. Yea, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he hath doon it in (vearse, vvherī is much more difficultie then in prose) that therby the carelesse mindes of vvanton persōs, might be mooued to read or hear, that vvhich othervvise they vvould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer regarde. Learned he hath shevved him selfe in that he hath confuted all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, and confirmed his ovvne asser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions, by sufficient aucthoritie of holie scriptures, and also by the iudgemēt, both of ecclesiasticall and profane vvriters, yea, and by the lavves and constitutions made in generall counsailes, and in our ovvne parliaments also. Receiue thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully therfore these (our brothers) labors so godly, so painfull, and so learned. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace veritie, vve he not maried to cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome: but to Christ. He neuer said, I am custom: But thus he hath said. I am the vvay, the truthe, and the life. Let vs therfore vvalke in him: that vvhen our iourney shalbe ended: vve may enter vvith him into that endles rest, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <pb facs="12"/>
the rest of the seuenth day is a figure. And liue vvith him in that endles life that he hath prepared for vs, vvhich God for his mercie sake graunt vs all to doo. Amen. ❧</p>
