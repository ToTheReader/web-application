   <p>VVHat the state of our most afflicted Countrey is, without all doubt you have perceived by others; all things (as I may use the words of the Poet) have runne together for the worse, and slid with a backward foot, for wheresoere we cast our eyes, wee see nothing but misery, and a horrid devastation of townes and villages; the insolencie and cruelty of the Souldiers exceeds all beliefe, they have not beene afraid, sor the hope of prey, in <hi>Swei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruggen</hi> to violate the tombes of the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious Dukes many yeares agoe deceased, to exercise cruelty on their corps, to disturb and diminish their bones. The dearenesse of provision is such as never hath beene heard of before in this land, a bushell of corne is scarsely got with 1<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="1 letter">

should lend us his helping hand, those few Inhabitants which yet remaine alive, and hitherto for the most part have lived on apples and peares must needs perish. The Famine of <hi>Saguntum, Samaria, Ierusalem,</hi> if they are but paralleld with those most grievous ones (oh our griefe!) that have befalne us in our Countrey, seeme but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles. About a fortnight since, an Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of the village of <hi>Ilvesbeim</hi> (a mano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise of a good report) comming into the house of his neighbour, when he was absent, tooke a little bread, intending to goe out, a child of some eight yeares of age called after him, and threatned him, that when his Cousen came home, with whom he lived, that he would make manifest his theft presently; that wicked fellow ranne unto him, and with a pruning hooke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably cut his throate. In the Village of <hi>Steinhaus</hi> neere <hi>Hornebach,</hi> a certaine wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man having allured unto her with enticing words a girle of 12. yeares old, and a boy of 5, a Millers son (I tremble in the relating)
<pb facs="14"/>
killed them both, and devoured them with her neighbour; the Garrison Souldiers of <hi>Sweibrugen</hi> making an excursion by chance into this village, being drawne thither by the smell, enter the house of this infant kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; they search every corner, at last they finde a vessell full of humane grease, and a head that had beene scalded in hot water, and so baked in an oven; they carried her caprive unto <hi>Sweibruggen,</hi> where on the 24 of <hi>Ianuary</hi> shee suffered condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; At her death she confest, that neere <hi>Landovia</hi> and the Village of <hi>Anna,</hi> she killd two other children the last year. The other woman, which was partaker in the eating, is still kept in prison, and constantly denies that shee was a partner in that wicked act. Such things (oh our grief!) we are compeld daily to heare, most sad examples. O ill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading hunger, O wits truly Cyclopicke! O dreadful Metamorphosis! by which men putting off all humanity, and putting on the nature of salvage beasts, doe truly become wolvish!</p>
