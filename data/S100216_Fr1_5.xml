   <head>A Complaint of the abuse of the noble Arte Chirurgerie.</head>
   <l>A Midest the waues of Ocean seas,</l>
   <l>to memorie I gan to call,</l>
   <l>The famous arte of medicine,</l>
   <l>that daylie doth to ruine fall.</l>
   <l>A gift of God most excellent,</l>
   <l>to cure each mans infirmitie,</l>
   <l>Whereby his name extolled is,</l>
   <l>with praise and thankes continuallie.</l>
   <l>For what is he that doth beholde,</l>
   <l>the sundrie thinges that longes thereto,</l>
   <l>As gummes of trees, hearbs, seedes, and fruites,</l>
   <l>with stones and mineralls also.</l>
   <l>But will aduance his power great,</l>
   <l>to see their hidden propertie,</l>
   <l>And operations wonderfull,</l>
   <l>vppon the partes of mans body.</l>
   <l>And to fulfill this Godlie guift,</l>
   <l>he hath ordaned members fit,</l>
   <l>Chirurgians I meane which to</l>
   <l>the sicklie may deliuer it.</l>
   <l>But out alas I am constrained,</l>
   <l>with griefe of heart for to declare,</l>
   <l>That such a worthie arte shoud be,</l>
   <l>in peeces rent and left so bare.</l>
   <l>For to record the present state,</l>
   <l>it makes me greuously to mone,</l>
   <l>Sith Galen and Hippocrates,</l>
   <l>did exercise it all as one.</l>
   <l>In elder times there were but few,</l>
   <l>that had therein experience,</l>
   <l>But such in deede as did excell,</l>
   <l>in learning and in diligence.</l>
   <pb facs="14"/>
   <l>Wherefore they were accepted then,</l>
   <l>as treasures ritch and precious,</l>
   <l>And also to the common wealth,</l>
   <l>accounted most commodious.</l>
   <l>But now there are so many that</l>
   <l>this famous arte doe dailie haunt,</l>
   <l>And such as for the most part are,</l>
   <l>both blind and verie ignoraunt.</l>
   <l>That for their hurtfull practises,</l>
   <l>t'were better they were neuer borne,</l>
   <l>Appearing to their countrie deare</l>
   <l>as Caterpillers be to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>rne.</l>
   <l>Chirurgery moreouer is,</l>
   <l>abhorred of the Phisition,</l>
   <l>Who doth esteeme it as a thing,</l>
   <l>to vile for his profession.</l>
   <l>The other doth account this arte,</l>
   <l>a part of Phisick for to be,</l>
   <l>As for those parts of man alone,</l>
   <l>that are apparaunt outwardlie.</l>
   <l>And therefore doth he not regard,</l>
   <l>in learning to be studyous,</l>
   <l>For that he doth suppose the same,</l>
   <l>vnto his arte superfluous.</l>
   <l>How can the Surgeon well dissolue,</l>
   <l>the thing contained in his cure,</l>
   <l>Except he doe euacuate,</l>
   <l>and purge the same that is vnpure.</l>
   <l>Or is he able for to cure,</l>
   <l>all woundes and vlcers redylie,</l>
   <l>Without the administration,</l>
   <l>of diuers medicines inwardlie.</l>
   <l>Or can he take away the griefe,</l>
   <l>that vnto nature hurtfull is,</l>
   <l>Without the ayde of diet due,</l>
   <pb facs="14"/>
   <l>and purging that which is amisse.</l>
   <l>How can then Surgery I say,</l>
   <l>from Phisicke well detracted be,</l>
   <l>Sith that in euery action,</l>
   <l>according lie they doe agree.</l>
   <l>But as it ws without aduise,</l>
   <l>disorderedlie distincte in twaine,</l>
   <l>So now the same deuided is,</l>
   <l>by wicked impes in parts againe.</l>
   <l>Some for the rheume forsooth will deale,</l>
   <l>and some to heale th'affected eyes,</l>
   <l>Some for the deafenesse of the eares,</l>
   <l>and some to cure the stone likewise.</l>
   <l>Some for the strangury, and some</l>
   <l>to cure a feuer skilfull are,</l>
   <l>And some to beautify the face,</l>
   <l>some also agneales for to pare.</l>
   <l>Some for an vlcer, some a wound,</l>
   <l>and some the Fistulae alone,</l>
   <l>Some for the pockes, some for a wenne,</l>
   <l>and some to cure a broken bone.</l>
   <l>Some for the dropsy others eke,</l>
   <l>that for the gout alone doe deale,</l>
   <l>Some for the tooth ach expert be,</l>
   <l>and some the rupture for to heale.</l>
   <l>Thus euerie one doth catch a peece,</l>
   <l>and gadding goes from place to place,</l>
   <l>Like pedlers prating in their pumpes,</l>
   <l>which daielie doe the arte disgrace.</l>
   <l>But to maintaine their Idle liues,</l>
   <l>they rather seeme to practise it,</l>
   <l>Then by their studies for to liue,</l>
   <l>in common wealth as members fit.</l>
   <l>And further more a griefe it is,</l>
   <l>to see how thinges are brought about,</l>
   <pb facs="15"/>
   <l>And onely to subuert the arte,</l>
   <l>and vtterly to roote it out.</l>
   <l>For they that doe professe the same,</l>
   <l>and should most excellent appeare.</l>
   <l>Their callings greatly doe neglect,</l>
   <l>in riot, pride, and bellie cheare.</l>
   <l>Not once regarding that they ought,</l>
   <l>in readinesse ech thing to haue,</l>
   <l>Whereby the grieued limmes and life,</l>
   <l>of the aflicted they may saue.</l>
   <l>But some will say I haue a salue,</l>
   <l>most excellent for ech affect,</l>
   <l>When he the bodies state, disease,</l>
   <l>And Countries force doth not respect.</l>
   <l>Nor yet the number that is hurt,</l>
   <l>by present chaunce ensuing then,</l>
   <l>So that in curing fiue or sixe,</l>
   <l>perhaps he spoyleth nine or tenne.</l>
   <l>Some will a mixture make of druggs,</l>
   <l>yet they their vses doe not know,</l>
   <l>Which when they are in practise put,</l>
   <l>their strange effects doe truely showe.</l>
   <l>And othersome in steade of bookes,</l>
   <l>doe studie at the bowles full hard,</l>
   <l>And when they should their cures apply,</l>
   <l>doe runne to plaies, to Dice and Cards.</l>
   <l>Some take delight to iest and skoffe,</l>
   <l>in whoredome and in idlenesse,</l>
   <l>Some couet greatly to be rich,</l>
   <l>and some delight in all excesse.</l>
   <l>Some are of such a currish kind,</l>
   <l>They are not, so that they may gayne,</l>
   <l>Nor takes regarde vnto the sicke,</l>
   <l>that languisheth in grieuous payne.</l>
   <pb facs="15"/>
   <l>Some occupations three or foure,</l>
   <l>haue also ioyning therevnto,</l>
   <l>And when they haue great substance got,</l>
   <l>their studies quite they doe forgoe.</l>
   <l>And some moreouer papists are,</l>
   <l>some nulli fidians likewise be,</l>
   <l>Some atheists temporifers, and</l>
   <l>some machiuells a griefe to so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <l>And some so stained are with vice,</l>
   <l>that they more likely doe appeare,</l>
   <l>Incarnet diuells for to bee,</l>
   <l>then such as liue in Godlie feare.</l>
   <l>And some there be that prentises,</l>

   <l>their onelie drudges do them make,</l>
   <l>Whose yeeres when they expired be,</l>
   <l>to practise straight they do prepare,</l>
   <l>As wise as woodcocks in their workes,</l>
   <l>without discretion or care,</l>
   <l>Some buy their medicines redie made,</l>
   <l>not knowing how to make the same,</l>
   <l>Or else doe take it in disdaine,</l>
   <l>therto their fingers fine to frame,</l>
   <l>Through which abuses this our arte,</l>

   <l>And many thousands spoyled be</l>
   <l>whose cause I doe lament this daie,</l>
   <l>Yet no man heere I doe accuse,</l>
   <l>to be the priuate cause of this.</l>
   <l>But euerie one I doe exhort,</l>
   <l>to mend the thing that is amisse.</l>
   <l>Who dealeth not with brutish beasts,</l>
   <l>but man that is Gods Image deare,</l>
   <l>Regard therefore your calling great,</l>
