   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>COurteous Reader; it is a note as the <hi>Wise-man,</hi> noteth it, of a <hi>foole, to beleeve every thing:</hi> I doubt not but thou hast heard much of the Troubles in Scotland; Now, that thou mayst not <hi>justifie the wicked, and condemne the just, which are both abomination to the Lord.</hi> I have thought fitt, for thy good, to publ sh this short relation: It came to me from such persons, as doe well know the proceedings of things there, from first to last; and therefore thou mayst be confident that the same is trùe.</p>
   <p>It seemes by some notes which I finde in the margent, that it was sent from a <hi>Scotsman,</hi> to some good freind that he had in England: and in likelihood a strict <hi>Nonconformist,</hi> who shewes his good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, that <hi>England</hi> might bè reduced unto <hi>Scotlands</hi> Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and not <hi>Stotland</hi> to <hi>Englands</hi> Deformation: But not beeing willing to write of things whereof I have no cerraine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I will therefore be silent, and leave thee to the reading of the discourse.</p>
