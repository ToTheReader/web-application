   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ertayne chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
wemen (and
speciallye suche,
as were ryche or
wealthy) when
theyr husbandes
were deade, thorowe ambition
and vayne glorye, dyd marye
wyth the gentyls afterwardes,
because they were ashamed of
chrysten men, as personnes of a
lowe degre, and of smale sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stannce.
<pb facs="17"/>
For in those dayes, the
heathē had at y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wealth, &amp; highe
power in their handes. They
did raigne, bare rule, and had all
the dominion alone. The poore
chrysten lyued then wyth oute
all maner of office, or authory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
in the commune wealth: ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
yea rather laye hyd, &amp; wer
al onelye knowen, by theyr mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destyousnesse,
and sobre liuinge.
Therfore when Tertulyan saw
this vnsemelye example, of the
wyddowes, whyche so dyd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
againe, he in this latter boke,
going aboute for to warne hys
owne wife of that incōuenience,
intreateth of those wemen, that
toke vnto theyr husbandes, gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiles:
declarynge also playnely,
y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in so doyng, they dyd wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
&amp; al agaīst S. Paules sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
with y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which they defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="18"/>
theyr dede. By and by after
he doth rehe rse, the impedymen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and inconueniency, that came
of such wedlocke, seīg that they
mighte not frelye attende, vnto
the obseruacions of the christen
faythe. In the whyche place he
receyteth the chiefe studies and
offices, of our religyon, whiche
wer vsed in those daies. That is
to say, of standing, of fasting, of
processyon (whyche represented
the people of the Iewes, that
went fourthe of Ierusalem, for
to mete Chryste: And also the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
goynge oute, vnto the
Mounte, when chryste ascended
into heauen) Of the vysyting of
the bretherne (that was of the
christen, when they were syche,
and diseased) of the watchinge
in the nyght at Easter: whyche
Sainct Ierome thoughte ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be celebrat and done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="18"/>
it is the tradition of the
Iewes, that Chryste shal come
at mydnyghte, like as it was, in
the tyme of the Egiptians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Wherfore I thynke (sayth
he) y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the Apostles tradicion did
then stil remayne, that on Easter
euen, the people mighte not goo
awaye, tyll halfe the nyght wer
paste, but shoulde tarye waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
for the comming of Christ,
that then, when that tyme was
passed, they myghte al of them,
with the more securitie, &amp; wyth
out feare, kepe that feaste holy.
Tertulian makyth also mentiō,
of the lordes feaste, or supper, of
the vysyting of men in prison, of
the kyssing of bretherne, that is
chrysten men, of the washyng of
feete, of the impartynge or dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge
of meate and drynke, and
lodginge, of the sygne or token
of the crosse, of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> prayers made
<pb facs="19"/>
In the nyghte: of the sacrament,
of the lordes bodye and bloude
(whiche was then taken, before
they dyd eate anye meate) and
of the holy synginge, of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
people then. Laste of all, he
extolleth, that matrymonye, by
the whyche a chrysten manne, is
coupled vnto a christen woman,
because that then, one may kepe
theyr chrystianity, when as (that
I maye vse Tertulyans owne
wordes) the sycke is freely visy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the neby susteyned, when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>messe
is done without torment,
or feare: the comunion vsed and
frequented, wythout all scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losyte
and doubte (that is to
say, when the husband himself,
beynge also present at the same,
is not afrayde of his wyfe) day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dylygence without any impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyment,
no markynge of one,
wyth the sygne of the crosse, by
<pb facs="19"/>
stealthe. (For a chrysten woman
then, durst not, that her husband
myghte see, crosse her selfe: but
did it secreatly) no tremblyng or
fearfull gretyng (for the wyfe in
saluting of a chrysten man, dyd
cause her vnbeleuing husbande,
for to suspecte her of adulterye)
nor yet no domme praysynge of
god. For in the presence of an
heathen man, hys wyfe durste
not openly, or alowde gyue thā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
vnto chryste. Whych thinge
he hym selfe dothe so expound,
when he sayth, afterwardes.
psalmes and holye him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
are songe betwen
them two, and the
one striueth with
the other, who
can sing best
vnto their
God.</p>
