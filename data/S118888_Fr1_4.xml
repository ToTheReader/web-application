   <head>❀ Iohn Caluin to all fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Readers greeting.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I perused this disputation, I perceiued vpon the very point of the handling of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, certen bitter, and sharpe kinde of wordes, which possibly, may grieue and offend some delicate and fine eares. But because I know that many good and godly men haue suffred some part of this sleape of the soules, to enter, and possesse their harts, either by too too much lightnes of beliefe, or els for want of knowledge of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which was in deede the cause, why they were not vpon the soddaine, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly armed to withstand the same, I would not haue them offended, nor yet take so much occasion as they mought, to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with me, because they fall not obstinately, and malitiously herein. And therefore I minde here, purposely to geue warning vnto all such, to the end they should not construe any thing that I haue sayd, to be spoken as it were, to put them in any heate. But let them vnderstand thus much, That so often as I boldly, and freely, speake, that I direct my speach to that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="9"/> and obstinate generation of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes, from whose springhead, as I haue already sayd, this poysonfull water run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eth: and therefore doe I not so roughly deale with them as they deserue. For, I am determined so to behaue my selfe towardes them, as that if they shall heareafter spurne agaynst me, they spall finde me a constant defender of the trueth, and although I be not all the greatest clearke, yet dare I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>houldly, by the grace of almighty God promise this, that I will be found inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. Neither haue I but in modest sort, vttered my choller agaynst them, for to say truely, I still cease from outragious and spightfull wordes: and haue almost in euery place so tempered my stile, or vaine of wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as that it is rather an apt order of teaching, then a forcible drawing: &amp; yet is it for all that, such, as may draw those which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>il not wilfully be caryed away. For in deed my intent is to bring them back agayne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right way, rather then to moue and prouoke them to anger. Wherefore, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and beseech all the Readers hereof, in the name of God the Father, and of his sonne Iesus Christ our Lord, to bring with them
<pb facs="10"/> to the reading of this Treatise, a perfect and sound iudgement, and also a right and pure hart, as a seate ready prepared for the manifest receiuing of the trueth.</p>
   <p>I know well enough what fauour the thing may haue, for the pleasing of some mens eares: Howbeit, we are thus to thinke, that there is but one onely voyce of lyfe, and that in deede, proceedeth from the mouth of the Lord. Wherfore, our eares out of all doubt, ought to harken vnto that voyce, so often as there ariseth any questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the doctrine of saluation, and not to listen to any other whatsoeuer. Now, the word of God is no new, or straunge thing: but such as hath bin from the beginning, is now, and shall be for euer.</p>
   <p>And therefore they are very grossely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, who finde fault with the newnes of the word of God, being now, after long op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, or buriall, through peruerse vsage, and negligence brought to light, and on their side, in my opinion, they offend as greatly, who lyke Reedes, suffer themselues to be caryed away with euery winde, yea and more then that, to be shaken and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the least blast that may be. Is this
<pb facs="10"/> to learne Iesus Christ, when as we will geue eare vnto all kindes of doctrine, how true soeuer they be, without the warrant of God his word? For, if we receiue the doctrine, as from a mortall man, shall not leasings also as easely preuaile and take place with vs? And what bringeth man with himselfe, but onely vanitie? Now, this is not to follow the example of those, who after they haue once receiued the word of God, deepely sound and search the scriptures, to know whether it be so or no. This is then a good example if we would fellow it: But we receiue the word, I know not how negligently and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or rather contemptuously, so that if we haue learned but three wordes of it, we forthwith swell with an opiniō of wisedome, and yet neuer burst: thinking our selues by and by to be Princes, and great rich men.</p>
   <p>And vpon this imagination, we shall finde a mighty number cry mainely out, and keepe a great coyle, agaynst the ignoraunce of all ages: and yet themselues as ignoraunt as they, agaynst whome they so proudely cry out. But what shall a man say, or doe to this geare? They would be taken forsooth for Christians, and so in deede are called,
<pb facs="11"/> because they haue had a lick at the wikes of the lips of some of the principal poynts, or Articles, of cōmō places. And forsomuch as they thinke it a great shame to be ignoraūt in any thing, they will shamelesly aunswere to euery matter, as if they were all oracles which come out of their mouthes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from thence doe spring so many schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, errors, and opinions, such a number of offences, and hardnes of our beliefe: so, that by this occasion, the Infidels prostitute them, and blaspheme the name, and word of God. And in the end (which is the very ground worke of all mischiefe) whenas they obstinately continue the maintenaunce of any thing, which hath lightly passed their mouthes, they fourthwith runne to defēd their error by the holy scriptures. O good &amp; mercyfull God, when they are once growen to this poynt, what is it that they will not turne vpside downe? what is it that they will not depraue, or corrupt to make it yeld, yea forcibly wring and wrest it, to their mindes and purposes? And therefore the Poet sayd very well, that fury causeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and debate. Is this, I beseech you, the way to learne, to turne ouer the leaues
<pb facs="11"/> of the scriptures, to serue our fond appetits, and be subiect to our mindes? Was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a foolisher thing then this? was there euer greater folly? O most pernicious pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: <hi>O</hi> dronklieu darnell, the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne and sure enemy to mankinde, which meaneth to ouergrowe and choake the good and true seede. But yet let vs be abashed to see that so many sectes should come from those which first professed the Gospell, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the word out of the dark Truely this threat greatly troubleth me, where it is sayd The kingdome of God shall be taken from you, and geuen to another nation, that shall bring fourth the fruites thereof. And here I meane to end my complaynt: because my booke would be ouer great, if I should make such a declamation, as appertayneth to the froward dealing of these dayes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my brethren, let vs, after so many examples be admonished, or at the least, yet in the end, become wise. And let vs wholy depend vpon the mouth of God, and still looke vnto his word: neither let vs add, or entermeddle any thing of our owne, to or with his wisedome, to the end our Leauen marre not the whole lumpe, and make the
<pb facs="12"/> salt that is in vs, vnsauery But let vs shew our selues to be such obedient subiects to our God, as he would haue vs be: to witt, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, simple, and playne, not cleauing to our owne wisdome &amp; very zealous to learn: yet let vs know nothing, or be willing to learne any thing, saue onely that which he shall teach vs, And besides, let vs flee whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is straunge, and not conteined in his law, as a deadly poyson. I will meete also with those kinde of men, who would faine finde fault with my meaning, and say, that I rayse vp terrible styrres, and controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, about a matter of nothing, decyding these quarrels with cruell dissentions. For I am sure there are great store of these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who will not stick thus to deale with me. And therefore I aunswere them thus: That seing the word of God, is of set purpose, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately assayled: that the least iotte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is by no meanes to be abidden, to be dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the wall: and this is not a matter of nothing, or of so light regard, to see the light of God thus furiously put out, through Satans obscuritie and darkenes. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, this cause is of farre greater waight, then many take it to be. But by the way,
<pb facs="12"/> he that cannot away to see the errors and foolishe opinions of others, is not therefor as they enterpret it, by and by to be sayd, that he opinatiuely disagreeth, euen to the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of bloud. For, I reproue nothing els, but the foolish curiositie of such as striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these questions, which are nothing els, in very deede, but a tormenting and vexing of the minde. Neuertheles after they had reuiued this dounghill opinion, it was meete their rashnes should be reproued, to the end they should not preuaile agaynst the trueth. Now, I knew not whether I was able to doe it or no, yet my will was very good: &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer goodnes is in it, I haue also with good will deliuered it: Wherefore, if there are any others that can better deale in it, Let them in Gods name bestow their trauell to the common benefite of their poore Brethren. Basile. 1536.</p>
