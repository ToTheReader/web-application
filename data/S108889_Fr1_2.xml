                 <title>Looke from Adam, and behold the Protestants faith and religion : evidently proued out of the holy Scriptures against all atheists, papists, loose libertines, and carnall gospellers: and that the faith which they professe, hath continued from the beginning of the world, and so is the true and ancient faith. Herein hast thou also a short summe of the whole Bible, and a plaine manifestation, that all holy men who have pleased God, have beene saved through this Christian faith alone</title>

   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving divers times observed with my selfe (most Christian Reader) that the doctrine of the Gospell, which hath beene now freely preached these many yeeres amongst us, in this our flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing Common-wealth, is yet daily and ordinarily, by sundry persons, charged with noveltie, as which being an upstart, were not of sufficient standing or antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: I thought it not amisse in this respect, either for the confutation of the obstinate adversarie, or for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the weake and simple professour of religion, to publish and set forth this little worke of <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Miles Coverdale,</hi> who for his integritie of life, and fame in learning, and other excellent gifts, was so renowmed in the Church of Christ in his age, that I doubt not, but that his onely name will be a sufficient credit, (with any man, that is not maliciously disposed) for the full allowance, and well-liking of any such monument of his, as he of pure zeale, and good affection, hath commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us his posteritie. By which travels of his, as hee
<pb facs="3"/>
hath generally shewed himselfe a notable member in the Church of God: so hath he thereby especially well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of this his native Countrey. Wherefore not willing to detain thee from better matter, I wish thee to use this booke to thy profit, and with mee to give thanks to our mercifull Father, for this valiant Souldier, as also for other worthie Martyrs of his time, which after the battell by themselves fought, have (by Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) left spirituall children, (I meane their good bookes) to make a supply, that Christs Church may bee encreased, to the utter confusion and overthrow of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
