   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader; thy gentlenesse and patience is much exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in these times, with the multitude of bookes; which men say they bee commonly forced to put vpon thee by the importunity of their friends. This to mee is no reason at all, for the publishing of this Treatise: and indeed they whom it most concerneth doe least desire it. Yet three motiues I haue which may make sufficient apologie for me.</p>
   <p n="1">1 First, seeing the haruest of Vsurers in these parts to be great; at S. <hi>Stephens</hi> in Walbrooke, the heart of this Citie, I began to labour in this point. By their flocking to those Sermons, they seemed to be ripe, and euen <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 4. 35</note>
      <hi>white vnto the haruest.</hi> But when men assemble after the <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 17. 21.</note>
      <hi>Athenian</hi> fashion, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly proueth a solemne hearing, and a solemne forgetting. Notwithstanding, perceiuing afterwards those poore labours to haue made some little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in the minds of the better sort; I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="5"/>
to make this impression. Wherein after my plaine maner, I haue somewhat, not as I would, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined that which then was more rudely deliuered: cast it into a new mold and method, that thou maist carrie the whole frame in thy view, and passe more easily from point to point: and added much more, then in the throng of other busines I could, at that time, thinke vpon.</p>
   <p n="2">2 A second motiue hath been the mistakings of some which haue occasioned misreports; as if in the end I concluded nothing, or defended some kind of Vsurie. Which censures I may impute vnto two causes. The first is ordinarie vpon these occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where the most attentiue may say, as wise and learned <hi>Eliphas</hi> said of himselfe: <note n="*" place="margin">Iob 4 12.</note>
      <hi>Mine eare hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a little of it:</hi> for part of that which is only spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, must needs vanish in the aire, before it can bee fully fastned in the mind, and fitted to the whole frame and current of speech. 2 Another cause is, the narrownesse of the point in question. For euery question, as the learned know, hath a point which is scarce diuisible. Comming therefore precisely to cut an vsurious act from such lawfull couenants as doe next adioyne vpon it, the passage is so narrow, that we might easily mistake, or bee mistaken. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding thus farre I must appeale to the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie which then was; that when I came to those straites at the conclusion and determination, of the question, purposely to auoid these misconceites; I did often iterate and beate vpon the maine conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that, <hi>all Vsurie properly so called, is simply vnlawful.</hi> But howsoeuer it was either not so exactly deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb facs="5"/>
or distinctly taken, as it should: the onely reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die which now remaineth, is to exhibit the effect of that in writing which then was said; that such as make scruple, may at their pleasure, and best leisure, pause vpon it.</p>
   <p n="3">3 Last of all, after that by the handling of this point in publike, I had troubled the waters, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp the minds of men to giue censures according to their seuerall apprehensions; I haue taken time to obserue what yet could further be vrged for Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; or obiected against that which then was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: whereby being better furnished by reason of matter newly ministred, then at the first I could; I thought it part of my dutie to giue better satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this kind, and to meet with such probabilities as are, or may with any colour bee suggested. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which, if I could find any ground of reason, for the defence of any Vsurie at all, I would most willingly either acknowledge it, or be silent. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I haue found none; but discharged my cōscience according to my simple knowledge. My reward shal be manifold censures no doubt: for what other can be expected in so vnpleasing a matter, and amidst so many aduersaries? Aduersaries, I say, not in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or argument, but in action. So as being thought ouer busie in this businesse, I feare I shall be occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take vp that text of Scripture, though I hope in a farre other cause: <hi>Thus was I wounded in the house</hi>
      <note place="margin">Zac. 13. 6.</note>
      <hi>of my friends.</hi> Bee they friends, or bee they strangers, who are any waies touched in this point; let them strike with the tongue, and wound at their pleasure; I shall thinke my selfe well apaid, if I can cause their
<pb facs="6"/>
but to feele those wounds which they haue made in their owne consciences, by this sinne.</p>
   <p>This Treatise (Christian Reader) is not so large as to require a table, though it be tedious. Howbeit to giue thee some direction (besides the order of the generall heads before the booke) the last chapter being a briefe of the premisses, with reference in the margine to the seuerall places, where the points bee more fully handled; may serue in stead thereof.</p>
   <p>So wishing that thou maiest reade with a single eye; iudge of what thou readest without affection; and conforme thy affection to right iudgement: I commend thee to the spirit of grace, whom I beseech, according to the right, to guide and sanctifie the actions of thy life.</p>
