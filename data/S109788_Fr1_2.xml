   <head>To the Right Honourable, Lord, Lord Thomas, Earle of Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex, Viscont Fitzwalter Lorde of Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, and of Burnell, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, Iustice of the Forrestes &amp; Chases, from Trent Southward, and Captaine of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Pensioners, of the house of the Queene our Soueraigne Ladie,</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Athyllus,</hi> he of <hi>Samos</hi> (moste honorable Lord) was one whiche the Poet <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creon</hi> sang alwayes of, minding him in euery song for a certaine conceipt of worthinesse which he thought was in him: Likewise <hi>Ligurinus</hi> was alwayes one at
<pb facs="3"/>
the ende of <hi>Horace</hi> his pen and mouth. And as a report goeth (and many Romaine Histories shew the same) <hi>Numa</hi> &amp; <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi> are by Poets commended, vp to the Orbes of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Skie: where they saye they liue as they list: whose bread is <hi>Nectar,</hi> and drink <hi>Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> a sugred and confect kinde of Wine, which is serued oute in a faire Goblet or Cuppe by a faire waiting Boy named <hi>Ganime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> These Poets figured here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (most Honorable Lord) that any of the nine Muses, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb facs="3"/>
kinde of Harpe they vsed, it should be strung and tuned so that it mought reach to <hi>Diates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seron,</hi> the onely note of Noble mens commendation. And so doe I gather, it is best vsed. I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon nowe wishe that although <hi>Anacreon</hi> be gone, I had yet his Harpe: for then would I now set and tune it many Notes higher than euer could he in the prayse of <hi>Bathyllus,</hi> or <hi>Horace</hi> in the testimonie of <hi>Ligurius</hi>: For I would vse it to recognize and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gester the memoriall of Yours such absolute Vertues. But sith
<pb facs="4"/>
this Harpe is denied me: and the verie Instrument which I nowe sound of, is not as I would it were, my intent notwithstanding and not my possibilitie is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Yet rather then I should haue shewed nothing at al of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter testomonie of my good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your Honor, this shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fise me (vntill hereafter I may do better) to vse so simple a sound. And if so be I could worthilye cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende you (as those Poets did <hi>Numa</hi> and <hi>Seruius</hi>) to highe <hi>Olympus:</hi> you should surely by such our meanes come by some of
<pb facs="4"/>
their Iuncketts that they haue: But this would I rather be done, by message had to and fro from these (which way <hi>Hercules</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with <hi>Hyla Thiodamant</hi> his Sonne: <hi>Apollo</hi> with <hi>Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth: Diana</hi> with <hi>Hyppoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>:) then that you enioying the presence of those, our Countrie should lacke you, such hir orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and beautifying. Therfore for their better remembrance of you, I will do so much at the least as to signifie vnto them your cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisance the faire bright <hi>Starre:</hi> which besides that, hath his hid
<pb facs="5"/>
signification. But to leaue these: and although <hi>Typhis</hi> and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> be bolde: yet I hope (moste Honourable Lorde) I haue not theirs, but <hi>Vatienus</hi> his face. Whose simple Treatise of mine, when I was excited to bestow it of your Lordship, I straight wayes gathered with my selfe that you were not <hi>Licinius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour which was malicious toward the learned: neither yet <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> an vtter enimie to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Science,</hi> and hir daughter <hi>Discipline</hi>: neyther yet <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi>: but rather contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> excelling both in Martiall prowesse, and also serious after the inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good Discipline: or else <hi>Iulianus</hi>: or <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi> Which small gift of mine, if your Lordshippe take in good worth: I shall be encouraged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while to enrich these: and to attempt muche greater and better hereafter, so soone as I shall attain to a little more ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And thus ceasing to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Lordshippe any more I make an end: desiring GOD to blesse you in all his giftes, both
<pb facs="6"/>
ghostly and bodilye: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue you in long life and true Honour, to his glory: the helpe and assistance of others: and your owne, and endlesse comfort. Amen.</p>
