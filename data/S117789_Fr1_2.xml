   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader;</hi> The publishing of this Treatise, submits it to thy judgment. It may be thou wilt judge it of little worth, because thou esteemest 1. the Authors credit to be small, 2. the Art it selfe to be obscure, and 3. of little vse, and 4. the worke to be imperfect, and 5. vnfitly put forth in the English tongue. But this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face shall make it cleare, thou art mistaken in all these particulars.</p>
   <p n="1">1. Though my own credit be small: yet this neede not hinder thy good liking, because my labour is but to collect out of other Authors. So that if the credit of Authors will please thee, I need not feare thy displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, for here thou hast Authors of all ages, and of the best account, yea <hi>Aristotle</hi> himselfe, the Prince of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers (as the learned vse to call
<pb facs="3"/>him) leads thee the way, and guides the whole game.</p>
   <p n="2">2. Some account the art it selfe of <hi>Logicke</hi> to be obscure, and therefore hard to be attained: but though this were true, yet is it worthy of all that honour that is due to any humane art whatsoever, because the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ariseth not from the thing it selfe: (for it agrees to humane reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more but a comprehension of precepts, directing the vse of true reason) but from mans defect, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either vnable for want of natural parts, or vnwilling through idlenes to learne it. But grant this Art were in it selfe obscure, yet is it no lesse honourable for that, because silver, gold, and other pretious mettals are hard to obtaine: yet are they high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteemed of (as daily experience shews) for what labour will not men take, and what hazard will they not vndergoe to get and hold them? Nay
<pb facs="3"/>I adde further, that the difficultie of attaining vnto this Art, makes it more honourable when it is attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; for things hardly gotten are rare, and rare things are pretious, especially when they are of excellent vse: and such is this Art of <hi>Logicke,</hi> as my answer to the next will shew.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Many are of opinion, that <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke</hi> is vnprofitable, &amp; of little vse, as serving to exercise the witts of yong Schollers, and that therefore when they grow vnto yeares, they doe wholly neglect it. This judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is erronious; for whatsoever tends to some good, is truely profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: and this is the case with the precepts of <hi>Logicke,</hi> because hereby (in some sort) is healed the wound we received in our reason by <hi>Adams</hi> fall: and this daily tryall teacheth, because by the precepts of <hi>Logicke,</hi> things hidden and darke, are cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objected to our judgement. Truth
<pb facs="4"/>and falshood is made to stand naked before our knowledge.</p>
   <p>It may be some will conceiue that mans naturall <hi>Logicke</hi> will serue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for the foresaid ends, and that therefore there is no neede of precepts.</p>
   <p>I answer. True it is, many mans naturall parts are ripe and prompt, so as they are speedy and sound in judging. But this is not every mans case, therfore vnto such the precepts of Art are needfull. Yea, I say, that such precepts are needfull to the promptest witts, for man hath not now so ample vse of reason as <hi>Adam</hi> had at his first Creation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he needs the helpe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> artificiall precepts.</p>
   <p>To conclude, since the Art of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke</hi> is no more but a Directour of true Reason: the more logicall a man is, the more is he like a man, and the lesse logicall, the lesse like a man
<pb facs="4"/>who is a reasonable Creature. If this be true (as it is most true) then must it be granted that the precepts of this Art, are profitable for the vse of man in the highest degree.</p>
   <p n="4">4. This worke is not imperfect, because no precept, essentiall vnto <hi>Logicke,</hi> is wanting. I haue indeed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the modality and conversion of propositions and Elenchs: but this breeds no defect in the art, for these three appertaine to the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the precepts of this Art: they are no essentiall precepts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. 1. The modalitie of propositions doth explicate the subject or predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of the proposition wherein it is. 2. The Conversion of a proposition is no more, but the right placing of things not rightly placed in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. And 3. Elenchs are the detections of falshood in the forme of syllogismes.</p>
   <p n="5">5. Our Mother Tongue doth not
<pb facs="5"/>disgrace this Art of <hi>Logicke</hi> to the <hi>English,</hi> no more then <hi>Greeke</hi> did to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> or the <hi>Latine</hi> to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes:</hi> for if it had, then would not <hi>Aristotle</hi> haue written his <hi>Logicke</hi> in Greeke, nor <hi>Tully</hi> his in Latine. We haue the holy Scriptures in our mother tongue, without disgrace thervnto, why then should it be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull to <hi>Logicke?</hi> Besides, some men vnderstād not Latin, &amp; yet haue they neede of <hi>Logicke,</hi> because they need the helps to the vse of reason.</p>
   <p>Thus (I hope) full satisfaction is given to every doubt that might hinder thy profit by this art now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vnto thee: so as nothing more seemes needfull, or worthy thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and mine: therefore here I will end all that I haue to say for this thing.</p>
