   <head>The Argument of Saint Paules
Epistle to the Galathians:</head>
   <p>IT is wel inough knowne in what part of the lesser Asia the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
dwelt, and how farre their Countrey reached, but as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their originall, and the place from whence they came first, the
auncient Authors are not all of one mind. They all agree that they
were Galles, yea and thereof they bare their name: for they were
called Galgreekes, of a word compounded of Gal and Greeke▪ But the
thing that hangeth in doubt, is out of which quarter of Galland they
came. The Geographer Strabo thinketh that those Galles whiche
were called Tectosages, came out of the Countrey of Prouince, and
othersome say they came out of Gall Celtike, which is the commoner
opinion▪ Howbeeit for as much as Plinie maketh the people of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
to be next neighbours to the Tectosages: and all Authors wel-neare
agreee that the Tolistobogians were their companions which
dwelled about the Rhyne: I take it to be most likely that they were
of Gall Belgike which is the lowest Countrey vpon the riuer of Rhyne
towards the English Sea. For the Tolistobogians hilde the Countrey
that is nowe called Cleuelande and Brabant. The common errrour
(in mine opinion) grew vpon this, that a companie of the Tectosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
being cast vpon the Countrey of Prouince, tooke possession of it,
and reteyning still their olde name, conueyed ouer the same to the
Countrey which they had conquered. And that is the thing which
Ausonius the Poet of Burdeaux meeneth when he sayeth, vntoo the
Tectosages, which were first named Belgians. For hee called them
Belgians, and dooth vs to vnderstande that they were earst named
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>tosages in sted of Tectosages. VVheras Caesar placeth them in the
black Forest, which in those dayes was called Hercinia, or Hertswald:
I beleeue it happened by shifting of places, bycause they were retired
thither out of their owne Countrey: which thing may be gathered by
Caesars owne saying, where he maketh mention of them. But we haue
spoken ynough of their originall for this time. Plinie reporteth of the
Galathians which dwelt in that part of Asia, which was called after
their name, that lyke as they were deuided into three principall peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb facs="6"/>
that is too witte, the Tectosages, Tolistobogians, and Tro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannes:
so also they had three head Cities. Now for as much as they
were there among neighbours of small prowesse, and nothing well
trayned too the warres: they spedde their businesse so well in times
past, that the greater part of the lesser Asia became tributarie too
them. But in the ende they grewe out of kinde, and by little and
little lost their courage, giuing themselues ouer to pleasures and
wantonnesse. By meanes whereof <hi>Cneus Manlius</hi> the Romane
Consull vanquished them in battell without any great adoo, and
subdued them too the Empyre, vnder the whiche they were in the
time of Saint Paule. Nowe although he had taught them the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
faithfully: yet crept there in false Apostles in his absence, which
corrupted his good seede by their false and wicked doctrine: for they
taught that the keeping of Ceremonies was still necessarie. It might
haue seemed at the first blushe too haue beene a matter of no greate
importance: but Saint Paule debateth of it heere as of the cheefe
article of the Christen fayth. And good reason, for it is no small
mischeefe, when the light of the Gospell is quenched, when mennes
consciences are clogged, and when all difference is taken away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the olde and newe Testament. Furthermore, he sawe there
was a wicked and mischeeuous opinion interlaced with those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
whiche was, that menne maye deserue or earne rightuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
and that is the cause why hee contendeth with so great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
and force. VVherefore seeing wee bee warned what will
followe vppon the matter that is treated of heere: let vs reade it with
diligence. If a man shoulde iudge the cace by the Commentaries of
Saint Ierome and Origen: hee woulde maruell why Saint Paule was
so whote for any outwarde Ceremonies. But if a man looke too the
welspring, hee shall finde that the things were well worthie too bee
handled so sharpely. And for as much as the Galathians suffered
themselues too bee turned out of the right way through ouergreat
simplicitie or light beleefe, or rather through inconstancie and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
therefore dooth hee rebuke them the more sharpely. For
I am not of their minde which thinke that Saint Paules rough hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of them, was bicause they were naturally dull witted, and hard
<pb facs="6"/>
of vnderstanding. The Ephesians and Collossians had beene temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as well as they. Now if they had lightly giuen place too the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie
of the false Teachers, as the Galathians did, thinke wee that
Sainct Paule woulde haue spared them? Then was it not the peoples
nature that made him so bolde as too be in thatchafe with them, but
rather the vnwoothinesse of the matter compelled hym too doo so▪
Nowe that wee vnderstande the cause why thys Epistle was written,
let vs come too the order and maner of proceeding whiche hee kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
in it.</p>
   <p>In the two first Chapters, hee indeuereth to mainteyne the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of his Apostleshippe, sauing that towardes the ende of the
seconde Chapter, hee entereth by occasion intoo the cheefe poynt,
that is too witte intoo the question of Iustification, howbeeit that
the peculiar place where hee handeleth that matter of sette pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
too the full, is the thirde Chapter. And although that in
those twoo Chapters, hee seeme too treate of many things, yet
his drift is but too proue himselfe equall with the greatest Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and that there is not any default in his owne persone why hee
shoulde not bee taken for an Apostle, and bee as highly esteemed
as the rest. Neuerthelesse it is good too vnderstande too what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
hee laboureth so muche too mainteyne his owne reputation.
For what matter makes it whither hee bee greater or lesser than
Peter, or whither there bee no oddes at all betwixte them: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
that Iesus Christ reigne, and that his doctrine abide pure
and vncorrupted? Seeing that all other must bee diminished too
the ende that onely Iesus Christ may growe: it is in vaine to striue
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> the prerogatiues of men. Furthermore it may also be demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
why hee compareth himselfe with the rest of the Apostles?
For what oddes was there betwixte Petr, Iames, and Iohn?
VVhat needed it then to set one agaynst another after that maner,
where ther was so good vnitie and agreement? I answer, that the false
Apostles which had abused the Galathians, had shrowded themselues
vnder the names of the Apostles, as though they had bin of their
sending, to the intent to be the better welcom, and to worke their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the easlyer. It was a trim way too winde themselues in, and too
<pb facs="7"/>
purchace authoritie, to make them beleeue that they represented
the Apostles, and that the Apostles spake as you woulde say, by
their mouth. And in so doing they defaced the name, power and
authoritie of the Apostle Saint Paule. For they alledged that hee
had not bin chosen by our Lorde for one of the twelue, nor bin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
for such a one by the rest of the Apostles, and that hee
had not receyued his doctrine, not onely not of Iesus Christ himselfe,
but also not of any of his Apostles. By this meanes not onely Sainct
Paules authoritie was diminished, but also he himself esteemed much
inferiour to them, as one that was no better than one of the common
sort. If the matter had touched no more but their persones: it had
bin al one with Saint Paule to haue bin counted among the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
But seeing that the doctrine was by that meanes discredited:
he ought not to hold his peace, but rather to crie out agaynst it. L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
what the wilinesse of Satan is: when he dares not assayle the doctrine
openly, hee laboureth too deface the Maiestie of it by ouerthwart
wayes. Therefore let vs remember that the truth of the Gospell
was assayled in Sainct Paules persone. For if hee had suffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to haue bin bereft of the honour of Apostleship, it had follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
that he had thitherto taken more vpon him than became him:
and so, that false bragging of his shoulde also haue made him to bee
suspected in all other things. Againe, vppon that verie poynt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
the authoritie of his doctrine, for so much as it had not bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
as a thing proceeding frō an Apostle of our Lord Iesus Christ,
but as from some common disciple. On the otherside it had bin darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and defaced by the brightnesse of the names of great persones.
For the false Apostles glorying of the tytles of Peter, Iames, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d
Iohn, tooke Apostolicall authoritie too themselues also. Now<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> if
Saint Paule had not withstoode such boasting earnestly and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>utly:
it had bin a yeelding vnto vntruth, and a suffering of Gods truth
to bee oppressed in his persone. Therefore hee stryueth in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to shewe both the one and the other: that is too witte, that the
Lorde had ordeyned him to be an Apostle, and also that he was not
inferior to any of the others, but had the like dignitie and authoritie
that the rest had, according to the name which he bare as well as they▪
<pb facs="7"/>
He might well haue denied that those Gallants were sent of Peter and
his fellowes, or that they had any charge or commission from them.
But this defence is of farre greater weight, when he sayeth that he him
selfe is of as greate authoritie as the verie Apostles. For if he had
spoken any lowlier, it would haue seemed that he had not bin well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of his cace. Ierusalem was at that time▪ the moother of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
bicause the Gospell flowed from thence intoo all the world, and it
was as the chiefe seate of Christes kingdome. All they that came from
thence too other Churches, were honorably receiued, and good reason.
Howbeeit there were a number which were puffed vp with pride bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had beene familiar with the Apostles, or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
had beene trayned vp in their schoole: and therefore they
could away with nothing which they had not seene at Ierusalem. All
other maner of dealings which had not bin vsed there, they not onely
reiected, but also boldly condemned. Such waywardnesse and pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is a daungerous plague, when wee will needes haue the custome of
any one Churche too bee receiued for an vniuersall Lawe. And that
proceedeth of an vnaduised zele, when wee bee so affectioned to some
maister or place, that without any iudgement we will bind all men to
that one mannes minde, or all places too the ordinances of that onely
on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>place, as to a common rule. Soothly there is alwaies ambition min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled▪
with that maner of dealing, or to speake more rightly, suche ouer
great waywardnesse is alwaies full of vainglorie. But too returne too
these false Apostles, if their foolish fondnesse had led them no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than onely to assay too bring in the vse of the Ceremonies euery
where, which they had seene kept at Ierusalem: they had done ill i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
already: For there was no reason why they should of a custome
make by and by a common rule. But there was yet a further mischief:
namely their wicked and harmefull doctrine, whereby they ment too
bind mennes consciences, and to ground rightuousnesse in the keeping
of Ceremonies. Nowe wee vnderstand why S. Paule speaketh so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
in defence of his Apostleship, and wherefore he setteth himself
against the other Apostles.</p>
   <p>He pursueth that matter till towardes the latter end of the second
chapter, where he openeth a gap to treate of his peculiar matter: that
<pb facs="8"/>
is to wit, that wee be iustified freely before God, and not by the workes
of the Lawe. For the reason wherevpon he groundeth himself, is this:
If the Ceremonies bee not able too iustifie a man, then is not the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of them necessarie. Howbeeit, he treateth not only of Ceremonies,
but of workes in generall: for otherwise it were but a very colde dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
If any man thinke that this is a drawing aloofe from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Let him consider twoo things. First that the question coulde not
otherwise bee resolued than by taking that generall principle, that we
be iustified freely by the only grace of God: which principle excludeth
not onely Ceremonies, but also all other woorkes. And secondly that
S. Paule stoode not so much vpon the Ceremonies themselues, as vpon
the wicked opinion that folowed them: that is too wit, of purchacing
saluation by woorkes. Therefore let vs marke that the holy Apostle
dealeth not impertinētly, in beginning his matter so farre off, but that
it stoode him on hand too touche the welspring of the whole matter, to
the end that the readers might vnderstand, that the thing whiche he
dealeth with heere is no trifle, but of most importance aboue all others:
too wit, by what meane wee obteyne saluation. They then doo mistake
their marke, which imagine that the Apostle standeth vpon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
point of Ceremonies: for that could not be well delt with alone
by it self. VVee haue a like example in the fifth of the Actes. There
fell a contention and debate about Ceremonies, too wit, whither▪ they
were needefull to bee kept or no. For the resoluing of this question, the
Apostles set downe the vntolerablenesse of the yoke of the Lawe, and
the free forgiuing of sinnes. To what purpose doo they that? For it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
too be an impertinent digression, and that they leape out of the
propounded matter without reason. But it is not so: For the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
errour could not be liuely disproued, but by taking a generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
As for example: if it behoued mee too reason in defence of
the eating of flesh: I should not onely make mention of meates, but I
should also arme my self with the generall doctrine, and shew whither
mennes traditions ought to binde mennes consciences: and by and by I
would take this ground. That there is but one Lawegiuer which hath
power too saue and too destroy. To bee short S. Paule conueyeth his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
heere from the generall to the particular negatiuely, which is
<pb facs="8"/>
a very ordinarie maner of reasoning, &amp; most agreeable to nature that
can bee. Furthermore if we go to the bodie of the Epistle, woe shall see
by what textes and reasons he proueth this sentence, that we be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the onely grace of Christ. This matter he handleth too the end
of the third Chapter.</p>
   <p>In the beginning of the fourth, he treateth of the right vse of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
and wherfore they were ordeyned: and there he sheweth also
that they be abolished. For it behoued him too preuent this absurditie
which would haue run by &amp; by in euery mans head, To what purpose
then were the Ceremonies ordeyned? VVere they vtterly needelesse?
did the fathers lose their labour in keeping them? Hee dispatcheth
both the one and the other in fewe woordes, saying that they were not
superfluous in their time, but that they be now abolished by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of our Lord Iesus Christ, bicause he is the very truth and ende
of them. And therefore he sheweth that we must rest vpon him. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in that place he sheweth wherein our state differeth from the state of
the fathers. VVherevpon it followeth that the doctrine of the false
Apostles is lewde and daungerous, bicause it darkeneth the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Gospell with the old for worne shadowes. He intermedleth
certaine exhortations with his doctrine, too moue mennes affections:
and towardes the end of the Chapter he beautifieth his discourse with
a goodly Allegorie.</p>
   <p>In the fifth Chapter he exhorteth them too keepe the freedome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaced
by the bloud of Iesus Christ, too the ende they should not yeeld
their consciences in bondage too mennes traditions: Neuerthelesse he
therewithall admonisheth them also wherein that freedome consisteth,
and which is the true and right vse of it. And too the same ende he
sheweth whiche bee the true exercises of christenfolke, too the intent
they should not lose their time in musing vppon Ceremonies, and in
the meane while leaue the chiefe things vndone.</p>
