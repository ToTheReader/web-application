   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>I</hi> Will not Dedicate these weeping lines</l>
      <l>Vnto a laughing Lord for Patronage,</l>
      <l>That without Mourning habit richlyshines</l>
      <l>In gold, nor will I send a Pilgrimage</l>
      <l>My sorrowes, brought a bed in this same Booke,</l>
      <l>To be protected by a Ladyes Looke.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Nor will I inuocate a Iudge, because</l>
      <l>I write vpon an Honourable fate,</l>
      <l>Vntimely hastned; for within his lawes,</l>
      <l>Deathes immature are all degenerate,</l>
      <l>He that condemneth life, and goods, shall be</l>
      <l>No pittilesse protector (Booke) to thee.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>No Sycophant shall see thee by my will,</l>
      <l>No, nor a golden Coward, for I vow,</l>
      <l>I hate his quaking qualitie as ill,</l>
      <l>As any the worst vice that raigneth now;</l>
      <l>A foole shall neuer thy sad lines behold,</l>
      <l>Because Brasse is as good to him as Gold.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But I will send thee like a Marshall Booke,</l>
      <l>Vnto all Souldiers, lac'd with noble skarres,</l>
      <l>That thinkes on <hi>BVRGH</hi> with a deiected looke,</l>
      <l>And that hath knowne him well in all his Warres,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="5"/>That can repeate all things that he hath done;</l>
      <l>Since the first minute that his sand did runne.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And that perhaps the glory of his worth,</l>
      <l>His noble Birth, his seuerall Commands,</l>
      <l>Will in a larger volumne blason foorth,</l>
      <l>Then this that passeth through my feeble hands,</l>
      <l>For to set foorth his rise, and not his fall,</l>
      <l>Kirneld with life, and not with Funerall.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>I could my selfe Heroicke stories make,</l>
      <l>Of all the passages, of all his facts,</l>
      <l>But that a mightie volume it would take,</l>
      <l>And I should be so pleased with his Actes,</l>
      <l>I should not halfe be sad enough, to write</l>
      <l>His last fare well, my Heart would be too light.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And therefore I will vnto other braines,</l>
      <l>Leaue the whole progresse of his former dayes;</l>
      <l>Ile onely like an Eccho take the paines</l>
      <l>To sing his end, and crowne his end with Bayes,</l>
      <l>Which if I Miser-like too sparing doe,</l>
      <l>Let euery Soule ioyne in my sorrow too.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And then shall <hi>Robert Markham</hi> be,</l>
      <l>Most happie in his Ellegie.</l>
