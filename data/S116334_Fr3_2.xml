   <p>They will make a publike brag of their Papall succession, and yet know that it is vndefined who succeeded <hi>Peter.</hi> Some of them saying <hi>Linus,</hi> some <hi>Clemens,</hi> and some they know not what.

Who by an ordinance of their Apostaticall Church must needes be Bastards: and so in their vnderstanding of <hi>Deu.</hi> 23.2. they must haue beene vncapable of all Ecclesiasticall function, specially of Popeship. Though <hi>Parentall vices must not be imputed to

Children</hi> (for thereby they would euade, abusing <hi>Augustine</hi> therein) yet Children in ciuill policie haue beene by lawe diuine and humane disinherited, and made vncapable of many exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall priuiledges, by reason of Parents vices. And by this rule it is, that our late malcontented <hi>Seculars</hi> (assuming <hi>Ro. Parsons</hi> the Iesuite to be a Bastard) do vrge his incapabilitie of Church-function. If such (in the censure of their owne lawes) haue beene the Succeeders (a Dozen whereof <note n="*" place="margin">

   <p>They will tell the simple, how all translations of the Bible (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting their Latine-one) are false and intollerable.

   <p>If <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and such say, that this hath come to passe through drowsinesse or ignorance of their Monks, who first writte them (<hi>nam Monacho, quis indoctior?</hi>) how comes it to passe, that they haue printed them estsoones without correction?

   <p>With these Equiuocatours I sometimes in the succeeding Treatise (so well as in the former) doe conflict: maintaining the ancient doctrine of Faith against their Romish innouations. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this (I doubt not) some of that Faction will kicke, in my

natiue country: which somewhat more then a yeare since coulde like of a violent hand in secret, for bastonadoing the Authour. For a Religion it is, that cannot be defended so well with words as swords: nor so easly by open plaine dealing, as by secret treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries and publike Equiuocations.
