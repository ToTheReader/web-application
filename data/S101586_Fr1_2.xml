Edvvarde Dyer, increase of estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, though neither my
experiēce, nor skil, may
yeelde me any hope to
coūteruaile your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse,
by any worke,
or labor of mine, considering in youre
self, your owne arte and abilitie of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
yet partely my affection, partely
yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> curtesie, and partly the loue you
beare vnto knowledge, haue together
by degrees preuailed to persuade me, to
cōmend vnto you the willyng proffer,
of this my small &amp; simple present. The
rather, for that indifferently debating
with my self of the matter, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
myne opinion with the nature of
the time, wherin eche thing doth couet
<pb facs="3"/>
to growe to perfection: I finde the same
so plētifully stored, with such vertuous
precepts and well tempered rules, both
of publike and priuate behauiour, that
of it selfe it may liberally deserue, to be
imbraced of all men: but especiallye of
those, that delighting in the study and
knowledge of good letters, are desirous
in the ende, to reape the due fruite and
benefite of their labour: And wherein,
you chiefly aboue the rest, may plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
also as in a glasse beholde, a pleasaunt
remembraunce of your contempl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>iue
delights: togither, with those things set
down for precepts vnto others, that are
but matters, of daily practise with your
selfe. All which, though for the priuate
vse of your own vnderstanding, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
right well, howe generally you are
seene and acquainted in the languages,
I might with lesse labor haue deliuered
<pb facs="3"/>
to your hands, vnder those very words
that the Author himselfe hath set down
the same: yet therewithall considering
the nature of <hi>Vertue,</hi> which hath alwais
bene accompted to cary this propertie,
that is, to couet to haue eche thing to be
like vnto it selfe: I thought it therefore
more agreable to your liking, to see the
matter sette plainely down, vnder such
oure ordinary and vsuall phrase, as the
vulgar sort that haue affectiō to learne,
might thereby also gather some profit.
VVho, if indifferentlye as they haue
cause, they ponder the aduātage of that
whiche is profered, may well perceiue,
that what by example of your selfe and
such like, &amp; what by the precepts here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contayned, they maye the rather
learne, howe firste to auoide, the vsuall
haunte of suche ydle company, as brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
in the ende, no profite but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce:
<pb facs="4"/>
and after, how and in what sort
to imploy their time at home, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of such knowledge, as bringeth
with it a contented world both of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and delight: and such also as ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the minde, with the true dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and habite of <hi>Vertue,</hi> whiche as the
<hi>Philosophers</hi> affirme, is double, the one
<hi>Intellectuall,</hi> the other <hi>Morall,</hi> wherof
the firste is to be gotten by <hi>reading,</hi> the
latter by <hi>practise,</hi> and they both, leading
the way to that eternall felicitie, which
of al mē is so generally desired. Finally,
if by this occasion it maye so come to
pas, that <hi>Knowlege</hi> the mother of <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
may the rather be imbraced, and
that <hi>Idlenes</hi> the nurse of <hi>Mischief,</hi> may
be aught the more auoided: the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therof as it belongeth to your self,
in respect of whom regarding your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serte,
I was onely moued to vndertake
<pb facs="4"/>
this attempte: so, if otherwise I maye
seeme by this meanes to deserue, in the
iudgement of those that are curiouslie
disposed, either blame or misliking: I
likewise craue your friendly assistance,
by the helpe of your protectiō, to coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
my procedings. In lieu wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I am able to yeelde you no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
than that whiche was due
vnto you before, that is, the vnfayned
affection of him, that wholy remaineth
at your deuotion.</p>
