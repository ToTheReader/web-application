   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubt not but your
Honoures knowe,
that when the most
ancient treuth of the
ancient of dayes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
in his holie
word, and left vnto
vs to be the onlie rule of our fayth,
doeth fayle our Adversaries of the
<pb n="6" facs="3"/>
      <hi>Romish</hi> Church, that then their next
refuge is, after that they haue loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
sacred Scripture with odious
imputations of obscuritie, imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and sweying everie way, in
their severall conflictes, to fill the
eares of each one with their clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
vp-brayding of Antiquitie,
and humane authoritie, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
hath forsaken them; like <hi>Saul,</hi>
who when God would not aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
him, had his recourse to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</hi>
Which notwithstanding how
little it maketh for them, &amp; how as
smallie it avayleth them, as <hi>Balaam</hi>
did <hi>Balak,</hi> when hee sent for him to
curse, where in the contrarie hee
blessed: or as <hi>Baal</hi> ayded his owne
priests, when hee was so earnestlie
in-called vpon by them to answere,
while in the meane time there was
no voyce heard; any one, who with
a single eye ever perused the same,
may easilie perceiue, and manifolde
experience hath oftentimes proven.</p>
   <p>And yet we see that this is their
great <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> wherein they
<pb n="7" facs="3"/>
glorie more than the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when
they cryed, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the
Temple of the Lord:</hi> and as <hi>Rahel</hi> hid
her fathers Idoles, with the Camels
furniture, and sate on the same, and
would not aryse; So with the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of venerable, but wrested and
wronged Antiquitie, they would
hyde their Errours, and cover the
Idolatrie of their whorish mother,
from whom they can not bee moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to depart, nor goe out of <hi>Babel,</hi>
or put away their strange gods, and
bee purged with <hi>Iaakobs</hi> godlie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie.</p>
   <p>So that their doing is like the
craftie dealing of the <hi>Gibeonite</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadoures,<note place="margin">Ioshua, 9.</note>
who to make a League
with the Lordes People, pretended
that they had journeyed from a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
farre countrey, and were come
for the Name of the Lord: and this
their impudent lie (which yet they
would haue to bee believed as an
vndoubted trueth) they soothe vp
(forsooth) by demonstration of
Antiquitie; that therefore all which
<pb n="8" facs="4"/>
they had was olde: and this was
their onlie proofe, whereby <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
and both Princes and People were
deceived: the reason whereof is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in Scripture, Because they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
not counsell at the mouth of
the Lord.</p>
   <p>Even so, that which our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
bring, when they haue quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Scripture, to make their blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
lies to bee believed, as
sure &amp; sacred trueth, is that which
(as they pretende) is from a verie
farre, even the Apostles tymes, and
ancient holie Fathers of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church, glorious in sufferings,
and from their immediate succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours:
And all this they doe (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth)
but for the Name of the
Lord, having a religious pretence
(as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> did) of clearing
trueth, &amp; convincing errour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and so to make vnitie of fayth
in the Church of God.</p>
   <p>And to performe all this, all
which they would seeme to showe
or say, is all olde, drawne from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie:
<pb n="9" facs="4"/>
But beeing aware (by <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua's</hi>
example) will wee trye the
men, and their speaches, their furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and pretences, and all this by
the right rule, with the men of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi>
and as <hi>Israel</hi> should haue done
the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> asking counsell at the
mouth of the Lord, which hee hath
opened in holie Scripture, and
which wee are bidden search, not
believing rashlie everie doctrine, to
bee carried about there-with, but
trying the spirits, whether they bee
of God, or no: and then wee shall
easilie discerne and discover their
guyle, and knowe the Beast by his
Dragon mouth, to bee but a craftie
counterfet of the Lambe.</p>
   <p>And tho for a seducing ende
(as was that of the olde Prophets
of <hi>Bethel,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. King. 13.</note> pretending the word of
the Lord) that these ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are adduced by them to proue,
yet they are found rather to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
their erroures: and beeing
violentlie drawne contrarie to their
minde, to pleade for lies, they either
<pb n="10" facs="5"/>
stand (as Christ before <hi>Pilate)</hi> not
vttering a word, or (as <hi>Daniel</hi> for
<hi>Susanna)</hi> opening their mouthes to
withstand conspyring falshood, and
defende injured innocencie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
bragging <hi>Goliah</hi> so, hath often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
his head cut off with his own
sword; and what they most repose
in, is found truelie to depose against
them.</p>

   <p>So that as the chiefe Priests, and
Elders, and all the Councell, sought
false witnesses against Christ, and
tho manie came; yet found they
none, till at last two came: Even so,
altho the Pope, and all his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
seeke busilie false witnesses
against Christes blessed Trueth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
in Scripture, yet amongst
these reverend Fathers, and ancient

they shall finde none conspyring so

<pb n="16" facs="8"/>
remarker shall finde it so no wise,
till some came in in later tymes for
the behoose of that <hi>Romish</hi> high
Priest, and few Pople in great store
in the Lords field, and thorow faire
pretences, and secret subdolous
meanes which they vsed, and the
not so warie vigilancie of the Lords
owne Servants, altho they were not
so clearelie perceived, nor heedful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
resisted in the beginnings, yet
when that wicked seede beganne to
kythe more plainlie by anie growth
and discoverie of it selfe, it was
remarked by sundrie vvho vvere
awake, and from tyme to tyme op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by some, tho few, who were
as <hi>Elias</hi> in <hi>Achabs</hi> time, or the two

as they rose and spake, or els killed

   <p>A particular prooffe of the
trueth heereof your Honours may

Antiquitie, concerning that maine

Bishop <hi>Hooper,</hi> at his going to

this worthie BERTRAM, whom in

   <p>Weighing these together, (I
say) and viewing with what rare
light, as a cleare Torch-bearer, this
man so long since hath gone before,
howsoever others worthilie of late
haue followed after, I was moved
to bestow some paines in exposing
it (especiallie in these dangerous
dayes) to the common view of all:
whereby if our spirituall <hi>Nasci &amp;
Pasci,</hi> the new birth, and new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paste,
be compared, and the trueth,
or realitie of both, according to the
effectuall force and vertue which a

<pb n="19" facs="9"/>
(which maketh the verie renewed
<hi>Gentile</hi> to be a true <hi>Iew</hi> indeed) so far
as ignorant <hi>Nicodemus</hi> swarved by
his literall and carnall meaning,<note place="margin">Rom. 2, 29.</note> from the true vnderstanding of
Christs words, when Hee spake of
the one; as farre with the carnall
<hi>Capernaite</hi> shall our Adversaries bee
groslie found to erre, by their like
literall and carnall meaning, from
the true vnderstanding of Christs
words, when he spake of the other.
And that to them as clearelie Hee
showeth the way to vnderstand
aright the true manducation of His
Bodie, while as Hee sayeth, <hi>The
wordes that I speake, are spirite and
lyfe,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iohn, 6, 63.</note> as Hee pointeth at the true
meaning of His wordes, that a man
must be borne of new againe, while

      <hi>and the spirite, he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
