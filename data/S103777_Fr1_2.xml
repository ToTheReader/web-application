   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Isacmos,</hi> I haue spent 3. daies in idle houres, to examin the months of your meditations on a lothsom <hi>Aiax,</hi> and I finde them so vnsauerie, as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for you to be a sauer by thē: your pen hath dropt excrements, and you cannot wipe them cleane with your witte. Alas, that so long filed, should so filthily be defiled: you haue spent labour without reason, and are seene for a spectacle of follie, to those that cannot see without their specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
<pb facs="3"/>
Because the world laughes, you thinke it applaudes: but the most part that outwardly smile, doe inwardly pitie. A good wit, and a grosse sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, so much I allow you: but if your ambition must needs clime, it is more comely in a courteors habite, then in a fooles antique. That I see your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, I make your selfe iudge: that I pitie your errours, my sparing reproofe may assure you. That I am ambitious as your selfe, I protest it, with discretion: yet it greeues mee that two good wittes should wrestle for a dunghill. Come come wittie <hi>Misacmos,</hi> ouerlooke howe I haue lookt ouer you. If this Aprill shower clense you, I will forbeare the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest. For as I am a Germane in nature (who hate detractions) so can I be both a <hi>Molossian</hi> &amp; <hi>Melitean</hi> dog, as occasions are offered me. Would <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacmos</hi> be famous? why I yeeld him
<pb facs="3"/>
the meanes: he is a courtier in regard, I a courtier in hope: he riche in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent demeasne, I in good demesne: he sprightly and wittie; I diligent &amp; pleasant: a ladie blest his children, and God and our Lady my Lady mothers sonnes: he a <hi>Lincolnes Inne</hi> man, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Lincolne.</hi> If any oddes be, he hath the interest of mony, I of Rea ding. Nowe sir: if from the meanes of a priuie, he will become a publicke gentleman, after this assault, let him burie his <hi>Aiax</hi> in a dunghill. Then perusing his bookes, walking in his sute of <hi>Abrizetta,</hi> eating fat Capons, &amp; Venison, and drinking pure hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cras, let him make election of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and chuse out a probable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, haue with him from a fart, to all artes, I refuse no encounter: let vs iest like gentlemen, argue like schollers, be pleasāt without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>ailing, that good wittes may gather treasures from our

trauels, &amp; our selues eternitie by well deseruing: If you rise by my fall, I thinke my fall happie to make you rise: and if it be your destinie to sincke in the incountry, though the desert be wholy mine, I giue you the half of the glorie. If <hi>Aiax</hi> were the froath of your wit, let it die, as to weak for my forces, and if one Cullis of conceite be left, yet play not the gormand, let the world haue parte with you. Take the choice of the weapon, I offer eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aduantage: if you wil striue in wit, I am merrie without detraction: but if you play the scolde in steede of a scholler, I protest it will greeue me: for I know the Eccho of my wrongs will make double report in your eares: for renuing my disgrace, you may liue in your dishonors. Come, let's walke through Vertues temple, and so sacrifice to Honour: and if <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> obserued that custom, let Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

vse it. Otherwise, both of vs may say as the duke of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land did to the lord Gray, as they rid through Shordich; The people presse to see vs, but none say, God speede vs, <hi>Pauca sapienti,</hi> I leaue you to your sops and muscadine. Protesting that if any offence come, it shall be by your seeking.</p>
