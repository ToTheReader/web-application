   <head>To the right honourable, and his singuler good Lady, the Lady <hi>Mary Chandois,</hi> R. A. wisheth health and euerlasting happinesse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y honourable and very good Lady, considering my dutie to your kind Ladiship, &amp; remembring the vertues of your prepared minde, I could doe no lesse but dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this strange worke to your view, being both mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of moment and truth. And to the whole world it may seeme strange, that a Gentlewoman so vvell brought vp in Gods feare, so well married, so ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous euer, so suddainly wrought to this act of murder; that when your Ladiship doth read aswell the Letter as the Booke, of her owne indighting, you will the more wonder that her vertues coulde so aptly tast the follies of vice and villanie. But so it was, and for the better proofe that it was so, I haue placed my kinsmans name to it, who was present at all her troubles, at her comming to prison, her bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prison, and her going out of prison to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That those Gentlemen to whom he dedicates his worke witnessed, may also be pertakers in that kind, for the proofe thereof, that your Ladiship &amp;
<pb n="2" facs="16"/>
the world so satisfied, may admire the deede, and hold it as strange as it is true.</p>
   <p>We haue many giddie pated Poets, that coulde haue published this Report with more eloquence, but truth in plaine attire is the easier knowne: let fixion maske in Kendall greene. It is my qualitie, to adde to the truth, truth, and not leasings to lyes. Your good Honor knowes <hi>Pincks</hi> poore hart, who in all my seruices to your Late deceased kind Lord, neuer sauoured of flatterie, or fixion: and therefore am now the bolder to present to your vertues, the view of this late truth, desiring you to so thinke of it, that you may be an honourable mourner at these obsequies, and you shall no more doe, then manie more haue doone. So with my tendered dutie, my true ensuing storie, and my euer wishing well, I do humbly commit your Ladiship to the prison of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, wherein is perfect freedome.</p>

      <signed>Your Ladiships euer in duty and seruice,
