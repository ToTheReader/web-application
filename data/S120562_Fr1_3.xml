Euery day, euery houre, euery moment, and in euery place, the Deuill fighting agaynst vs: the worlde with his delyghtes, and the flesh with his pleasures in so hot an assault, as doth admit no peace, nor suffer any truce,

I thought good to present you with this <hi>Anatomie of Death,</hi> that in the middest of your delightes, you may take a view of him, who will in the ende, cut off all your delights. Accept it as I import it, the Pawne of my good desire to pleasure you, and Bill for your assurance, to receaue greater things at my hand, when opportunitie shall serue: in the meane time, as you tender the health of your body, so likewyse care for the health of your soule: remembring, that Death to the wicked, is the high way to Hell: but Death to Gods chyldren, is the path-way to Heauen.</p>
