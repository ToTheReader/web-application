      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE best learned, and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest Phylosophers, hauing recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no taste or light of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Christ, but only being led and directed by Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, helde this for a Principle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues, that MAN was not borne to himselfe onely, but was framed of Nature such an excellent Creature as he is, to that ende, that he myght employ those sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular gifts wherewith he is beautifyed, as Wisedome, Reason, Memorie, Discretion, and Iudgement, not onely to his owne priuate commoditie, but also to the profite of his Countrie, and others. This good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ingraffed in their myndes by Nature, deliuered from one to another by Instruction, and so from time to time continued among themselues by consent: caused the best able men among them, such as God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had plentifully endued with knowledge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, to leaue such worthy Monuments as they did to Posteritie: as Plato, and Tullie, good Rules of lyfe and gouernement. Aristotle, the hidden secretes of Philosophye: Ptolomie, the hie my steries of Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: Euclyde, the infallible Principles of Geometrie. Varro, the necessarie obseruations of Husbandrye. &amp;c. Out of the whiche, so great commodities in all ages haue bene reaped, and (as occasion and good wittes haue serued) haue also from time to time bene encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. If this Principle of theirs be sounde and true (as in deede I take it to be) then of consequence, one other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon the same, must needes bee as true, and <pb facs="6"/> that is this: That those men doe nearest approch to the Rule of vncorrupt Nature, and do best deserue of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welth, whose labours and traueyles are bestowed on those thinges which tende to the best ende. For by the consideration of the ende wherevnto eche thing lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: the goodnesse and excellencye of the thing it selfe is to be knowne and esteemed. As for example: If helth eyther maintayned, or recouered bee good: then Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, whose chiefe ende is to maintayne and recouer health, must needes be good also. If good gouernement publikelye, and peaceable enioying of our owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, be a good thing, and to be commended: then the Law, for that it respecteth Iustice in all actions, and quietnesse, as his chiefe ende, must needes likewyse be good, and deserue the like commendation. And as be many things, which for this selfe same Reason that I haue nowe alleaged, are to bee accounted good, and prayse worthy in their kynde: So, I thinke there is no man so farre from Reason, but that hee seeth, by the selfe same Argument it must needes bee inforced, that though many Artes and sciences be good, for that their endes be good: yet some one there is, that is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as best, for that his ende is best. The chiefe ende of Man in this worlde, what it is, I thynke no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man so slenderlye instructed, that hee maketh anye doubt therof. For the very Philosophers themselues, of whome I spake before, were fully resolued, that it was to liue well and vertuously, and affirmed, that (wheras other Creatures are made grooueling, and still behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the grounde as they go) Man was therfore framed streyght and vpright, that hee might alwayes beholde Heauen and heauenly things, and so by the very shape <pb facs="6"/> of his bodye and countenance, be put in mynde conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, that albeit hee were here for a season, as a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Pylgrime vpon earth, yet his end was, to be a free Citizen, and an inheritor of heauen aboue: And as they by Reason and Coniecture were ledde so to thinke: so we by fayth, and expresse commaundement, are moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, so stedfastly to beleeue. If then the knowledge of God and heauenly things, be the chiefest end and mark whereat man ought to shoote, it must nedes be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that those mens studyes and labours deserue the greatest prayse, which are employed to the attayning and directing of others therevnto. Wherein, as God in all ages hath alwayes stirred vp some, who haue taken great paynes therein, to the publike commoditie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: So, in my simple iudgement, neyther this present worke, neyther the Author thereof deserueth the least commendation. And albeit I wote full vvell, that so the worke it selfe be good, it is not greatly materiall what the workeman be: yet, like as good Wyne is then best, vvhen it is drunke out of a cleane vessell, and good meat then best delighteth, when the dresser therof is cleanly: So this Booke, which of it selfe, I doubt not, to be such, that it will be liked of all those who delight in God and godlynesse, I trust, euen for the Authors sake, it shall neuer awhit the woorse be welcome. Of vvhose syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere lyfe, and great prayses, although there is good cause why I shoulde speake, for that hee hath bene of long time throughly knowne to me, and I am assured his vertues and integritie to bee such, that if I shoulde saye, there are fevve his like to bee founde, I trust, for saying the truth, no good man woulde be offended: Yet partly for that I am not ignorant, that no man deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <pb facs="7"/> lesse to heare his owne praise than he doth: partly for that there be many causes why I should rather ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, than for lacke of sufficient skill and abilitie, meanelye prayse him: I will leaue him to thy particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar iudgement (gentle Reader) and to the testimoniall of the vvhole vvorld, vvho I doubt not, vvill say no lesse, but that he is a man vvithout fraude or guile, and such one as feareth God.</p>
   <p>As touching the Booke it selfe, good reason it is, ech man shoulde vse his ovvne iudgement and opinion. But if my simple Testimoniall maye preuayle, I dare vvarrant it to bee such, that vvhat studie soeuer thou shalt bestovve in reading the same, it shall vvell requite thy paynes. And though the Author be such, that he rather delighteth in good and vertuous lyfe, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth boste of anye great learning: Yet such hath his paynes bene herein, that very good Clarkes neede take no scorne, to receiue some light from this his Candell. In summe: the Booke is of God, and his holy Saintes, and therefore to be reuerenced: collected out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore no vaine fable: written briefely, and therefore not tedious: set forth in playne and simple vvyse, and therefore the better for thy capacitie▪ truely reporting the lyfe and death of such, as eyther for sinne, (and those to be auoyded) eyther for vertue, (and those to bee imitated) haue mention made in Gods holye Booke. All that is vvritten therein, is vvritten for thy helpe and instruction. Vse it then to that ende that the Authour meaneth, that is: Not onely to increase thy knovvledge, and so to be made more learned: but also to increase thy vertuous life, and so to become the better Man.</p>
