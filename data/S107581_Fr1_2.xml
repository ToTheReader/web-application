   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIAN discreet Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by example of this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postata, thou maist perceiue how easy a thing it is for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, of the meanest ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, to build many wind-mills and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in the ayre alone with himselfe: and how impossible to discouer but one of thē to the iudgment of others, without incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences. For things not found in truth, fall of themselues and often oppresse the builders: but howsoeuer, they cannot stand, if they be duely oppugned.</p>
   <p>I had compassion of this poore mans simplicity, reading the Booke which he published for excuse of his flight, fraught with so many disaduantages against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, which we should not haue knowne, if he had byn so wise as to haue kept his owne counsaile. They are so many, as they
<pb facs="3"/>would require a greater volume to handle them all at large: but some of the chiefest thou shalt find examined in this Treatise.</p>
   <p>And because we may expect the like workmanship from the same workman in the other ten Bookes which he promiseth, if he be not holpen by others, better mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Art then himselfe: to ease the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of further censure hereafter, if he be so bold as to publish them; I haue thought good to preoccupate the answere of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he hath allready written, or his friends may say for him hereafter, vnder his name, vpon the same subiect: And to giue thee at once, aforehand, sufficiēt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Catholike truth, wherewith, by thy selfe, thou maist easily confute his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, &amp; without further help ouerthrow the phantasticall Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> which he hath imagined. For the Leuell layed to a crooked worke (without any more) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth what is out of order, as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher teacheth, <hi>Quod rectum est index sui &amp; curui.</hi> And with this forewarning, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thee to our Sauiour. This 10. of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember 1617.</p>
