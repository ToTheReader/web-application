Amongst Philosophers none more vehement then <note place="margin">Porphirius &amp; Iulian. ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidi in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum canes. Hieron.</note> Porphyry the Apostata, who writ fifteen books against Christian religion, and for
<pb facs="23"/> his singuler hatred therof was syrnamed <hi>tou Christianon polemios</hi> the Christians aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. And in these our miserable daies none haue bene so spiteful, so malicious, so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement against Catholiques ether in perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, speaking, or writing, as they who haue bene once Catholiques. And in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land now none sheweth him selfe, so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or so vehement against Catholiques as the Apostata Bel, daring, challenging and adiuring al Papists iointly, and seuerally to the combat with him, being desirous as it seemeth of the tytle of <hi>ton catholicon pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mios.</hi> The Catholiques aduersary.</p>
   <p>These Apostataes be like to him, who <note place="margin">

         <hi>See S. Ireney lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> worse then the former, and his end made worse then his beginning. For such is the estate of this miserable caitiue Bel, who being once deliuered from the diuel of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy, clensed with the beesom of confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and Penance, and trimmed with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient sufferance for the Catholique faith, falling afterward to idlenes, and dissolute life, wherof him self since hath boasted, is possessed again of his old diuel of Heresy accompained with seuen other wicked sprits of blasphemy, railing, pride, slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
<pb facs="24"/> lying, dissembling, and abusing of Gods and holy Fathers words, and his end becomme far worse then his beginning was. His spirit of blasphemy he descryeth in many places as p. 149. where he saith that <hi>God hath giuen vs those commandements which we can not possibly keep.</hi> This the holy Father S. Hierom both calleth, and accutseth as <note place="margin">S. Hieron. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masc. de ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posi. ione fidei.</note> blasphemy in these words. <hi>VVe curse their blasphemy who say that God hath commanded to man any impossible thing.</hi> And no maruel. For what reason can ther be in God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note place="margin">Quod ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem non habet dici non debuit. S. Eugenius apud Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem de per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secut. van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal. l. 2.</note> a thing which he knoweth can not be done? what fault in vs not to do that which can not be done? what iustice in him to punish, and that with eternal death, the not performance of that which can not be performed? If neuer there was man so void of reason as would commād a thing, which he knew could not be done, neuer Tyrant so cruel as wold punish with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death the vnperformance of impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matters, shal we think it no blasphemy to God, to attribute that to him which we can not imagin that any man who hath any spark of reason, or humanity wold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? Hauing thus blasphemed against God no meruail if he blaspheme against his Church of late daies saying. p. 134. that she is no sufficient witnes of his truth, &amp; p. 41.
<pb facs="24"/> against our iustification calling it <hi>supposed holy</hi> wherby he giueth vs to vnderstand that as he is fallen from God and his Church, and lost holy iustification, so he is an enemy to them al.</p>
   <p>His railing spirit he could so il maister, as in the very first period of his epistle to the <note place="margin">Epistle to the King.</note> King, without respect of his Maiestie he must needs cal vs <hi>the cursed brood of traiterous Iesuits,</hi> and streight after speaking <hi>ex abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantia cordis,</hi> and reuiling especially against the Iesuits, who haue bene his maisters, he auoucheth them to be <hi>traiterous, seditious, brutish, barbarous, cruel, villanous, most bloody, treacherous, prowd, cruel, tyrants, firebrands of al sedition, theeues, murderers, right Macheuels, coosiners, malicious, and dependers vpon the diuel.</hi> And of this Rhetorik I expect good store for my part, but the more the merrier, such reprochful terms in this quarrel shal be to me <hi>super millia auri, &amp; argenti.</hi> His pride is more notorious then I need shew it. For if it were pride in Golias though a Gyant to challenge any of Gods hoste, what is it in this puny, not only to challenge, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure al Papists seuerally and iointly, being him selfe not worthy to cary the books after many of them, as shal appeare by his manifold ignorance, not only in deuinity, <note place="margin">See the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex.</note> but also euen in Latin, principl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s of Logik,
<pb facs="25"/> Histories, and Preaching, as shal be made manifest in this answer.</p>
   <p>His slaūders reach euen from the highest <note place="margin">
         <hi>pag:</hi> 17.</note> to the lowest, Kings and Emperours he slaundereth with no les matter then ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the window to al Antichristian ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. <note place="margin">Bels ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</note> Popes (who long tyme manteined him at school) with challēging powre equal <note place="margin">
         <hi>p.</hi> 16. 40. 106.</note> to God, with dispensing with one to marry his ful sister, with burning the Scripture, and the like. And Papists he slaundereth <note place="margin">
         <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note> with killing Christ a thousand tymes a day, with affirming that the Pope can depose Kings and Emperors, and translate their <note place="margin">
         <hi>p.</hi> 1.</note> Linpires and regalities at his good wil and pleasure, with attributing to the Pope powre equal to God, thinking the breach <note place="margin">
         <hi>p.</hi> 16. <hi>p.</hi> 130.</note> of Lent to be a greater sin then adultery periury, or murder. His other three spirits, of lying, dissembling, and abusing Gods word euery where shew them selues in his books, and now and then are noted in my answer.</p>
   <p>No maruel therfore if one possessed of so many, and so wicked spirits be so forward, so spiteful, so malicious, against Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, as to callenge, &amp; adiure them al ioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly or seuerally to the combat with him. Oh that I would please his Maiestie to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this combat, that Bel, &amp; I (the weakest
<pb facs="25"/> of many thousands of Gods soldiers) might try the truth, not by writing, which blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth not (as Tully said) but face to face as the Bishop of Eureux, and Plessy did before the French King. I doubt not but if there were any blood in Bels body, or any shame of men in his minde, I shold make it appeare in his face. But whiles this combat must be fought a far of, only by paper shot, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and our writings kept from the view of the people, no meruail if Bel feare no shame of men, whiles they may see him fight, &amp; florish, but must not behold ether defence or blowes of his aduersary.</p>
   <p>If he be so confidēt in his Heresy (which he once vomited forth, and now like the dog hath lickt vp again) as he maketh shew of, why hath he not in al this tyme of his Apostasy procured lycence for publike dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation? or at lest, why neuer repaired he to the Catholique Priests in prison? Let him procure but one such safe conducte for Priests as the councel of Trent graunted <note place="margin">Sess. 13. 15. 18.</note> three or fowre to Protestants (when none of our English Ministers durst accept it) &amp; he shal not need to challenge, or adiure, but shal be dared at his owne dore. For Priests who willingly spend their blood in testimony of the truth which they teach, wil far sooner spend their breath in defence
<pb facs="26"/> therof, &amp; are ready (to make the like offer <note place="margin">Epistle to the King.</note> as Bel doth in a different matter) to iustify it before indifferent iudges against him, or what Protestant soeuer vpon peril of their liues, if their aduersaries wil aduenture the like peril. And vpon this condition Bel I challenge thee, and adiure thee, accept it if thou darest. What more could haue bene done to bring this so weighty a matter, wherupon dependeth the eternal saluation of so many millions of soules to tryal face to face, then hath bene done of Catholiques by speaking, by writing, by petition, by supplication? Puritans vpon one only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication haue bene admitted to Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Catholiques can vpon none. And this is that which maketh Bel so bold to challeng vs to the open combat, when he knoweth we can not appeare in open shew, but vpon hazard of our liues. And I wold to God that with danger, yea with losse of life we might be lycēced publikly to try this truth so important to the eternal life of our dearest countrimen. But seeing there is no hope of this, when I red Bels challenge it seemed to me not only an vnlearned thing, patcht vp of obiections gathered out of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin, and learnedly answered by him, but a witles challenge of some coward, who seeing his enemy commanded vpon pain of
<pb facs="26"/> death to keep his house, callengeth him to the open field, and more like to condemne the Author of folly, and vanity; then the Catholique religion of falsity before any discreet, &amp; iudicious Reader. Neuertheles because (as I vnderstood some monthes after the publishing of it) some vnaduised Protestants hearing Bels glorious vaunts and challeng, had conceaued great hope of this their Champion, &amp; thought his booke vnāswerable, I took it in hand not knowing as then that any other wold vouchsafe to <note place="margin">Author of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Bels dovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefal.</note> medle with it, &amp; haue left to my knowledg no one point therin vnanswered, attending more to solue what he obiecteth, then to cōfirme what Catholikes mantein, though this also I haue done sufficiently (as I hope) for my intended breuity.</p>
   <p>He termeth this challeng a downfal of <note place="margin">VVhat Bel impugneth.</note> Popery and yet in the greatest part therof impugneth no point of Popery, but ether perticuler opinions of priuat men, or (which is worse) false imputations of his owne, being so desirous of quarrelling, as he figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with his owne shadow. And what he impugneth he doth with so good successe, as almost in euery Article he ouer throweth <note place="margin">VVith vvhat suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>e.</note> what he meant to establish, and confirme. So that if he had giuen his booke the right name he shold haue called it the downfal of
<pb facs="27"/> Bels foolery. Of these eight Articles which he hath pickt out as most aduantagious for him self, &amp; in which there are some things, which as S. Austin speaketh l. de vtil. cred. c. 1. to. 6. <hi>may be impugned to the common peoples</hi>
      <note place="margin">S. Austin.</note>
      <hi>capacity, but not be defended by reason of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty but of few.</hi> In the first he impugneth the Popes superiority ouer al Princes on <note place="margin">
         <hi>pag:</hi> 1.</note> earth, and his powre to depose them at his good wil, and pleasure. wherof the first is but the opinion of some few Canonists cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reiected of al Catholiks, and dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at large by Bellarmin, whose doctrine Bel accounteth the Popes owne doctrin, &amp; saith it is approued by him. The second no Catholik holdeth, but it is Bels faulse slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Catholiks. In the second omitting <note place="margin">
         <hi>p:</hi> 19.</note> the question of the being of Christs body in the blessed sacrament, he impugneth the being of his quantity therein as a thinge (saith he) held of al papists as an article of their faith, which is vntrue, as is declared in the answer. In the third he inueigheth <note place="margin">
         <hi>pag.</hi> 37.</note> against the Popes powre to dispense in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony before it be consummated, which likwise is an opinion of Canonists, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly refuted of Catholik deuines. In the fift omittinge true merit which is a point of faith, he impugneth condigne merit as a thinge defined by the Councel of Trent <note place="margin">
         <hi>p:</hi> 75.</note>
      <pb facs="27"/> which it is not. In the seuenth Article in steede of Traditions conteining things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for mans saluation, which in the beginning of the article he proposed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne, he impugneth an erronious opinion <note place="margin">
         <hi>p.</hi> 131. 132. 133.</note> of Papias about Christs reigne after his iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, and an other of S. Ireney about Christs age, one history about Zachary S. Ihon Baptists father, &amp; an other concerning Constātins baptisme, a probable opinion of Popes priuate teaching the same doctrin with S. Peter, and an other concerning our Ladies Cōception without sin. In the eight he oppugneth the keeping of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments in such a sense as no Catholik dreameth of. So that though he had flong down al these matters, yet ther had bene no downfal of Popery. Is not this fellow think you a iolly challenger of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>pists? a goodly downfeller of Popery? Is not be one of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hos <note place="margin">1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 1</note> of whom S. Paul saith willinge to be Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the law, know nether what they say, nor of what.</p>
   <p>But if we marke the successe which this Champion hath, whiles he yet florisheth by him self, before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>

   </q>
   <p>it is admirable. For, omitting particuler cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
<pb facs="28"/> almost in euery Article he flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth down the very main point which he wold establish. As art. 1. he wold proue that the Pope hath no superiority ouer Princes, nor power to depose them: and yet affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that <hi>some Kings, and Emperors haue hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>pag.</hi> 17.</note>
      <hi>them selues, yeelded their soueraign rights to him, and that Popes liued in duetiful obedience</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>pag</hi> 2.</note>
      <hi>vnder Emperors vntil the year</hi> 603. which he proueth by S. Gregory, and yet no les then <note place="margin">S. Fabian. S. Innocent. 1. Symmachus S. Felix 2. Anastasius 2. Vigilius.</note> six Popes did in that tyme excommunicate their Emperors, &amp; S. Gregory was the first that decreed the deposition of Kings and Princes. In the second article after he had talked long against the real presence and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Masse he falleth to cal the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing of</hi> (Christs) <hi>flesh with Preists hands,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>p.</hi> 26. 27.</note> golden words, and to say that <hi>if we wold be iudged by a doctrin of Bellarmins,</hi> (which a litle before he had said was the Popes doctrin) <hi>the controuersy about the real presence wold be at an end.</hi> In the fourth article after he had long labored to proue inuoluntary motions of the flesh to be formal sin, and called the contrary damnable doctrin, he both affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth and proueth such inuoluntary motiōs in S. Paul to haue bene no sin, because they <note place="margin">
         <hi>pag.</hi> 48.</note> were against his wil. In the fift Article after he had spent many leaues to fling down condigne merit, at the last he auoucheth,
<pb facs="28"/> that if we wold be iudged by Bellarmins &amp; <note place="margin">
         <hi>p.</hi> 78. 79.</note> others doctrin published in print, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy wold be ended, &amp; yet immediatly before he had affirmed that Bellarm. taught his doctrin of merit, (which is the very some which commonly al Catholiks hold) <hi>after mature deliberation, and graue consultation with al the best learned Iesuits in the world, and with the Pope him self.</hi> What is this but to confesse that in vain he impugneth the Popes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of merit? Such is the force of truth (saith S. Austin) <hi>that it is more forceable to</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lib. cont. Donat. post collat. c. 24. <hi>pag.</hi> 81.</note>
      <hi>wring out confession, then any rack or torment.</hi> In the sixt Article he admitteth the distinction of mortal and venial sin in a godly sense (as he saith) and yet streight after concludeth absolutly that al sins are mortal, and saith that we flatter our selfs in our cursed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed venials. In the seuenth article after he had spent 27. leaues to fel down Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, called them falshoods, and vanities p. 93. and pronounced them accursed of S. Paul who receaue them: at last him self p. <note place="margin">
         <hi>p.</hi> 134. 135.</note> 134. and 135. accepteth one Tradition about the Bible whither it be Gods word or no; wherby he beateth down whatsoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had set vp against the Traditions of the Church. In the last he graunteth that Gods commandements are possible to be kept in a godly sense, and yet afterward ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutly
<pb facs="29"/> concludeth that we can not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly keep them. Thus we see this silly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <note place="margin">
         <hi>p.</hi> 149.</note> as he hath bene of opposit religions and professions, so playing ambedexter, now the minister now the Priest, now the Protestant now the Catholik. what aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary need such a challenger who is so great an aduersary to him self? what successe is he like to haue of a mean aduersary, who hath this euil euent of his own brauado?</p>
   <p>He promiseth to subscribe if one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">
         <hi>pag.</hi> 31. <hi>Preface to Iesuits Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Preistes.</hi>
      </note> which he maketh vpon S. Austins words be answered, or if any could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince him ether to haue alleadged any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter corruptly or to haue quoted any place guilfully, or to haue charged any other falsly.
