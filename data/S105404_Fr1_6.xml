   <head>TO THE READER,
whether in CITIE or
COVNTRIE.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloued</hi> READER,
(whether Christian, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
Gentle; either, or
neither.) If you expect in
these ensuing Lines any
scarce credible or feigned matters of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment,
made in some Tauerne or on
some Ale-bench, to tickle your Eares and
helpe you to sing Care-away, you will be
deceiued: for there are enow, if not too
many such like Spuriall Pamphlets, which
the Presse hath of late already spewed out,
(Broods of <hi>Barbican, Smithfield,</hi> and the
<hi>Bridge,</hi> and <hi>Trundled, trolled</hi> and <hi>marshalled</hi>
vp and downe and along the Streets; and
haply the Countries also:) and certes (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
<pb facs="7"/>
one ingenious and ingenuous
Writer lately extant,<note place="margin">Ʋox Civit.</note> and published since
this Tract was penned,) they are mad
Mountebankes that dare venture to vent
their Quacksaluing Conceipts, to mooue
mirth, in time of a mightie Mortalitie, and
when GOD and KING calls for Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
The very Title of this <hi>Tract</hi> is <hi>Teares;</hi>
the <hi>Subject, Sad;</hi> the <hi>Matter, Mournfull;</hi> in <hi>a
sorrowfull Season;</hi> in <hi>a perplexed Place:</hi> All
true, and really too true: If it were the
will of GOD, would it were not so: Yet
all is heere related by way of Meditation,
and but generally: particular Sad and
Mournfull accidents, I doe but touch,
though I know many: For example, of
whole Families swept away by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of GODS Destroying Angell; some
consisting of 5. some 6. some 7. some 8.
some 9. and 10. persons in a Familie; and
none left to lament the losse of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
nor any lawfull Inheritour left,
or hardly to bee heard of, to lay clayme
to the Goods and Estate remayning: and
if any such found out, how shie and
<pb facs="7"/>
fearefull to enter and take possession of
the said Goods? I know, I say, the
names of such Families, the places where
they dwelt: yea, and Nurses, and such
like keeping-Creatures going away with
the best part of such Goods as are left in
the Houses: whiles Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
hearken after the right Inheritours.
And who is there remaining in this Citie,
that hath not a share in the knowledge,
more or lesse, of this Tragedie, of those
that are dead from vs? Now, for our
<hi>Londoners</hi> that fled from vs, their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinment
in the Countries about vs, and
in the seuerall Shires of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
I must leaue you to those forced
and farced, if not feigned, Relations
before specified: or rather to their
owne Reports by their Letters, and at
their returnes: bad enough, and too
bad, I partly heare it hath beene: for
which the Countries hard-heartednesse to
Citizens extended my Prayer shall be, that
God haue not a scourge in store for them.
<pb facs="8"/>
And so not to trouble farther with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
I referre and commend you to
more purpose, to the ensuing
TREATISE.
