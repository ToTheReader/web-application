      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Sir, your manifolde comfortes which you raine daily vppon mee, I hope shal not fall into a barren scile, that will not render interest in due season. I send you the epilogue of all those can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which either out of Scriptures, fathers, or theological discourse I can affoord you: because, without Bookes, conference, or other good opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, what can be expected? you may well perceiue they are not drawn from sundry sweet floures, as Bees sucke their hony, but rather like the silke wormes webbe, distilled from the inner bowels of my soule, in my quiet repose and silent Meditations, I send you them as a fleece of wooll new shorne, without weauing, dying, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or fashioning: but you, or any other, as I</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <hi>I bope wil weaue them in a better methode, dye them with a purer stile, and enrich them with Fathers and Scriptures. I send you them as an of-spring of my goodwill, at your request begun, continued, and performed. If there be any thing in them profitable for good Catholikes to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, or to serue them for their spirituall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, thanke God for it, and the next cause ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge your selfe: for the full disposition of them I commit to your discretion. As for the other two Treatises you requested of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and frequent communion (God willing) I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do my best, to satisfie your desire: if you had any booke of this subiect, I would be content to peruse it, to see if my practise and speculation confront with his iudgement. In the meane time I beseech you to remember mee in your deuoute prayers, and request the dew of heauen, that I may yeeld you those delightfull fruites, I knowe you desire.</hi>
