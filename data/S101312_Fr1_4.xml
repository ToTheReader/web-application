      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which aunciēt writers and learned men reporte to be the singular commendation and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall prayse of a good Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographer (gētle Reader,) to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale nothyng of the truth for feare, or to vtter any vntruth for for euill will, neither yet to flatter or claw for fauour: that same me thinkes is necessarily to be required of all those whiche take in hand to testifie of any matter whatsoeuer. For els how should we possibly looke for truth of those men whose myndes are wedded to affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, whose handes and pennes are let out for lucre, and toungues let loose to testifie an vntruth, who are wholy blinded with disdayne, and beyng egged on with euill will, haue set them selues to sale, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng whatsoeuer is vnhonest with vnsatiable greadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Cōcernyng my selfe, in simplicitie of hart I testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and solēnely protest before the whole world, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling God to witnesse (whom I know to be a sharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenger and seuere iudge agaynst those which abuse his blessed name to any vntruth) agaynst myne owne soule, if in this treatise I haue vttered ought for enuie or malice of those people, against whose opinions my whole stile and writyng is especially directed. I haue truely quoted, rightly alledged, and faythfully as I am hable reported, whatsoeuer I haue either heard by word, or read by writyng concernyng the errour of those men who terme themselues to be of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

of Loue. Whiche I haue the rather done beyng thereto required by that dutie that I owe vnto the Churche of Christ, whiche is the felowshyp of the faythfull and societie of the Saintes of God▪ as also beyng by a Christian Magistrate thereunto cōmaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I could not chuse (I say) but I needes must testifie the truth of that whiche both I haue heard and sene: which also I am ready at any tyme to auouch before any person beyng called thereunto either priuately or openly. Wherein also I haue not sayd so much as I might truely, and could iustly, hauyng refrayned for their sakes especially, which are my very frendes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng somewhat ouertaken with the lime of that secte, and are bewitched with the blyndnesse of those vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauery opinions.</p>
   <p>Concernyng my further knowledge in that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, I referre thee (good reader) vnto that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth, most humbly beseeching thee to blesse and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther me with thy most feruent prayers, as I hartly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the promotion and furtheraunce of Gods true Religion, the encrease of a true fayth in the feare of God, the quietnesse of our English Church, and the vtter ruine and abolishyng of all Papistry, Atheisme, and Hereticall sectes, and Schismes whatsoeuer.</p>

   <p>Readyng certaine bookes of H.N. and conferring with certaine of that Louely Fam. I was by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested to set downe vnto them in writyng for my further instruction those doubtes whiche (either by meanes of the vnusualnesse of their Methode in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the noueltie of their farre fetched phrases, there wrong and wrested Allegories, there Diuinitie not
