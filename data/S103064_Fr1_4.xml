   <head>The Preface of the Authour.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo things specially do moue ech jodly and christian man destring the glorie of Christ, and the weale publique) to wish that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> publique affaires of the Churche, or common wealthe where he liueth, may be better set in order. The one is, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> memorie &amp; record of the gret di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligēce of our elders in their good gouernmēt. The other is, the consideration of the greate negligence in the gouerners of our tyme, in suche affayres. Therfore when and as often as I call to mynde, wyth howe greate fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and endeuour the holy fathers oure aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesters in tymes past prouided, that the poore people shoulde charitably he reléeued in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parishe and Citie by the common almes. And agayne I seacute;e howe shamefully in these dayes the true pouertie is neglectéd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any care almost to releeue them.</p>
   <p>These two things truly cause me not only to wishe and desyre hartily, that the pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in our parishes and common wealth may better than they haue hitherto, be bereafter prouided for: but also I thinke it be houefull, for me by all meanes to labour, as much as
<pb facs="7"/>in me lyeth, to set foorth some order, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may at length remedie these present inconueniences.</p>
   <p>For if there be yet any remnaunts of the Christian fayth (wherein wée so muche glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) remayning, if there bée any sparkles of charitie (which necessarilie followeth a true and liuely fayth) harboured in our breasts, then truely wyll wée neuer suffer it to be thoughte, that either we will not, or can not persist in those vertues, wherin our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetours (by reporte) haue alwayes excelled, when as suche as would haue their noble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse, where with they are endewed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed, must not onely endeuour to match, but also if it may be) to surmoūt their elders in euery kinde of vertue. It is a shame to boast of holy fathers, and not to imitate their worthy examples. For which thing Chryste vpbraydeth the Iewes, who vaynely gloried that they were the children of Abraham, when in no poynt they did expresse the fayth or works of Abraham. Therfore in all other vertues, but esecially in liberalitie towards the poore, it is requisite that we frame our whole studie to followe the holy fathers, whose examples wée sée commytted to writing, and deliuered ouer to vs their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie.</p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p>Which thing, the more readily and easily that we may in oure parishes and common wealthe perfourme, I will assay to gather and set foorthe certayne fitte orders, whiche partely our aunceffors were wonte to vse in reléeuing the poore, and partely are suche, as may for the time present honestly procure, that euery Citie may foster their pouertie, by their Publique liberalitie. In whiche thyng, bycause I shall sufficiently declare, bothe my great studie in setting foorthe the glorie of God within our Churches (which I wishe alwayes moste earnestly to profite yet dayly more and more, in the knowledge of spirituall things) and also shall expresse my godly desire to helpe the true pouertie, whom no man dothe not greatly lament, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they shuld shamefully be neglected, or perishe, excepte his heart be altogither as harde as Adamant. Therfore I trust this my labour to all honest and godly men, as well gouernors of Churches, as cōmon wealths, shall be acceptable and thank worthy. But I suppose, I may with more fruicte to all good men, of whatsoeuer degrée, accomplishe this which I haue taken in hande, if I expounds these titles in order as they followe.</p>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <list>
      <item>1 That it belongeth iointly both to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastically and politique gouernors, to take care for the releefe of the poore.</item>
      <item>2 How many things there be, in these wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched times, which ought to moue vs to healps the poore.</item>
      <item>3 That euery parishe and Citie must take aduise, howe they may best prouide for theyr pouertie, as place and time requireth.</item>
      <item>4 That certayne fitte men must be chosen by voyces, to take charge of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> whole busines.</item>
      <item>5 What belongeth to those mens office.</item>
      <item>6 Whiche way the true pouertie may be discerned from the counterfaites, and howe they muste be particularly searched and knowne.</item>
      <item>7 Howe the money and necessarie charges may be raysed, without any great griefe to the Cittizens.</item>
      <item>8 Howe the almes must be distributed to the néedy particularely.</item>
      <item>9 It must be prouided, that they which be the distributers be knowne to be faithful and trusty men, whose estimation may not be empayred.</item>
      <item>10 It must be prouided, that the reléese ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the poore, when it is once wel esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, be alwayes after continued.</item>
   </list>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <p>All the which things when we haue expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, I trust it shall appere that we haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a safe and ready way for all wel dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed persons (where soeuer inhabiting) whose worthy minde shalbe in any wise stirred to exercise liberalitie towards the poore, so that they may cherefully and constantly followe it. And these things we will so euidently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse by the holie Scriptures, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of the auncient fathers, by the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical histories, Synede, &amp; Canons of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Bishops, that such men as are not too vnapte to cenceyue, may (without any paine) learne out of this our cōmentarie, what is conuentent in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for euery time and place. ∴</p>
