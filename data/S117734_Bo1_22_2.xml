   <p>NOw sir, it is a common customary vse in these times, to salute you
with somewhat; as Honest, Kinde, Courteous, Louing, Friendly,
or Gentle; but all these Epithites are ouer-worne, and doe, as it were,
stinke of the fusty garbe of Antiquity. Besides, if I should come
vpon you with any of these claw-backe tearmes, I might chance to
belye you. But if your kinde disposition doth merit to bee called kinde, I pray
let me finde it in your fauourable censure. Some will (perhaps) dislike, that I doe
dedicate my bookes to <hi>Archy,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> and such like. To them I answere,
that my subiect being altogether foolish, I were very absurd to thinke that any
wise man would be my Patron. And it were meere follie for mee to make a
hotch-potch, in seeking to compound wisedome and follie together. But how,
soeuer thou esteemest it, it thrusts it selfe into thy view; wherein (if thou beest
not too much drowned in Melancholie) thou wilt shew thy teeth (if thou hast
any) with laughing. And as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> lines are somewhat defectiue in their shape,
so I pray thee doe not hacke them, nor hew them with thy stammering, to make
them worse, nor. Buzzard-blast them with thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>alumniating mewes, rushes,
and scuruies. Thus leauing thee to thy selfe, and my selfe vnto thee, I remaine
thine as thou respect'st me,</p>
