   <opener>
      <salute>RIGHT HON:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>WHen I had compos'd these unpolish'd lines, and being urg'd by some of my friends, to put
<pb facs="3"/>
them into the wide world, to shift for themselves; I thought it somewhat an unnaturall part, to turne my new-borne Muse out of doores harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse being unknowne, lest she should be tost to and fro, with some hollow blast of arrogant breath. Then musing on the many undeserved favours that I have received from your Lordship, which I know not how to requite; I thought of presenting my home-bred Muse to your Honour; being
<pb facs="3"/>
the first fruits of my poore indeavours in this kinde, and as part of the testimony of my humble service in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes to your Lordship. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though somewhat discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, when I considered the greatnesse of your person, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with your worth, and gifts of minde, meeting with learning and pietie, which makes you shine as a fixed Starre in our English region. And then looking backe how unworthy my plaine Muse is
<pb facs="4"/>
of your Honours acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But when I considered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what small and weake indeavours (such which might claime kindred with this of mine) have beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of great personages when they have been drawn as a clew from the bowels of love (which I hope your Lordship conceives no lesse of mine.) And the Eagle though shee soares aloft, doth not disdaine to stoope low, and the Sunne that is so glorious, doth not
<pb facs="4"/>
deny his spangled beams, nor cloud his smiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from these infereour darke bodies here below, and that the noblest spirits are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the humblest mindes (which I have ever found in your Lordship) then my doubts vanisht as the mist before the heate: so I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to present (as here I doe) these lines to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours protection, Humbly craving your Lordships ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, that they may beare
<pb facs="5"/>
your name; So with your Honours countenance, they shall passe secure; Thus pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Lord will inrich you with spirituall blessings, and that the dew of heaven may sweeten the fatnesse of the earth, to you and your noble off-spring forever.</p>
