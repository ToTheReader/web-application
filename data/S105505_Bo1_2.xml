   <head>¶ The preface / vnto the reader.</head>
   <p>Among other innumerable pestilent infections of bokes &amp; learnynges / with the which christen people haue bene pyryously seduced and deceyued (brought vp in dyuers kyndes of dyffydence &amp; false hope) I may iudge and that chiefly / those to be pernicyous / on whom they be wont in euery place to pray / and haue also lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by herte / both curyously &amp; with great scrupulosite to make rehersal of theyr sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. These bokes (though they aboūded in euery place with infynyte errours / and taught praiers, made with wycked folish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes / both to god and also to his sayntes) yet by cause thei were garnished with glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryous tytles and with redde letters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysyng moch grace and pardon (though it were but vanite) haue sore deceiued the vnlearned multytude / one is called y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyn of the soule / another the paradyse of the soule / &amp; by cause I wyll be short loke thou thy selfe / what dyuerse and glorious names be gyuē vnto them / wherfore here nedeth sherpe reformation / yea and many of them be worthy to be vtterly destroied. The same iudgement and reformation is olso to be had of the bokes of passyons &amp;

sayntes lyues called legendes for in these are also many thynges added / wherof Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thā is author / how be it syth neither time suffycyent is gyuen to one man / neither y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> burthē of this reformation of one may be susteyned. I thought it ynoughe in this place onely to haue monyshed you trustīg that god in tyme commynge shall adde to those thynges bothe tyme conuenyent &amp; also lyght. Therfore here (as entryng my mater) fyrst I wyll declare after a symple &amp; playne maner (by the which euen as by a glasse thou shalt knowe) what y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lege of sinne is, and how we ought trulye to pray folowyng the rehersal of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes and of the Pater noster. And I duobte not but this one prayer is sufficyent ynough to them that pray how often soeuer it be, or what soeuer they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre, yea yf they take but one lytle parte of it which so euer it be, for a good prayer stondeth not nether cōsysteth in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tytude of wordes as Christe sayeth in the syxte of Mathew. But here stondeth the pythe that thou syghe to god often from the botom of thyn harte, for to haue strenght to do his wyll, to fulfyll his cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, and this syghe ought to endure contynually. Therfore I desyre
<pb facs="15"/>
al persones that from hensforth they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get suche prayers as be saynte Brigittes and other lyke, whiche greate promyses and perdons haue falsely aduaūced. And you shal retorne vnto this symple prayer nedefull for euery Christen, whose comē vse doeth yet perseuer amonge all men, yf they dyd vnderstonde it, and applyed theyre myndes to it. Suche vertue hathe the Pater noster, that the longer and the more thou vse it, the swetter and more ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceptable it is, whiche I desyre that the master of this prayer cōferme Iesus Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ste whiche is blessed eternally. So be it.</p>
   <p>IT was neuer ordeyned withoute y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> synguler prouidence of god that the multitude of Christen people shuld learne by herte the tenne cōmaundementes, the Crede, and the Pater noster, for truely he that vnderstondeth these hath the pythe of al those thynges, which holy scripture dothe conteyne, and what soeuer may be taught necessary vnto the Christen, and that purely and plentyfully, besydes that so bryefly and clerely that noman can cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne or excuse hym selfe iustly, syth that (whiche is required to the blessed lyfe) is neyther ouertedyous, nor yet so harde but it may be performed. Thre thynges
<pb facs="16"/>
there be, necessary to be knowen to obtey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne eternall lyfe. The fyrste is that thou know what is expedient to be done, and what to be vndon. The secunde when thou perceyuest that thou of thyn owne strenght cannest neyther doo, neyther yet auoide that which thou art bounde to do or to eschewe, that then thou knowe of whome to seke, fynde, and receyue this strenght. The thyrde is howe thou shul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest seke, and obteyne it. And hereunto I wyll gyue the an ensample to thentent y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thou mayst y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> more euydently perceyue it, a man which is diseased with any maner of syckenes. Fyrste enquireth with what kynde of sycknes he is infect, &amp; then cōsy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth he what strength he hath, what he is able to do, and what he can not do, thē searcheth he for a medecyne to ley to his dysease, so that by this meanes he may get his helthe &amp; that he may afterwarde be able to do and leaue vndone all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as the hole. Fynally, when he hathe founde this medecyne, he wyl take it, and vse it / lykewyse the cōmaundementes of god do teache a man to knowe his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, that he may vnderstonde and fele, what he can do, &amp; what he can not, what he can leaue and what he can not, so that
<pb facs="16"/>
he maye knowlege hym a vitious person and a synner, after he hath knowleged hym selfe so, that then he may learne by faithe, where to fynde remedy and grace whereby he may be restored and iustified and so may be able to fulfylle the cōmaū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dementes. For faythe pleynly declareth god and his mercy shewed and gyuen in Christe. But y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Pater noster, dothe teache how we shulde desyre, aske, and obteyne this bountuous fauour, as in a well orde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, meke, and faithfull prayer / whiche getteth all these thynges, so that (fulfyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng the cōmaundemētes of god) we may be saued &amp; made blessed, wherfore (as I haue saied) in these thre cōsisteth the hole scripture, wherfore it is expedient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne at the cōmaundemētes, so that we maye by theym learne to knowlege our synne and malyce (as the spirituall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myte) which maketh vs feble and weake so that we can neither do, neither leaue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which we be bounde to do, or to leaue.</p>
