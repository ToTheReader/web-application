   <p>GOd, vnto whome all
mens hartis be opened,
and the wyll of manne
speakethe, is my wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that to the desire of
knowlege, whervnto I haue hither
to ben euer of my nature disposed / I
haue ioyned a constant intent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte
therby to my natural countrey:
Whervnto acordyng to the sentence
of Tully, we be most specially boū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
Wherfore after that I had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the more parte of my lyfe in
perusynge diligently euery auncient
warke, that I mought come by / ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greke or latine, conteyninge any
parte of philosophie necessary to the
institution of mans lyfe in vertue, I
haue endeuored my selfe to set forth
such part of my studie as I thought
mought be profitable to them, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
<pb facs="3"/>
shulde happen to rede or here it.
But diuers men rather scornyng my
benefite than receyuing it thankfully
doo shewe them selfes offended (as
they say) with my strange termes.</p>
   <p>Other finding in my bokis the thing
dispreysed / whiche they do cōmende
in vsynge it. Lyke a galde horse abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
no playsters be alwaye gnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge
and kyckynge at suche exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and sentences as they do feele
sharpe or do byte them / accomptyng
to be in me no lyttell presumption,
that I wylle in notynge other mens
vices correct Magnificat, sens other
moche wyser men and better lerned
than I, doo forbeare to wryte any
thynge. And whiche is warse than
all this: Some wyll maliciously di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
or coniecte that I wryte to the
intent to rebuke some perticuler per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone
couaytinge to brynge my war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
and afterward me into the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation
of some man in auctorytie.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
Thus vnthankfully is my benefyte
receyued / my good wyll consumed,
and all my labours deuoured. Such
is of some menne the nature serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
that lappyng swete mylke they
conuerte hit forthe with in to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to distroy hym of whose libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
they late had receyued it. How
incomparable be these men vnlyke
to the most excellent prince our most
dere soueraygne lorde? whose most
royall persone I hartily beseche god
to preserue in longe life and honour.
His highnesse benignely receyuynge
my boke / whiche I named the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour,
in the redynge therof sone
perceyued that I intended to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
our Englyshe tongue, wherby
men shulde as well expresse more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
the thynge that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
in theyr hartis (wherfore lan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>guage
was ordeyned) hauynge wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
apte for the pourpose: as also
interprete out of greke, latyn / or any
<pb facs="4"/>
other tonge into Englysshe, as suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently / 
as out of any one of the said
tongues into an other. His grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
perceyued / that through out the
boke there was no terme new made
by me of a latine or frenche worde,
but it is there declared so playnly by
one mene or other to a diligent reder
that no sentēce is therby made derke
or harde to be vnderstande. Ne the
sharpe and quycke sentences, or the
rounde and playne examples set out
in the versis of Claudiane the poete
in the seconde boke / or in the chapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Affablitie, Beneuolence, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence / 
and of the diuersitie of fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers / 
and in dyuers other places / in
any parte offended his hyghnes: but
(as hit was by credible persones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
vnto me) his grace not onely
toke hit in the better parte, but also
with princely wordes ful of maiestie
cōmēded my diligēce / simplicite &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
in that I spared none astate in
<pb facs="4"/>
the rebukynge of vice: which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
full of very nobilite brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my remembraunce the vertuous
Emperour Antonine, called for his
wysdom Antonine the philosopher,
who on a tyme herynge that there
was in the Citie of Rome a playne &amp;
rude persone / whiche alwaye spake
in the rebuke of all men, and neuer
praised any man: he sent to hym / re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirynge
that he wolde come and
speke with hym. And whan he was
come, the Emperour had these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
vnto hym. My frende / wherin
haue I euer offended the? The felow
therwith soore abasshed answered
in this wise. Sir your hyghnes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
offended me, that I am ware of.
Than art thou (sayd the Emperour)
an vncourtoyse subiecte, that thou
haste so longe dissembled with me,
not tellyng vnto me my faultes.</p>
   <p>And after the Emperoure reteyned
hym styll gyuyng vnto hym dowble
<pb facs="5"/>
wages / commaundynge hym to vse
his olde libertie. And whan dyuers
men meruayled therat, he affirmed
openly, that princis vices were soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
espied by other men thā by them
selfes: and that there was moche
more difficultie in remembring them
of their vice or lack, than in extolling
and commendynge their vertues.</p>
   <p>So well dyd this mooste noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
consider, that his exaumple
mought be more profitable vnto the
publyke weale of the citie, than any
other thynge in his persone or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
   <p>¶In lyke wise our moste dere soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raygne
lorde perfectly knew that no
writar ought to be blamed, whiche
wryteth neyther for hope of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
rewarde / nor for any priuate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne
or malyce, but onely of feruēt
zele towarde good occupation and
vertu. Perdie man is not so yet cōfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med
in grace, that he can not do syn.
<pb facs="5"/>
And I suppose no prince thynkethe
hym selfe to be exempte from morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.
And for as moche as he shall
haue mo occasiōs to fall, he ought to
haue the moo frendes or the more
instruction to warne hym. And as
for my parte I eftesones do protest,
that in no boke of mi making I haue
intended to touche more one manne
than an nother. For there be Gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos
in Spayne as wel as in Grece,
Pasquilles in Englande as welle as
in Rome, Dionises in Germanye as
welle as in Sicile, Harpocrates in
France as wel as in Aegipt, Aristip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
in Scotlande as well as in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena,
Platos be fewe, and them I
doubte where to fynde. And if men
wyll seke for them in Englande / whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che
I sette in other places, I can nat
lette them. I knowe well ynowghe
dyuers do delyte to haue theyr gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of the facion of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes,
and that whiche is mooste
<pb facs="6"/>
playne is vnplesant: but yet it doth
happen sometyme that one man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
in auctorytie or fauour of his
prince, beinge sene to weare somme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing
of the old facion: for the strāge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
therof it is taken vp ageine with
many good felowes. What I doo
meane euery wyse man perceyueth.
Touchynge the title of my boke, I
considered that wisedome is spoken
of, moch more than vsed. For wher
in it resteth fewe menne be sure. The
commune opinion is into thre partis
deuided. One sayeth it is in moche
lernynge and knowledge. An other
affirmeth / that they whiche do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducte
the affayres of greatte prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
or countrayes, be onely wyse
men. Nay saythe the thyrde, he is
wysest that leste dothe meddle, and
can sytte quietly at home and tourne
a crabbe, and looke onely vnto his
owne busynesse. Nowe they whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
be of the fyrste oppinion be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
<pb facs="6"/>
at varyance. For somme doo
chiefly extoll the study of holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(as it is rayson) but while they
do wrest it to agree with theyr wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
ambition, or vayne glory, of the
mooste noble and deuoute lernynge,
they doo endeuor them to make hit
seruile and full of contention. Some
do preferre the studie of the lawes
of this realme, callynge it the onely
studye of the publyke weale. But a
great noumbre of persones, whiche
haue consumed in sute more thanne
the value of that, that they used for,
in theyr angre do cal it a cōmune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment.
All thoughe vndoubtedly
the verye selfe lawe trewely prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised / 
passeth the lawes of all other
countrayes. In thynkynge on these
sondrye opynyons, I happened
for my recreacyon to reede in the
booke of Laertius the lyfe of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and beholdynge the aunswere
that he made to kynge Dyonyse,
<pb facs="7"/>
at the fyrste syghte it semed to me to
be very dissolute and lackyng the mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>destie
that belōged to a philosopher:
but whan I had better examined it,
therein appered that whiche is best
worthy to be called wysedome.</p>
   <p>Wherfore to exercyse my wytre, and
to auoyde Idelnes, I toke my penne
and assayde / Howe in expressyng my
conceyte I mought profyte to them,
whiche without disdayne or enuye
wolde often tymes reade it. If any
man wyll thinke the boke to be very
longe, let hym consyder, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of wysedome can not be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared. All be hit of them whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
be well wyllinge it is soone ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
in good faythe sooner thanne
Primero or Gleeke: Suche is the
straunge propretie of that excellent
counnynge, that it is sooner lerned,
than taught, and better by a mannes
rayson than by an instructour.</p>
   <p>Finally if the reders of my warkis,
<pb facs="7"/>
by the noble example of our mooste
dere soueraygne lorde do iustly and
louyngely interprete my labours, I
durynge the residue of my lyfe wyll
nowe and than sette forthe suche
frutes of my study profitable (as I
trust) vnto this my countray. And le<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uynge
malycious reders with their
incurable fury, I wyll say vnto god
the wordes of the Catholike Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
in the booke of Sapience:<note place="margin">Sap̄. 15.</note> To
knowe the good lorde is perfecte
Iustice / And to knowe thy Iustyce
and vertue is the very roote of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalite:
And therin is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
that is very wysedome.</p>
