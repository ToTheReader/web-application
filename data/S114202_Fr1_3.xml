      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader. I pray thee be advertized of the Bookes I haue vndertaken to answer, they are these. <hi>Abridgm. of Linc. Minist. Dispus. ag. kneeling, Perth assembly, written by some Scotchmen. Survey of the Bookes of Com. Pr. a certaine Manuscript,</hi> which I light on, without the name of the Author (which because it is in the hands of many, and much esteemed of, I thought needfull to be answered amongst the rest.) <hi>Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>cent ceremonues.</hi> In all which (with some others) I haue answered that which they say, concerning the gesture of the Lords Supper, and further I medle not with them. Therefore I let thee know, that I take not vpon me to be the defender of the Reverend and learned <hi>Bp</hi> of <hi>Cov▪</hi> and <hi>Lichfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>l,</hi> nor will my wrighting prevent the labour of any one; to whom his Lordship may perhaps haue committed that taske; if yet that Reply can be judged worth answering which is so scornfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

      </gap> written. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Evidence of his Lordships booke I could not well forbeare to defend him against the greevous imputation of mainteining idolatry, wherein I hope I shall not seeme to be arrogant.</p>
   <p>I will not trouble thee with the cause of my writing or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing, since I haue witnesses enough for my iustifiable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in both. And for the latter it is knowne, how I haue bin vrged with pressing reasons (some of which I haue to shew) from such as are of good place: and of great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and learning.</p>
   <p>For my sincerity in answering I haue thus much to testifie. 1. that I haue vsed no carnall shifts or colourable evasions, but wholly <hi>grounded on the good word of God.</hi> 2. <hi>my method</hi> will testifie, which wholy tends to the credit &amp; advantage of our brethrens cause. 3 my fidelity will testifie <hi>in producing all which they wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>,</hi> and making the best of all their arguments, whereby they shall see more put together against kneeling
<pb facs="6"/>
then (I suppose) any of them haue seene. 4. the learned will testifie, to whose iudgement &amp; correction I haue already submitted my selfe. 5. my brethren may testifie, in some part, whose conferences and disputations I haue been so farr from declining, that (vpon their owne appointments and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers) I haue waited for them in vaine. 6. the Lord will testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, to whome I haue beene carefull, in all the proceedings which I haue made, in some comfortable measure to approoue my conscience.</p>
   <p>For my plainesse I need not much excuse my selfe. I deale with men who write in the plainest manner; also the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (being of humble kneeling) is <hi>Argumentum humile.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides I thought it needfull, partly by reason of the ignorance, partly the disposition of the common sort, (despising any thing that is not within their owne vnderstanding, calling it <hi>braine-knowledge)</hi> to deale with them, as it were, by familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</p>
   <p>If any man thinke I haue not written <hi>mildly</hi> enough, I say with Mr. <hi>Cart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>r. They must not thinke much to be strucken with the backe, who haue stricken others with the edge.</hi> I say further, sometimes they deliver such silly or vnchristian points, (as the Disp. about coheires, &amp;c.) that it was needfull to answer with some rebuke. Yet protesting, for our brethren, who are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise wise and godly men, I loue them in the bowells of the Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p>Of my Reader I heartily request, that he would cover my oversights and infirmities with the mantle of loue; and if he be scrupulous that he would not suffer himselfe to be forestal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: that he would please to take the paines to reade through, not being discouraged with the rude and hasty generalls in the first part: that he would set himselfe to consider what I reason or answer, and how the force of obiections is taken away: that if he can be satified, he would not be ashamed of men, or afraid of disesteeme of the world; but giue God his glory, the Church her due, and gaine vnto himselfe the sweete advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of frequent communicating, and finally make vp the breach, to the end we may more sweetly ioyne against the common Adversaries of the Gospell.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
The practise of two sorts of men I vtterly abhor: 1. of them which being themselues vile and prophane, should hence take occasion to reproach our brethren for professing to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of their wayes. I will be no encourager of such wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches whose case is miserable and damnable, whiles the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities (such as the best men haue) of them which striue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to know the truth, and walke according to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, shall never be imputed to their condemnation. 2. Of them who will be censurers though no readers, speaking evill of the things they know not; or if they reade, reade but to scoffe and cavill, having not a spark of good iudgement, discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or charity: I looke for many such, but we must all stand before the iudgement seat of Christ.</p>
   <p>Lastly, to those persons that can be contented to take it at my hands I would giue this counsell. 1. To thinke as they would be thought of, to speake as they would be spoken of. to doe as they would be done to. 2. To consider, that it is not knowne that any Christian since the world was created, hath suffered trouble in confession against kneeling to God in his holy ordinance.</p>
