   <head>❧The Preface vppon the booke of Salomon, called the Preacher.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause this booke hath beene obscurely &amp; darckly translated out of the Hebrew tounge,<note place="margin">He blameth the abusing of this booke.</note> euery learned mā hath greedyly gone aboute to expoūde and declare it, eche man labouryng to frame diuerse of the sayinges therin to his owne profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or rather opinion whether for that their curiositie was delighted in straūge, obscure and vnwonted matters: or els for that in such obscure and darke writyngs, it is easie for a man to fayne what hee phansieth and supposeth. For the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers haue thought, that which Salomon sayth euen in the very begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, hath appertained to them, namely, that <hi>all thynges are difficulte, man is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vtter them with tounge,</hi> as though Salomon ment some kinde of vayne spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation in Philosophie.</p>
   <p>Some other being offended with this saying of Salomon: <hi>As the beast dyeth so dyeth the man, and they haue both one end and lyfe:</hi> haue demed that he was an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, or spake in the person of the Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. But none haue more daungerously
<pb facs="6"/>
misused the same,<note place="margin">The er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mē, in this booke.</note> thē the Schooles of the diuines, who haue wrested this place: <hi>No man knoweth whether he be worthy of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred or loue</hi> to the cōscience toward God, and so much haue wrested the same, that they haue vtterly slaughtered the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of all mē, and put out the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine sayth in Christ, teachyng &amp; beatyng into most miserable harts,<note place="margin">The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of doubtyng, tooke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng of this booke.</note> nothing more deuoutly thē y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we ought to doubt &amp; to be vncertaine, of the loue, &amp; grace of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, lyued we neuer so inculpable.</p>
   <p>So great was the darkenes more the that of Egypt, that by reason of this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Salomō, yea rather through theyr owne errours builded vpon his saying, they saw now no more the writynges of the Apostles and Euangelistes, which do declare by so many miracles Scriptures and Argumentes, that Christ is our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, and the authour of the most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted grace and saluation, that God hath prohibited and geuen freely to vs. And no lesse hurt haue diuers of the holy and notable fathers and Doctours in the Church done by misunderstādyng of the same booke,<note place="margin">The er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fathers, in misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstādyng of this booke.</note> who haue thought that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon had taught vs herein the cōtempt of the world (as they call it) that is to say of the creatures, that God hath made and ordeined. Amongest whom S. Hierome is one which by hys Commētary writtē
<pb n="5" facs="6"/>
vpon this booke allured his beloued <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silla</hi> to become a Nunne. From hēce hath flowed and rūne ouer all the church lyke a flud or inundatiō all that diuinitie of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> religious houses or monasteries,<note place="margin">The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng of Monkishe lyfe.</note> where they taught that it was the duty of a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiane to forsake the gouernaunce of hys house, to giue vp his office, yea to leaue the Byshoplyke or rather Apostolike mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, to get them into the wildernes, to separate them from all company, to lyue in quyete and silence, saying that mē could not lyue in the world and serue God: as though Salomon counted mariage, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance of kingdoms, bearing of office &amp; ministery of the word vanity, all which in this booke hee meruelously extolleth &amp; calleth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gifts of God.<note place="margin">Errour of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretours.</note> And whereas Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomō declareth that men thē selues, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their coūsels &amp; deuises, are vanities, these men peruertyng all thyngs, call the things thē selues vayne, and suppose that they &amp; their deuises are sounde &amp; good, smothly dreamyng all thynges contrary to Salomons meanyng. And to be short, they haue drawen vs out of this most goodly and profitable booke nothyng but monsters, and of most fine and pure gold haue made abhominable Idoles.</p>
   <p>Wherefore the rather to discouer this darkenes, and to abolish these filthy I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doles, I haue suffered these annotations
<pb facs="7"/>
of myne, noted and written, by other as I spake them, and framed after this order of speach, (for my selfe by reason of much businesse could write no sufficient and full Commentary vpon the booke) to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. Which annotations albeit they are but slender and litle, yet may they to them that haue no better, or which haue been seduced heretofore with false gloses (as I haue been) geue occasion as vnto wise men, to become the better and finde out and deuise better matter. Surely a ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry small tast of this booke was to me a great pleasure, after I was weryed in the same all my lyfe long, and had in vayne vexed and corrupted my selfe, with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked opinions agaynst the fayth in Christ. Wherfore I giue most harty thankes, to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> father of mercies, which hath renewed this latter age with so many reuelations and so great light.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The title of this booke.</note>Therfore we will more aptely call this booke of the Preacher, the politikes, or Oeconomikes of Salomon, (not for y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he giueth any rules or preceptes how to gouerne any Cities, or to rule any fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies (for that doth the law of nature or rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son of man abundantly perfourme. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>unto all thynges in the world are subiect. Gen. 1. which hath bene alway the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, Iudge and end, &amp; must so remaine of all lawes aswell ciuile as domesticall)
<pb n="6" facs="7"/>
but for that it giueth counsell to men in aduersitie whether they be publike or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate persons, instructyng their myndes &amp; strengthenyng them to patience, by bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of misfortunes which many wayes fall out in such cases, as the bookes of the holy hystories and all Poetes fables do declare, such as are <hi>Hercules</hi> trauelles, the monsters that <hi>Vlisses</hi> &amp; others ouercame, the Beare, the Liō, and Goliath that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid vanquished. He that in these pointes is ignoraunt, at length falleth downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tyred, and great is his fall, as was the fall of <hi>Timon, Demosthenes, Cicero,</hi> and diuerse lyke. Through the impatiencie hereof haue heretikes also styrred vp sects in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church because such was the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynes of men, that they forsooke their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery. As it is commonly sayd <hi>Despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion maketh Monkes.</hi> For it is true that the wise mā sayth:<note place="margin">He mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Plato.</note>
      <hi>Office and authoritie shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what a man is.</hi> But in deede, onles we haue some Salomon to exhorte and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte vs, office and authoritie, ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, casteth downe, and vndoth a man.</p>
   <p>I commende therfore to the godly bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren this my <hi>Salomon,</hi> rather pointed at, and but touched, then fully declared. And I wish that some good and learned man of a more abundaunt spirit, and happyer vayne then I am would stand vp, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and beautifie this booke according
<pb facs="8"/>
to the worthynes therof, to the prayse of God and commēdation of his creatures, to whom be glory for euer, through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
   <div type="part">
      <head>The Argument vpon Salomons booke called the Preacher.</head>
      <p>
         <note place="margin">The obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or hard<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of this booke.</note>THis booke is one of the most difficulte bookes of the whole Scripture, whiche no man hath hetherto fully attayned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, yea it hath been depraued with the vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy commentaryes of diuerse men: in so much that it is a more trouble to purge y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> author ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from the dreames wherewith they haue defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, then to restore the true sense therof agayn. And two causes there haue been,<note place="margin">Two causes why it is so obscure.</note> why it hath been more hard to vnderstand then other. One was, for that they perceaued not the intent and meanyng of the author, which thyng as in euery kynde of writyng, so chiefly in this, and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it had been requisite, they had kept and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. The other was by reason they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt in the Hebrew toung, &amp; in the auctors peculiar phrase, whiche many tymes swarueth from the common phrase of speach, and differeth much from the custome of our tounge.<note place="margin">The vse of this booke.</note> Hereby it came to passe, that the booke which for many causes was worthy to be had in all mēs hādes, and specially to be knowen to all gouernours of common weales (for in it was most liuely set forth and in no place like, the administration of affaires aswell publike as priuate) hath hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been depriued of his name and dignitie, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably vnregarded and neglected, so that to this day, we haue had neither vse nor commoditie of
<pb n="7" facs="8"/>
it. So much hath the rashnes and ignoraunce of some men been able to do. Wherfore our first la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour shalbe to hold fast the certeine scope &amp; intēt of the booke, what it requireth and whereto it tendeth. For if we hereof be ignoraunt, it shall be impossible to vnderstand the style and phrase in the same.</p>
      <p>The meaning therefore and summe of thys booke is,<note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this booke.</note> that Salomon wyll haue vs to be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted and setled in our mynde, that in all occurrē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and chaunces of thys lyfe, we should liue cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented wyth our present estate, wythout care &amp; desire of thynges to come, as Paul sayth: liuing wythout carefulnes, because vayne is the desire of future thyngs. Salomon gathereth by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne perpetuall and cōtynued induction of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thynges, that mens deuises and enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are friuolous and vayne, so that of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, makyng a generall conclusion, he prooueth that all mens deuises are vayne. For he sayth y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>: to get lyuyng &amp; riches, it helpeth not to be wise, to runne fast, it auayleth not to be swift, to gette the victory, it booteth not to be strong: yea, the wyser, the holyer, the more laborious a man is, the lesse he preuayleth: so that as well his wys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as his righteousnes and workes are of no strength or force. So that if neyther these nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other thynges be of force, then of necessitie must all thynges be vayne and forceles.</p>
      <p>But here in the begynning must we roote out an errour and noysome opynion that many men haue, namely,<note place="margin">The errour of them cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed which condemne Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> that we thynke not Salomō to speake of the contempt of creatures which the scripture wyll not suffer to be contemned or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. For all thynges which God created are very good, and made for the vse of man, which thyng, Paule in playne wordes affirmeth.
<pb facs="9"/>
1.<note place="margin">The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God are good.</note>
         <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. saying: <hi>Euery creature of God is good, and nothyng is to be reiected, that is receaued wyth thankes geeuyng. For it is sanctified by the word of God, &amp; by prayer.</hi> It is therefore very foolyshly &amp; wyckedly done of some preachers, to enuey agaynst glory, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, dignitie, riches, golde, fame, beuty, women, playnely condemning the creatures of God. A Magistrate or officer, is an ordinaunce of God. Golde is good, and ryches are the gyfte of God. A womā is a good thing, and made to be an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto man. For God made all thyngs, to the ende they shoulde bee good and profitable some way to man.<note place="margin">The abuse of Gods creatures, &amp; naughty affections of men are condemned in this booke.</note> Therefore the creatures of God are not cōdemned by this booke, but the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affection and desier of men, which are not cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented wyth these present creatures of God, and the vse of them, but are alway carefull how to heape vp ryches, to get honour, glory, and great name, as though they should alway lyue in thys world, lothyng still their present state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and wyshing, and aspyring to one thyng after an other. For thys is a great vanitie and misery, that a man should defraude and byguyle hymselfe of the vse of such pleasures as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hym, and vaynely to vexe and disquiet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe about thyngs he hath not. These naughty affections (I say) and enterprises of men doth Salomon in thys booke condemne, and not the creatures themselues: For touching the vse of these creatures, hee hymselfe sayth hereafter: <hi>There is nothyng better then to be meary in thys life, and to eate and drinke, and man to reigne in his labour. &amp;c.</hi> where he shoulde be founde vtterly agaynst hymselfe, if he shoulde condemne the thynges, and not rather the abuse
<pb n="8" facs="9"/>
of them, which is onely in our affections.<note place="margin">The errour of them that vnderstand not this booke.</note> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne foolishe men, not perceiuyng these thyngs, haue taught vs absurde opinions about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and forsakyng of the worlde, and haue themselues comitted many absurde thynges, as we read in the liues of the fathers, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> there were some which would not looke vpon the Sunne, (beyng worthy doubtles to haue had their eyes put out) and lyued most filthely and slouenly, because they would seem religious: which thing what we may iudge of it, appeareth playnely by that is sayd before. For it is but a sory contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the worlde, to lyue solitarily, and out of the company of men. It is no contempt of golde to cast it away, or to absteyne from touchyng of money, as dyd the Franciscanes: but he in deede contemneth it that vsing it euery day, is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away wyth the greedy desier of it. Thys therfore is the principall thyng that they shoulde cōsider which will read thys booke of Salomō.</p>
      <p>Farthermore,<note place="margin">What thyngs <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth in this booke.</note> this also is diligently to bee obserued, that Salomon in this booke spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth onely of mankynde, and keepeth hymselfe within the bondes of mans nature, that is, of mans enterprises, deuises, desiers, and counsayles, least perhappes wee may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the same that the interpreters of this booke doe, which thynke the knowledge of nature, the studies of astronomy and all philosophy, are here dispised, as vayne and vnprofitable speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereas the commodities of these sciences are great and manifolde, as dayly we see before our faces. Besides that in searching out the groundes and causes of thynges naturall, there is aswell great pleasure as profit. And the holy Scripture proponeth diuers thynges, to teach vs the properties and vertues of them, such as
<pb facs="10"/>
is thys in the Psalme: <hi>He maketh thee young and lusty like an Egle.</hi> Againe: <hi>Like as the Egle that prouoketh her young ones to flye.</hi> Againe: <hi>As the hart desireth the water springs and soyle.</hi> And: <hi>Go sluggish body to the Emmet and Pismere.</hi> Yea the scriptures are full of such metaphores and similitudes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of nature, so that he that should take thē out of the holy Byble, shoulde take therewith much lyght from it also.</p>
      <p>
         <note place="margin">What the matter and content of this booke is.</note>To be plaine therfore, the subiect and matter of the booke is, that mankynde is so foolish, that he desireth and searcheth after his owne wayes many thynges which he can not compasse and bryng to passe, or if he bring them to passe, he can not enioy them, but possesseth them with care &amp; losse, not thorough any fault in the thynges, but by reason of his most foolishe affectiōs &amp; desiers. Iulius Cesar was greatly occupyed to obteine the Empyre of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Romaynes, but what perils &amp; trauels susteyned he before he could get it?<note place="margin">What the affectiōs of man are.</note> And hauing gottē it, he was not yet quiet, he had not bys whole wyshe, but while he was carefully busied to clyme yet higher, hee perished most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably. The same cōmeth to passe in all worldly affaires, whē we haue greatest wealth, straight way, we lyke not with it. If we want &amp; lacke, we are neuer quiet &amp; at rest for desire of it. This vice of mans nature and inclination saw y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> heathē writers. For thus sayth Ouide:
<q>
            <l>That lawfull is, we loth, and like</l>
            <l>the thinges we are forbid to doe:</l>
            <l>That foloweth vs, we flee, and seeke</l>
            <l>to follow that, that flees vs fro.</l>
         </q>
Againe:
<q>
            <pb n="9" facs="10"/>
            <l>The present state doth no man please,</l>
            <l>Vpon his owne to liue at ease.</l>
         </q>
      </p>
      <p>This is the vanitie of mans hart,<note place="margin">The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of this booke is, to vse our goods with thankes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng.</note> neuer to be content with Gods present blessings, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise them, seeking still one thyng after other, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer content till he haue gotten his desire: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng once gotten it, nothing regarding it, but still deuising some other wayes.</p>
      <p>Therfore to repeat againe my saying, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scope and end of this booke is to teach vs to vse Gods present benefits &amp; creatures which he boūtiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bestoweth vpon vs with thākesgeuing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out carefulnes, &amp; hereafter, to the entent our hart may be quiet setled, and merry, beyng content wyth Gods worde and workyng. So in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters folowing, he exhorteth vs, <hi>to eate and drinke with the wife of thy youth, &amp; not to want oyle for our head, but to haue our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments white,</hi> according to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> saying of Christ: <hi>Sufficient to the day is the trauell and care therof.</hi> And as <hi>Paul</hi> saith: <hi>taking no thought for the fleshe, to fulfill the lustes of it.</hi> And if a man woulde followe this trade, hys mynde would still be quietly setled, and God would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly prouide vs of all thynges. And now men vexe and disquiet themselues with two mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, namely, while they depriue themselues of the vse of thynges present, and trouble &amp; vexe thēselues with care of things absent. Or if they haue any vse of their goods, it is but bitter &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasaunt. Cicero that great eloquent man, had beene maruelous happy, if he had knowen well how to haue vsed this quietnes, but the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man desirous still of higher aduauncement, &amp; to set forward his owne wayes &amp; deuises, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="11"/>
himselfe of many great bēnefites, and was the cause of his owne calamitie and destruction. Well,<note place="margin">S. Augustines <hi>saying.</hi>
         </note> therfore doth <hi>S. Augustine</hi> say: <hi>Thou hast appointed (O lord) that that man, which is not contented with his owne estate and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, shal haue a vexed &amp; troubled minde, for his punishment.</hi>
      </p>

         <note place="margin">The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mās nature and miserie of mans affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>And if a man would compare the goodes that he hath, with the euils, that he hath not, he should at length perceaue, what a treasure of goodes he possessed. He that hath his eye sight cleare and good, maketh no great accompt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, nor is not much delighted with Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, but if he wanted eyes, he would giue all the goodes he had to haue them. Thus fare we in health, &amp; all other lyke thynges. If God would giue me the eloquēce that Cicero had, the power of Cesar, the wisedome of Salomon, yet should I not be contented. Bycause we alwayes seeke after y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we haue not. If we lack a wife we seeke for one. When we haue her, we lothe and despise her. We be all together lyke vnto quickesiluer, which in no place can stand still in rest. So incon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stant is the mynde of mā, being therfore vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to enioy any one of Gods benefites.</p>
