      <hi>on, first to reads, and then to iudge.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may be there are some will thinke it strange that a man of my profession should deale in these causes: Vnbefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (they will say) for a souldier to meddle with all. But if there be any such who doth not know it to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any man that is a Christian, and truly prosessing Christ (of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer calling otherwise he be) may not indeuour himselfe for the glory of God, or the aduancement of the Gospell; I will rather pray for that man, then take vpon me to answere him. The matter that I haue vndertakē, is to discouer the Pope, to make him knowne, and so to lay him open to the viewe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery discreete reader, that he might no longer deceiue that he that is not wilfully blinde may be made able to discerne betweene light and darkenesse, to iudge of trueth &amp; false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to knowe the voyce of Christ calling to saluation, and to shune the waies of <hi>Antichrist</hi> leading to destruction that this rablement of Iesuites &amp; Seminaryes, and the rest of that viperous brood, shold not be so easily able to seduce, that haue already sobewitched &amp; infected that infortunate country of Ireland, that ignorance is ioyned with obstynacy, that blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is coupled with malice, that wilfull opinion is holden for the testimony of a good conscience, where he that is most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, is accounted for most Catholique, &amp; to conclude, where Christ is despised, and Antichrist is aduanced.</p>
   <p>To the end therefore that this man of sin, this Antichrist I
<pb facs="6"/>
meane (that hath beene so often spoken of, and so long looked for) might be discerned, I have gathered together what notes the holy scriptures do testifiy of him, what markes are there left vnto vs whereby we may knowe him, what pathes he should tread out, and what waies he should walke, whose steppes I haue vndertaken, and followed the tract directly to Rome, I haue brought it to saynt <hi>Peters</hi> chayre (as some would haue it called, and there I haue left it. Now according to the Irish custome, when a Health is cōmitted, and the tract being followed into any part or quarter off the Country, the Lord of that place is either to put it off againe from out of his precinct, or else to stand charged with the fact, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to make a full restitution: thē according to this custome, the tract of Antichrist being brought to Rome, they must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put it off againe from out the territories, and make good proofe into what iurisdiction they haue brought it, or else that holy seate which they say in times past hath been Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, is now become the seate of Antichrist, and the Pope is to answere for as much as the word of God doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly charge him with, that is to say, of Treason, of murther and of theft.</p>
   <p>First of Treason against the most Highest whose lawes, couenants seales and sacraments, he hath not only clipped, counterfeited, chopped and changed▪ but he hath also set vp other Gods of his owne making, which he causeth to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped honoured and adored.</p>
   <p>For a murtherer, who hath euer heard of a more cruell and mercilesse butcher, aswell against the Saints and seruants of God whom he persecuteth with sword, with fire and with all maner of tortures, wherewith hee tormenteth them to a temporall death, but likewise sendeth infinite thousands of the miserable soules (that doe assie and trust in him) with
<pb facs="7"/>
his Indulgences, Bulles and pardons, to eternall death &amp; da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
   <p>Now for felony, what more notable theft then to rob God of that glory that is proper to himselfe? and yet not contented with that, but he hathrobbed vs of the holy scriptures left vnto vs by the holy Ghost to be our comfort &amp; sauing health, &amp; wherin we are to search the very mysterie of our saluatiō. Our sauiour sent the Scribs and Pharises to search the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures though they were but hypocrites, and sought dayly to erucify Christ, but the Pope forbiddeth Christian men once to looke on them, though they be baptized and haue receiued Christ.</p>
   <p>Are the scriptures medicynable to the bad, and vehemous to the good? and more perylous to him that will belieue in Christ, then to him that will crucify Christ?</p>
   <p>They vaunted of their father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and their sitting in <hi>Moses</hi> chayre, as the papist doth now of his holy father the Pope, and his sitting in <hi>Peters</hi> chayre: yet Christ pronounced woe against them for shutting vp the key of knowledge, which was by giuing a false sense, by wrong interpreting the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but it is not found that they prohibited or forbad any man to read thē, as the Pope &amp; his shauelings are accustomed.</p>
   <p>What I haue iudeuoured herein, I haue done it in compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for if there be any commiseration to be had of those that walke in darkenesse, and sit in the shadowe of death▪ the poore people of Ireland are to be pittied; and not onely they alone, but as many other, what, or whersoeuer, that are thus seduced and blinded by the ministers of the Prince of darkenesse.</p>
   <p>If thou with like fauour and curtesie will vouchsafe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use it as I haue honestly ment it, censure it then &amp; spare not: &amp; thus reposing my selfe on thy charitable disposition, I rest.</p>
