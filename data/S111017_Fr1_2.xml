      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there haue risen vp in the Church from time to time false Prophets &amp; teachers, <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 1.</note> which oppose them selues to the holye Prophets of God, and true teachers of his worde: so among the people where such contrarietie of doctrines hath bene deliuered, like contrarietie of hearers hath alwayes followed, not onely in iudgement, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in their affection. For as some through the mercie of God and the sincere preaching of the Gospel, haue yeelded obedience to his worde: so many, caried away with corrupt teachers, haue for want of iudgement embraced errour in place of trueth, and carnall worshippings, in steade of the pure worship of God, which euermore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth <note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 24.</note> in spirit and trueth. Against this so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous infection of false teachers, the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Saint Iohn hath giuen vs a most wholesome counterpoyson: willing vs not to beleeue euery spirit, but to trie and examin the spirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4. 1.</note> they be of God. But (to speake of our times) this examination and trial may seeme very hard, seeing the teachers on both sides are thought learned, and al pretend to teach the trueth. For, it is not denyed but both sides haue had their education in schooles of learning, they haue also laboured in the liberall artes, to furnish them selues to greater matters: wherupō they al bring very good words, some shewe of reason, &amp; seeme to haue no small force of perswasion. Howe then shall the simple people iudge, howe shal they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, whose iudgement and discretion should be framed by their teachers, and setled by their
<pb facs="3"/>
sownd, and plaine doctrine? To this I answere, S. Iohn in that place maketh the matter more easy then it appeareth at the first shewe. For, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting vs not to beleeue euery spirit, he doeth drawe our consideration to the spirit and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the teachers, and not to these outwarde giftes of an eloquent stile, or a sweete sownde of pleasing wordes, which may be common to good and euil: yea wherein the euil, for want of a good cause labour to excell, and from which the godly absteine for the sufficiencie of their cause with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, &amp; are also restrayned, lest our faith should stande in the wisedome of men, and not in the <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 5.</note> power of God. But Saint Iohn, to make this his trial of spirits yet more ful &amp; plaine, addeth, that euery spirit which confesseth Christ Iesus to haue <note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4. 2.</note> come in the fleshe, is of God, and euery spirit which confesseth otherwise, is of Antichrist. Now therefore, let vs see bowe the Apostle frameth vs to a spirit of discretion, to discerne the spirits of true and false teachers. If any man shall teach and consesse that Christ was made man, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned of God the Father a Prophet, alone to teach: a King, alone to rule: and a Priest, alone to sanctifie vs, and to reconcile vs to his Father by the obedience of faith, this confession and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is of the holy spirit of God, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, what spirit soeuer shall mightily or cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly perswade the contrary. On the other side, if any spirit shall teach that Christ is not our only teacher by his holy Gospel, but that we must admit vnwritten beleefe and traditions, from we know not whom, to be of like authoritie with the written worde: secondly, if any spirit make not Christ alone our King and head to rule vs by his holy spirit, but teache that a mortall and sinfull
<pb facs="3"/>
man must sit in our consciences, and for hatred or gaine (which is his practise) bynde or loose at his pleasure: lastly, if any spirit impeach the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiencie and entier vertue of Christs sacrifice offered vp once for euer, &amp; teach that themselues must renforce it from day to day by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 27. &amp; 9. 12. 26. 28. &amp; 10. 10.</note> of their dayly sacrifice of the Masse, offered for the quick &amp; dead: it appeareth manifestly, that such spirits are not of God, nor their doctrine to be receiued, though it be deliuered with neuer so much perswasion of eloquent speach, or offered to vs with neuer so much expectation of worldly honour. For, to denie the most absolute vertue and effects of Christes offices, is in effect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the authoritie of his person, and to lose the benefite of all his graces, because they withdrawe a part. To this examination of spirits, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of persons, the godly Reader is to be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For the doctrine that giueth al glorie to God, is of God: the doctrine that attributeth some glory and ascribeth some merites to man, is of men: the religion also that is agreeable to flesh and blood, making an acceptable sounde and shewe to the outward senses, is carnall and vayne: finally, what religion so euer is not ioyned with the knowledge and exercises of the worde of God, that is no true religion, but a disguised and blinde maske full of deuilish superstition. The aduersaries take a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary course in making triall of their doctrine: for they woulde haue this examination of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits vtterly suppressed, and vnder one title of that falsly named Catholique Church of Rome, they would bind all men to receiue for vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted true religion what corruptions so euer they teach, without any further question. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graunted them, the examination of spirits
<pb facs="4"/>
neede not: for if Rome affirme it, the matter is sufficient and must not be denied. Also these ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the trueth leaue the touchstone, which tryeth al metalles, namely the doctrine, and for it they drawe the teachers into examination: sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that if they can discredit or disgrace the men, they shall easily vndermine and ouerthrowe their doctrine. For triall of this long practise, there are so many bookes, that I neede not alleadge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but this late Censure written as in defence of popish religion: but the authour shifting his hands very cunningly of the direct and plaine mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the questions in controuersie, doth but offer at them, or giue some false fire: his leauell and batterie is against their persons and credit, that maynteining the trueth, cannot but assaile the doctrines, and put in hazarde the authoritie of the popish Church.</p>
   <p>Therefore I am in the name of the trueth to craue it of the good Reader, to lay aside respect of men, &amp; the regard of those giftes that may please him much; and deceiue him more: and if it be his desire, not so much to see the fight, as to beholde the issue &amp; enioy the victory: then let him imbrace that doctrine most, that attributeth least to the broken arme, or blinde iudgement of man, that in the Church al the power and wisedome of our saluation may be ascribed to God alone, through Christ Iesus our Lorde.</p>
