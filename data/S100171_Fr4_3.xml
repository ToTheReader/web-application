                 <title>Christian offices crystall glasse : In three bookes. First written in Latine, by that famous and renowned Father, Saint Ambrose Bishop of Millane. Whereunto is added his conuiction of Symmachus the Gentile. A worke tending to the advancement of vertue, and of holinesse: and to shew how much the morality of the Gentiles, is exceeded by the doctrine of Christianity.

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heir authoritie is next to the sacred scriptures, and they are expositors of them giving great light to them, neither are their interpretations, and commentaries of small strength, and worth to perswade, that what sense they giue of them should not bee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
   <p n="2">2. Their writings afford us a true chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie of the times, how they haue passed what hath beene done in each severall age, what doctrines haue beene maintained for orthodox, what rejected as erroneous, and hereticall.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Their sweete and pithy sentences are of invaluable weight, proceeding from the profoundest iudgement, and rarest invention, conceived not with humane wit, but by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, which appeares by this, that none in our dayes can attaine to the like excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency therein.</p>
   <p n="4">4. No examples of holy life bee found since the Apostles comparable to theirs for
<pb facs="208"/> devout prayer, fasting, charitie, care of the flocke commited to them, courage for the convincing of error arising in the Church, beating downe sinne with the due punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, by their good discipline joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with decent order, and reverend go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement.</p>
   <p n="5">5. The synods or Councels were called but they were assigned to be speakers, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents, cheife pillers, and compilers of what soever therein was acted, and effected.</p>
   <p n="6">6. The translating of them is a meanes to bring them out of the dust, and darke cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners wherein they lye rotting, and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with moths, and to set a new coate, and flourish vpon them, to reviue their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed memory, to honour them, and to give them their deserved comendation, more narrowly to sift out their true tenets, and to discover their frailties: the one being a good marke for imitation, the other for devitation.</p>

This willbe as a spurre to stirre vp to the reading of them, and to examine how that which is translated accordeth with the originall, will make them more familiar, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowne, bring them more easily to hand, to more frequent, and certtaine vse.</p>
   <p n="8">8. It hath beene accustomed in all ages to translate them, and if the <hi>Greeke</hi> fathers might be turned into the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, why might not the <hi>Latine</hi> into other Languages? <hi>Pisanus Burgandio</hi> presented as a worthy
<pb facs="208"/> peice of worke to the councell of Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> the homilies of Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> translated into <hi>Latine</hi> vpon the Gos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel of the Evangelist <hi>Iohn,</hi> and said that hee had done the like in a great part of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies vpon <hi>Genesis,</hi> not one of all the <hi>Greeke</hi> Fathers beside, but hath beene translated.</p>
   <p n="9">9. They which take not that course, yet what they commit to writing as their owne they extract out of their workes, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> did his Ecclesiasticall history out of that famous library, which Bishop <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had erected in <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>

Many humanity bookes are extant in our tongue, as <hi>Plutarchs</hi> liues, <hi>Plinie, Homer Ovids Metamorphosis, Persius,</hi> with others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most innumerable in our, and transmarine languages. Now can it be held as profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a common weale, that the thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of humane authors should be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that divine writers of an inferiour ranke,
<pb facs="209"/> and no way worthy to be compared with the ancient Fathers, should be a thing beneficiall to the Church of God, and not of them? What is objected to the contray is of no weight, as that thereby the common people shall be prompt in them as our selves. For we ought rather to be of <hi>Moses</hi> meeke and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving disposition, who <hi>hearing that Eldad, and Medad prophesied in the host, wished that all the</hi>

      <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> so let us the Fathers into our speech. For it is not simply the words of the sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that make for our salvation, but the sence, which where is it better given then by the fathers? Grant the one therefore, then of necessity the other must bee admitted. It is a thing commonly received as from anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that <hi>Ezra</hi> the Scribe invented the pricks for the more facile reading of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> and that afterward some other divided the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible into chapters, and that <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Langton</hi>

   <p>Tendernesse of conscience is another ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</p>
   <p>The Fathers may be by this meanes mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construed, and corrupted.

In both these respects was necessary remorse of conscience not any

Concerning<note n="f" place="margin">In translating the same sense. not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes easily kept: and that according to St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> confession.
