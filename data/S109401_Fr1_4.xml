   <head>TO
ALL THE KINGS
FAITHFVL SVBIECTS,
and principally to those Catholikes,
that are desirous of the quiet of the
Church and State.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are now thirty yeeres and more
(at seuerall times) since we haue had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
warres with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> as with
Rebels and Heretikes; though we haue
perceiued of late, that our former opinion
was wrongfully conceiued against them: and we may
be also mistaken in the latter; and that time, which hath
made it appeare, that they are not Rebels, may discouer
likewise vnto vs that they are not Heretikes. But howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
it were much to be wished in the meane time, that
we would entertaine a charitable conceit of them, till
there be more euidence giuen in against them.</p>
   <p>The bitter dissention in Religion, hath beene the
spring-head of all our miseries. That was it, which
brought them forth at first, and which yet nurseth them:
whence it is now come to passe, that those men who are
<pb facs="5"/>
at this present, disturbers of the State, haue at the very
selfe-same time begun to raise tumults in the Realme,
and to reviue and exasperate the differences which we
haue in Religion: In such fashion, as that the practises of
the principall Leaguers, and the turbulent Sermons of
diuers Preachers (for I blame not all) haue beene (as it
were) <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twins, who went alwaies together,
laught alwaies together; and it may chance, that these
also may weepe together: and we haue seene the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of it, that the tongues of the one haue done more
mischiefe than the swords of the other.</p>
   <p>See the cause then, why in the beginning of these late
troubles, the Catholike Apologie hath laboured to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
this heat, and to confute the slanders giuen out
against the Reformed Religion, and those of it. Which
Apologie hath beene in part refuted, but so coldly, that
no proofes which the Confuter produceth, could make
me see any reason, why we should so peremptorily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the <hi>Huguenots</hi> for Heretikes, although differing
from vs, about the explication of some points of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Vpon which I was induced a yeere since &amp; more,
to answer the Reasons aforesaid. But finding the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to be of great weight, I iudged it fitter to write a
iust Treatise thereof by it selfe, than to answer the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
hudled vp together by another man: which hath
caused mee also both to suppresse that which I had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
already, and to defer that which I purposed to write.
And longer I suppose I had deferred it, if these late Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies
acted in the murthers of our two last Kings,<note place="margin">Henry 3.</note> had
not put me in the conceit of it,<note place="margin">Henry 4.</note> how that these horrid
Acts sprung from the selfe-same fountaine, and that
only vpon this ground too, namely, <hi>That the Errours of
<pb facs="5"/>
the Huguenots are so exceedingly enormous;</hi> they found
their <hi>Maximes,</hi> by which they perswade themselues;
That a man may take any course lawfull or vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
to destroy them and their fauourers.</p>
   <p>Another motiue I also had, which induced me to
proceed in my purpose of writing. Which was the
consideration of the fortunate proceedings of our
late King HENRY (whom his enemies made to be
called, Great) all the time that he continued Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant:
Then whose troubles we need seeke no further
example, to shew how God both dislikes mans blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
courses, and disposes also of his owne procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
his owne way. For God neuer produces any
extraordinary euent, without some extraordinary
Designe. But how extraordinarily God in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
fauoured his Maiestie, whiles he continued Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,
none knowes so well as his enemies, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as God made vse of their courses, for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement.
They conceited it, that by embroyling
<hi>France</hi> in Ciuill warres, to haue ruined him; and these
warres haue increased his honour and power. They,
impatient of delayes, thought presently by vniustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
practises, to haue vrged the late King<note n="a" place="margin">Henry 3.</note> to haue
prosecuted him with more violence, than he had done
heretofore; and these plots of theirs, haue been both
the causes of the vtter ruine of his enemies, and of his
reconcilement to the King. Briefly, his enemies thrust
Armes into his hands for their owne destructions:
and those deuices by which they had thought to
haue chased him out of <hi>Guyen,</hi> haue brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heart of <hi>France;</hi> and by the selfe-same meanes
whereby they thought to take away his life, they haue
<pb facs="6"/>
giuen him the Kingdome. May wee imagine that
God had no designe, in the bringing about of these
purposes? Or what else may wee gather out of all
this; but that God is angry, when we will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to dispose of his owne Church, his owne
way, but deuise to preuent him by our owne wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes?
For which respect, I protest before God, that
had I beene the sorest enemy that the King had had,
yet should I thinke that for no other reason God had
so many wayes fauoured him, than to punish vs, who
by vniustifiable practises out of an impatient zeale,
would haue rooted out the Reformed Religion,
though erroneous.</p>
   <p>Haply then it may fall out, that if wee alter our
courses, God will also change his. And as those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
of ours, by which we verily thought to haue
aduanced our Religion haue hindred it: So God also
may turne the same meanes which we feared would
hinder our Religion, to the aduancement of it. In the
meane time let vs know thus much; That God neuer
blesses those mens courses, which thinke to anticipate
him through impatience. Let vs then haue patience
a while; and when wee shall perceiue the times of
peace to be fittest for our purposes, let vs (a Gods
name) offer the same conditions vnto the <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
which they propounded vnto vs before; which was,
to assemble the best learned men in both Religions,
to discusse friendly the points in controuersie; to the
end, that the quiet of the Common-wealth, may goe
along with that of the Church: which if the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi>
shall accept of, (as I make no doubt but they
will) I perswade my selfe, that there may be such a
<pb facs="6"/>
course taken in the Conference, that discouery may
be made of many things, which haue beene concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
hitherto from both of vs. Not that I imagine any
noueltie can be found out in Religion, (God forbid
that I should euer thinke so) but that the meaner
questions in controuersie, being reconciled, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
ones omitted, the greater may be insisted
vpon, to be cleared by more euident demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
   <p>Nor can either partie (considering the points be
already sufficiently discussed) imagine that such a
conference would be vnprofitable; for although
there can hardly be found more solid Arguments,
than those wherewith we haue serued our selues here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore;
yet is it one thing to proue, and another thing
to satisfie: now wee must not so much maintaine a
side, to vanquish; as to winne those that are in the
wrong. And thus much I dare say, and I will be able
to make good against any contradiction; that neither
partie, haue in any conference as yet taken that
course, which they ought and might haue followed,
for the satisfaction of the aduerse partie, and the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of doubts.</p>
   <p>For mine owne part, though I be the meanest of a
Million, who haue embroyled themselues in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
of the time, yet dare I vndertake to reduce the
points in controuersie to so short an issue, and to set
downe such a course for the handling thereof; that
more of the truth shall be discouered in this one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
than in all the other disputes, which haue
beene since <hi>Martin Luther</hi> first opposed himselfe
against the Pope. For both the issue shall bee so
<pb facs="7"/>
drawne, and the meanes so disposed of; that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of neither Religion (keeping themselues to
their owne proper <hi>Maximes</hi>) shall be able to reiect
them. I should be too impudent to giue it out, if I
were not well assured of my abilitie for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
But I am acquainted well enough with the
euasions of either side, I know their fallacies, and I
haue also the Art to preuent them.</p>
   <p>But the time seemes not to be yet so fit, for wee
must haue our spirits quiet, as well as our State; and
aboue all, free from that same preiudication. For
if we <hi>Catholikes</hi> come to a Disputation, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
before hand, that the <hi>Huguenots</hi> are already
condemned for Heretikes: And they on the other
side, that they vnderstand the Scriptures better than
<hi>S. Austin,</hi> and that all is cleare on their side; to what
purpose serues such a Conference? The Priests and
Ministers may seeme as confident as they please, for
they are our Teachers; but we should not be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
for we are but Learners. The end which they
propose, is the Victorie; but the end which we seeke
for, is the Truth. Which if wee haue found, why
looke we further? But if we beleeue without search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we may very well be deceiued.</p>
   <p>The chiefe reason then, which induced me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assume
my designe of writing in this point of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
was; that our spirits being something paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
wee might be the better prepared to a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and in that Conference make discouery of the
Truth; and by discouery of the Truth, establish
a Peace in the Church of God. But I suspecting mine
owne insufficiencie, and fearing withall to bestow
<pb facs="7"/>
my labour in vaine: and on the other side, being
wondrously desirous to see an vnion in Religion, I
chose rather to hazard that paines which I had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
taken, in publishing that answer which I had
made before, than to lose a new.</p>
   <p>The reason then why I that am a <hi>Catholike,</hi> doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blame the rigour of ours against the <hi>Huguenots,</hi>
than theirs against vs (both parties being faulty much
alike) is; because he that would reforme another, must
begin at himselfe.</p>
   <p>The importunitie and arrogancie of mine Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie,
vrges me sometimes to write not so like a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,</hi>
which I doe not purposely to confute the
<hi>Catholike Religion:</hi> but to shew only; That the errors
of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> are not so grosse, as our side per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
themselues they are. And knowing also that
no one thing hath more suppressed the Truth, than
the meane esteeme that the one partie hath of the
others Arguments. Which (God knowes) is meerly
out of ignorance; forsomuch as the deeper learned
any man is, the more difficultie he finds in confuting
his Aduersarie. For it is most certaine, that <hi>Ignorance</hi>
engenders <hi>Vehemencie,</hi> and <hi>Vehemencie</hi> blinds vs from
discouering the Truth. For their ignorance that are
in the rights, makes those likewise the more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that are in the errour; and the ignorance of
those that are in errour, blinds them the more.</p>
   <p>See then the true intent of this my Discourse:
wherein though I may perchance haue vsed some
Reasons, which in too rigorous a Iudgement, may
be esteemed with the most, in fauour of these new
opinions; yet is not my intent, with them to seduce
<pb facs="8"/>
any man, or to turne them from the Faith of their
forefathers, but only to purge their spirits from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudication
vntill further proofe be made. And if such
proofe be made (without which I conceiue no hope
of vnion in the Church) I adiure thee (beloued Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
of whether Religion soeuer thou beest) to come
with a spirit void of this preiudication: Such a spirit
I wish to thee, as I protest I my selfe haue; and I pray
God to confirme in all of vs. <hi>Amen.</hi>
