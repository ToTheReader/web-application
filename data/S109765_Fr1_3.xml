      <p>
         <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Carnaruon,</hi> (so called because he was born at <hi>Carnaruon</hi> Castle in <hi>VVales)</hi> and sonne to King <hi>Edward</hi> the First, consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> and the policy vsed therein by King <hi>Edward</hi> the First.</p>
      <p>The creation of <hi>Edward,</hi> sirnamed the <hi>blacke Prince,</hi> to be Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> and the antient manner of the inuesture of the Princes of <hi>VVales.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>The strange limitation of the estate of the Lands of the said Principality, and the reasons
<pb facs="6"/>
thereof, and the difference betweene the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>VVales,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> for the eldest sonne and heire apparant of the King of <hi>England,</hi> is Duke of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> as soone as be is borne, or as soone as his father is King of <hi>England.</hi> But he is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Prince of <hi>VVales</hi> by a speciall creation, inuesture, and donation of the lands thereunto belonging, and not by birth.</p>
      <p>The yeerely value of the reuenues of the Principality of <hi>VVales,</hi> as the same were in the bands of the Prince, commonly called the <hi>blacke Prince.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>
         <hi>Richard</hi> sirnamed of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> sonne of the said <hi>blacke Prince,</hi> was after the death of his father, created Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> at <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering,</hi> at the Bower, in the Countie of <hi>Essex,</hi> by <hi>E</hi> 3. his Grandfather.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Munmouth,</hi> sonne to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, created Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> he was afterwards King, by the name of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fift.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Edward,</hi> the sonne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixt, created Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Chester,</hi> and for that hee was then very
<pb facs="6"/>
yong, there was ordained by an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what allowance should bee made vnto the said Prince for his Wardrobe, seruants wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and other necessary expences, vntill the said Prince should be of fourteene yeers of age.</p>
      <p>There was also a Counsaile of diuers ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable personages, as Bishops, Earles, and others for the gouernement and direction of the reuenues of the said Prince, which dispose the same accordingly, with the assent and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Queene, who was also especially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in that behalfe.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Edward,</hi> the sonne and heire apparant of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, created Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> and a Councell of honourable perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages allowed to him also for the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his reuenues, and the Lord <hi>Riuers,</hi> Vncle by the mothers side of the Prince, was appointed Gouernour of the Person of the said Prince.</p>
      <p>The creation of <hi>Arthure,</hi> sonne and heire apparant to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seuenth, to bee Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> the Copie of the Charter of that creation obserued for the forme and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of penning thereof, and the names of the
<pb facs="7"/>
Councellors that were assigned vnto him.</p>
      <p>After the death of Prince <hi>Arthure, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> his brother, who was afterwards King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, was created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> after whose time there are no Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters found of the creation of any Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> although King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixt, in the life of his Father, and Queene <hi>Mary</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the name of Prince generall: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why this discourse hitherunto is drawne after an historicall manner.</p>
      <p>
         <label>After the said historicall discourse.</label> Three things are further considered of, <hi>viz.</hi> First, in what manner and order the said Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie and Marches of <hi>Wales</hi> were gouerned and directed vnder the Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> as well before, as after the <hi>English</hi> Conquests thereof: wherein by the way are noted, the Courts of Iustice of the said principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> the originall of the Baronyes Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: and when the first Councell was establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the Marches of <hi>Wales</hi> vnto <hi>England,</hi> and in what manner the same was done, and the commodities ensuing thereof; which vnion or annexation may serue in some respect, as a
<pb facs="7"/>
president in other cases of like consequence.</p>
      <p>The second principall thing proposed, is the consideration of the antient and moderne Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the said principality, seruing the Lord <hi>Prince,</hi> and none others, and what fees and sallaries were allowed vnto them.</p>
      <p>The third principall matter is the present reuenues of the principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> as the same was in charge before the Auditors this last yeere past, <hi>viz.</hi> the fortie foure yeere of the late Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

      <p>The diuers kindes of Tynners and Tynne, and the coynage of Tynne is, and for what cause due and payable, and the priuiledges that the King and Duke of <hi>Cornewall</hi> haue in their preemption of Tynne.</p>

      <p>The reuenues of the said Dutchie of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> as it was in the fifteenth yeere of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight.</p>
