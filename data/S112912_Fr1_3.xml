                 <title>A full satisfaction concerning a double Romish iniquitie; hainous rebellion, and more then heathenish æquiuocation : Containing three parts: the two former belong to the reply vpon the Moderate Answerer; the first for confirmation of the discouerie in these two points, treason and æquiuocation: the second is a iustification of Protestants, touching the same points. The third part is a large discourse confuting the reasons and grounds of other priests, both in the case of rebellion, and æquiuocation. Published by authoritie</title>

   <head>TO THE SEDVCED Brethren, Grace and peace in Christ Iesus.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that I had discouered vnto you (my Brethren) the hainous positions of your Priests, there arose some one, I thinke, of that priesthood, entituling himselfe <hi>A moderate answerer;</hi> and me <hi>A slanderous and lying libeller:</hi> And why? <hi>Because the testimonies alledged</hi> (saith he) <hi>are falsly applied.</hi> For proofe of this, scarce exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining one of twentie, he commonly returneth this answer: <hi>If this</hi> (saith he) <hi>be the opinion of these Authors,</hi> or <hi>if these Authors write thus &amp;c.</hi> wilfully seating himselfe in the chaire of those Doctors, whom the Apostle hath descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: <note n="*" place="margin">1. Tim. 1. 7.</note>
      <hi>They will be Doctors, and yet vnderstand not what they say, nor whereof they affirme.</hi> To the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and manifest <note n="*" place="margin">In the 1 and 2. part.</note> proofes, I may now adde the <note n="*" place="margin">In the third part</note> Arguments of the same Priests for the defence of their discouered rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious conclusions. By what reason then can my <hi>Moderate Answerer</hi> charge me as <hi>slanderously</hi> misreporting that to be the doctrine of those Priests, which the Priests themselues by Reasons labour to confirme? Wherfore I perswade my self his intent in answering was not to answer, that is, to satisfie the iudicious: but onely to be thought to haue answered, that is, to delude the too credulous: like the answer which the priests of the Synagogue did prescribe, for repressing the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie of the resurrection of Christ out of the sepulcher, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>Whilest we slept his Disciples came and stole him away.</hi> Common sense might haue replied, How could you tell what was done when you were all asleepe? But minds enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the opinion of a neuer c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ing Priesthood (which confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Answer) could not possibly but erre with their Priests. Such, alas, is the case of all them, whom (because they will not seeke or see the truth) God in his iustce <note n="*" place="margin">2. Thess. 2. 11</note>
      <hi>Deliueteth vp to beleeue lies,</hi> as idle and fabulous as fancies and dreames of men <hi>asleepe.</hi> Of which kind be many of your ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reuelations: as that of the <hi>Deliuerance of the soule of Traian out of the lowest hell.</hi> Many lying priuiledges, as that temporall <hi>Donation of Constantine:</hi> and the other Ecclesiasticall forged <hi>Canon for Appeales to Rome.</hi> Many lying Traditions, as that <hi>Bodily assumption of the blessed Virgin into heauen.</hi> Many lying Saints, as that of <hi>Saint Christopher</hi> (except in a picture) neuer seene. Many lying Sanctities, as that of <hi>S. Francis in harboring of alouse.</hi> Many lying Histories, as the <hi>Goldē Legend,</hi> an abstract of a leaden braine. Many lying reports, as of the now <hi>Miracles</hi> among the <hi>Indians:</hi> to omit many lying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and reports; with infinite such other, which they call <hi>Piae fraudes,</hi> that is, <hi>godly cosinages:</hi> inuented to keepe the people in deuotion, and their priesthood in esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But that which excelleth all the rest in falshood, is their Aequiuocation, as being not onely alying Art, but also an Art of lying. This is now practised (as will be proued) in most detestable periuries for couert of the horrible treasons of their priesthood: teaching you to imitate the wisedome of the Ostrich; which bird, if she can but couer her head, thinketh all her bodie safe. Notwithstanding that Romish See, like to the <note n="*" place="margin">Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>Lying tongues, and hands that shedde bloud;</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">Esa. 59. 3.</note>
      <hi>Hands defiled with bloud, and tongues that speake lies:</hi> Such are their hands of Treason, and tongues of Aequiuocation. But hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a little, <note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 4.</note>
      <hi>In the last dayes</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>shall come perillous times, when men shall be voide of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, Traitors.</hi> All which we proue to be the expresse characters of your Priests. O but it may be thought that the Apostle doth not describe any that do such things with any religious intent, but onely desperate and profane miscreants, who make no conscience of sinne: not so: for in the next words the Apostle describeth the colour of their cloake: <note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5.</note>

Wherefore you are exhorted in the words following, <hi>Turne away from such.</hi> You should haue had this Reply two moneths ago, but that I was to adde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discourse of greater importance, which is contained in the third part.
