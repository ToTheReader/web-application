time vpon this Sermon, preached long since, yet freshly desired to bee published for their benefit, by diuers godly Learned, especially, for that our <hi>Antichristian Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries</hi> seemed much discontented, that their <hi>Pope</hi> should be arraigned and adiudged to bee that Great <hi>Antichrist</hi>; and themselues to be prooued so plainly <hi>Antichristian,</hi> euen open Rebels to Christ and Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereas (as they thinke) in the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique part, <hi>Andreas Eudaemon</hi> hath answered our obiections, and for the practique, their loyaltie is approoued in the sight of GOD and Man.</p>
   <p>Indeed this Argument is the very roote of all the differences betweene them and vs, vpon which, after so many Great Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, I doe not presume to deliuer more then hath beene said, but only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh the Memories of the Learned, with a new Method of olde matters; both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying vpon <hi>Eudaemon,</hi> where he seemeth to presse, and explayning the miserie of our enslaued Countrymen vnder the <hi>Pope.</hi>
