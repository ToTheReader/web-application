      <hi>George Baker,</hi> in commendation of the Author.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst all the heynous offences that euer were, none were in time past so sharply punished, nor more strayter lawes made, then for ingratitude: and in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nothing can more grieue an honest mind (especially where good is deserued) then to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenst with euill. I doo not thinke that this booke can passe cleane away with the good liking of euery one, but that it will drinke of the same enuious cup, that other famous workes heretofore haue done. I could rehearse a number that haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned thereof, whose eternall fame shall neuer be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished. The Author of this treatise, his good and zelous intent, and sufficiencie in his profession, I knowe to be such, as deserueth well. His willing and godly mind to do his countrie good, (not only this booke) but also many people both rich and poore that haue already receyued helpe at his hands, can and will testifie the same. This which he hath written is no new inuention, but the ground thereof allowed, both of auntient and later writers: and besides he hath considered that in euery place a good Phisition is not to be gotten at all times, so that the partie infected may be dead before any such helpe can be had, (yea) and the most part of the best of them will not hazard them selues in so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an enterprise: he considering the same, hath heere taught the most easye and approued medicines, with
<pb facs="6"/>
the whole order of the cure, not only for such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, but also haue to preserue them that are sounde. What doth he deserue that thus hath done, let the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort iudge: for the rest, I thinke if either they haue the feare of God, any sparke of honestie, or iudgement in any thing, they will for shame hold their peace, least their ignorance and hatred bewray their folly, and so deserue the same punishment which the wisest sort haue alreadie set downe, which I hope none will so wilfully hazard to incurre. Now, considering his zealous intent, it is the part of euery good minde, to encourage him in so godly, and good an enterprise, whereby others may be anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do the like: and therefore considering the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the matter, and necessitie of the cause, the whole common wealth is to embrace him, who lookes but only for a thankefull acceptance in lewe of his trauell, which is the least may be yelded him. Farewell. From my chamber at the Court this 6. of Aprill. 1593.</p>
