   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T said of <hi>Diogenes</hi> that <hi>Cynicke</hi> Philosopher, that being well stricken in yeeres, hee should now betake himselfe to his rest and ease: hee replied, that it did not become one that was running a race, to intermit or slacke his pace, the neerer especially he drew to the end thereof. The like may I in some sort say of my selfe, who have for these many yeeres past, not hid my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in a napkin, keeping within mine owne breast that knowledge I had both in the Vniversity, and by many yeeres experience acquired in the profession of Physicke: but have, not onely by my practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call imployment endevoured to bee profitable to this present age and place wherein I live; but also to propagate some directions to posterity, for leading a more comfortable life both in sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and in health. Of late yeeres therefore as my other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did permit, I set upon this taske which I now present unto the view of the world. But because whosoever in this last and literate age of the world steppeth forth upon this publicke stage exposeth himselfe to the sharpe censures of as many different hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, as were that Lyricke Poets guests; it hath beene therefore a common custome for such as undertake such taskes, to make choice of some noble and vertuous Patron to protect them from the virulent and venomous tongues and obtrectations of envious and
<pb facs="3"/>
malevolent persons. And therefore casting mine eyes about this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mispheare, and thinking on many, my thoughts could rest no where, untill such time as I pitched upon your Honourable Person. Motives to induce mee hereunto I found divers; First, your eminent place in the publike, being installed in the state chaire of higher Honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ordinary Gentry. And here have I a large field afforded mee to expatiate into, to wit, the honour of this noble family, and in what esteene it hath beene during the reigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but especially during the reigne of King <hi>Iames,</hi> of famous memory, in what esteeme hee had it, and to what eminencie hee hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the same, is yet recent in the mindes of most men now living; and how his Majesty now reigning, hath nothing diminished, but rather increased these former favours and honours, without my relation is well enough knowne, both in court and countrie. It were easie for mee also to discourse of the many honourable houses wherewith this noble family hath matched, having been by marrriage allied to many great houses of this kingdome. But because I know your Honour is not delighed with such panegyricks of your owne praises, I will passe over these and many other things might be said: besides that all these outward ornaments and prerogatives, how great and glorious sover, yet are nor permanent, but perish; and the wise-man, who both by reason of the extent of his wisedome and understanding, together with the abundance of wealth, had atteined to as high a pitch of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as the earth could afford him, yet makes this still the burthen of his song, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is but vanity.</hi> And this same wise man in this same palinody, or recantation sermon, as I may call it, concludes with this sentence, worthy to be ingraven in letters of gold, <hi>To feare God, and keepe his Commandements, this is the whole duty of a mans life.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all these outward ornaments, howsoever I deny not to be great blessings, yet compared with true piety (which was that which chiefely graced great ones recorded in holy writ) they are nothing but the shell, that being the kernell. And this is that which hath so much ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and beautified your Honour, as likewise the love to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie which are so well knowne over the country, that it need not to be proclaimed by my pen. And this seemeth, as it were, with your other large inheritances, to be hereditarily derived from your noble parents, both father and mother of happy memory, whose worth and virtues, especially true piety (being especially now againe revived in your owne person) are yet so fresh in the mindes of many yet alive, that superfluous were it forme to spend time thereon.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>Another motive moving me to make choice of your Honour, was the love and favour I have ever found both from your selfe and whole family ever since my first comming into this countrie: the which, as it hath beene alwaies extended to scholers, so to my selfe in particular, having beene divers times imployed for the recoverie of the health of your Honours last noble Ladie of happy memorie, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to these hopefull Gentlemen your Sonnes, and to that noble Gentlewoman, Mistresse <hi>Manners,</hi> in whom may yet conspicuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be seene those vertuous ornaments which did so much adorne that noble Ladie now resting in peace and happinesse.</p>
   <p>Againe, another motive inducing mee heereunto, was, that of late yeeres, a worthy religious and learned Divine, your neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, had some few yeeres agoe dedicated unto your Honour a booke,<note place="margin">M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>olton, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi> of Broughtō <hi>in</hi> Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton shire.</note> called, <hi>Some generall directions for a comfortable walking with God,</hi> I thought it would not be impertinent for a Physitian to follow with his directions how to order the bodie of man in sicknesse and in health, and that by the use of good and laudable diet, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things thereunto belonging, and at great length in this booke to be seene. And although the greatest part of your glasse be now runne, yet may it prove profitable for younger people, and in particular, for these young Gentlemen, in whom you are your selfe againe renewed, but especially in that hopefull Gentleman, your eldest Sonne, who, as hee beares the name of your selfe, and immediate predecessour, and is like to inherite large and ample possessions, so is my hope and confidence, that hee shall really inherite all those noble vertues, Pietie especially, whereof either your selfe, or noble Predecessours were ever possessed.</p>
   <p>This might yet againe prove no small motive and inducement for me to present these dieteticall Precepts unto your selfe, in that you have by your owne practice and example lest such a worthy Paterne and precedent to posteritic of temperance and sobrietie, not in diet onely, but in your other actions also. And therefore it is no lesse true than triviall; <hi>Ʋivimus exemplis, non regulis,</hi> men are commonly more moved by practice than by precept. Neither herein hath your labour beene lost, having now atteined to that number of yeeres, with such a freedome from infirmities, as very few of your age and eminency have attened unto.</p>
   <p>Accept therefore, Right Honourable, this my rude labour, and take these my paines in good part, as a gratefull acknowledgement of that respect and dutifull observance I owe unto your honourable
<pb facs="4"/>
person, and noble family; and although conscious to my selfe, both of the weaknesse of my parts, and the hard censures I am like to undergoe (from the which, notwithstanding, my betters have not beene freed) yet I shall more willingly undergoe this burthen under the protection of so noble, judicious, wise, and pious a Patron. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect therefore, and still countenance the learned and honest Artist, and discountenance ignorant Empiricall Physitians, and such, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as erring out of their owne orbes, without due consideration of the weightinesse of their owne calling, too too pragmatically thrust their sickle into another mans harvest. But because many things concerning this same particular point, are handled in this subsequent discourse, therefore, to avoid tediousnesse, with hearty wishes to Almighty God for your Honour, the continuance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny happy daies for the good both of Church and Commonwealth, and countrie wherein you live, with the increase of choicest blessings upon your selfe and noble family, I rest</p>
