         <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>ERILLVS</hi> an <hi>Arcadian</hi> shepheard, who frequented the flowrie plaines of <hi>Ida;</hi> and indeed no lesse musicall, then pastorall: For his learning famous, for his measure in all compositions curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for his censure in moderne presentments, no lesse affected, then by his fellow-inhabitants admired; fell in loue with a Nimph of the adioyning mountaine, hight <hi>Eliza:</hi> of parentage honorable, of beautie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable, and endowed with all graces internall; which made her no lesse beloued, then desired, euen of the greatest: for her demerits were such, as <hi>Arcadia</hi> resounded with her praises, Long had shee (euen of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> naturall loue vnto retirednes) sequestred her selfe from the publique concourse of the world, professing as it seemed a ves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>all life: when now (being of great expectancie, as the onely daughter to her father) she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

was moued by her friends to addresse her selfe for proceedings both more answerable to her Fortunes, more correspondent to the generall intentions of her friends, and more aequiualent to her yeeres, being now in the flower of her Time, and increase of estate. After a modest, yet halfe-assenting repugnance, shee condiscended to their request: leauing <hi>Vesta</hi> and her retired habitations, and now consecrating her laies and hymnes to <hi>Hymen,</hi> wishing no doubt, his furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to her otherwise affected disposition. It chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that (on a solemne festiuall day) when all shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards leauing their pastures, and making recourse to a Temple erected neere to the foresaid mountaine, they offered sacrifice to <hi>Pan</hi> (the shepheards God) that he would preserue their flockes, &amp; giue encrease vnto their heards, according to the custom of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the <hi>Lupercalia</hi> be solemnised by the mountaine <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:</hi> the <hi>Parilia</hi> were kept in honour of <hi>Pales,</hi> for the preseruation of cattell: such were the feasts of these <hi>Arcadian</hi> shepherds. Now in the performance of their vowes to <hi>Pan,</hi> ere their solemnities were half finished, came in <hi>Eliza</hi> with other amiable maids, to see the order (as it seemed) of the shepheards in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their festiuals. The passionate shepheard <hi>Beril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> who before had conceaued no little affection of the demure carriage, modest gate, and well-respected, &amp; reputed conuersation of <hi>Eliza,</hi> had no sooner fixed his eyes on her, then his sacrifice was ended, his deuotion cooled, and those many orisons which he made to <hi>Pan,</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
conuerted to the honour of his Saint &amp; shrine <hi>Eliza.</hi> Much loue he professed by his eye: for though <hi>Pan</hi> had his knees, yet that honour was but externall, <hi>Eliza</hi> had his heart, no lesse reuerencing her presence, then he did <hi>Pan</hi> with outward appearance. <hi>Eliza</hi> at last obserued (as what woman, if faire, knowes not her Beautie?) that irreuerberate fixing of his eyes, by the transparent characters of his lookes, measuring his loue, shee (not to dant the poore shepheard) gaue him a modest smile, which gaue no lesse content to <hi>Berillus,</hi> then if <hi>Pan</hi> had descended and confirmed their vowes with his presence.</p>
   <p>The sacrifice ended: yet the flame which appeared at the sacrifice not extinguished in the loue sicke shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards brest, continued his passions, not hopelesse, because resolued such Beauteous colors could not bee soiled with the blemish of a remorcelesse heart: but as the Syreus neuer portend more raine, then when their voice is most delightfull, nor the Crocodyle more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, then when feigned semblances shew her teares most remorcefull, so this bitter sweet, seemed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pittie, and to accept of the poore shepheards sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, registring his sobbes, sighs, and vnfained pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in the Tablet of her heart: vowing acceptance if her parents assent confirmed her election. But see that generall vice (innate to her sex,) leuity of minde, estraunged her intentions, and made the forlorne shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard more wretched, in that his former hopes had made him blessed: shee contemnes his giftes, scornes his
<pb facs="7"/>
suite, plaies vpon his simplicitie: so as the shepheard surprised with a sympathie of passions, in that his hopes and great expectances are made abortments: proined of their expected growth, and blasted in the prime of his affections, sits descanting of his discontents: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his pipe the surdon of his sorrow: to expresse his languishments more fully, in an abrupt straine of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords (as that harmonie best suites with his present fortunes) lying deiected on the ground (best repose for his declining hopes) thus intimates his owne miserie: shadowing (though couertly) womans inconstancie: shutting vp his ode with this conclusion: They are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, who haue seene (and by seeing) haue bene cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of a louers miserie, and womans obduracie, hating where they propound most euident and infallible Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of their sincerest loue.</p>
