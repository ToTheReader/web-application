   <p>VVHerein may bee seene, that S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> in these three bookes of his Offices performeth, what true pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence requireth for the fit direction of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues about their media: first consulting, and setting downe truly what belongeth to them which is invention; secondly, selecting such as are agreeable to the intended end, which is judgement; thirdly, using forcible inducements to draw to action, which is perswasion. Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles method in his morals is analyticall, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in circular-wise, and so accounted the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest: namely beginning from the totall, and ending the whole ergasie, or tractate with it. <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Gellius</hi> mention two sorts, one exotericall, which is in common, and civill use, the other acroamaticall more accurate, which belongeth not to <hi>Ethicks,</hi> but to exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site demonstration and <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> In the former are sufficient arguments for probability,
<pb facs="30"/> such doth our author S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> here follow, not the other. Office, for that it generally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to all men, and therefore being an act, or duty belonging to every mans person, hath its foundation from honesty accompanied with decency and utility. Honesty in like manner with those associates, is the roote, from which the foure Cardinall vertues, prudence, justice, temperance, fortitude with all their retinue, grow, the Pillar, on which they leane, that which concurreth with their Comportment, that which maketh up their complement, that which obtaineth, it selfe first flowing, and daily assisted from the divine hand of God, true beatitude, and an ever-blessed life. It is the order ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of nature, which hee observeth then of art rather Rhetoricall, and perswasive, then logicall, and compulsive by force of reason, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more powerfull: because the proofes are impregnable, as deduced out of the irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble authoritie of the booke of God, and that most frequently, and the three fold cable is not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infringed. The efficient cause of all, that is of Office, honesty, vertue, is God; honesty the formall of her two associates, decency and utility, with the foure Cardinals their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grall subjective, potentiall parts, the materiall man, the finall the Lords honour, the motive holy presidents, and precepts with invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reasons. Fostering of friendship is the upshot of all: and that not without speciall
<pb facs="31"/> cause, for that Christian friendship in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Communion of Saints, which is the sweetest on earth openeth the bowels, and in the inseparable union by the reconcilement of Christ to the Father of all comfort, acquireth that love, which is the bond of perfection.</p>
