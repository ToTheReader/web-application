   <head>¶ TO THE RIGHT honorable my singuler good Lorde, the Lorde Norrice: Thomas Church-yard wisheth blessednesse of life, muche honor in the worlde and the beste happe can bee desired.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y good lorde the fauor and Noble dealynges towards me in the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes you were lorde em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour in Fraunce, when your aide and pollicie (by meane of a passeport) conuayed me from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Prince of Orrange, made me often remember that sutche courtesies with good will or seruice should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted.</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>But hauyng small power for the publishyng of duetie, and little abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to requite a good tourne (wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng occasion to bee gratefull) I take suche matter as tyme doeth minister for a furtherer of my expectation, and a meane to encrease my credite with your lordship. And consideryng whē dolefull newes was brought of one of your chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest sonnes dedde in Irelande, I wrote a heauie Epitaphe, I thought now hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng greate and goodnewes of another (both in nature and valliancie brother to the eldest who GOD hath called) to make a pece of amēds, for the saluyng of my first presumption, &amp; the throughly expressyng of my present desire of due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull doyng. So my good Lorde leauyng</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>circumstance of wordes and filed phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of florishyng ceremonies, I fall to my purposed matter. It hath been an olde maner, and a newe finenesse in this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng worlde, that sutche as could pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace praise or commendation by their owne practises (either by pen or tong) would reape the glorie thei could get to themselues, and leaue out the fame of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if trothe by tract of tyme reueled not rightfull causes, and gaue eche well doer the reward of their workes, then if those maners of menne, finenesse of the worlde, &amp; greedinesse of glorie runnes awaie with hast to their owne commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, and no benefite to others: Blame not any nation (properly giuen to their priuate praise) to tread doun the laude</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>and honor of any strange people, neither borne in their Countrey, nor commyng to their soile, but to serue for money &amp; sutche report of fame, as the Countrey maie spare from them selues to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, that serue for these twoo causes before rehearsed. Not withstanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the eager myndes of menne (that bites at euery blaste of fame) shall not breed by their boldnesse, neither abuse nor ill custome, whereby the estimation of forwardmen should be hindered, nor the quicke forwardnesse of vainglorie should not finde too mutche occasion to triūph on the aduantage of tyme, I haue now tyme as I thinke with trothe and good laisure, written sutche intelligēce to the worlde of the taking of Macklin,</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>as I hope shal serue for a testimonie that my penne is euer honestly occupied, and that no writer maie willingly (if licēce permit) suffer further report of newes to be published, then the wise of the world alloweth, &amp; the generall opinions of men maie embrace. Thus wishing truthe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies (as a torche to burne on the topp of a hill) to bee looked on, and affections of men to bee tried and wrested to the beste constructions of that whiche beste becomes a good worlde to heare, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to your Lordship the true reportes I haue heard for the winnyng of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cklin, and sutche thynges as there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at Macklins mischance: written not for that sutche matter (or a greate deale greater) can bee hid from a noble</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>man of your callyng. But presented to keepe my acquaintaunce with my good freendes, and cause the worlde to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine I was borne vnder a Marcial pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net and signe: and neither spareth pen, studie, nor paines to prefarre Marciall people, and honour the worthiest sorte of men. So hopyng your Lordship lookes on my willyng mynde to dooe well, and turnes your face frō the defectes of my base phrase and writyng: I wishe your honor daiely to encrease, with the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng of God vpon your house and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. From VVestminster the laste of Aprill: your Lordshippes at commaundement.</hi>
