      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His worke of mine,
which (if my hopes
and desires faile
me not) time may
heereafter make great, I
<pb facs="3"/>
haue presumed both to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
in whole to your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and to parcell out in
seuerals vnto subordinate
hands. It is no maruell if
Bookes haue this freedome,
when wee our selues can and
ought to be all yours, while
wee are our owne, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
vnder you. I dare
say, these Meditations,
how rude soeuer they may
fall from my pen, in regard
of their subiect are fit for a
Prince. Heere your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
shall see how the great
patterne of Princes, the
<pb facs="3"/>
King of Heauen, hath euer
ruled the World, how his
substitutes, earthly Kings,
haue ruled it vnder him,
and with what successe either
of glorie, or ruine. Both
your peace and warre shall
finde heere holy and great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.
And if historie
and obseruation bee the best
Counsellours of your youth;
what storie can bee so wise
and faithfull as that which
God hath written for men,
wherein you see both what
hath beene done, and what
should bee? What obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="4"/>
so worthie as that which
is both raised from God,
and directed to him? If the
proprietie which your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
iustly hath in the worke,
and Author, may draw your
Princely eies and heart the
rather to these holy specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
your seruant shall bee
happier in this fauour, than
in all your outward bountie;
as one, to whom your spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
progresse deserues to bee
dearer than his owne life;
and whose daily suit is, that
God would guide your steps
aright in this slipperie age
<pb facs="4"/>
and continue to reioice all
good hearts in the view of
your gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
