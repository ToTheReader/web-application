   <head>A.VV. In commendation of Gascoigne and his Posies.</head>
   <l>I Praysed once a booke (whereby I purchast blame)</l>
   <l>And venturde for to write a verse, before I knewe the same.</l>
   <l>So that I was deceyude, for when it came to light,</l>
   <l>The booke deserued no such worde, as I therein did wright.</l>
   <l>Thus lept I ere I lookt, and wandred ere I wist,</l>
   <l>VVhich giues (me haggard) warning since, to trust no falkners fist.</l>
   <l>And yet the booke was good, (by hap and not my skill)</l>
   <l>But not a Booke of such contentes, as might my wordes fulfill.</l>
   <l>VVell now I neede not feare, these Posies here to prayse,</l>
   <l>Bicause I knew them euery flower, and where they grew alwayes.</l>
   <l>And sure for my conceyt, euen when they bloomed first,</l>
   <l>Me thought they smelt not much amisse, no not the very worst.</l>
   <l>Perhappes some daintie nose, no Batchlers button lykes,</l>
   <l>And some at Pimpernell and Pinkes, a slender quarell pykes.</l>
   <l>Some thinke that Gillyflowers, do yeeld a gelous smell,</l>
   <l>And some (which like none herbe but Sage) say Finkell tastes not well.</l>
   <l>Yet Finkell is of force, and Gillyflowers are good,</l>
   <l>And Pinks please some, and Pimpernell doth serue to steynch the blood:</l>
   <l>And Batchlers buttons be, the brauest to beholde,</l>
   <l>But sure that flower were best not grow, which can abide no colde.</l>
   <l>For slaunder blowes so shrill, with easterne enuious windes,</l>
   <l>And frosts of frumps so nip the rootes, of vertuous meaning minds</l>
   <l>That few good flowers can thriue, vnlesse they be protected,</l>
   <l>Or garded from suspitious blastes, or with some proppes erected.</l>
   <l>So seemeth by the wight, which gardened this grounde,</l>
   <l>And set such flowers on euery bed, that Posies here abounde.</l>
   <l>Yet some tongues cannot well, affoorde him worthie prayse,</l>
   <l>And by our Lorde they do him wrong, for I haue sene his wayes,</l>
   <l>And marked all his moodes, and haue had proofe likewise,</l>
   <l>That he can do as well in field, as pen can here deuise.</l>
   <l>Not many Monthes yet past, I saw his doughtie deedes,</l>
   <l>And since (to heare what slaunder sayes) my heauie hart it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>edes.</l>
   <l>Yet Reader graunt but this, to trie before thou trust,</l>
   <l>So shalt thou find his flowers and him, both gallant, good and iust.</l>
