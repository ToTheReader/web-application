      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ORNELIA</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Metellus Scipio,</hi> a
young Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Lady, (as much accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht with the graces of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
&amp; the vertues of the minde as euer any was,) was first mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to young
<hi>Crassus,</hi> who died with his Father, in the disconfiture of the
Romains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Parthians; Afterward she tooke to second husbande
<hi>Pompey</hi> the great, who (three yeeres after) vpon the first fiers of
the ciuill warres betwixt him &amp; <hi>Caesar,</hi> sent her fro thence to
<hi>Mitilen,</hi> there to attende the incertaine successe of those
affaires. And when he sawe that hee was vanquisht at <hi>Pharsalia,</hi>
returnd to find her out, &amp; carrie her with him into Egipt, where his
purpose was to haue re-enforc'd a newe Armie, and giue a second assault
to <hi>Caesar.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In this voyage, hee was murdred by <hi>Achillas</hi> and
<hi>Septimius</hi> the Romaine before her eyes, and in the presence of his
young Sonne <hi>Sextus,</hi> and some other Senators his friends. After
which, shee retyred her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to Rome. But <hi>Scipio</hi> her Father,
(beeing made <pb facs="4"/>Generall of those that suruiued after the
battaile) as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled new forces, and occupied the greater part of Afrique,
allying himselfe to <hi>Iuba</hi> King of <hi>Numidia.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all
whō, <hi>Caesar</hi> (after he had ordied the affayres of Egipt and the
state of Rome) in the end of VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter marched. And there (after many light
encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) was a fierce and furious battaile giuen amongst them, neere the
walls of <hi>Tapsus.</hi> Where <hi>Scipio</hi> seeing himselfe
subdued, and his Armie scattered, he betooke himselfe with some small
troope, to certaine shippes which he had caused to stay for him.</p>
   <p>Thence he sailed towarde <hi>Spayne,</hi> where <hi>Pompeys</hi>
Faction commaunded, and where a suddaine tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest tooke him on the Sea,
that draue him backe to Hippon a Towne in Affrique at the deuotion of
<hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> where (lying at anchor) he was assailed, beaten &amp;
assaulted by the aduerse Fleete; And for hee woulde not fall aliue into
the hands of his so mightie Enemie, hee stabd himselfe, and suddainly
leapt ouer boorde into the Sea, and there dyed.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Caesar</hi> (hauing finished these warres, and quietly
reduc'd the Townes and places there-about to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience) return'd to Rome
in tryumph for his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; Where this most faire and miserable Ladie,
hauing ouer-mour'd the death of her deere husband, <pb facs="4"/>and
vnderstanding of these crosse euents and haplesse newes of
Affrique, together with the pitteous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of her Fathers end, she tooke
(as she had cause) occasion to redouble both her teares and
lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: wherewith shee closeth the Catastrophe of this their
Tragedic.</p>
