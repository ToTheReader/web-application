Truely in my oppinion, a very fruitefull necessary, and honorable argument, but might I deeme, or were it rashnesse, as Tullye in his Tusculans, in the comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Romains &amp; Grecians, which might excede other, or be more auncient in knowledge, sayth of such, as of thē lay neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecte, <hi>Honos alit artes omnes{que} incendunt' ad studia gloria,</hi> Surely not vnlike, but as in al other things, so in science, what auayleth seruice, where soueraigntie is neglected, what actiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie where men lie downe to sleepe, with sloth: what loue, what frendship, where no man buildes on fayth or credyt, so takè honor from lawe, rewarde from Phificke, admiration from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicalls, humilitie and zeale, from heauenly science, and who sets his sonne to schoole for them: no doubt Tully saide ful wisely, keepe backe rewarde, and learning adew.
