   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F late, perusing certaine writings which laie by me, it was my good hap to light vpon one which was full welcome: both for the profite which presently I reaped in reading of that, which before time I hadde heard, as also in regard of these our daies: wherin, if euer in any former age, these, or such like most learned &amp; godly instructions, are more then necessarie. The treatise is not long, and therefore I mind not to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie recapitulation thereof: and the rather too, because I would bee loth to dismember that, which so lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
<pb facs="3"/>
and so methodically is conioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togeather. Onely this in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that it meeteth with a kinde of bad people, who were budding and sprouting vp then, but since in respecte of their outragious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, both to God, and man, without all compasse. For proofe hereof, let the lewd and shameles li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels speake, of late set out.</p>
   <p>But heerein they expresse the auncient and olde disturbers of the Church, who dealt in such manner with their Bishops then, as they doo now. The qualitie of these men at this time, shall not be particularized by me. Although if we would do as their manner is, that is, to cull out mē by name, &amp; make legendes of them, without either feare of God, loue of brother, or care of religion, perhaps they might be made to blush, as well
<pb facs="3"/>
as others. But that course is vile, &amp; hardly (if at all) will we bee drawen to the practise thereof. And yet let <hi>Ireneus</hi> say what he felt by them, and thought of them. They are cruell (saieth he) they haue not the loue of God, they seeke their owne glorie, rather then the peace of the Church: for euery small cause they deuide &amp; cut in sunder the glorious bodie of Christ, as much as in them lieth, they haue peace in their mouthes, &amp; war in their hearts, they straine at a gnat, and swallow vp a Cammell.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Nazianzen</hi> writeth, that the like kinde of People also troubled the Church in his time, and that suche were then of diuers accompted the godliest, which did most spitefully slander their bretheren, &amp; scorneful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vse other. <hi>Omnes</hi> (saith he) <hi>per hoc docti et Catholici volumus videri, si a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lios
<pb facs="4"/>
reprehendimus &amp; impios iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> that is, we do all now a daies, by finding fault with others, and accounting them vngodly, procure to our selues an opinion of learning and religion. The rest of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Bishops were in the same ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as it is manifestly to be seen in their writings, especially, in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, Athanasius, Ierome, Basil, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> &amp; manie others. The learned of our age, haue likewise tasted of this cuppe. <hi>Caluin</hi> writeth that these kind of mē, did more slaunder him, raile vpon him and reuile him, then did the open enemies the Papists: yet that he was therewith so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually exersiced, that he made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count therof. And so <hi>Chris.</hi> as if hee had liued in <hi>Caluins</hi> time. <hi>Non tanta ab infidelibus conuitia &amp; probra, quanta ab his qui <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>obis iunctireligione videntur,
<pb facs="4"/>
fidelibus iaci videbit aliquis:</hi> that is: A man may easily see, that the faithful do not beare so many slaunders, and reproches at the handes of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, as they do of such, as seeme to be professors of the same religion. It is therefore no maruaile, though some in these daies tread in the steps of their predecessors. But for my part, I am fully perswaded, that these worthie and godlie Fathers, who of long time before, (and of late most straungely) haue bene thus set vpon, may and doo, in the testimony of a good conscience, say with <hi>Cal. I am pridem ad eiusmodi probra, quibus &amp; Prophetas, &amp; Apostolos, &amp; vnigenitū dei filium obnoxios esse video, continuo vsu obdurui:</hi> that is, long since haue I bin hardened against such slanders, from which, neither the Prophetes, neither the Apostles, neither yet the
<pb facs="5"/>
onely begottē son of God, could be cleare and free. In a word, let the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill magistrates looke to thēselues. Let them call to minde, how the Anabaptists did first deale so with the ministers of the word, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, both with words &amp; blowes, fell likewise vpon them. As for the most reuerend, &amp; godly learned mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our Church, the authour of this sermon, vpon whō they yawne most, and snatch at, without all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie or truth: I know in respect of himselfe, he makes small reckoning of their doings, which in truth, are too too odious &amp; intemperate; yea sory he is, &amp; sorie againe, that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn</hi> and his <hi>Martynistes,</hi> haue giuen so great an offence to the Church of God, &amp; yelded to the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy so iust occasion of Ioy and Triumph.</p>
