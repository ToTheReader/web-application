draw thee on to the perusing of this short Treatise. The Author of it stands vp as a worthy Minister of God, in the midst of foure other Brethren, all the Sonnes of one Father, all learned, religious, godly Preachers, a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Off-spring of Blessed Parents, a liuely mirrour of Gods blessing vpon such as consecrate their posterity to the holy Ministery. They are right <hi>Samuels,</hi> first, by their Parents giuen to God, &amp; againe, giuen of God to the seruice of the Tabernacle. Let vs reioyce in the good of Sion, and blesse God for the abundant <gap reason="foreign">

   <p>Thus assured of much comfort and profit vnto thee, if thou wilt vouchsafe the paines to reade it ouer, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily crauing thy prayers and praises to the Lord of all Spirits, both for the Author himselfe, and also for vs all his louing Brethren, we doe humbly commend thee to God, and to the Word of his grace, which is able to build thee further, and to giue thee an inheritance among all them that are sanctified. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
