I will not heere enter into the wide field of your vertues, for that I knowe you take more pleasure in doing wel, then in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring well, and for that the right Corrall needeth no coulouring, neither the fine Marble painting, neither can my pen possibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure more honour to your name, then it hath alredie gotten, partly by your owne doinges, partly by the renowmed deedes of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble▪ Gentlemen your sonnes, of whom, some are furnished with suche wisedome, with such discretion, and with such sufficiencie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way, that our Prince and Countrie cannot spare their good seruice: some are indued with suche valour, that our Countrie is too little to conteine the greatnesse of their mindes, some with such manly prowesse, euen in their childishe yeeres, that it stoode our Countrie of late in no small steede, in repressing and subduing our rebellious enimies.
