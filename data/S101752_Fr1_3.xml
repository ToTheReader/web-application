   <head>¶THE ARGVMENT OF THE XLV. Psalme, seruing for an Argument and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face or abridgement of this booke of the Canticle of Canticles or song of songes of Salomon.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Psalme as the whole booke of the Canticle of Canticles is to bee taken and altogether to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in a spirituall sense: and therefore there is no appearance or shewe of reason to take it as some haue done, for a marriadge song of Salomon and Pharoes daughter. For besides, that the title which is in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe ouer many of the Psalmes woulde haue made some mention tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this point, wee see howe this marriadge is condemned, and that worthily by the holy ghost, <hi>1. Kings. 11.</hi> so farre it is from all reason to take that alliaunce &amp; marriage of his to haue bin a figure of so holy &amp; sacred a one as that is which is proposed vnto vs in this Psal. We haue therefore in this psalme an excellent and most diuine treatie touching the most strait and spirituall bonde and alliaunce which is betweene Iesus Christ and his Church, euery point thereof being prosecuted and continued vnder such formes and phrases of speach as are customari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vsed in the treaty of the conditions of a naturall marriadge betweene such persons as are of an high degree and qualitie: as the Prophets also haue in many places retained the very same termes of Bridegrome and spouse and of marriadge speaking of Iesus Christ and of his Church, as the Apostle hath likewise vsed the same, namely, <hi>Rom. 7.2.</hi> &amp; <hi>2. Cor. 11.</hi> and <hi>Ephs. 5.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>We are therefore to note in the first place that as in the matter of mariadge the fiansailes or betrothings are first solemnized &amp; then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the marriadge, so Christ also as the bridegrome of the Church ought to bee in some sort considered after two diuerse manners, first according vnto his infirmitie, which may bee compared vnto the fian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes: and secondly according vnto his glory which he obtained after his resurrection, beeing nowe the true husband of his Church, replenished himselfe with glory, though shee bee yet remayning in part vpon earth.
<pb facs="5"/>
Now as touching this psalme Christ is therein proposed vnto vs, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already in his glory, and as he who hath begonne already to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish in deede this holy marriadge with his Church.</p>
   <p>Christ therefore as husband is this true king of his Church, so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite in respect of himselfe in all beautie, that there is nothing wanting, vers. <hi>2.</hi> As touching the good grace he hath to winne all heartes vnto himselfe, and euen to chaunge and turn them altogether, the same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so appeareth in the preaching of the gospell accompanied with a vertue &amp; power of the spirite which cannot be expressed. Himselfe in asmuch as hee hath taken vpon him the nature of man, hath receiued in the same nature the spirite of God without measure, in such aboundaunt wise that he poured it as it were ouer in all his saintes.</p>
   <p>He is girded also with a sword, and that not in shewe onely without effect, but which he draweth and vnsheatheth in deede, namely then when he maketh his worde to pearce vnto the diuiding of the soule &amp; of the spirite: vers. <hi>3.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>He is besides described to bee furnished and prouided with arrowes with which he shooteth thorough &amp; transpearceth all his enemies, ver. <hi>5.</hi> which maketh also that al praise ought principally &amp; souerainly to be yeelded vnto him, who sheweth himselfe of so ready and mighty a power that hee is able to succour and defende such as are his, &amp; to breake in sunder and ouerthrow the strength of such as rebell against him. ver. <hi>5.</hi> To this purpose he is introduced as being trained in his chariot by these three horses, Truth, Meekenes, and Righteousnes, which are condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the word as by him that guideth this Chariot, vers. <hi>4.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Nowe to declare at large the sense and meaning of euery of these things here proposed, it would require a great volume. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we may as it were by the way obserue somewhat out of them, if we make a comparison on the contrarie side of the traine they kepe, and on what chariot they cause them-selues to be carried, I meane the kinges &amp; Princes who serue that master which is opposed altogether vnto this head of the Church, in whose whole furniture and prouision is nothing but Ambition, Pride, Insolencie, Crueltie, Dissolution, with an horrible trāpling vnder &amp; oppressing of them which are their subiects. We must also diligently note that which is added, that albeit the worlde will not accept this most iust and most milde gouernement of his, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb facs="5"/>
this so iust a king gouerneth alwaies most happily, &amp; that the more men oppose and set themselues against him, the more hee maketh his power to appeare, whether it be in that so iust and assured defence which hee causeth those who are his to feele, or whether he strike his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies within vnto death by a most diuine power, namely when hee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth them into a reprobate sense to make them-selues the instruments of their own ruine &amp; destruction. Now albeit these things come to passe euery day, inasmuch as this good king doth alwaies defend all his elect, to the end that none of them perish, &amp; inasmuch as he doth vengeance vpon their enemies according as it pleaseth him to shewe the markes thereof: notwithstanding this appeared most expreslie in the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this marriage, as it seemeth to be here in some sort touched, when he shewed such vengeaunce on that vngrateful synagogue of the Iewes obstinatly perseuering in her incredulity, in which she continueth vnto this date, reseruing notwithstanding the remnaunt of his elect according vnto his expresse mercy which he promised vnto the race of Abraham, howe rebellious so euer it doth shew it selfe.</p>
   <p>Now after this king hath obtained such a victorie, hee is here seated on his seat of Iustice and Righteousnesse, which is called eternal and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting, ver. <hi>6.</hi> to giue vs to vnderstand that it is not of this woorld, and that not onely because that Iustice establisheth the seat of the king in this world, as it is written, <hi>Prou. 27.28.</hi> but especially because here the question is of a king who is together both true God eternal, and true Son of Dauid according vnto the fleshe, vnto whom also in asmuch as he is man is giuen all power both in heauen and in earth, beeing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted aboue euerie name, as this place is alleaged, <hi>Heb. 1.8.</hi> in so much that the Church hath no more manie kinges, then one woman can haue manie husbandes: neither is he whom she hath for her husband so God, that he is not also man, seeing otherwise the marriage would not agree betweene him &amp; the Church which is gathered from among men: as neither is hee man in such sort, that hee is not God too, because that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise the Church should not haue an head and husband mighty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to defend her.</p>
   <p>Afterwarde is declared the most righteous gouernment of this goodlie kingdome, to wit, of the Church, ver. <hi>7.</hi> for there is no kingdome but the Church which is gouerned by the true rule of a most iust and
<pb facs="6"/>
moderate discretion, bee it in publicke charges or in priuate duties and particular charges, because it is in it properlie that the spirite of God doth raign, which ordereth &amp; directeth indeed the senses, &amp; gouerneth the affections of the true faithful &amp; beleeuing. And the reason of this point which is added is of great waight, namely, because that this king of the Church both in respect of his person as also of his office, is annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue his companions, that is to saie, we must set him by himselfe in another order &amp; degree then other kings are. For euen in the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent kings, yea in Dauid himselfe there haue beene many defects and imperfections, but in such a king as this is there is nothing but all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
   <p>As for that which is added of the most exquisite robes and vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this king, vers. <hi>8.</hi> this is referred partly vnto that proper voice which the father caused to be heard when he was baptized, saying, This is my welbeloued Sonne in whom I am well pleased▪ by which voice is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs to vnderstand the ful and perfect reconciliation with the father by that most sweet odor aswel of the integrity and righteousnesse resiant in the parson of Christ our Immanuel, as also his obedience vnto death euen the death of the crosse. These same vestiments also and robes of his are referred vnto that which the Apostle saith, <hi>2. Cor. 2.15.</hi> we are the sweet odor of Christ as of him who hath beene made vnto vs Wisdome, Righteousnes, and Sanctification, &amp; Redemption, <hi>1. Cor. 1.30.</hi> which blessings hee powreth downe vpon vs from those pallaces of Iuory, which are those heauenly places where hee is seated, and from whence hee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon vs, and from whence also he causeth these blessings &amp; graces of his, to flow downe vpon vs, yea his owne selfe (as we may so say) after a spiritual maner &amp; fashiō, &amp; such as is vtterly incōprehensible vnto vs.</p>
   <p>This king and Bridegrome being thus described vnto vs, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and estate of the Church his spouse, and of their whole marriage is most amply set downe and handled vers. <hi>9.</hi> Nowe in the discourse and handling heereof there are adioyned vnto the Israelites and faithfull Iewes which properly represent this spouse, certaine others which are the kinges Daughters also to be her companions: al which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding appertaining but to one husband represent vnto vs by this meanes the person of one onely Church truely Catholicke, that is to saie vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, but yet in such sort that they are as it were placed after this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb facs="6"/>
spouse of the people of Israel: because the first right appertaineth first of al vnto the holie Prophets &amp; Apostles of the nation of the Iewes and to al the other which the Apostle calleth the natural braunches, by whose ministerie also we haue been led and conducted into the chamber of this king, with whose gold and glittering shining we are made bright and shining. Wee are farther to note touching the ornamentes of these Queens which are the body of the Church, that it is not said that they tooke them out of their own cabinets and ward-robes, but they receiued thē of the king himselfe, to the end it should be acknowledged that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is faire &amp; goodly proceedeth not, as it is most true, but from his mere grace &amp; fauor who hath couered our pouerty &amp; nakednes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it foloweth that she ought properly to be held &amp; taken for the true Catholicke Church whom wee see to come foorth in this place with her companions in al humilitie with that rich crowne of the onely righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of Christ her king and sauiour, embraced by faith and freely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted &amp; allowed her: although together with this righteousnes of faith there must appeare besides in the faithfull an actuall righteousnes, but neuer perfect and entire, but onely begun and delineated forth by little and little, by which notwithstanding a man maie alwaies distinguish the children of light from the children of darkenes, as it seemeth our Lorde Iesus Christ had also respect thereunto, <hi>Math. 22.11.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Al these things being thus handled, in which almost all the secretes of our saluation are comprised, the Prophet addresseth his speache vnto the Church or rather vnto euery member thereof: ver. <hi>10.11.</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to study to please this Bridegroome who cherisheth and fauoureth her so much, shewing withal how she shall doe it, namely if in hearkening diligently vnto him (according as faith proceedeth of that which a man heareth of God himselfe, and without which a man cannot please God) and ordering her selfe altogether vnto him (which is done if shee take narrow heede vnto his wil which is seene in the glasse of the Lawe) shee beginneth to rid her selfe in the whole traine and tenour of her life from al wicked spots and defilements of corruption which she hath in herselfe imprinted in her both from the originall and beginning of her nature &amp; being, and from the nouriture of her Parents as also of al such as after by custome &amp; cōtinuance are growen according vnto the flesh &amp; deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted in her, that so shee maie learne the better to obey this onelie
<pb facs="7"/>
Bridegroome of hers as her true head and Lord for euer.</p>
   <p>Afterward there is adioined an exhortation which is vsed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the small beginninges of the Christian Church such as it was when it began to take her first beginning in Ierusalem, ver. <hi>12.13.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For it is easie to bee seene by the Actes of the Apostles what the Church might bee according vnto the flesh when there were in the first assembly but threescore persons and those poore people and of no counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or appearaunce, and therefore hee comforteth her and foretelleth that it shal come to passe, that they euen of Tyre it selfe, vnder whom he comprehendeth the strange nations &amp; the very mightiest of the world, should ioine themselues vnto her. And yet for al this he warneth her in good time that al this goodly beutiful shew and setting forth whereof he maketh mentiō, &amp; which he saith is to be priced aboue al the gold in the world without cōparison &amp; whatsoeuer ornament the greatest Queens of this world might haue, ought to be within &amp; in the hart &amp; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out to be apparant only vnto the eies according vnto the fashion &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world, ver. <hi>13.14.15.</hi> &amp; that yet a daie shoulde come when it shoulde appeare so high and magnificent in this Queene and in her Daughters, that it should surmount and exceede all the magnificency the mind of man were able to conceiue, namely then when we shal meet Christ as the Apostle speaketh, and when beeing entred with him into his pallace we shall be and abide with him for euer.</p>
   <p>Now to conclude if any man demand what this Bride shal doe while she waiteth &amp; expecteth the last accōplishment of this souerain blisse &amp; happines which this blisfull Bridegroome shal in the end bestow vpon the church his true spouse: it is said that this spouse for the time she waiteth for shal not cease to bear or bring forth children vnto this husband ver. <hi>16.</hi> yea &amp; those excellent &amp; good children, &amp; such as shal resemble &amp; proue like vnto their true ancestors, I meane the ancient Prophets &amp; Patriarches: &amp; such as shal be kings to rule ouer al the coasts &amp; quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the world, hauing therein by the vertue of the spirit of this great king subdued and ouercome satan, sin, death and themselues. Whence it foloweth that then here shal be in euery respect a most perfect mariage, and such a one as shal endure for euer.</p>
