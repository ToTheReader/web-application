   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL my Reverend and right worthy friend M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> D. AIRAY, Provost of the Queenes College in Oxford, Grace &amp; Peace.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> haue adventured once againe Right Worshipfull, reverenced, and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> to put into your hands, and present vnto your view, what hath fallen into my lap, and lot from the Lord. This worthy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Treatise so behoofefull for al persons, so needfull for these times, being formerly commended to my vse, with some other things of like nature, by my beloved, and gracious friend: I did accordingly as I had occasion, vse, and pervse. Now the more I did read, ponder, and consider what I read, the more I did admire the Impressions of wisdome, learning, religion, sanctification, and many other rare parts, which in faire characters of Grace, I found stampt almost in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry page of it. Certainely this Preacher sought to find out both profitable, and pleasant things, words of delight, and words of truth: not to humor, and tickle the itching eare by plausible, &amp; vaine sounds, as of tinckling Cymbals: but to refresh the thirsty heart with waters of life, and satisfie the hungry soule with good things, I know, Sir, you are no stranger, neither to the Tree, nor fruit, having former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dwelt together vnder one roofe, dranke togither of
<pb facs="3"/>
one Cisterne, and mutually reioiced togither in all offices of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ty &amp; loue: yet may you now renew the tendernesse of your affection by renuing your acquaintance with the Fruit of his labours. For, seeing here your eie may with more serious observation behold, what with good atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion heretofore your eare hath heard: both eie, and eare, head, and heart, may be refreshed anew with the renued presence (as it were) of an absent, &amp; ancient friend. <hi>David</hi> for his loue to <hi>Ionathan</hi> the Father, shewed great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> his Sonne, and I doubt not but this Infant for his Fathers sake, this worke for the Authours, shall finde accesse, and acceptance in like manner at your hands. And so commending this and my selfe to your favour and loue, I pray for continuance of Gods mercies &amp; increase of his graces, and that both for your person, &amp; place, to the farther building vp of the Body of Christ both in your selfe, and in all that depend vpon you. <hi>Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury in Cheshire, Iuly, 8. 1614.</hi>
