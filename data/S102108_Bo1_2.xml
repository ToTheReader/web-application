   <head>An aduertisement to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, after the Printing of this Catechisme, which beginneth with that principle of repentance from dead works at the ninth leaf of this book, I called some few things to minde whereof I thought good to aduertise thee; First, though the former Catechisme seeme somwhat long, and our sluggish natures best like short worke which is quickly done: yet hauing numbred the Questions which I finde to be fourteenescorce in the whole, I desired to certifie thee of this thing, that if eyther other Catechismes be not at hand with thee, or if this shall like thee better then others, eyther for clearenesse of order, or for easinesse of matter, that thou maist go foure times through it in thy family in one year, &amp; yet put them to learn but foure Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions euery day: &amp; by learning two euery day, it will twise be run through; or if they be catechised but twise a weeke, and rehearse but three Questions at a time, it wil be once ouercome yearely, the fruit may quit the cost. Things which at first view seeme great and hard, being wel and circumspectly dealt in, are found more easie, then they seeme for. As in an army, to subdue a great number of men well appointed seemeth a matter of great hazard (as it is indeed) yet single them out by two or three, it will be nothing to vanquish them. The new Testament hath shew of a great worke, yet read but fiue Chapters a day, (&amp; thou wilt spend much time worse) thou shalt go through it once in two moneths and lesse, sixe times in one yeare. Also the Psalmes (being one hundred and fiftie) in appearance a long worke to peruse, yet read but two a day, and thou shalt foure times a year ouer read that precious booke of the psalmes, and haue diuers play dayes cast in: so is it with sundry Catechismes which carry a face of some difficultie to learne, howbeit by a good order being constantly followed, in short space they will be learned, and grow very familiar.</p>
   <p>In the second place I am to entreat this of thy curtisie, that if thou findest in the foresaid Catechisme any thing eyther vnperfect or vnsound, (for the former it cannot be otherwise as all mens workes are; for the latter I hope it is otherwise, yet we are all men) and wilt certifie me thereof priuately by word or writing, I will thanke thee for thy good will and will trust if God will to giue thee satisfaction.</p>
   <p>Lastly, whereas I haue drawne the former large Catechisme into a very little summe, hereunto affixed, containing not aboue fortie short Questions: the reason of my purpose herein, was for the fauour and ease of such as be weake, as well in yeares as knowledge, who hauing first with delight sucked in, and digested this summe, (through the good care of their parents or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours) they may become stronger, and better able to set vpon an harder and greater worke.</p>
   <closer>Farewell.</closer>
