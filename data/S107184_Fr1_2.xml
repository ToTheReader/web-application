<pb facs="5"/> by his effectes, whiche because in this case thei are of two sortes, it shall be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a worde to weigh them a parte, that in the effectuall triall of the same, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God maie in a sounde experience of the power of Christ in their owne soules, bee cheared vnto constancie in euery good due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie against Sathan and men: and the vaine dissemblers, Heretiques, tyme seruers, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, and carnall Gospellers, with the like, who swarme euery where, maie (if thei had eyes to see) perceiue their iust cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and to humble their soules vnto the obedience of the Lorde.</p>

      <hi>Because ye are Sonnes, God hath sent the Spirit of his Sonne into your har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, criyng Abba, Father.</hi> Whiche although for a tyme it seeme to bee hid, and beyng as it were raked vnder the ashes of our owne corruption, yet because it is a pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>dge of the

   <p>The other effect is more apparātly seen. For by faith he doeth purifie the hart,<note place="margin">Acts. 15.9. Rom. 6.4. Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And these effectes as thei are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to the Spirite of Christ, and haue not been, in a right purpose (namely for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God and the good of his in any other then in the Sainctes of God, so in whom soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer these effectes are founde, though with
<pb facs="6"/> much weakenesse,<note place="margin">Who so hath the fruites of the Spirite, hath the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. 2. Pet. 1.10.</note> so it be in truth and with out hypocrisie, it shall euer bee founde to bee most true, that where is the effectes, there is the cause to whom thei belong. So that by this right discernyng of the fruites of the Spirite of the Lorde Jesus, and the hauyng of the same, we maie truely gather that we haue hymself, so as is meant in the worde of God, and so are surely grafted into Christ, and maie assure our hartes before him both for our selues and others, what soeuer other waies our feare and feelyng be for the tyme. For if at sometymes wee maie finde that in some measure wee haue had these effectes, the true fruites of a liuely faithe, and so the assuraunces of our election and saluation by Christ, then is there no iust cause of any feare, if wee mourne vnto the repossessing of our peace againe,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.29.</note> because the giftes and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges of God are without repentance. And if it bee obiected that wee haue felt the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the Lorde, but now it is gone, and cleane tourned awaie, as that obiection is most vntrue, so to thinke on that fashion, is to suppose an impossible thyng. For God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer chaungeth his owne purpose, but what soeuer he hath purposed shall stand,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.19.</note> and his
<pb facs="6"/> counsell shall take effect, whatsoeuer lets be against it. Wherevpon we maie rightly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that who soeuer hath a certaine testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of his faithe and saluation in all his life, maie be assured that it is there stil: and shall bee vnto the ende, although for a tyme thei feele it not, nor perceiue the working of it. For it doeth not followe, that a little child hath no reasonable soule, because he hath not the vse of it, or that the Trees be dead in Winter, because thei beare no fruite, or that there is no Fire, because there is no flame.</p>
   <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.10. 2. Cor. 5.17. Reue. 21.5.</note> the Lorde Iesus Christ killeth in vs, that is, beginneth to kil in vs the whole bodie of sinne, and maketh all thinges newe concernyng the qualitie thereof, so that our vnderstandyng and iudgement is lightened and gouerned, that it beginneth to approue of those good thynges which before it misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, our will also is cleansed to the hatred of sinne, and desire of those thynges that be good, and our affection beginne to flie and eschewe what is forbidden, and to embrace and followe that whiche is commended of the Lorde. The whiche inwarde power of the Spirite of Christ, if wee feele in effect,
<pb facs="7"/> and working in our owne soule, or see the care it leadeth others vnto: the conclusion is infallible and plaine, that wee haue faith, and so consequently Jesus Christ &amp; eternall life.</p>
   <p>But it is obiected, how can there be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suraunce of the vndoubted fauour of the Lorde, and of saluation, seeyng all men are sinners: not onely in that euery man is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by nature, but that the corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man doth daily bryng forth effectes accordyng to the same, mouynges, prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, consentynges, and actions contrarie to the will of God? yea seing all doe sinne? The aunswere is easie, that albeit euery one hath continually in hym those thynges that bee in them selues infinitely offensiue before the Lorde, yet the distaunce is not so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene heauen and earth, as the difference is great, betweene sinner and sinner, that is, betweene hym in whom sinne raigneth, and hym in whom sinne is. Of the first: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle commaundeth such as feare God, that sinne doe not raigne in them,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.12.</note> that is, haue power to leade thē with delight in the waie of euill. And of the other he saieth by his owne example:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.15.17.</note>
      <hi>That that I would not do,
<pb facs="7"/> that I doe: yet not I, but sinne that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in me.</hi> Where he meaneth by sinne, the remnaunces of corruption whiche yet were sinne, albeit he laboured against it, and was so farre from taking delight therein, that he euen groned vnder the burden thereof,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shal deliuer me from this bodie of death?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But who seeth not, that fewe there are, who striue to giue obediēce vnto the Lord, and to shew forth the effectual cognizaunce and badge whose people thei be, by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and sincere loue to the brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren? Infinite in deede are the thousandes of men, who beare an outward face to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell of Christ, that yet doe wholly prophane them selues in the obedience of sinne, not knowyng, or not regardyng,<note place="margin">2.

Yet the olde complaint of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is in vse at this daie, that men seeme to saie in their hartes:<note place="margin">Esa. 28.15.</note>
      <hi>Wee haue made a couenaunt with death, and with hell are wee at a greement, though a scourge run ouer, and passe through, it shall not come at vs: for we haue made falshood our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,

For howsoeuer thei
<pb facs="8"/> outwardly pretende to agree with vs in one and the same truthe of God, yet we continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally see to our intollerable greefe, how in the practize of their life, thei runne headlong to all prophannesse, cast the glorious power of the worde of God (whiche should continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bynde them to the obedience of his will) out of their sight,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.2.5. 2. Pet. 2.3.</note> whilest thei accompt more of gaine then of Godlinesse, and wallowe in their vaine pleasures and fleshly delightes, as is infinitly seen at this daie.

<pb facs="9"/> God, then is there iust cause, that all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Gospellers, Libertines, carelesse profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors and prophane men, should intollerably feare before the anger of the Lord.

He though not the excellencie of Gods callyng to be as it was, in the tyme of his vanitie, nor yet doe thei. He wept for a blessing, and it maie be some of them would gladly be saued: But true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce,<note place="margin">Luc 24 47.</note> the waie whereby it is had, was farre from him, and who shall promise it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them?

And that is to see, that Papistes and other Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, the longer thei haue helde and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their error, the more forwarde and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent thei bee in the waie of sinne, but many that seemed to haue well profited in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lordes truthe, haue at once
<pb facs="13"/> tourned out of the waie, and as beeyng in a dead sleepe of securitie, flatter themselues in a naked knowledge without all true zeale to quicken the giftes that thei haue, to the honour of God and the good of his Saincts. Jt is accompted a notable poinct of excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng wisedome in this daie with many, not to shewe a face to the truthe or to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren before men, but as the moste doe, whiche is nothyng at all. When we first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bee lightened with knowledge of the truthe, the Gospell it self was moste sweete vnto our soules, and the fellowshippe of our bretheren was moste deare and profitable vnto vs: but now Sathan hath besotted vs with an imagination of knowledge, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most who doeth not thinke it follie to be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, and a poinct almost of extreame mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to make more accomptes of men as thei accompt of the Lorde, and yet we haue the president of the Spirite of God,<note place="margin">2.

True knowledge in deede, and right zeale for the Lorde, are ioynt cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, or rather Twinnes, that maie not be sondered, whereby the harte is lightened and stirred vp to a cherefull and moste rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die obedience of the will of God, with desire of his glorie and the good of his people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="14"/> all thynges in the worlde. And what maie we thinke of them that be otherwise, that pamper them selues either in a blinde zeale without care of knowledge, the waie to error, or in a bare knowledge thinking themselues wise despise the waie of the Lord, which is in true zeale and right knowledge of the Lordes waies according to his word. And their such proude accompt of nothing, taking the very shadowe of knowledge for true knowledge it self, maketh them secure, who of wise and zealous members of Gods Churche, according to the measure of their experience in that tyme, are now becomne vnprofitable Drones, and carelesse Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and thinke them selues more wise (in their extreame follie) then euer thei were before. But it must needes be as the Lorde hath foretolde of the like, that thei are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stonie grounde,<note place="margin">Math. 13.5.6.7. Luc. 8.6.7.8.</note> where the seede had no depth of yearth, or that it is choked with thornes,<note place="margin">Math. 12.45.</note> euen their harts eaten vp with the care of this world, whose ende will be worse, then the beginnyng.</p>
   <p>Some others there are that take excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at whom thei wil, and albeit the Lord hath testified that there is no respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with hym,<note place="margin">Act. 10.34. Rom. 2.11.</note> yet thei feare not to vpholde
<pb facs="14"/> this imagination of their owne, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of profityng and practise of true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, euery one in their place, it is more free for some men then for othersome, and for all men then for women. And that their such dreaming may appeare the more grosse, thei let not to saie, (with what purpose I leaue to them selues) that a woman should not bee more religious then her housbande, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng belike, the approued examples of the Scriptures <hi>1. Sam. 25.3. Luc. 8.3.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Acts. 1.14. Rom. 6.6.12.13. 2. Tim. 1.5. Luc. 23.55.56. Luc. 24.1. Read Maister Foxe, and by name Anne Askewe, and Prestes wife of Exceter.</note> And how many holy women are infinitely mentioned in the worde, without any mention of their housbandes fall, and holy Histories testifie of very many, that haue māfully giuen their liues for the Gospell, when their housbandes haue beene backesliders, and some of them haue persecuted their poore wiues. And that thei maie bee founde to peruert the straight waies of the Lorde, thei saie a man should not take to wife (as the like) one that is more religious then hym self. I would aske these men whether a man maie take a wife that is more welthie then hymself, if thei graunt that he maie (as I trust thei will easily do) then shal thei be inforced to saie, either, that the thynges of this worlde are more to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, then the heauenly blessinges of the
<pb facs="15"/> Spirite of God, and the transitorie thynges of the bodie, more worth then the giftes of the mynde, or that a man not onely should: but also ought to make especiall choyce, as there are excellent blessinges in the inner man.<note place="margin">Gen. 2.18.</note> And if the wife must be in all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges a helper, then in the cheefe thynges it were absurde to saie she must bee vnapt to helpe. Thei maie remember that the Lords people haue from tyme to tyme, been forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dē to match themselues with the prophane,<note place="margin">Deut. 7.3. Iude. 3.7.</note> whiche necessarily intendeth the contrarie. But thei will except, that thei doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but the wife should haue some religion, but not more then her housbande: But thei should rather saie it is shame worthie in the housbande, who should be so farre before, to come so farre behind. I aske, when the hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande hath no religion, and the wife must not haue more then he, or when he doth not labour for it, and she must not labour more then he: how muche is then left vnto her, either of religion, or of meanes to attaine vnto it, none at all. This is so farre of from continuyng them vnto all good duetie vnto their housbandes,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.22. Collo. 3.18. 1. Pet. 3.1.</note> wherevnto thei are fast bounde by the lawe of God: and suche as in truthe feare the Lorde, will I am right sure
<pb facs="15"/> make conscience of: that it is to saie almost, that their saluation and the meanes of it, is not free, but at the deuotion of others, that God, his worde and grace, with the glorie of his name, are quite out of sight, and the housbande must be in his place. Let no man thinke that my meaning is to loose the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of obedience in this case: for my whole desire is quite contrarie. First, that bothe the housbande, and the wife, should obey the Lorde, bothe as Christians, and in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall place: thei that are to gouerne, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne in, and accordyng to the Lorde,<note place="margin">Collo. 3.17.</note> and thei that are to obey, to obey in, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to the Lorde.<note place="margin">Acts. 4.19.</note> If any intende otherwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, their authoritie will bee without the Lorde, and deserueth to bee so taken. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I aske, seyng the Lorde hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this vnto all his children,<note place="margin">1. Thes. 4 1.2.</note> that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thei haue gained of knowledge &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in the worde of God,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.18.

J wish we maie in this cleare light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge leaue winking, as it were, at noone da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, and tremble, thus to dallie, or thus to deale vniustly with the most holie truth of
<pb facs="16"/> the Lorde, and to presse vniust iniuries vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the soules of our poore bretheren, least in carelesse greeuyng the consciences of the Lordes annointed, we violently bryng vpon our selues the heauie wrathe and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</p>
   <p>If we in the truth of an humble soule do weigh the seuerall testimonies of the worde of the Lorde, to the right guiding of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts to the assuraunce of his grace in the obedience of his will, we shall easily be made able to meete with all these mischeefes and many moe, that might otherwaies preuaile to turne vs out of the waie. And as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God hath amongst infinite other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture to that effect, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle Sainct Ihon in his first Epistle, proued that true iustification and eternall life is onely by Iesus Christ, and shewed further, that there is no assuraunce of this grace of the Lorde, where is not the effectuall power of the Spirite of the Sonne of God in the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified (who are vnited vnto hym as the members vnto the head, and receiue of his fulnesse) to leade them in a continuall true obedience of his will reuealed in his worde, and in the truthe thereof, that thei might stand out immouably vnto the end, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="16"/> to beware of false teachers and all that deceiue, and reasoning from the effect to the cause, he proueth the truthe of the loue of God towarde vs, by our loue to the brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren. Which beyng well considered of vs and applied to our seuerall vse in the direction of the Spirite of Christ, will not onely arme vs against Sathan in the former euilles: but make vs effectuallie wise in the waie of life. And as the same Epistle of Sainct Jhon is most sweete and plentifull in it self, being full of plaine witnesse of the grace of God, and effectuall testimonies who bee his: So is it most clerely &amp; profitably opened and made plaine by the reuerende and moste worthie seruaunt of Iesus Christ, M. Caluin, in his tyme.
