      <l>For whose life, <hi>Alexander</hi> would haue giuen</l>
      <l>One of his kingdomes: who (as sent from heauen,</l>

      <l>

      <l>Did more aduance his Asian victorie,</l>

      <l>Nor haue we soules to purpose, if their loues</l>

      <l>How much then, were this kingdomes maine soule maim'd,</l>

      <l>May finde stuffe to be fashiond by his lines.</l>
      <l>Through all the pompe of kingdomes still he shines,</l>
      <l>And graceth all his gracers. Then let lie</l>
      <l>Your Lutes, and Viols, and more loftily</l>
      <l>Make the Heroiques of your <hi>Homer</hi> sung,</l>
      <l>To Drums and Trumpets set his Angels tongue:</l>
      <l>And with the Princely sport of Haukes you vse,</l>
      <l>Behold the kingly flight of his high Muse:</l>
      <l>And see how like the Phoenix she renues</l>

      <l>Thousands of yeares attending; euerie one</l>
      <l>Blowing the holy fire, and throwing in</l>
      <l>Their seasons, kingdomes, nations that haue bin</l>

      <l>No gold can follow, where true Poesie flies.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Then let not this Diuinitie in earth</l>
      <l>(Deare Prince) be sleighted, as she were the birth</l>
      <l>Of idle Fancie; since she workes so hie:</l>
      <l>Nor let her poore disposer (Learning) lie</l>
      <l>Stil bed-rid. Both which, being in men defac't;</l>
      <l>In men (with them) is Gods bright image rac't.</l>
      <l>For, as the Sunne, and Moone, are figures giuen</l>
      <l>Of his refulgent Deitie in Heauen:</l>
      <l>So, Learning, and her Lightner, Poesie,</l>
      <l>In earth present his fierie Maiestie.</l>
      <l>Nor are Kings like him, since their Diademes</l>
      <l>Thunder, and lighten, and proiect braue beames;</l>
      <l>But since they his cleare vertues emulate;</l>
      <l>In Truth and Iustice, imaging his State;</l>
      <l>In Bountie, and Humanitie since they shine;</l>

      <l>In vs, and all this Cope beneath the Skie;</l>
      <l>Nor great <hi>Existence,</hi> term'd his Treasurie.</l>
      <l>Since not, for being greatest, he is blest;</l>
      <l>But being Iust, and in all vertues best.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>VVhat sets his Iustice, and his Truth, best forth,</l>
      <l>(Best Prince) then vse best; which is Poesies worth.</l>
      <l>For, as great Princes, well inform'd and deckt</l>
      <l>VVith gracious vertue, giue more sure effect</l>
      <l>To her perswasions, pleasures, reall worth,</l>
      <l>Then all th'inferiour subiects she sets forth;</l>
      <l>Since there, she shines at full; hath birth, wealth, state,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="4"/>Power, fortune, honor, fit to eleuate</l>
      <l>Her heauenly merits; and so fit they are</l>
      <l>Since she was made for them, and they for her:</l>
      <l>So, Truth, with Poesie grac't, is fairer farre,</l>
      <l>More proper, mouing, chaste, and regular,</l>
      <l>Then when she runnes away with vntruss't Prose;</l>
      <l>Proportion, that doth orderly dispose</l>
      <l>Her vertuous treasure, and is Queene of Graces;</l>
      <l>In Poesie, decking her with choicest Phrases,</l>
      <l>Figures and numbers: when loose Prose puts on</l>
      <l>Plaine letter-habits; makes her trot, vpon</l>
      <l>Dull earthly businesse (she being meere diuine:)</l>
      <l>Holds her to homely Cates, and harsh hedge-wine,</l>
      <l>That should drinke Poesies Nectar; euerie way</l>
      <l>One made for other, as the Sunne and Day,</l>
      <l>Princes and vertues. And, as in a spring,</l>
      <l>The plyant water, mou'd with any thing</l>
      <l>Let fall into it, puts her motion out</l>
      <l>In perfect circles, that moue round about</l>
      <l>The gentle fountaine, one another, raising:</l>
      <l>So Truth, and Poesie worke; so Poesie blazing,</l>
      <l>All subiects falne in her exhaustlesse fount,</l>
      <l>VVorks most exactly; makes a true account</l>
      <l>Of all things to her high discharges giuen,</l>
      <l>Till all be circular, and round as heauen.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And lastly, great Prince, marke and pardon me;</l>
      <l>As in a flourishing, and ripe fruite Tree,</l>
      <l>Nature hath made the barke to saue the Bole;</l>
      <l>The Bole, the sappe; the sappe, to decke the whole</l>
      <l>VVith leaues and branches; they, to beare and shield</l>

      <l>(Since out of that againe, the whole Tree growes:)</l>
      <l>So, in our Tree of man, whose neruie Roote</l>
      <l>Springs in his top; from thence euen to his foote,</l>

      <l>For which she should liue honor'd; Kings should giue</l>
      <l>Comfort and helpe to her, that she might still</l>
      <l>Hold vp their spirits in vertue; make the will,</l>
      <l>That gouernes in them, to the power conform'd;</l>
      <l>The power to iustice; that the scandals, storm'd</l>
      <l>Against the poore Dame, clear'd by your faire Grace,</l>
      <l>Your Grace may shine the clearer. Her low place,</l>
      <l>Not shewing her, the highest leaues obscure.</l>

      <l>All whose poore seed, like violets in their beds,</l>
