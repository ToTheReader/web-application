   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ngenuous Readers, question you
may, with what front I (enlisted
(I confesse) among the Rable of
home-bread versifiers) dare thrust
upon the world this abortive
pamphlet: shall I tell you? I dreamt nothing
lesse, but was entasked to undertake this unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
willing labour. But not to goe about the
bush, if you reake not of this Apologie, (I pray
you) sith every capricious brain-sicke Rimer so
pestersthe world with the uncouth Chimaeraes
of his owne fancy, why should not I disvellop
the flag of my Muse? which though shee bee
home-spun, and savors of Rusticity, yet fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to rove at random after selfe-plotted and
new-fangled trickes; (in which respect shee
may extort, though not praise yet pardon) hath
chosen to confine her-selfe within the precincts
<pb facs="4"/>
of Translation, and here presents you with these
Pastoralls (which were first coated by the
Prince of Latin Poets in a Roman Garb) now
shifted into an English habit.</p>
   <p>As for the worke it selfe, I could wish I
had performed it throughout with such Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
as might have indeered, and ingaged
your liking: But sith (as I mistrust) I have not
in some places, upon just admonition, none
shall bee more ready to agnize his errors, and
amend them, than my selfe.</p>
