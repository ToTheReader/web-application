   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this present booke welbeloued Reader, I haue taken vpō me to set forthe the trew and worthie cunning of the distillation of Mineralles, that is, of those hi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ges the which are founde in the Mines, as all maner of <hi>Saltes, Allomes, Vitrioll, Sulfur, Mercurie,</hi> and suche like Mettalles as <hi>Saturnus, Iupiter, Mars, Sol, Luna, Venus.</hi> And how you shall get the licour or moysture out of them. And all that whiche appertaineth to the health of man. The whiche I meane by the grace of God to set forthe in this booke, with a nū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Alchymistes</hi> preparations of the saied thinges, the whiche worketh won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully in mans bodie: so that it seemeth to diuers persones miraculous.</p>
   <p>Therefore gentle Reader peruse this booke with discretion, and then if thou seest it stande to thy mynde, set thy hande to the Plough &amp; be diligent in the worke, so that thou maiest knowe the proofe, and feele the readie commoditie thereof, for
<pb facs="44"/> ye shall vnderstand that there is no medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in the world that can be founde of so quicke operation as the Mineralles are, if thei be truly prepared and as I will shew you hereafter: But if thei be not well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared thei are very hurtfull, and not to be allowed. Therefore looke that ye prepare them as I shall shewe you, and then you shall wonder at their workyng.</p>
   <p>And although the worthie science of <hi>Alchymie</hi> is come in suche disdaine through leude persones, that it seemeth lyes and fables, and no true science: Yet that ought not to hinder or derrogate any thyng to our purpose, as long as our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is against the abuse of it, as for example</p>
   <p>The <hi>Alchymistes</hi> haue wrought in this worke, to the intent that they might haue of leade and copper, golde and siluer, or the meane to make them of all other sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or sleight Metalles. But whether god hath giuen them that gifte I knowe not: therefore I leaue it to the maisters of that arte. And albeit we haue seen many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thinges in that arte: yet will I not affirme that it is possible to be doen, for it
<pb facs="45"/> seemeth vnreasonable, that a man in so shorte tyme should dooe that thing, the whiche nature doeth in many yeres. And that mē should presume to do that which God doeth onely him self, and not any of his creatures. We therfore will not affirme it to bee true or possible, nor yet denie it vtterly, or condemne it as vntruth. But we will leaue the aunswere vnto those that take it to be doen.</p>
   <p>But here in this treatise we wil set forth that whiche we haue seene and wrought, and proued, and are experte therein. And although it bee sprong out of the arte of <hi>Alchymie,</hi> yet it is not to that intente, for it serueth not to transmute Mettalles, but it serueth to helpe those diseased bothe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and outwardly: who of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chyrurgions are counted vncurable, and also giuen ouer of the Phisitions. Those pacients shalbe holpē through the hidden misteries and heauenly secretes of this science.</p>
   <p>And for as muche as it is vnpossible to prepare these thinges without the arte of <hi>Alchymie:</hi> therefore we must praise this
<pb facs="45"/> arte through our preparations aboue al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sciences, that maketh for the health of man, for thei preserue a man onely tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched &amp; afflicted with slight woundes and griefes on his bodie, and that with muche paine and muche adoe. But this arte gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto man his health againe in shorte tyme, and with small paine vnto the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, be he neuer so desparatly sicke, and to mans thinking past cure: for I haue seene miracles therein.</p>
   <p>And in so muche that it is all prepared with fire: the meane man calleth it <hi>Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.</hi> How beit the intēt of the <hi>Alchymiste</hi> is farre from our intent. But call it what you will, it maketh not muche matter of the name. For I am sure there is nothyng in all Phisicke that ministreth either bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or readier helpe to cure mans bodie, then this science of preparing Mettalles with fire rightly. I saie rightly prepared, not as the vnskilfull <hi>Apoticaries</hi> haue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them: or as the vnlearned Phisition haue occupied them, for the <hi>Apothecarie</hi> is no other then a seruaunt in the kitchin (as I maie tearme him) and no Maister
<pb facs="46"/> Cooke, so long as he knoweth not these preparations, whiche I will shewe you.</p>
   <p>In like maner it is to be thought of the Phisition that hath no skill in these prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. For we haue seene and proued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers tymes, that the first vapour or smoke of any Hearbe or Spice is the beste that is therein, and yet our learned Phisitions commaunde it to be boyled vntill halfe be consumed, &amp;c. Then note if the beste flye awaie in the boyling, what strength can the medicine haue. Therefore I saie that the Phisition without this arte of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is little or nothyng worthe, although they take the pacientes money. For he goeth to worke blindly with a blinde lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whiche is the Apoticarie. But the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition that is experte in this science, and doeth prepare his medicines truely, he is to be praised aboue all other. For a man cā not buye with any money that whiche is got by long carefull trauaile. Therefore is the arte of <hi>Alkimie</hi> worthie to be praised, and the <hi>Alchymiste</hi> to be praised also, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thei attaine not to their first inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō, yet thei haue opened the way, through
<pb facs="46"/> the whiche this excellent cunnyng of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was knowne and founde, and through the which there are a number of wonderfull secretes opened, the whiche without this arte were all vnknowne, to the great hinderaunce of the sicke and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seased persones. Therfore I will not speake against it, but holde it in greate estimation to our intention, that is to the helpe of the sicke and diseased person, and to prepare the Minneralles wherewith you may doe that whiche can not be done with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hearbes, or simples, or Spices. And hearewith will we finish this preface, and wright of the names of the simples, the whiche are occupied in this arte.</p>
