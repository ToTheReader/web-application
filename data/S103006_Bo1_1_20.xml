   <p>It may happily be thought that this treatise (by reason of the tartnes of some speeches phrases, &amp; censures, passed vppon Mr. Be. the ministers, &amp; Church of England) may passe the bounds of Christian wisdom &amp; charity: especially considering that we of the Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be ignorant, what great offence ther is taken at Mr. Barrowes bitternes in his discovery, &amp; that we know how greatly the forward preachers &amp; professors of the land desire to be mildly &amp; gently handled, &amp; to have a charitable censure paste of them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects of their Religious dispositions to the truth: wel: For Mr. Be. let him know for his part that he is fallen into a deep pit of Apostacy from his formerly seeming sincerity, &amp; if men may be judged by that which is visible, I see no reason why the forward preachers &amp; professors of the Lands should not esteem of him as they do of Mr. Merbury, sith Mr. Be. is now fallen to his gracious Lords as wel as the other: only Mr. Ber. case is somthing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this respect, that he wanteth some of Achitophels pollicy, &amp; Rabsakeh his rayling, &amp; of Tertullus Rhetotick to oppose the truth: in respect whereof ther is hope that Mr. Be. sinning through infirmity, simplicity, weaknes of judgment, &amp; violence of affection may by some sharpe effectual ingredients, having vomited vp al his choler, &amp; purged out al his evil humors, be reduced eyther to as good, or to a better constitution then wherin he formerly was &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>o this purpose is al the sharpe phisick administred vppon him in this prescript: &amp; so the Author doth intreath Mr. Ber. in his best love to interpret it: &amp; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what Nathan said vnto David: thou art that man: &amp; what David answered Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than: I have sinned: &amp; what comfort Nathan presently annexed: The Lord hath put away thy sinne: This condition we vnfeynedly wish to Mr. Be. our old &amp; kind frend: &amp; for the forward preachers &amp; professors of the Land, they must vnderstand, that our censure must be &amp; is only according to that which is visible in their communion: now in that respect seing the Church, Ministery, VVorship, and Government, of the English Ecclesiastical as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies is judged &amp; proved false, &amp; Antichristian: how is it possible that wee should speake otherwise of them as they are ministers and members of that Antichristian body then as of false ministers &amp; false Christians what would they have vs speak as the false Prophets did, Peace, Peace, where ther is no peace? would they have vs proclayme, The Temple of the Lord: The Temple of the Lord: to the Synagogues of Antichrist? this were to deceave them, &amp; to daube the wal with vntempered mortar: but if the forward prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers

   <p>But if ther be any in the assemblies, either forward preacher &amp; professor that seeth this truth of the Seperation, &amp; yeeldeth not in obedience to forsake that Antichristian way, &amp; to walk in the truth, let him know, that seing his hart cōdemneth him, God is greater then his hart: &amp; blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth: &amp; thus humbly &amp; hartily desiring the Lord to shew the light of his truth more &amp; more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Land, &amp; at the length vtterly to disperse al that myst &amp; darknes that overshad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth &amp; obscureth the truth, I cease writing: wishing all welfare to the vpright hearted Reader.</p>
