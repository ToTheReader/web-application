      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat I have thus cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen patron, and by a dedication singled you, know Sir, it is an act not enterpriz'd without consulted thoughts: I often leveld, and you still became my marke: For if wee beare (as indeed wee should,) a thankefull commemoration, even of all by-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, how much more then ought wee to intend the maine, and more immediate? Had my choise beene made otherwise I should have swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Ab officio;</hi> and there is a gratefull
<pb facs="3"/>remembrance rests in mee, which would have prompted me I had done amisse. Large courtesies, ask large ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements. Many there are, who by indeavours of this kind, have sought to render satisfaction for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits received: but no such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction must be made of mine; whose utmost end and scope, is only to shew you the ready will I beare to doe you service. And if you shall vouchsafe to esteeme them, but as the shaddowes, of what I desire to demonstrate by more reall effects; you have then tooke the hight of my intentions. The subject I confesse somewhat too light for your eare: oft conversant in more serious studies. wherefore it is taught a becomming distance; nor is it to harbour least hope of your perusall, untill you have taken truce with time, and meane to passe it with varietie: then if you shall reade, it may perhaps not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
<pb facs="3"/>you. My errors in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, (some being necessarily inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to humanity,) I submit unto your censure: which I know will be like your selfe; mild, and candid. I had rather be imputed ignorant, then ingratefull. Receive then (Noble Sir) these first fruits of my pen; a present (I ingenuously acknowledge) farre beneath your merits: yet, how much the lesse that is in quality, so much the more shall be your praise in the acceptance: and you shall for ever bind me to bee, as well in act, as word</p>
