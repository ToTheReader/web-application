   <p>And now most noble Queene, seeing God
hath aduanced your H. to this great honour,
honour him againe that hath honoured you.
Forget not him that hath remembred you,
and serue him faithfully, that hath preuented
you with blessings liberally. Two Annaes are
famous in scripture:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1.</note> Anna of Elkanah for her
godly posteritie in Samuel, Anna of Phanuel
for her deuout pietie in praying in the temple.<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 36.</note>
Elka<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ab, whose wife the first Anna was, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth,
the possession of God: Phanuel, whose
daughter the second was, is as much to say, the
sight of God. Anna also is interpreted, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or mercifull. Answerable vnto these
<pb facs="4"/>
names were the effects: the first had a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sonne Samuel, a possession of God in deede:
the second saw Christ in the temple and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
him: and both of them were vertuous
women. God graunt vnto your Highnes the
possession of Elkanah, encrease of spirituall
sight, and knowledge with Phan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>els daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

with God, and to shew mercie and compassion

   <p>Two other of this honourable and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

      </gap>decessours, one wife to
Richard the 2. sister to Wincelaus king of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemie;
the other, ladie Anna Bullen, wife to
king Henrie the 8. and mother to our late
gratious Soueraigne Q. Elizabeth. The first
is honoured for her studie in the Scriptures;
who had in those blind daies the 4. Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
in English,<note place="margin">Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> in true
religion, her Christian charitie and princely
liberalitie toward the poore, whose almes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
that way in three quarters of a yeare, are
summed to be 13. or 14. thousand pound. And
now God hath sent vs a third Queene Anna,
which we trust in all these princely vertues as
<pb facs="4"/>
shee continueth the Christian name, so will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viue
the honourable fame of these vertuous
matrones. That innocent ladie Queene Anna
Bullen, though by the malice of her aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
traduced, yet both by her godly death, and
Gods blessing vpon her posteritie is sufficiently
cleared. At her coronation these verses were
exhibited:
<q>
         <l>Regina Anna, paris regis de semine nata</l>
         <l>Et paries populis aurea saecla tuis.</l>
         <l>As Anna Queene of princely race
doth equally descend,</l>
         <l>So to her people golden daies
her offspring shall extend.</l>
      </q>
These propheticall verses, if I may so call thē,
had their due accomplishment afterward, in
the happie issue of this Ladie, then vnborne,
Queene Elizabeth, by whome indeede this
Church of England enioyed a golden time:
<hi>such as the like (as his Maiestie saith) hath
not been read nor heard of since the daies
of the Romane Emperour Augustus.</hi>
