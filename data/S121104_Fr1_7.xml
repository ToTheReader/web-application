      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He principall virtue of mans soule is Reason, unto whose power the soule would have every thing subject, if it might; because that is the Standard to trie the truth; in the knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of principally the soule is delighted But because arguments alwayes appeare not, by the weight of which reason may try the truth; the soule is content to beleeve or unbeleeve such things, as it cannot trie by reason; either for the credit of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or for the desire which it selfe hath, that they should be so, or not so. The first degree then of the powers of the soule above reason is faith: but because the soule is loth to bee deceived, therefore will it not alwayes come so farre as to beleeve, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit a thing, but is content to hold it in opinion: and yet upon a more sleight view, to suppose something to be, or not to be, true or false for a time: for a man may suppose that to be, of which he will not entertaine an opinion that it is, yea and have
<pb facs="17"/> an opinion of that, which he doth not constantlie beleeve; yea and beleeve that for which he cannot give a sound proofe that it is. So that faith, opinion, and supposition, are of larger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe one than another, and all of greater circuit than reason Yet because the imagination that lovely <hi>Dalilah</hi> is ever service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reason her <hi>Samson,</hi> though never faithfull; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is nothing in any of these three, which the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dares not be busie with; therefore by the helpe of imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reason enquires into the workes of all these, using thereto saying and gain-saying, likelyhood and unlikelyhood, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on every side, till it come to a conclusion, in which it will rest, at least for a time. And as every minde or soule is more noble and excellent than another, (for there are many more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of excellencie in spirituall substances than there bee in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily) so doth it exercise it selfe in the most hard and excellent things. And to set all other matters aside (for all other are farre beneath the knowledge of God, and the assurance of our faith in him, which is our present search) let us see by what degrees we are come unto that taske which we have undertaken.</p>
   <p>Religion is a band or tyall of the conscience in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God, in respect of the excellency of the reward to them that doe well, or of the punishment of them that doe ill: for there was never any religion true or false, but it was set in the service of some God, whom the worshippers beleeved to bee just in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding both good deeds and bad, and that not only in this life, but much more in another, where they perswaded themselves the soule was immortall, as one of their false prophets truely said, <hi>Virtus recludit non meritis mori Coelum.</hi>— Seing then that religion (as every other thing that is reasonably undertaken) proceeds from the knowledge of the End; and that all religion doth suppose an everlasting happinesse, or punishment to the soule in immortality (excepting only that of the pestilentiall Sect of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who though they confessed God, yet thought that the promises and threatnings of the Law stretched no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to this life only, and therefore denied the resurrection, the soules immortality, Angels, Devils) It might seeme that I, who enquire of religion according to the discourse of reason, might hold it sufficient to lay downe the reasons of the positive
<pb facs="17"/> Doctrine without any mention of heresies or contrarie opinions, and that I ought first to enquire,<note place="margin">See Chap. <hi>39.</hi>
      </note> whether there be any such happinesse at all, as is supposed in the life to come.<note place="margin">See Chap. <hi>40.</hi>
      </note> Secondly, whether the soule be immortall, and so capable of eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse. Thirdly, whether the soule although immortall, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a separate and an entyre being by it selfe, or whether when it departs out of the body, it doth not returne into the <hi>Chaos</hi> of life, as a drop of water falling into a river: for if any one of all these points faile; that is, if there be no happinesse at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, or if the soule enjoy it not, because it dyes, or if that happinesse be not peculiar and entyre to the soule by it selfe, and in it selfe, then the end of all our religion is utterlie frustrate. But for the present, they shall be onely as <hi>postulata,</hi> or suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the proofe shall appeare hereafter in the Article of <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life.</hi> And concerning heresies, I confesse that in this disputing age, wherein men will rather seeme to know, that they may oppose the truth, than willingly to submit themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, I had great doubt in my selfe, whether by the remembrance of them, I might not give occasion to such as itch after opinions, to be tainted with these stinking ulcers, or at least cause a doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or falling away of them that are weake, when they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diversities that have been, and still are concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But when I remembred the saying of S. <hi>Paul 1 Cor. 11.19. There must be heresies even among you, that they that are approved might be knowne:</hi> I supposed that this benefit would grow thereby, that men in the examination of opinions might be more firmely grounded in the truth of God, while they take heed to his word, as to a light that shines in a darke place. Therefore as Mariners set Buoyes and Seamarkes for avoyding of shipwracke; or as Physicians describe <hi>Aconitum</hi> and other poysonous herbs, that they may be avoyded, so are these heresies here set out.</p>
   <p>Moreover in this triumph of the truth of Christ, a great part of the captive traine should have beene wanting, if they had not been driven before the triumphant Coach: Whereas now the Christian may have comfort to see how the truth hath been fought against, but yet hath overcome; hath beene besieged, not taken, battered, not shaken: so that hereafter he may contemne
<pb facs="18"/> the force of any adversarie. And for feare of danger, I thinke there is none, when both by Scripture and reason these heresies mentioned are so utterly overthrowne. But if any contrary to both these will yet bee licking of that foule vomit, Let him that is filthie, bee filthie still; and let him that is holy, be holy still. The heresies I mention under the most usuall and knowne name, not reckoning up for ostentation, all those that were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of that opinion. The word <hi>Heresie</hi> I use at large, for any opinion which a man doth chuse to maintaine against the truth; knowne or unknowne. And herein I put not onely the perverse opinions of them that have beene called Christians, but also those false positions of the Heathens, who profest Philosophie, of whose traditions and false principles we are admonished to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware <hi>Col. 2.8.</hi> And these things being thus remembred, let us now with due reverence and regard first be assured, <hi>That God is,</hi> that we may know what that glorious truth is, which is the ground and rule of all truth, and the foundation of our most holy and Christian religion: because that this foundation being once laid, the spirituall building of our most glorious faith may on that firme Rocke be raised up in all the parts thereof perfect and entyre. And as we know that the author of all truth hath no need of our Lye, whereby to be justified: so where the truth is manifest, let us not shut our eyes against it, because we know that it is the shine of his being upon our understanding; and that for this end, that our understanding and will being enlightned thereby, we may find the way to everlasting happinesse.</p>
