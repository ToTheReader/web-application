                 <title>Tobacco tortured, or, The filthie fume of tobacco refined : shewing all sorts of subiects, that the inward taking of tobacco fumes, is very pernicious vnto their bodies; too too profluuious for many of their purses; and most pestiferous to the publike state. Exemplified apparently by most fearefull effects: more especially, from their treacherous proiects about the Gun-powder Treason; from their rebellious attempts of late, about their preposterous disparking of certaine inclosures: as also, from sundry other their prodigious practices</title>

   <head>A Ware-lash for wood-braines.</head>
   <l>THe sluggish sort, who snorting sleepe, and liue like lazie louts,</l>
   <l>False frauds will frame to mate each man; yet firke them with their flouts.</l>
   <l>The Serpent slie, the subtile Snake, will fawne vpon each Feare;</l>
   <l>And coldly crewle till they be crept into the bosome deare,</l>
   <l>Of them that pitie their complaints, and waylings well do way:</l>
   <l>But (if in breast they once be borne) to sting they neuer stay.</l>
   <l>The Caterpillers carping crew, with these I may bring in;</l>
   <l>Who liue o'th labours of good men: yet passe they not one pin,</l>
   <l>What cold, what irkesome wearie nights, what tedious tasks, what toyle;</l>
   <l>Nor yet, how many meatlesse meales men haue, nor what turmoile.</l>
   <l>Yet, <hi>Deacon</hi> deare (not dreading darts of furious franticke fooles)</l>
   <l>Hath wouen a web, and wrought a worke most meete for stately Schooles.</l>
   <l>He feares no force of Vipers b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oode, nor Caterpillers crew;</l>
   <l>But frankly of his owne accord puts it to publike view.</l>
   <l>In it he toucheth no mans state, of high or low degree:</l>
   <l>Surmounting sinnes he would suppresse, as soothly men may see.</l>
   <l>Each vice put downe in open Booke, I might in order name,</l>
   <l>Had not the Author to our hands, so soundly shew'd the same.</l>
   <l>And sith the man gapes not for gaine, nor praise from men pretends:</l>
   <l>Afford him thanks for his great paine, and so you make amends.</l>
   <l>This guerdon iust if you grudge at, I should accompt you wurse</l>
   <l>Then Iudas he, (that treacherous wretch) who bare about the purse.</l>
   <l>But, hope I haue, you will accept thereof by due desart,</l>
   <l>And it applaud: and so (deare frends) adieu with all my heart.</l>
