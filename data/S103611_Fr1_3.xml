      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Presse hath gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into one, what fancie had scattered in many loose papers. To write this, love stole some houres from businēsse, and my more serious study. For though Poetry may challenge if not priority, yet equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with the best Sciences, both for


<pb facs="4"/>
antiquity and worth; I never set so high a rate upon it, as to give my selfe entirely up to its devotion. It hath too much ayre, and (if without offence to our next transmarine neighbour,) wantons too much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the French garbe. And when it is wholly imployed in the soft straines of love, his soule who entertaines it, loseth much of that strength which should confirme him man. The nerves of judgement are weakned most by its dalliance, and when woman, (I meane onely as she is externally faire) is the supreme object of wit, we soone degenerate into effeminacy. For the religion of fancie declines into a mad superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,


<pb facs="4"/>
when it adores that Idoll which is not secure from age and sicknesse. Of such heathens, our times afford us a pittyed multitude, who can give no nobler testimony of twenty yeares imployment, then some loose coppies of lust happily exprest. Yet these the common people of wit blow up with their breath of praise, and honour with the Sacred name of Poets: To which as I beleeve they can never have any just claime, so shall I not dare by this essay to lay any title, since more sweate and oyle he must spend, who shall arrogate so excellent an attribute. Yet if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of a chaste Muse shall bee more acceptable, and weigh heavier


<pb facs="5"/>
in the ballance of esteeme, than a fame, begot in adultery of study; I doubt I shall leave them no hope of competition. For how unhappie so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I may be in the elocution, I am sure the Theame is worthy enough. In all those flames in which I burnt, I never felt a wanton heate, nor was my invention ever sinister from the straite way of chastity. And when love builds upon that rocke, it may safely contemne the battery of the waves, and threatnings of the wind. Since time, that makes a mockery of the firmest structures shall it selfe be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>umated, before that be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht. Thus was the foundation layd. And though my eye in its survey,


<pb facs="5"/>
was satisfied, even to curiosity, yet did not my search rest there. The Alabaster, Ivory, Porphir, Iet, that lent an admirable beauty to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward building, entertained me with but a halfe pleasure, since they stood there onely to make sport for ruine. But when my soule grew acquainted with the owner of that mansion; I sound that Oratory was dombe when it began to speake her, and wonder (which must necessarily seize the best at that time) a lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, that dulled too much the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the minde, onely fit to busie themselves in discoursing her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Wisdome, I encounter'd there, that could not spend it selfe


<pb facs="6"/>
since it affected silence, attentive onely to instructions, as if all her sences had beene contracted into hearing: Innocencie, so not vitiated by conversation with the world, that the subtile witted of her sex, would have tearm'd it ignorance: Wit, which seated it selfe most in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, and if not inforc't by good manners, would scarce have gain'd the name of affability. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, so timorous, that it represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a besieg'd Citty, standing watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon her guard, strongest in the loyalty to her Prince. In a word, all those vertues which should restore woman to her primitive state of


<pb facs="6"/>
beauty, fully adorn'd her. But I shall be censur'd, in labouring to come nigh the truth, guilty of an indiscreet Rhetoricke. However such I fancied her, for to say shee is, or was such, were to play the Merchant, and boast too much the value of a lewell I possesse, but have no minde to part with. And though I appeare to strive against the streame of best wits, in erecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>g the selfe same Altar both to chastity and love; I will fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> once adventure to doe well, without a president. Nor if my rigid friend question superciliously the setting forth of these Poems, will I excuse my selfe (though justly perhaps I


<pb facs="7"/>
might) that importunity prevail'd, and cleere judgements advis'd: This onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> dare say, that if they are not strangled with envie of the present, they may happily live in the not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slike of future times. For then partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ceaseth, and vertue is without the idolatry of her clients, esteemed worthy honour. Nothing new is free from detraction, and when Princes alter customes even heavie to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, best ordinances are interpreted innovations. Had I slept in the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of my acquaintance, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted no study beyond that which the chase or field allowes, Poetry had then beene no scandall upon me, and


<pb facs="7"/>
the love of learning no suspition of ill husbandry. But what malice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in the Country upon ignorance, or in the City upon Criticisme, shall prepare against me, I am armed to endure. For as the face of vertue lookes faire without the adultery of Art, so fame needes no ayde from rumour to strengthen her selfe. If these lines want that courtship, (I will not say flattery) which insinuates it selfe into the favour of great men, best; they partake of my modesty: If Satyre to win applause with the envious multitude; they expresse my content, which maliceth none, the fruition of that, they esteeme happie.


<pb facs="8"/>
And if not too indulgent to what is my owne; I thinke even these verses will have that proportion in the worlds opinion, that heaven hath allotted me in fortune; not so high, as to be wondred at, nor so low as to be contemned.</p>
