   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue not without faire cause inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed this Sermon vnto you. First, It was preacht in that sacred Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference and Assembly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you were a principall part: Secondly, it was preacht
<pb facs="5"/> vpon your owne ground, euen in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of your owne <hi>Bethell,</hi> your owne Chappell. Thirdly, it was preacht for one, who was, not long since a conspicuous member of your Company, and one, who hath laid vp his greatest trust, for the decur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of many great workes of Charitie, in your faithfull hands. As it is then iustly consecrated vnto you, so I desire you to receiue it with the right hand, that it may passe vnder the Conuoy of your worthy names; This is the first time, that euer I set to Sea in this publike manner, that euer my Name came into the Printer's stockes.</p>
   <p>And though I haue not wanted that, which is now made the common bridge of Pretence vnder which most Bookes passe, I meane the Abetting of diuers friends to these Publications; nor yet I thank my God some small thongs of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner abilities in my selfe, yet had it not bin, out of conscience of my thankfulnesse to my blessed friend of euer-deere memorie, rather to keepe vp his Remembrance, then to spread mine owne, I would still haue
<pb facs="5"/> kept mine owne priuate way, and neuer haue rode in the common dust. But so sweet was the thought of his tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction euer vnto mee, that I could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rest of my selfe by erecting him a monument onely in mine owne heart, but that I must present this walking monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him in paper to all the World, and first to you. Nay, sooner had this small Barke of mine floated abroad, but that the last yeere God troubled our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and turned them into bloud. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, I hope it is not out of season, for a man that cannot serue the Occasion, and pay at day, to pay a due debt, when the Occasion serues him: though I could not by reason of that storme put out im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after his death: yet now it comes as an <hi>Anniuersary,</hi> at the end of a yeere, to kindle his Memory once againe.</p>
   <p>Therefore I humbly craue, that you would bee pleased to lodge these poore labours in your good opinions, and the rather for his sake, whose goodnesse yet sparkles in your eyes, and the Image of whose vertues is in this little Codicill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<pb facs="6"/> to you. So shall you binde vp his Name in your owne names: And further beare a strong obligation of Respect and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie ouer</p>

      <signed>Your Worships most deuoted poore friend and Seruant, <hi>NAT. SHVTE.</hi>
