      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe, these foure Bookes of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, collected and set foorth, by M. CONRAD HERES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BACH, a great and a learned Councellour of the DVKE of Cleues: not thinking it reason, though I haue altered and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his vvoorke vvith myne ovvne readinges and obseru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>tions, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vvith the experience of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry my freendes, to take from him (as diuers in the like case haue done) the honour and glory of his ovvne trauayle: Neyther is it my minde, that this eyther his dooinges, or myne, should deface, or any vvayes darken the good enterprise, or painefull trauayles of such our Countreymen of England, as haue plentifully vvritten of this matter: but alvvayes haue, and doo geue them the reuerence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to so vertuous and vvell disposed Gentlemen, namely, Master Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert, and Master Tusser, vvhose vvoorkes may, in my fancie, vvithout any presumption, compare vvith any their Varro, Columella, or Palladius of Rome. You haue here set dovvne before you, not only the rules and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the olde auncient husbandes, as vvell Greekes as Latines, vvhose ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry orders (for the most part) at this day vve obserue, and from vvhom (yf vve vvyl confesse the trueth) vve haue borrovved the best knovvledge &amp; skill, that our skilfullest husbandes haue: but also haue ioyned herevvithall, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and husbandry of our ovvne husbandes of England, as farre as eyther myne ovvne obseruations, or the experience of sundry my freendes vvoulde suffer me. And though I haue dealt vvith many, both Graines, Plantes, and Trees, that are yet strangers and vnknovven vnto vs, I doo no vvhit doubt, but that vvith good diligence and husbandry, they may in short time so be denisend and made acquainted vvith ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> soyle, as they vvyl prosper as vvel as the olde inhabitantes. It is not many ages agone, since both the Peache, the Pistace, the Pine, the Cypresse, the VValnut, the Almond, the Chery, the Figge, the Abricock, the Muske Rose, and a great sort of others, both Trees and Plantes, being some Perseans, some Scythians, some Armenians, some Italians, and some Frenche, all strangers and aleantes, vvere brought in as nouelties amongst vs, that doo novve most of them as vvell, yea and some of

them better, being planted amongst vs in England, then yf they vvere at home. I haue also been carefull about the planting and ordering of the Vine, though some of my freendes vvould haue had it omitted, as altogeather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to our countrey: because I am fully persvvaded (yf diligence, and good husbandry might be vsed) vve might haue a reasonable good vvine grovvyng in many places of this Realme: as vndoubtedly vve had immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Conquest, tyll partly by slothfulnesse, not liking any thing long that is painefull, partly by Ciuil discord long continuing, it vvas left, and so vvith time lost, as appeareth by a number of places in this Realme, that keepes still the names of Vineyardes: and vppon many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>liffes and Hilles, are yet to be scene th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> rootes and old remaynes of Vines. There is besides Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, an auncient house called Chylvvel, in vvhich house remayneth yet as an auncient monument in a great vvyndovve of Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ssing of Vines. Beside, there is yet also grovving an old Vine, that yeeldes a Grape sufficient to make a right good vvine, as vvas lately prooued by a Gentlevvoman in the saide house. There hath moreouer good experience of late yeeres been made, by tvvo noble and honorable Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ons of this Realme, the Lord Cobham, and the Lord VVyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams of Tame, vvho both had grovvyng about their houses as good vvines, as are in many places of Fraunce. And yf they ansvvered not in all pointes euery mans expectation, the fault is rather to be imputed to the mallice and disdaine peraduenture of the Frenchemen that kept them, then to any yll disposition, or fault of the soyle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Beside, that the nearenesse to the South, is not altogeather the causer of good vvines, appeareth in that you haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Orleans, great store of good and excellent vvine: vvhereas, yf you goe to Burges, tvvo dayes iourney f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
