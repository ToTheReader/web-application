   <p>
      <hi>PHilotas</hi> the sonne of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Plutarch in the life of Alex.</note>
was a man of great
estimation among the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi>
and next vnto
<hi>Alexander</hi> held to be the
most valiant of the <hi>Greekes:</hi>
patient of trauaile, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
bountifull, and one that loued his men
and friends better then any Noble-man of
the Campe: but otherwise noted of vaine-glorie
and prodigallitie, in so much as his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hauing notice of his carriage, warned
him to make himselfe lesse then he was, to
auoide the enuie of the Campe, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of the King, who grew suspicious of him
in respect of the greatnesse of his Father,
<pb facs="70"/>
and his owne popularitie, and by hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of certaine vaunts of his vsed to
<hi>Antigona</hi> a fayre Curtizan borne in the cittie
of <hi>Pidna,</hi> with whome being in loue, he let
fall many braue wordes, and bostes of a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
to aduance his owne actions and his
fathers, terming <hi>Alexander</hi> at euery worde
the young man. Which speeches <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gona</hi>
reuealing to a companion of hers, were
at length brought to <hi>Craterus,</hi> who with the
woman carryed them to <hi>Alexander,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>Philotas</hi> lay open to all the aduantages
that might worke his ouerthrow.<note place="margin">Q. Curtius lib. 6.</note> And in
the end concealing a conspiracie (which
was reueald vnto him) intended against
the King, was thereby suspected to haue
beene a partie in the plotte: but brought
before <hi>Alexander,</hi> hee so defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that hee obtayned his pardon for
that time, suppd with the King that night,
and yet the next day notwithstanding, was
arraignd for the same fact, which he stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
denying, was afterward put to torture,
and then confest his treason. And indeed
<hi>Alexanders</hi> drawing a pedegree from heauen
<pb facs="70"/>
with assuming the <hi>Persian</hi> magnificence; was
the cause that withdrew many the hearts
of the nobilitie and people from him, and
by the confession of <hi>Philotas</hi> was that, which
gaue a purpose to him and his father to haue
subuerted the King assoone as he had esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
<hi>Asia,</hi> and freed them from other
feares, which being by <hi>Ephestion</hi> and <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus,</hi>
two the most especiall Councellors of
<hi>Alexander</hi> grauely and prouidently discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
was prosecuted in that manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
their neerenesse, and dearenesse with
their Lord and maister, &amp; fitting to the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the state, in the case of so great an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirer:
who no doubt, had he not beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented,
