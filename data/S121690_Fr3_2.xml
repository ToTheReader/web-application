      <hi>J. D.</hi> wisheth all temporall happines, with the confluence of all spirituall Graces in this life, and eternall blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the life to come.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>Right Honorable, and my most honored Lord and Lady,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S long peace and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are the common causes of carnal securitie and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, so these the vsuall forerunners of feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full punishments, seeing in this desperate Disease (which we may fitly call, the stone in the heart) more gentle Medicines will not effect the cure. For when mens hearts are come to brassy or flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hardnesse, nothing will melt them (without some extraordinary worke of the Spirit) but the fiery furnace of Affliction, nothing will bruise and breake them, but the heauy hammer of Gods
<pb facs="492"/> dreadfull iudgements. And this is manifest in the examples of all Ages, which are left vnto vs in the Scriptures, to giue vs warning. As of the old world, <hi>Sodome</hi> and her bordering Cities; and of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> Gods owne best beloued people, all which, as they were lulled asleepe in the Cradle of carnall Security, with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and bewitching tunes of peace and pleasure; so were they alwayes, when they least suspected it, surprised vpon the suddaine in their lethargie of sinne, with some remarkable plagues and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments. And therefore considering with my selfe, that our long peace, plenty and prosperity hath infected the most that liue in our land, with deepe security and retchlesse carelesnesse, and caused them to dreame, that this Sun-shine will neuer set: I could not chuse but suspect, and daily expect the neer approching of the other, and that the darke night of affliction and calamity will ere long surprize vs, vnlesse the loude cries of Gods Ministers doe speedily awaken vs out of our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie, and moue vs to meet the Lord and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent his iudgements, by turning vnto him in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayned repentance. In which regard, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted and called by God to bee one of his (though least worthy) watchmen, whose office requireth, that we should not only our selues keep the spirituall watch, but also, as much as in vs ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, awaken others: I thought it my duty, by giuing warning of these approaching dangers, to
<pb facs="492"/> rowze vp as many as I could out of this sleepe, or rather lethargie of securitie. And because my voyce were farre too weake (though I could, as the Lord requireth, lift it vp as a Trumpet) to be heard of all the people of this Land, I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to conuay the sound thereof (as it were) by these paper Pipes, euen vnto the most remote places; and to those especially, where the liuely voyce of Gods faithfull watchmen, is rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard; either because the meanes of their maintenance by sacriledge and Church-robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or symonicall fraud is taken away; or because dumbe, or idle and sleeping watchmen doe hold their places, without any care to performe their duty, as neither keeping the watch themselues, nor being either able or willing to keepe others waking. The which my labours I haue made bold to dedicate vnto your Honors: To you, my Lord, I confesse, not without some presumption, as not being hitherto known vnto you, yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not vnexcusable, in that it proceedeth from a desire to shew how much I honor you, for your profession and protection of Gods true and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Religion, in that Honourable place vnto which God hath called you; your loue to Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and fouour towards the Learned. But to you Noble Ladie, in whose notice and vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued respect, I haue beene more happie, I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted this poore part and mite of my worthlesse Workes, that liuing in these Paper Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="493"/> as it were, in my longest lasting posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I may, euen after death hath imposed silence, still testifie vnto the world mine humble loue and vnfayned thankefulnesse, for your manifold and great fauours vouchsafed vnto me; and how much I honor you for those singular vertues and graces, wherewith God hath inriched you, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially your piety towards him and loue of his truth, much approoued, as by many other fruits, so especially by your loue to his Ministers and Ambassadors. The which were ample matter for a larger discourse, to incourage others of your ranke to imitation, did not your modesty and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility attending and adorning all the rest, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish mee that such praises of you, vnto you, will bee thought vnnecessary, if not vnpleasing and distastfull. The Lord infinitely rich in all goodnesse and perfection, more and more multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, all Christian Vertues and sauing Graces in you both; in the light and lustre whereof you shall be euer more truly honorable in the sight of God and all those that feare him, then in the highest dignities and noblest aduancements that the world can yeeld vnto you.</p>
