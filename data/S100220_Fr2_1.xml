   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, thou maist (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) wonder why this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the businesse of Amboy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, so many months since taken vpon the oaths &amp; depositions of our people that came thence, and presented to his Majesty, and the Lords of his Priuy Councell; cometh now at last to the Presse, and was not either sooner published, or altogether suppressed. The truth is, the English East-India Company haue euer been very tender of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent amity and good correspondence held between this Realm and the Neatherlands, and haue been very loth, by diuulging of the priuate iniuries done
<pb facs="3"/>
them by the Neatherlands East-India Company, to giue the least occasion of any distaste or disaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which might haply growe between these two Nations, for the sake and on the behalf of the two Companies respectiuely. For which cause, although the wrongs and iniuries, or rather contumelies done vnto the English by the Dutch in the Indies, haue beene as intolerahle as manifold; as to say nothing of those great heapes of them buried in the <hi>Amnesty</hi> of the Treaty of the yeare 1619. and only to point at the generall heads of those commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted since that Treaty, and grossely contrary to the maine int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>nt, and expresse words and disposition of the same: first, in the point of hostility; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>asion of the Islands of Lantore and Polaroone, then and before in the quiet possession of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, in the name of the Crowne of England; the taking of the same Islands by force; the razing and demolishing of the English Forts; the binding of the English (that had not so much as resisted them) to stakes with ropes about their neckes, throttling them with the same, and flourishing their naked swords about them, as if they would presently haue dispatched them; then taking them so amazed and bound, and tumbling them downe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>he r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>cks; and after, carrying their crushed and bruised carcases away in irons: secondly, in the
<pb facs="3"/>
point of their vsurped soueraignty; their taking vpon them the Conusance of controuersies between the English and the Indians, for matters passed farre without the compasse of the Neatherlands pretended jurisdiction, and executing their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences therupon by plain force; seizing of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Companies goods; fining, imprisoning, stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, yea, whipping our people at a post in the open market-place, and after, washing them with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar and salt: thirdly, in point of partnership with the English; their putting great sums to the common account, which were disbursed to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate and sole behoofe of the Dutch; giuing great Presents for the glory of the Dutch, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the English, and making warre for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of their owne dominion, yet bringing the charge to the common account; together with infinite other the like, the particulars whereof would arise to a just and ample volume: Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, the English Company from time to time contented themselues with informing his Majestie and his Honourable Priuy Councell with their grieuances priuately in writing, to the end that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary relief and reparation might bee obtained, without publishing any thing to the world in print, thereby to stir vp or breed ill bloud between these Nations, which are otherwise tied in so many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall
<pb facs="4"/>
obligations. And the same course they haue hitherto holden also in this crying business of of Amboyna; onely offering to the <hi>Manes</hi> of their murdered Countrey-men, Factors and Kinsfolks, their effectuall endeauours in a dutiful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ourse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majesty, for justice for their innocent blood, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>nd reparation of the honour of the nation heerein interessed. In which their wonted way they were so constant, that they could not be driuen out of the same by the contrary course of some of the other party; that not glutted nor mollified with the blood of these innocents, nor with all the other sufferings of the English in the Indies, published a Pamphlet in print in the Netherlands Language, not only in justification of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>his barbarous butchery, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in disgrace of the English Nation, and the laws and justice of the same. But behold now further, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>e same Pamplet, being called-in by an Edict of the States generall, was yet afterwards translated and printed in English, and dispersed euen in this Realm it self, to braue and disgrace vs at our own dores, and in our owne language. This, no English patience can bear: the bloud of the innocent cryes out against it: the honor of the nation suffereth in it. Wherefore the English East-India Companie is heerby inforced, contrary to their desire and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, to haue recourse also to the Presse, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="4"/>
the reputation of those their Countrey-men and seruants, that lost their liues vnjustly; and to acquaint the world with the naked truth of this cause, hitherto masked, muffled, and obscured in a fog of fictions, concealments, and crafty conueian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Author of this Pamphlet, and his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>lients the Gouernor &amp; Councel (so termed) of Amboyna.</p>
   <p>Hauing thus acquainted thee, gentle Reader, with the reasons why this businesse was no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>, and to be so grosly ouertopped, outraged &amp; vilified there: as also thou wilt no lesse admire that any of the Netherlands nation, which hath receiued such and so many fauors and supports f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>nswer thy
<pb facs="5"/>
selfe, if thou but consider the different end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe of the English &amp; Dutch Companies trading in the Indies, appearing by their seueral course and practise respectiuely. The English being subiects of a peaceable Prince, that hath enough of his owne, and is there with content, without affecting of new acquests; haue aymed at nothing in their East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>India trade, but a lawfull and competent gaine by commerce and traffick with the people of those parts. And although they haue in some places builded Forts, and settled some strength, yet that hath not beene done by force or violence, against the good will of the Magistrates or people of the countrey; but with their desire, consent and good liking, for the security only of thè Trade, and vpon the said Magistrate and peoples voluntarie yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues vnder the obedience and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of the Crown of England; their owne anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lawes, customes and priuiledges, neuerthelesse reserued. Further, the same English had vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted confidence in the Neatherlands Nation there also trading, especially being lately conjoyned with them in the strict alliance and sociall confederacy of the year 1619. and therefore attended nothing from them, but the offices of good affection and partnership. Upon these grounds, the English Company made their equipages answerable only to
<pb facs="5"/>
a course of cōmerce and peaceable traffick; not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any hostility, neither from the Indians, nor especially from the Dutch. On the other side, the Neatherlanders, from the beginning of their trade in the Indies, not contented with the ordinary course of a fair and free commerce, inuaded diuers Islands, took some Forts, built others, and laboured nothing more, than the conquests of Countries, and the acquiring of new dominion. By which reason, as they were accordingly prouided of shipping, souldiers, and all warlike prouision, as also of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Rendeuouz vpon the shore, and thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to wrong the English as well as others: so the cost and charges of their shipping, Forts, and soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, imployed vpon these designes, rose to such an height, as was not to bee maintained by the trade they had in those parts. Wherefore, for a supply, they were forced (as some of their owne Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Aduenturers in their Company, affirm) to fish with dry nets, that is to say, to pick quarrels with the Indians, &amp; so to take their ships, &amp; make prize of their goods. Which yet not answering their charge and aduenture, they proceeded also to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with the English, to debarre them of trade to free places; and for attempting such trade, to take their ships &amp; goods. Touching which, when a good order was set by the said treaty of the yeer 1619.
<pb facs="6"/>
yet they saw, they could not make their reckoning to any purpose, vnlesse they vtterly draue the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish out of the trade of those parts; thereby to haue the whole and sole traffick of the commodities of the Iudies in these parts of Europe, in their owne hands; and so to make the price at their pleasure, sufficient to maintain &amp; promote their conquests, and withall to yeeld them an ample benefit of their trading. Which vnlesse they can, by this and the like worrying and wearying of the English, bring to passe, it is easie to be iudged by those that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any thing of the course and state of the trade of those parts, that albeit their returnes heerafter should proue as great continually, as of late extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily they haue happened to be, yet the maine stock and estate of the Company must needs abate and decay by some hundred thousands of pounds yeerly. Thus, Reader, thou seest what hath made vs vnprouided against such accidents, and what now enforceth the Dutch East-India Company, or their seruants in the Indies, against the common <hi>Genius</hi> of their Nation, and the wonted firm af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection between these two Nations mutually, thus to degenerate, and break out into such strange and incredible outrages against their neerest allies and best-deseruing friends. Farewell.</p>
