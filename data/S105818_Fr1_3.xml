      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all controuersies men should know
what both sides graunt: &amp; what they hold
differing. So where I turne all the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps
against Rome: and did so twelue yeres
agoe against the Popes champion, D. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes
Pistorius,</hi> sent to moue warres in
<hi>Zwitzerland:</hi> reason would for facility of ending controuersie,
I shew how much they graunted me: and knew they must:
that if any of mine owne nation, come short: and that with
Satanean malice: they be dealt with, as endeuoring to make
our Church a synagogue of Satan. The matter shalbe briefly
told.</p>
   <p>Doctor <hi>Iohn Pistorius</hi> holden a father of the Iesuites, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in <hi>Friburge</hi> of <hi>Briscouia,</hi> distant twēty English miles from
<hi>Basil,</hi> was stird of the Pope to chalenge all our <hi>Cantons</hi> for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation:
that they ought to yeeld to the Pope, as the seauen
did: And vpon disputation refused, hee would by war cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
his supremacy. This then was thought no pley. Vpon
this Syllogisme the mayn stood.</p>
   <list type="syllogism">
      <item>If the scripture bee corrupted, another judge
must be had: that is the Pope: who onely doth
chalenge that.</item>
      <item>But the scripture is most corrupted: as <hi>Geneva</hi>
graunteth <hi>in Rob. St. praef. to the N. T.</hi> for Ebrew
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
double readings (848. as <hi>Elias</hi> reckoneth them) and
<hi>Arias Montanus</hi> hath written an whole work <hi>in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratu,</hi>
of the old Testament, corrupted in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in
52. yeares, in so many places: and <hi>Beza</hi> checketh and
vnchecketh the new, that none knoweth what to
stand to: and the enemies graunt, is still strong against
himself.</item>
      <item>Therefore the Pope will require by warres that
ye make him judge.</item>
   </list>
   <p>A <hi>Rhoetian,</hi> brought vp at <hi>Berne,</hi> named <hi>Caspar Clause-christi,</hi>
at <hi>Leyden</hi> saw my scripture Concent: where I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the old Testament to bee pure to euery letter by the
<hi>Massorites,</hi> and say the Apocrypha bee all lying workes or
Ironies: mackages of fooles. I taught him so much En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish:
and expounded the matter at large to him: and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
the Creed with the Gospell. <hi>D. Fr. Iunius</hi> had
told him hee was euer of my mind: and one M. <hi>Baudertius</hi>
shewed my Theseis to the Vniuersity, and the Vniuersity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them. By this he saw the Pope was berest of hope
to giue a charge to vs, where he hoped of victorie: or by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hennean
torment: as <hi>Athean</hi> a dream as his that wrote,
<hi>our Lord had gone into the second death, when God raised him
vp,</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. Diuinitie may not be handled
with respect of persons: But if <hi>Quirites</hi> yeeld to me, so far
I will defend Rome and <hi>Mentz:</hi> and if <hi>Lacus Lemanus</hi> make
the fish dead: and <hi>Wintonia</hi> haue but a sack full of wind,
which Aeolus gaue to <hi>Vlisses,</hi> when his fellowes thought
it full of a great treasure, and forced him to open it, and
so by tempest drowned themselues: that chester wil I leaue
to the wind, to bee shut vp in <hi>Vlisses</hi> sack: and leaue Lema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>
to the snow water of the wild <hi>Alpes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The <hi>Rhoetian</hi> saw all the Popes hope gone, by the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
proued true in text: and the Apocrypha to be workes
of men that knew not Christ, and all in sadnes to be foolish,
and the going of the soule to Paradise to bee spoken in the
Creed, and he told me with great asseueration, that if I went
to <hi>Zwitzerland,</hi> I should remoue war. I went presently to
<hi>Basil:</hi> and <hi>Zurick</hi> and <hi>Berne</hi> heard: and vsed me with all kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Mine host of <hi>Basil,</hi> a D. of Law, <hi>D. Iacobus Henric-petri,</hi>
had occasion to goe to <hi>Friburge</hi> to D. <hi>Pistorius:</hi> and on a
thursday at Supper spake much of me to him. Then D. <hi>Pisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
sayd: <hi>The scholers of England be learned in the tongues:
but it were better they knew the Fathers better.</hi> On Fryday my
Doctor telleth me what he sayd: On Saterday I gaue a Greek
reply to the Post: as <hi>Pistorius</hi> triumphed in Greek: to this
summe.</p>
   <p>The Greek Fathers were in eloquence vnmatchable: and in han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
of the Trinity, and Incarnation of Christ, and Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by faith, and of holy soules passage hence to heauen, and of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to <hi>Gehenna,</hi> they all agreed: and none euer of 1400. yeares
thought of Purgatory: as their oration in the Synode of <hi>Basil</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
160. yeares ago: which <hi>D. Iacobus Zwinger</hi> yet hath.
And so much learning as their age could vse against eloquent
heathen, God gaue them. But they had no occasion to deale much
for text of scripture with such: and therefore lesse studied it: But
for the Lords Supper, This was their common opinion: that the
Bread and Wine were <hi>Icones and Symbola,</hi> Images and Tokens
of the body and blood of Christ: As <hi>Origen</hi> spake the consent of his
age: and <hi>Eusebius</hi> from his great Librarie, the recorder of common
graunts: And eloquent <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and others by <hi>Typi</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>typa,</hi>
and as the most sage <hi>Theodorite</hi> in sad disputation to clear
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>
other matters, bringeth the same as a graunted common matter, to
proue douted: so <hi>Macarius Monachus</hi> sheweth his dayes opinion,
calling the bread <hi>Symbolon</hi> of the body. And none wise could
doubt: marking vpon what prophecy the Lordes Supper stood. The
Angell Gabriel told holy Daniel that after 490. yeeres, Christ the
King by his death would end sacrifice and offrings. And the
Iewes dated all dayes in common Epistles and conueyances, the
yeares since the returne from <hi>Babel:</hi> as wee the yeres of our Lord:
in whose last yeare, they, By Daniel, looked, the Kingdome of
heauen should appeare, <hi>Luc.</hi> 19. though they knewe not in what
manner. Nowe when sacrifice was to end at the Supper of the
Lambe: our Lord, to seale the end of sacrificing, gaue, for beasts
flesh and blood, which figured his body and blood, bread and wine,
to bee in couenant speach his Body and Blood. All Graecians
knewe proper speach and civill: that hee should bee bad, that knew
not the place of both. In proper speach a Father begetteth his Son:
in ciuill speach <hi>Romulus</hi> was ancester to Iulian Apostata, Baasa to
<hi>Achab, Iechonias Salomontiades</hi> to <hi>Salathiel Nathanides.</hi>
So the token of a Kings seale, is called his seale. This all the Greeke
Fathers knewe: and tottering <hi>Theophylact,</hi> your onely, turneth
to this. And the taking of the Lords Supper, is our oth that wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
hee died in due tyme, to bury Moses by his buriall: and that
by grace his spirit is with vs to sure saluation: as mighty as by
his word it made the world. More is needlesse and cannot bee, but
is wickedly forged. So farr the Fathers were rare: not alwayes in
commenting vpon the Byble: But extremely deceiued almost all
in honouring the Apocrypha: which Iewes kept to play for Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus
against Appiones that denyed all the Iewes story. Therefore
not to plead with them from the Law full of paradoxes, they object
failes and humane workes to busy them for all: And they meant
litle further great matter in them. The Greeke Fathers sawe
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>
not this much: though <hi>Eusebius</hi> told the true law had but 22.
bookes. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> agreeth for the number: but misseth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
one Apocryphon, for holy: <hi>Iudith,</hi> as I remember: and
<hi>Athanasius,</hi> casteth out holy <hi>Hester.</hi> So we like of the fathers for
learning controverted in their age: not aey for comment. And
these groundes ye shall graunt me or combat: The Hebrew text
is kept by the <hi>Massorites,</hi> so that nothing can be corrupted to
alter one wordes signification. The Iewes knew their owne tongue:
and teach vs the native of it. In honour of the two tables of
613. letters, they bring all speches of lawes bidding or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
into 613. And hold that all which faith or life may think
of is in them: And the New Testament never goeth further:
And no one syllable helpeth Rome: but Italy is expresly cursed by
your owne translation as by all Iewes exposition, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.
vpon which all the Apocalyps maketh a reuelation. This En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
holdeth: and will not give place to Rome, but will dispute
with <hi>D. Pistorius</hi> Protonotary of the Pope at <hi>Basil,</hi> one day in
Hebrew, an other in Greek: with penners of every syllable of our
speach. Protonotarius is stout in these tongues: as he hath written
<hi>de arte Cabalistica:</hi> though he hath missed altogether: and sayth
all Rabbins say Melchisedek sacrificed bread &amp; wine: where none
ever thought so: but all hold it offred to Abrahams souldiers to
eat and drink, as he was a King: and blessed Abraham as a sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.
And for Greek Protonotarius and Pope are yet to learne how
to defend the purity of the New Testament, and to see Antique,
Septuagint Thalmudique and Apostolique dialects. And no Papist
ever could speak or write Ebrew &amp; Greek as coūtrey speach. Thou
knowest if thou dare dispute I may overthrow the Pope: Therefore
tell thine own hart, and write to him: that an English man wrote
to thee, that the chalenger will give over his chalenge: or hee bee
counted a shamelesse lier.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="10" facs="6"/>
To this effect I wrote to him a Greek oration: and sent
<hi>R. Rubens Chananean</hi> epistle, which honoured England a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all nations: that he might see he had not to deale with
a Thraso. Three dayes after he wrote to <hi>Zurick</hi> great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēdations
of my poor studies, specially of Greek eloquēce,
as native <hi>Attique:</hi> And at three monethes end, after much
combat in all Greek he writeth thus: <hi>I will not dispute
nor have our old Religion to be called into question.</hi> Then both
sides <hi>Cantones</hi> showted, that the feare of war was gone,
seing the Popes chalenger putteth vp this: <hi>that the Pope hath
not one syllable in the Bible for his defence: But is vnvinciblie
accused: and hath none that dare dispute in the holy tongues for
his defence. Now he dareth not for stark shame require suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
being so broken.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>After this what <hi>Basil</hi> spake to English of me, how for
one all England should heare better while <hi>Basil</hi> stood, one
<hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Brand</hi> of <hi>Londen</hi> and <hi>M. Ward</hi> of <hi>Cornewall</hi> they told me,
and belike at home: How they told <hi>Netherlanders</hi> that this
combat ended warres, and sware so: they will never deny it,
&amp; noble <hi>Danes</hi> know, and doubtlesse told their K. how they
staying for me at a ferry neare <hi>Leopoldus</hi> buriall, which they
had seen, and I would see, a <hi>Zurick</hi> hearing my name, sayd:
<hi>wee were in great feare of war, till the Englander brake Pisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius:
I would gladly see his countenance: which argueth the mind:
that in quiet words calmed boysterous preparation of warres: But
my hast cannot suffer stay.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And so sayd many strangers at <hi>Basil:</hi> and <hi>French</hi> were
earnest to bring me to their King. And what will to my rare
honour, the state of <hi>Basil, Zurick,</hi> and <hi>Berne</hi> meant, I will let
them write.</p>
   <p>Now for Iesuites humanity. <hi>D. Pistorius</hi> himself four
<pb n="11" facs="6"/>
yeares agoe asked <hi>M. Hakewill</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> at <hi>Friburge</hi> of me,
whether I was alive. He said, he left me at <hi>Francfurt:</hi> then
said he, I am hartily glad, and gave high good words. Now
he is dead, and I am sory, for I hoped to turn him. Now two
Cardinalls of Rome, <hi>Caesar Baronius,</hi> as the Iesuites of <hi>Mentz</hi>
told me, and an other whose letters were intercepted at <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delberge</hi>
(of him I heard no more) obteyned of Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
a principall Cardinalship for me: and dealt with <hi>Mentz</hi>
Iesuites to perswade me: who when they could not, Archb.
<hi>Ioh. Adami</hi> would have had me of his court, and obteyned
that in Chapter: saying that he reioyced more for my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of him with dedication of my Greeke translation
of the Prophetes, then for his late election to be Prince of
the Empire. And he should by order have part of his court
Protestantes: and he spake of me, as not misliking my reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
But then Q. E. died, and I returned, and he died soone
after. None but shamelesse will denie this. Now this is past
all deniall, that <hi>Mentz</hi> gaue me leave to print in Greeke
my owne Religion. That brake the neck of Purgatorie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
other Papistique great poincts. Of this the best of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
wrote to <hi>Franckfurt</hi> to the Kings agent: that of nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres so much was never obteyned of the Pope, as
that booke obteyned: Rome must allow what Mentz al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
And if <hi>Haides</hi> have but two places, as they graunt,
Heaven and hell, Purgatory must give back all the land that
it wan.</p>
   <p>Furthermore when my book of Concent came in
Latin, Pater <hi>Baltasar Ezelius</hi> in the hearing of his felowes
in their college at <hi>Mentz,</hi> spake as by common consent:
<hi>We allow all that that book hath:</hi> This I have printed in
Latin, and I am sure he will not deny it: and when we are
<pb n="12" facs="7"/>
both dead, none may: seing in my life time it is not denyed.
So this much is graunted me of Rome: to assure the simplest
so far, how far the city is sunk: And badnes or madnes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<hi>Nabal</hi> for name, &amp; <hi>Nabala</hi> for fame to him that will not
see how vpon this Rome graunt, the comment vpon the
Apocalyps is past reply.</p>
   <p>I have turned the Apocalyps into Hebrew: and so I
would expound it: if the Turky merchants would pay the
charges. If they refuse, I will leaue them to try, whether
strange shipwrack shall revenge them. Their agent <hi>L. Ed. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
gave the beginning: writing thus: <hi>If M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Br. may be
brought to Const. that may turne to the common good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome.</hi>
This he sent to <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Stapers.</hi> Seing our age fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
wee should sell all to buy the Pearle of heaven.</p>
   <p>Let the just be just still.</p>
