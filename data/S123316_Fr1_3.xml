      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, the whole care and burthen of the Ministery of the Lords word, is, or at the least ought to be, how to bring men to the liuing God, &amp; to pull them out of the kingdome of Satan that they might be planted in the Kingdome of Christ. Euery one should helpe forward this worke, which is the greatest, and the most honorablest worke in all the world. The miserable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state wherein they are, who do remaine vnder Satan and his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, (as all men do by nature:) and the most blessed condition that they are in, who are vnder Christ and his gouernment (as none are but by grace:) should moue men sufficiently thereunto. For mine owne part, what I haue done this way, these Sermons of mine in part will shew thee. Reade thē at thy leasure, &amp; marke them well: begin not alone, but make an end. For haply (as it is in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell) the best wine is reserued till the last. VVhen thou hast ended, if thou receiuest any profite thereby, blesse thou the name of thy God for it, vnto whom all honour and praise do belong; and pray also vnto the same God for me, the instrument therein of thy good; that so I may alwaies stand fast in the truth, and increase daily in all heauenly graces, to the honour of his name, and the good of his Church. Our daies (thou knowest (are corrupt and full of sinne, and we our selues are very fraile and weake: looke therefore to thy selfe, and keepe thine heart with all diligence. Run not with the world, neither decline after vanity, but cleaue fast vnto thy God, come life or come death: and be thou sure euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to worke out thy saluation with feare and trembling, and so fare thee well most heartily in the Lord.</p>
