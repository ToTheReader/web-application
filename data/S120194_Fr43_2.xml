      </hi> Durst appeale to the iudgement of a carnall Reader (let him not bee preiudicate) that there is no Historie so pleasant as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred. Set aside the Maiestie of the Jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diter; none can compare with it, for the Magnificence and Antiquitie of the matter, the sweetnesse of compyling, the strange varietie of memorable occurrences: And if the delight be such, what shall the profit be esteemed of that which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>GOD</hi> for the saluation of Men? J confesse, no thoughts did euermore sweetly steale Me and Time away, then those which I haue imployed in this subiect, and I hope, none can equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit others: for if the meere Relation of these holy things bee profitable, how much more when it is reduced to vse? This second
<pb n="826" facs="430"/> part of the World repayred, I dedicate to your Lordship, wherein you shall see <hi>Noah</hi> as weake in his Tent, as strong in the Arke; an vngratious Sonne reserued from the Deluge to his Fathers curse: modest pietie rewarded with blessings: the building of Babel, begunne in pride, ending in confusion, <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith, Feare, Obedience; <hi>Isaac</hi> bound vpon the Altar vnder the hand of a Father that hath forgotten both nature and all his hopes; <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> burning with a double fire, from Hell, and from Heauen: <hi>Lot</hi> rescued from that impure Citie, yet after finding <hi>Sodom</hi> in his Caue: Euery one of these passages is not more full of wonder, then of edification. That Spirit which hath penned all these things for our learning, teach vs their right vse: and sanctifie these my vnworthy Meditations to the good of his Church. To whose abundant grace J humbly commend your Lordship.</p>
