   <head>TO THE READER:</head>
   <p>
      <hi>Reader looke for no apology, or excuse for this worke of myne, I make no question but the matter contayned in it will plead a necessity of making it publike. Reade and pervse that throughly. The second part of my former labour, thou shalt looke for (if the Lord will, and I liue) e're long, but not presently, for I haue something to doe before I can fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it. Pray for me that I may be furnished with grace, to write for thy good. Faerwell in the Lord.</hi>
