      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendly Reader, after J had (for my priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) translated some few notes out of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Historie, J was requested by some of my good friends to take further paines in the whole: which J was the rather desirous to performe, as well to satisfie their friendly requests, as also for diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respects. The first whereof was, for that my selfe had been a trauailer in this Countrie of Hungarie, and had (in regarde my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade there was not long) but superficially noted the manners and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition of the people there, and specially in their martiall affaires, wherein (during my residence there) J spent my time with some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of those parts, where then J had been: which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding did now with delight draw me on to begin and proceede in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of this Historie. The second reason that induced me hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, was, in regard that it seemed no fiction or fabulous toy, but a Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of grauitie and credence, as witnesseth the memorials of <hi>Stephen Broderic</hi> Chaunceler of Hungarie, and of <hi>Castalde</hi> Lieutenant for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> (who was King of Hungarie) in that countrie, and diuers others: which being so, J rested with assurance that it would greatly benefit thee for thy experience in many pollitike affaires. And the third reason that perswaded me to vndertake this worke, was, that J did, and also doe still, hartely desire that it might be, in things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to vs, as a president and caueat to these parts of Christendome that now thinke themselues as secure, as once the Hungars did, and they then as safe from the deluge of Infidels, as we doe now. But alas, such was their pride and dissention (vnhappie people) that (through their owne misgouernment) God inflicted this punishment vpon them, which now as remedilesse, and altogether in dispaire, they with wofull laments too late bewaile: for though that some neighboring Princes
<pb facs="4"/>
(whom the cause doth also neerely concerne) may affoorde them their best ayde, somewhat to withstand and bridle the Turkes mightie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions; yet surely farre vnlikely, and more vnable they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquer that which they haue lost: the reason is too apparant, for both in regard of multitudes of men and militarie discipline, they farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the Christians, and it may be that those who may, will not, and those who would, cannot affoorde them that succour which is needfull; so that, what betweene the one and the other, this miserable Hungarie (which is one of the fertilest and goodliest Countries in Christendome) is more shaken and torne by the Turkes violence and insolencie, then is a young Lambe betweene the VVolues iawes. Herein I must craue your patience to rest in silent melancholy (for mirth it affoords none) vntill the end, and lend your patient eare vnto detestable complots, impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and seditions; vnto ignominious conspiracies, immanities and cruelties; vnto horrible massacres of men, women and children that be Christians; vnto pitiful laments and mournings of husbands for losse and forcing away of their wiues, and wiues for their husbands; vnto violation and rapines of maydes; and to be briefe, vnto sacriledges, burnings, and deuastations of all manner of creatures: which when all these things shall liuely be discifered vnto you in this Historie, then iudge of the state of this poore Countrie into what an abisme of miserie it is fallen. J omit to write of many particulars concerning the Turkes politike proceedings, for the incroching vpon Christendome: touching all which (because J would not be tedious) I refer you to the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie it selfe, wherein more at large you may discerne their entercourse and temporising with Christians, which indeede is nothing else, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their owne commoditie to make vse of them, vntill they finde fit oportunitie to aduance their intended practises against them: and then adue league and all societie of friendship: onely this J say, and humbly desire God of his mercifull goodnes, to inspire Christians with that humilitie and faithfull repentance, that it may assure our harts of turning this iudgement from vs, which our Lord of his mercie graunt for Iesus Christs sake, and extirpe these Mahometaines, who (as our owne eyes may witnes) daily (with teares and griefe we may speake it) infringe the confines of Europe with their heathenish and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proceedings; as more at large this Historie will amplifie.</p>
