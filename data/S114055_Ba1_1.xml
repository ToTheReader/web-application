Perkins : Wherein his sundry abuses of Gods sacred word, and most manifold mangling, misaplying, and falsifying, the auncient Fathers sentences,be so plainely discouered, euen to the eye of euery indifferent reader, that whosoeuer hath any due care of his owne saluation, can neuer hereafter giue him more credit, in matter of faith and religion. The first part. Made by W.P.B. and Doct. in diuinty</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue hitherto set downe <hi>M. Abbots</hi> owne text word by word, that the juditious reader comparing it with my answere, may truly discerne vvhat substance is in his writing: And how farre forth he is to credit him in the rest, that hath in the first and best part of his booke, behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so insufficiently, in matter of learning; and dealt so dishonest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the manner of handling of it. There remaines behinde in this answere vnto my Epistle, some light skirmishes and vaine friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous brauadoes, vpon those points of controuersie; which I in one sentence only touched in the same Epistle, excepting much foule speech, and many slanderous lies, which he plentiful powreth out by the way: in both vvhich masteries, I willingly leaue to him the bucklers. Now because those his discourses, are (as it vvere) <hi>scopae dissolutae,</hi> not arguments soundly knit togither, and set in any good aray, but a feeble, loose, idle, and disordered kinde of wrangling; besides also, the very same questions be afterwardes handled againe distinctly and particularly: I haue judged it farre better, to handle throughly euery controuersie in his due place, then first lightly to skimme them ouer in hast, as he hath done; and afterward like vnto one, that had either forgotten or ouer-shotten himselfe, to recoile and turne backe againe, to treate of the same matter more orderly and substantially: vvhich course I hope wil not be misliked of the wise. Take (courteous Reader) this that is already finished in good part: If thou finde any thing in it to thy liking, giue the glory to God: And if thou be Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, helpe me vvith thy good praiers, that he who hath giuen me grace to beginne, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his blessings vpon me, to bring it to a good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect end.</p>
