A small token is welcome from a true freind; and I nothing doubt but this shalbe the better entertayned, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is sent from such a one, but also, for that it contayneth matter of Advantage, and that (as I trust I may boldely say) to your selues, as vnto those, who desyring, and endeavouring to be of that number to whome these most worthy preiveledges doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne, shall (in your due seeking) be right sure to enjoy, those many &amp; most blessed benefitts, which are here by vs discovered, and by God himself en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayled, to all his faithfull ones, for ever.
