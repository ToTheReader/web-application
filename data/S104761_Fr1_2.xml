      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT noble Lady, whose rare vertues, the wise no lesse honour, then the learned admire, and the honest ferue: how shall I, the abiect of fortune, vnto the obiect of honour, presume to offer so simple a present, as the poeticall discourse of a poore pilgrimes trauaile? I know not how, but, with falling at the feete of your fauour, to craue pardon for my imperfection: who hath redde of the Duchesse of Vrbina, may saie, the Italians wrote wel: but who knowes the Countesse of Penbrooke, I thinke hath cause to write better: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
