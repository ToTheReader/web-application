                 <title>A discourse of the sinne against the Holy Ghost : Grounded upon Matt. Chap. 12. vers. 22.-23. Tending to the comfort of such persons as, being afflicted in conscience for their sins, are, by the delusions of Satan, brought to the brinke of despaire, through feare that the have fallen into that unpardonable sinne.

      <pb facs="6"/>
      <p>Many have despaired for a time, and after beleeved, and so obtained pardon. Yea, a man may possibly despaire finally, and yet not sinne this sinne: because despaire doth not necessarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply any scorne, hatred, or malice, against the mercy and favour of God, which is the maine in the sinne against the Holy Ghost, Therefore despaire in this life, is so farre from being a kinde of this sinne, as indeed it is but a separable adjunct of it.</p>

      <p>FOr the not pardoning it must be understood in one of these three senses.</p>
      <p n="1">
         <hi>1</hi> That though happily it may be, yet it never was, nor shall be pardoned in event. Those that so understand it, give this reason. Our Saviour (say they) sayes not, it is impardonable, but shall not be pardoned: Those that goe to hell for other sinnes, their sinnes were unpardoned, but not unpardonable. So that their meaning is, that there shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be any instance, example, or experience of any in whom this foule act is pardoned. But to this I answer, that this very thing, that there n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ver shall be any instance or example, makes it unposs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ble, in some sense, to be forgiven. For <hi>frustra est po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tentia
<pb facs="9"/> quae nunquam produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur in actum.</hi> It is a vain possibility that is never brought to effect: and a vaine possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is as good as no possibility, and therefore no better then an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility. Besides, Saint <hi>Iohn, 1 ep. cap. 5. v. 16.</hi> sayes it shall not be prayed for; which yet it might, if there were any possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of forgivenesse; and <hi>Heb. 6.4.</hi> sayes it is impossible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them againe to repentance, speaking of the same sinne, or one not so bad.</p>
      <p>
         <label type="milestone">
            <seg type="milestoneunit">Sense. </seg>2</label> The second Sense that some give, is, that our Saviour means it may be pardon'd, but with a great deale of difficulty. But this may not passe for sound. There are two amongst the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists, men of great judgement (setting aside their affections and voluntary engagements to their own cause.)<note place="margin">Iansenius in conc. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. c. <hi>49</hi>
         </note>
         <hi>Iansenius</hi> and
<pb facs="9"/>
         <hi>Estius,</hi> who,<note place="margin">Estius in. sentent l <hi>2.</hi> distinct, <hi>43.</hi> §. <hi>3.</hi>
         </note> as in many other things, here jumpe together in this interpretation, The ground they build on, they thus levell: In that sense (say they) that our Saviour sayes that all other sins, except this, shall be forgiven, in the same sense he sayes that this shall not be forgiven; but hee meanes not that all those sinnes are forgiven to every one, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he meanes not that this sin is not forgiven to every one. Consequently (say they) hee must needes speake of facility of pardon in the former, and of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in the latter. But (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der correction) I thinke any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man may see our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our speakes of possibility and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility. For, sayes Christ, all manner or kinde of sinne and blasphemy, else, shall be forgiven to men: not every particular sinne to every particular man;
<pb facs="10"/> for then who shall be damned? But all sinnes in some men or other, and by consequence, this kinde of sinne in no man. As if I should say all diseases in men shall be cured, but the Pestilence taking the vitals shall not be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is manifest I speake of possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and impossibilities; for else it were as much as to meane that some diseases are easie to be healed, which are not easie, as desperate Feavers, desperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions and many others, which were a flat contradiction to the truth.</p>
      <p>
         <label type="milestone">
            <seg type="milestoneunit">Sense. </seg>3</label> Therefore I take the third interpretation to be most sound, that there is no possibility of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse: and that not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Gods power absolute who can doe wha soever he will, but in regard of his absolute will, who will not have it done, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be done. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility

         <hi>Austin:</hi> I thinke a brother then sinnes to death, when after acknowledgement of God by the grace of Christ, hee sets himselfe against the brethren, and burnes in envie against that very grace by which he was reconciled to God. See <hi>Gualter.</hi> Also <hi>Perkins</hi> his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue on <hi>1 Iohn.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>But to come to Argument▪ In that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> sayes it shall
<pb facs="11"/> not be prayed for, it shewes it must needes be some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary haynous crime. The Sinne of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was very great,<note place="margin">Act. 8.23.</note> which made <hi>Peter</hi> say, he was in the gall of bitternesse, &amp;c. Yet the Apostle there wishes him to pray for forgivenesse: pray God, if perhaps the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven.</p>
      <p>The Sinne of them that stoned <hi>Stephen</hi> was great and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it was <hi>peccatum aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> there was Envie, Pride, Murder, and persecution, all conjoyned, yet <hi>Stephen</hi> prayes for them. Therefore this sinne to death must exceed Pride, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Envie, Persecution, and then what can it be lesse then the sinne against the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p>Concerning <hi>Hebr. 6.4, 5, 6.</hi> who doubts but this sinne is also there understood.</p>
      <p>Yet with these two differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb facs="11"/> First, our Saviour, in the Evangelists, speakes most especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of sinne in speech that is blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie against the Holy Ghost, not excluding other kindes of Sinne; for, as he sayes all sinne and blasphemy shall be forgiven, that is, blasphemy, or any other sinne in thought or deed; so here againe, this blasphemy shall not be forgiven, nor any other sinne against the Holy Ghost, in thought or deed. It is sottish to thinke that this great sinne is onely confined to speeches, sith a man may be as bad or worse in deedes, as he can be in words. But here in the Hebrewes, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speakes more generally, as well of other sinnes against the Holy Ghost, as of blasphemy.</p>
      <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Musc. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in Mat. <hi>12.</hi> Istisunt duplicis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neru, &amp;c.</note>
         <hi>Musculus</hi> shewes a second difference: Those (sayes he) that sinne against the Holy Ghost, are of two sorts. First,
<pb facs="12"/> such as doe oppose and blaspeme that truth which they cannot but inwardly acknowledge, but have not at all given up their names to the profession of that Trueth, so these Pharisees, here in the Evangelists.</p>
      <p>Secondly, such as doe the like, but have also given up their names to it, and made profession of it, and of these this Epistle to the Hebrews chiefly makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
      <p>But notwithstanding this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, yet it is still the sinne against the Holy Ghost that is here spoken of: which thus I prove.</p>
      <p>The Sinne against the Holy Ghost, is a malicious deniall of, &amp; rage against a fundamentall, Evangelicall truth inwardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, therefore it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in <hi>Hebr. 6.</hi>
         <note place="margin">
            <hi>Heb,</hi> 6, 4, 5, 6.</note> For the fourth verse containes in it an
<pb facs="12"/> inward acknowledgement of such a truth aforesaid, to which adde the fift verse: and for the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious denyall of it, and rage and envy against it, it is clearely contained in vers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> 6 they fall a way and crucifie &amp;c. that is they so fall away as to crucifie Christ, and doe what they can to cast all the disgrace and scorne they can upon Iesus Christ and the Christian Religion: Not that every falling away is a crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for then had <hi>Peter</hi> been thus farre guilty; but <hi>sensu diviso,</hi> they so farre fall, as to commit this horrible indignity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude, it is clearely spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in this sixt Chapter.</p>
      <p>And as clearely is it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest in the tenth Chapter. The <hi>26</hi> verse containes in it this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acknowledgement of such a truth above mentioned: after yee have received (saith he) the
<pb facs="13"/> knowledge of the Truth: The <hi>29</hi> verse. containing a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rage against it. Who hath (sayes the Apostle) troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot the Sonne of God, — and done despight to the Spirit of Grace, not onely spoken; but done, not onely to Iesus Christ, but to the Spirit of Grace, that is, the Holy Ghost, which leades us forward to the fourth and last Difficulty; Why, seeing it is against the whole Trinity (as all sinnes are) and especially against Iesus Christ the maine of the Gospel, it's called a Sin against the Holy Ghost?</p>
      <p>
         <note place="margin">4. Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note>Why it is called the Sin against the Holy Ghost? which admits of two senses. For first, either Holy Ghost stands in opposition to man and uncleane spirits, to man, as it is a Spirit, to uncleane spirits; as it is the Spirit of holi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse, the Holy Ghost; and so it
<pb facs="13"/> must signifie the Holy God. Or secondly, it is taken for the third Person in Trinity, in relative opposition to the first and second Persons, the Father and Son.</p>
      <p>The ground of the first sense and interpretation lies thus: Our Saviour sayes that all blasphemy against the Sonne of man shall be forgiven, but not against the Holy Ghost; as if he had said, so farre forth as you sin against me, appearing but as a man, I will forgive you; but so farre forth as you sinne against me, appearing to be God as well as man, I will not forgive you. And whereas the word Holy is added to the word Ghost, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that (say they) is in direct opposition to that unholy and uncleane spirit of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> to whose power these blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers did impute Christs great and gracious worke of casting

         </gap>
         <pb facs="14"/> here understood by Holy Ghost, then all sinnes against the first Table are committed against the Holy Ghost.</p>
      <p>The second Interpretation is, that it stands in opposition to the Father and the Sonne; and is taken properly for the third Person in Trinity. Of which the Schooles give this as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: because this foule sinne is properly against the goodnesse of God. For (say they) power is properly attributed to God the Father, wisedome to God the Sonne, goodnesse to God the Holy Ghost. Consequently, sinnes of infirmity are against God the Father, sinnes of Ignorance against God the Sonne, sinnes of malice and wickednesse, against God the Holy Ghost. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>pon which notion of theirs, they inferre a reason why the sinne against the Ghost is onely

         </gap> an active opposition, resistance

      <p>Therefore to conclude this fourth thing: It is called the sin against the Holy Ghost, because although it be equally a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression against the whole Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who as they are equall, so in every sin are equally offended; yet it seemes most to reflect upon the Holy Ghost, by which Christ, as man, did all his great workes, <hi>Matth. 12.28.</hi> If I by the Spirit of God cast out Devils, &amp;c. by which to this day things are wrought that tend to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and sanctification of man fallen, by which Christ is made ours, and we Christs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called the Spirit of Grace, and despight is said to be done to the Spirit of Grace.</p>
      <p>Neither doth this thwart what is specified in the ensuing
<pb facs="17"/> Discourse, where it is said t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </p>
      <p>Thus have I (good Reader) as briefly as well I could, laid open those foure things, which seeme hard in this matter, and that I hope without any intren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching upon the ensuing Treatise. My aime herein is, thy satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; if I misse of it, it may be, it is either thy prejudicate thoughts, or slight perusall of what is written. But if thou hast duely weighed all things in the ballance of the Sanctuary, &amp; found any thing too light, tell me of it, and I will either satisfie thee, if I can, or crave pardon of God and thee, if I cannot. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cover the failings of me thy brother from others, so long as they doe not endammage others, and Iesus Christ for ever cover thine. For my part I could doe
<pb facs="18"/> no lesse then I have done in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing this small Worke follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I was told by a late friend, a little before his decease, that some Divines of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in the West of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, had Copies of the same, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> intending, if I had none, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish theirs. I thought it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very convenient to precede them in that Worke. First, that none might be more forward to continue the memory of my de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceased Father in any thing that might be usefull to the Church then I my selfe; and next to pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vent other Copies, that happily written at the second and third hand or more might be much different from the originall. In inditing wherof I know the, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ayme was at these things mainely. First, to comfort such afflicted mindes as thinke they have committed this sinne, but
<pb facs="18"/> have not. Secondly,<note n="*" place="margin">Quod non proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ab ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo esse commissum; nisi cum de corpore exlerit. Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>
            <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </gap>ust. Epist. <hi>50.</hi>
         </note> To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all rash judgement of the persons of others, whom we are apt to judge guilty of this sin, but are not. Thirdly, to admonish men of it, and to teach them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd the way that leades to it. Fourthly, to instruct all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true guise and nature of it. What acceptance other Treatises of his, those especially of Iustification and preparation, have found in the world, is knowne to the world; this also may finde some, offence I know it can give none. The Author de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires not thy prayers, who hath been dissolved, and beene with Christ now full twenty two yeares: those that he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>joy, for his sake bestow on me, how short soever I fall of him, how unworthy soever I be of them.</p>
      <p>I have beene somewhat too large, and perhaps the Reader
<pb facs="19"/> seeing the Treatise little, and the Preface long, will be ready to say as he, that seeing a little City and a great paire of Gates, said, the City perhaps will run out of the Gates. The Apophthegme is common. But to prevent such a thing, I will shut up the Gates, closing up all with my prayers that this fearefull sinne may a seldome be committed (if it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
