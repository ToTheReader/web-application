      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y owne forwardnesse (whereof it repenteth me not) hath sent forth other of my labours vnbidden, but this your effectuall importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie hath drawne forth into the common light. It is an holy desire that the eye may second the eare in any thing that may helpe the soule: and we, that are fishers of men, should bee wanting to our selues, if wee had not baits for both those senses. J plead not the disaduantage of a dead letter, in respect of that life which elocution puts into any discourse. Such as it is, J make it both publike and yours. J haue caused my thoughts, so neere as J could, to goe backe to the verie tearmes wherein J expressed them, as thinking it better to fetch those words I haue let fall, than to follow those J must take vp. That therefore which it pleased your Lo. to heare with such patient
<pb n="472" facs="253"/> attention, and with so good affection to desire, J not vnwillingly suffer abroad, that these papers may speake that permanently to the eyes of all our Countrymen, which in the passage found such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in the eares of your Citizens, and such roome in so many hearts. Besides your first and vehement motion for the Presse, your knowne loue to learning deserues a better acknowledgement, and no doubt findes it from more worthie hands. And if my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation would adde any thing, those should enuie you which will not imitate you. For the rest, God giue your Lo. a wise, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and couragious heart, that you may prudently and strongly menage these wilde times, vpon which you are fallen: and by your holy example and powerfull endeuours, helpe to shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten these reines of licentiousnesse: That so this Citie, which is better taught than any vnder heauen, may teach all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces how to liue; and may honour that profession which hath made it renowmed, and all Gods Church ioyfull: The welfare and happinesse whereof, and your Lo. in it, is vnfainedly wished, by</p>
