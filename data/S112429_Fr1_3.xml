      </gap>ronage of trifles, in this kinde,
hath long since rendred Dedications, and
Inscriptions obsolete, and out of fashion,
I perfectly understand, and cannot but
ingenuously confesse, that I walking in the
same path, may be truly argued by you of
weaknesse, or wilfull errour: but the reasons and defences,
for the tender of my service this way to you, are so just, that
I cannot (in my thankefulnesse for so many favours received)
but be ambitious to publish them. Your noble Father, Sir
<hi>Warham Sentliger</hi> (whose remarkeable vertues must be
ever remembred) being, while hee lived, a master, for his
pleasure, in Poetry, feared not to hold converse with divers,
whose necessitous fortunes made it their profession, among
which, by the clemency of his judgement, I was not in the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

and glad profession of it to the world. Besides, (and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

not the least encouragement to mee) many of eminence and
the best of such, who disdained not to take notice of mee,
have not thought themselves disparaged, I dare not say
honoured, to be celebrated the Patrons of my humble stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
In the first file of which, I am confident, you shall
have no cause to blush, to finde your Name written. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
you with this old Tragedie, without Prolog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

Epilogue, it being composed in a time (and that too, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
as knowing as this) when such by ornaments,
were not advanced above the fabricque of the whole worke.
