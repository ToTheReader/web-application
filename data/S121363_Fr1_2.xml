The Texts of Scriptures here expounded are all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and most of them mysticall; in the declaration whereof, if my observations second not your Majesties thoughts, yet I perswade my selfe they will occasion more divine raptures in your royall heart.

For that which is spoken commeth but to a few that are within hearing, and stayeth not by them; but that which is written, and much more that which is printed, presenteth it selfe to the view of all, and is alwaies ready at hand: and as it receiveth, so it maketh an <hi>impression.</hi> Which consideration, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, induced mee to give way to the desires of some friends, for the bringing of these <hi>illustrations</hi> of <hi>darker</hi> places of Scripture to <hi>light,</hi> especially because therein the proper He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies of these times are encountred, and the Doctrine and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline of the Church of England maintained by the Oracles of God, and the joynt testimony of prime Antiquity. In this Worke I owne nothing but the labour of many moneths, nay rather yeeres, in <hi>culling</hi> choice of <hi>flowers</hi> out of many hundreds of <hi>gardens,</hi> and <hi>platting</hi> them into a <hi>garland</hi> for Christ his Spouse. From which I humbly beseech Almighty God, that your Majestie, and all that touch any <hi>leafe</hi> thereof, may <hi>smell a savour of life unto life.</hi> The price and worth in all things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not the dedication; but in some the dedication maketh the price:<note place="margin">Plin. praef. nat. hist.</note>
