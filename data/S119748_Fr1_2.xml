   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Milius Macedonicus (Right
honorable) thinking to gratifie
Alexander the great with some
curious peece of workmāship,
waded so far in the depth of his
art, as strayning curtesie with
cunning, he skipt beyonde his
skill, not being able to make it
perfect. Who being blamed of Pausanias, for striuing
further then his sleeue would stretch, answeared: that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
arte and skill were wanting to beautifie the
work, yet heart &amp; wil did polish that part, which lacke
of cunning had lefte vnperfect, ouershadowing the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
of disabilitie, with the vaile of sincere affection.
Whose aunsweare, as one guiltie of the like crime, I
clayme for a sufficient excuse of my follie, that durst en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise
to striue beyond my strength, knowing my selfe
vnable, both by nature and art, to bring such a weighty
matter to a wise end. For if the fouler is to be condēned
of follie, that takes in hande to talke of hunting; or the
merchant counted as madde, which medleth with the
rules of Astronomie: then may I well be dubbed a dolt,
which dare take in hand to discipher the substaunce of
loue, that am but a lout; or to shew the force of fancie,
which am but a foole. But as there is not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
cooling carde to a rash wit then want, so there is not
a more speedie spurre to a willing minde, then the force
of duetie: which droue me into a double doubt: eyther
<pb facs="3"/>
to be counted as bold as blind Bayard, in presuming too
farre; or to incurre the preiudice of ingratitude, in being
too slacke; to bee thought vaineglorious in writing
without wit; or a thanklesse person forgetting my debt:
so hauing free choyse of them both, I thought it but a
light matter to bee counted ouer venturous, if I might
doe any thing which should shew some part of my due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
vnto your honour: neyther did I euer care to be coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
bolde, if that blemishe might eyther pleasure your
Lordship, or els make manifest my good will, whiche
alwaies did wishe to be with the formost of your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers.
But as wishes are of no value, so his will is as
vaine, that couetes to pay his debt with a counterfeite
coyne: wherein I both finde the fault, and commit the
offence. For being greatly indebted to your honour by
duetie, for the first payment I offer a peece of work nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worth the wetting nor wearing, the receiuing nor
reading, more meete for the Apothecaries pots, then a
noble mans hand; fitter for the pedler to rent, then Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
to reade. Yet if the worke be weighed with my
simple wit, it is downe measure; and if my good will
might serue for a weight, although the stuffe bee light,
yet there are few woulde be heauier in the ballance. So
that hoping of your honours wonted curtesie, that you
will marke the mynd, and not the matter; the will, and
not the worke; I commit your honour to the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
   <signed>Your Honours humble Seruant,
<hi>Robert Greene.</hi>
