   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orthie Reader, for
varietie sake, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
my idle time
to some vse, and to
offer my mite vnto
the Church of God,
that the graue and
learned men of our
nation may see, that
the Ministers of other reformed churches,
marche pouldron to pouldron with them
vnto the Lords combate: I haue vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
this translation, free from ostentation:
onely my ambition is (in tracing after the
stepps of my Authour) to haue one flurt at
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> and one push at the fall of the
great <hi>whore of Babylon,</hi> and so much the
rather, because mine eyes haue seene some
of her fornicatiōs, which some others haue
but heard.</p>
   <p>But it may seeme strange to some, that
a souldier should vndertake such a taske, as
<pb facs="4"/>
not appertaining to his profession: as that
man judges me a souldier, so I entreat him
to esteeme me a Christian, and then both
hee and I shalbe consonant.</p>
   <p>Wel then, into whose handes soeuer this
poore translation of mine shall come, whō
God hath alreadie inlightened, let vs sing
an everlasting <hi>Halleluiah,</hi> &amp; giue praise vnto
that great God, which hath translated vs
out of the kingdome of darknesse into his
merveilous light. And if it fal into the hāds
of anie that are infected with this <hi>deadly con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tagion,</hi>
I entreate them to reade it, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
it, for alas they are not able: because it
is grounded and bounded vpon &amp; within
the sacred word of God, and seconded by
the opiniōs of the most holy Fathers. That
were as if they should runne in vpon Gods
two-edged sword. That were as if a falling
and a running ennemy, beaten on all sides
should turne backe vpō a stand of charged
pikes, which are ready to receiue thē. There<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore,
it were better for them to suffer it to
graze vpō their stonie hearts then to resist.
And for my part, I will daylie praye vnto
the <hi>Father of lights,</hi> to illuminate and water
their soules with the beames and streames
of his <hi>Sunne of righteousnesse,</hi> that as Eagles
wee maye soare vp onely vnto him with
<pb facs="5"/>
the wings of our faith, in whom alone is
found the wel-spring of living waters and
noewhere else.</p>
   <p>As concerning the graue &amp; learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of this litle treatise, it were meere pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sumptiō
in me, to make an attestatiō of his
worth, whē the noe lesse wise thē H. Lords
of this state, haue abundantly testified the
same to all, by resolving on him, as the sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
they did know to re-establish the trueth
by his publique profession at Leydē. This I
will only day, that if a few spare houres cold
bring foorth this, we may well expect and
promisse our selves noe small fruit of those
holy labours, which shall hereafter bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.
Thus I beseech God to accept
of my weake performance, and giue a bles<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sing
vnto this and them.</p>
