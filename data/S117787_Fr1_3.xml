      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is plaine, I have not the least intent to gull thee in magnefying the <hi>Northerne Spaw,</hi> nor yet to tyrannize over thee, by confining, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating thy beliefe within the circle of my bare relation, by a generall avernment of what I write; for in nomination the parties who have received benefit by the water, I open unto thee a large field for thy satisfaction. If it doth appeare to thee (by conferring with any of them) that I have erred in some circumstances, stumble not at it. So long as I retaine the substance, it matters not for the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Nor thinke it strange that I omit others who have made use of the water, since it proceedes not out of ignorance of what hath past, but out of a tender regard I have not to burthen thy patience: supposing that the culling forth of the most remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able instances, would bee as satisfactorie to the judicious, as many heapes of examples. My purpose aymeth rather at a compendious realtie of things, then multiplicity of stories. Most of the parties I know, and have had conference with them: the rest I have received from such authenticall testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that I doubt not but their information, is of sufficient vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie to beget an undoubted confidence of their truths.</p>
   <p>If any of those mentioned in the following discourse (out of a nice scrupulocitie) thinke themselves disparaged by particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising their names, I am sorry that they should be so ignorantly curious since former times have afforded many presidents (writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by way of Councell, such as are those of <hi>Fernelius, Crato,</hi> and many others) wherein diverse of eminent quality (besides their names) have their diseases anotamised, without the least conceived jealousie of their reputations. They ought rather to blesse God, who hath in mercy vouchsafed them such easie meanes of their recovery, and glad themselues, that others by their example may be encouraged to have have recourse to the water for their reliefe.</p>
   <p>It may be, it is exspected that I should satisfie the learned in
<pb facs="4"/> one particular, namely, what assurance I can give that this our <hi>Spaw</hi> doth partake with Vitriol, and Iron, which once confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, there will necessarily follow an apparant probability of its ample performance of all and more then shall fall within the compasse of the following relations. This I foreseeing necessarily premising the conclusion, I desire that they would please to take for proofe of the infallibility of Vitriol the taste of the water, which is very acide, and rough upon the pallate, in plainer English, ynkish, and so like to Vitrioll or Copperes (called an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <hi>Attramentum sutorium</hi>) that there is little or no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the taste of the water and the substance of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioll touched with the tongue; or a drop of the oyle thereof mixed with a little water. Besides, take a glasse of the water (which in it selfe is translucid and very cleare, equaling the choicest spring) let the quantity be a pinte or thereabout, put to it so much Gall in powder as will cover our common far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, stirre it never so little, and the water receiveth a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Clarret dye. Or take a greene Oake sticke, bruise it at the end, and with it stirre the like quantity of water, and within a small space it is turned into a pure Saphir blew, or (standing a while with the sticke in it) to a Violet colour, both which hath beene often tryed. As for iron we account it a demonstrative note, the discollering of the earth and stones where the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the spring runnes: for it makes the channell red, which proceedes (as may be supposed) from <hi>Rubrique,</hi> otherwise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>mater ferri.</hi> And the better to confirme that the water is no stranger to iron, it is very well knowne that the whole soyle where this water riseth is full of iron stone, the plenty whereof hath beene such, that the working of iron stone hath beene a meanes to exhaust a world of wood growing in that part, there being yet to see the remainder of a great iron worke within halfe a mile of the spring. Nor is the iron stone so concealed but by digging in most places it is easily found, much of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in broaken bankes, and in the surface of the earth. I might boldly adde hereunto (for further proofe) the discolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the stooles of such as drinke the water, giving them a blacn or deep green dye, a common observed note in iron waters,
<pb facs="5"/> as also the operation of the water in all manner of obstructions, wherein (who knowes not) that iron doth claime an unparale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led excellency, but the ensuing discourse will make this good. Other notes an exact minerallist would easily produce, to whose discussing and disquisition I willingly leaue matters of this nature, they being improper for the spheare, both of my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and profession.</p>
   <p>How it comes to passe that these waters are thus vertuall, the learned can easily make appeare; for the mineralls that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixe with them once granted, from their natures will arise abundant satisfaction to all that are rationall of their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent use. As shortly thus. <hi>Sulphur</hi> (say they that write of it) attracts, resolves, mollefieth, discusseth, cooles and dries.</p>
   <p>Salt (whereof our Sulphur spring containes a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion) is astringent, detergent, purging, dispersing, attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, preserving from putrefaction.</p>
   <p>Yron saith (our learned <hi>D<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Iordan</hi>) hath an opening or deopilating quality, and an astringent also.</p>
   <p>Vitrioll (according to <hi>Diascorides</hi>) doth heate and binde. It hath an exceeding subtilty of parts saith <hi>Tho. Iordanus,</hi> and is of a penetrative quality.</p>
   <p>From their abstessive and incisive qualities, it is noted that these waters doe loosen and scatter viscuous and clammy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they attenuate the grosse, and after by their penetrative quality, the Liver, Spleene, the meseraique veines, reines, and other partes are deopilated, and by this meanes freed from such diseases as proceede from obstruction.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>D<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Turner</hi> in his discourse of Baths and minerall waters saith, that waters partaking of iron and Brimstone, coole and dry, that they are proper for all soares of the Kidneyes and Bladder, they both prevent and cure the strangury, Dry up rumes, are good for them that are short winded or stopped in the breast, that spit bloud, they cure the greene sicknesse, are very fit for cold flegmatick men that would gladly have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and have none; and so for women whose default doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from too much moistnesse of the matrixe, they are good by drinke or glister against wormes, and fit to allay the paines in the small guts.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>He saith also that where iron beareth the chiefe rule (as it doth in our <hi>Spaw</hi>) such waters are excellent for all manner of itch; hardnesse of the milt, diseases of the joynts, stiffenesse of the sinewes, cramps proceeding of moistnesse, numnesse or sleepinesse in any part, dizinesse of the head, the flixe, weake Kidneyes, pissing of blood, heate of urine, the oft, too much, and unwilling making of water, gnawings, and paines in the belly.</p>
   <p>Waters (saith <hi>Mounsieur Pigray</hi> in the observations of the <hi>German Spaw</hi>) whereunto ours are little (I am but too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest) inferiour, partaking of iron and vitrioll; revive the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, provoke appetite, facilitate digestion, free from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of obstructions; they oppose wonderfully the generatton of the stone, and hinder the knitting of the gravell with the glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous raw, and vescuous humor. The Hermetically learned (saith <hi>Hermannius Wolfus</hi> in his <hi>tractate de viribus, &amp; usu aquarum in Agro Cassellano</hi>) note that Vitroline waters have a faculty of mundefying and purging all the parts of the hody, corroborating the braine, curing the Epilepsie, exciting the appetite, killing all sorts of wormes, opposing the Palsey, Dropsie, Iaundise, breeding of the stone, suffocation of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, all inward oppilations, prevent the goute, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent qualities as may appeare in that his discourse in the third chapter. Which faculties joyned with the other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, our waters partaking with them all, how usefull these these waters may be, I leave to the consideration of those who are able to deduce particular instances from assured generall grounds. With these authors agree many learned ones, whose opinions I spare to transcribe, being very unwilling to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar{que}; my selfe in the discourse of these misteries, whereby I may be thought saucely to snatch the pen out of the Doctors hand, to whom I leave thee for further satisfaction, the former au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities being sufficient to grace our waters and confirme their vertue.</p>
   <p>They who with some violence put me upon this taske of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending to the generall notice this water, with its consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing springs, might (if they had pleased) have undertaken it
<pb facs="6"/> with a more plaucible entertainment: but their profession tending to prescribe to those who are to use the water (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) caused them to forbeare their paines, least a relation from them might seeme to reflect at their particular interestâª wherein I am altogether free.</p>
   <p>Omitting therefore all further apollogies, (for I feare the gates are growne too great for the Citty) rather then the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique should not bee benefitted, I have adventured bluntly to step upon the stage. Wherein if I may but be so happy, as by my weake (though willing) pen to invite any to the water for their good, and that I may receive of thee (that which an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest intention may challenge) the Plaudite of a favourablr ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, I shall thinke my small paines largely recompenced, and shall wish thee all successe in the use of these waters, and thy being partaker of that water, whereof whosoever drinkes shall never after be a thirst.</p>
