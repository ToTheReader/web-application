   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE</hi> Lord God, seeing that the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the men of <hi>Iudah,</hi> (the which he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, blessed, and beawti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before all the nations of the earth) notwithstanding all his benefits powred forth on them, would neither feare and serue him according to his word, nor yeeld vnto his goodnesse the pleasant fruites of Godlinesse: but rather, as Children most ingratefull towards their most louing and deare father, rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord their God, and angred him with their monstrous and manifold abhominations: neither by the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="7"/> reprehensions, admonitions, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and often preachings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the Name of the Lord, they could be moued to repent and turne to the Lord: but rather continued wallowing in their sinnes without repentance, to the high dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of God, and their owne horrible destruction: he now at the length put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a Parable in the mouth of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isayah,</hi> which concerneth the whole matter, and sendeth him therewith to those vnthankfull children. Agayne, the Prophet moued by the Spirit of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how little he had preuailed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his long preachings, prophesies and labours employed and bestowed on them: and how little they esteemed his plaine words and ordinarie dealing among them, he endeuoureth another way then before he accustomed, and vseth another kind of stile and veine of speaking. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he sayth, that he will now, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, or preach, or speake, as he was wont to do vnto them: but <hi>sing a Song:</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/> namely, the <hi>Song of his Beloued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Vineyard.</hi> The which being done, he expoundeth and applieth to the state and condition of the people of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> to whom he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the Parable, and of whome he had sung the Song. And by this, he would (if it were possible) moue and stirre vp them, who, as yet, would not be moued by any other wayes or meanes. Now, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken in hand to modulate this sweete Solace of the Prophet, I meane, <hi>the Song of the Beloued concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Vineyard,</hi> I haue thought good, not only to expound, but also to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the same, obseruing therein (as neere as I could) the methode and order of the<note place="margin">The diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the matter into three parts,</note> singer thereof: and therefore I haue made thereof three generall parts, <hi>viz.</hi>
   </p>
   <list>
      <item>1. A Proeme, or a preparation to a Song or Parable.</item>

         </gap>. The Song or Parable it selfe, with the exposition thereof.</item>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <item>3. The Application of the same for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and admonition, to this people and time.</item>
   </list>
   <p>The first part is made of these words<note place="margin">The first part hath fiue circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, or branches.</note> of the Prophet, <hi>Isay.</hi> 5. vers. 1. <hi>Now will I sing vnto my Beloued, a Song of my Beloued, concerning his Vineyard.</hi> And this part yeeldeth to our consideration these fiue things: <hi>viz.</hi>
   </p>
   <list>
      <item>1. The person of the Prophet, being <hi>the Actor,</hi> whereof there is made one Chapter. <hi>Chap. 1.</hi>

      <item>2. The manner of his dealing with the people, which is in a <hi>Song,</hi> as <hi>Chap. 2.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>3. The kinde and nature of his Song, which is a <hi>Canticle and Parable:</hi> as, <hi>Chap. 3.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>4. The person, to whome he consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Song: whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> is, <hi>to his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,</hi> as, <hi>Chap. 4.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>5. The Title of the Song, which is, <hi>Of his Beloued concerning his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> as, <hi>Chap. 5.</hi>
      </item>
   </list>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <p>The second part is made of the words immediatly following: <hi>viz. My Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued had a Vineyard in a very fruitfull hill,</hi>
      <note place="margin">The second part hath 6. branches.</note> &amp;c. vnto the end of the sixt verse, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eeldeth these sixe things to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: <hi>viz.</hi>
   </p>
   <list>
      <item>1. The great loue and mercie of God towards the people of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and thereof are made eight Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.</item>

         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. The horrible ingratitude of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> yeelding the vnpleasant fruits of wickednesse and sinne, as in Chap. 11. and 12.</item>
      <item>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>

            <desc>•</desc>

      <item>The Lords iust sentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb facs="9"/> and terrible commination of the execution of the same against them: and hereof are made foure Chapters, as in Chap. 15. 16. 17. 18.</item>
   </list>
   <p>The third part hath two Chapters,<note place="margin">The third part is an application of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as ver. 7.</note> and is made not only of the example of this Prophet, who hath applied this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the people of his time, as vers. 7. but also of the example of Christ Iesus in the Gospell, whom also his Apostles, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Paul, Iude, Iames,</hi> and other his Ministers, haue immitated, vsing to make such like Parables and Similitudes, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall instructions, and admonitions, by a sound application of them to the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, especially to the people in their times. So in those two last Chapters, haue I (in the feare of God) applyed the present Song or Parable (for an instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and admonition) to this our tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and Nation, and that the sooner, leas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> whiles we be busied in gazing on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> state and condition of others, we either forget or neglect our owne. Neithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
      <pb facs="9"/> may we thinke, but that both this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such Songs and Parables in the law, in the Prophets, in the Psalmes, and in the Gospell, may be worthely made appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorie, not only to them to whome they were then proposed: but also to all others in the posteritie, who are drenched in the same or like sinnes; the which in those Songs and Parables were reproued, and that both the one and the other, are kept in the holy Register, and layd downe (as <hi>Paul</hi> sayth) for examples vnto vs, who thereby be warned also to take heed, that we neither contemne nor abuse the loue and mercies of God, nor proue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind towards his goodnesse, after all his large bounties powred forth on vs: but that (as we are most bounden) we yeeld him the pleasant fruites of gratitude, and holy workes, the which he requireth and expecteth: lest we be both worthelie reproued, and rightlie recompenced with such greeuous plagues, as our sinnes do iustly deserue, and the which the Lord
<pb facs="10"/> hath yet in his mercy withholden from vs, most willing by his so long-suffring, wee should bee drawne to repentance. The Lord God graunt, that we may yet now at length be perswaded (by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his holy Spirit in our hearts, and the sound of his word in our eares) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that this is written and reserued for our learning also, and not for the <hi>Iewes</hi> onely: and that we may thereby the sooner consider of our present state and condition, and learne to be wise by the consideration of the hard haps of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, rather then to be schooled by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, the mistresse of fooles: which hath caused many a wretched wight to sing the Song of <hi>had I wist:</hi> when else they might haue modulated the Lords holy Song in their owne land in peace, to their exceeding ioy, and best solace. Moreouer, albeit that the wise man needeth not to haue line vpon line, and lesson vpon lesson, here a little, and there a little, (as those foolish <hi>Iewes</hi> needed
<pb facs="10"/> to haue, whome therefore the Prophet <hi>

         </gap>sayah</hi> reproueth, and vnto them, all was little enough): yet because the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the most part, vnwilling to be wearied with large discourses, like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>er of briefe lines, then of long lessons, I haue for their sakes disposed the parts into certaine particular Chapters, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matters and circumstances of the same, as ye may perceiue, being (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) most willing (after the example of this Euangelicall Prophet) to vse that way and meane, which might best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Readers, and allure hearers, of that which shall bring rest to their Soules, and do them most good.</p>
