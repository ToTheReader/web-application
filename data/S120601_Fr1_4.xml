no lesse seene in
Science, then in

by Fortune, found to his

studies, but also prospectiue
in eache kinde of pleasure: he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoreth
himselfe to his wunted
exercise, in so muche that he was
renowned for a Poet, but how? not
as our Poets, that prefer the praise
of women: but hee onely was a
<pb facs="8"/>
Poët more to contemne looue,
then by any way to commend it.
And therefore he was of women
vtterly abandoned, insomuch that
the women gaue him this name,
<hi>Poeta Puella,</hi> a Maidenlie Poët.
And beeing one day walking for
his delight, in a pleasaunt plotte
not far frō his lodging he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried
by a Lady named <hi>Caliphia;</hi>
who of long time had heard of his
contempte, and wrong oppinion
in looue. And beeing desirous
to vse some conference with him,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> that bothe time and place fitted
so well, she addresseth her selfe no
lefse to salute him: then hee seeing
her pretence, prepared to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
such courtesie, which beeing
by bothe performed; shee with a
sweete and sober voice, began to
say. Sir, if my sudden approche
might bee no preiudice to your
<pb facs="8"/>
learned practises, or otherwise my
demaund not vnto you disdaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
I then would craue your
doome concerning a doubt which
yet resteth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> vnresolued, and the
case not so curious as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to haue solution by your
skill. The Scholler heerat some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
abashed, more to see her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in his presence, whom hee
knew to be the prize of <hi>Padua,</hi>
then for anye dispaire he had in
disclosing her demaund: with
courteous and colde communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
reaunswered to bee at her
commaund; reuerently beseeching
her▪ not to conceale anye cause
which shee deemed his learning
could define. Which courtesie
she so well accepted, that turning
to such as were in her company:
shee willed them to walke aside,
till shee by signe, gaue showe to
<pb facs="9"/>
haue them come. And beeing
bashfull, began so sweetely for to
blushe: that the blood brought
to her beautie a farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fauour then
before.
And thus her tale
beginneth.</p>
