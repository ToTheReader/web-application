   <head>¶ The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Actantius Firmianus,</hi> in his second booke of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Institutions doth say, that man, after all things in the worlde were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was lastly formed and made, affirming this: And God would not bring man into this world, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till suche time, as all things for him were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. And holy Scriptures also teache, howe man was the laste worke of GOD whiche hee wrought: and so brought into the world, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an house nowe already prepared, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly furnished: and also for whose sake all things therein were made. The whiche thing, Ethnicke Poets do witnesse: as <hi>Ouid</hi> (who hathe spoken of the worlde, and of all thinges whiche were created) sayeth thus of man: A more diuine creature than these, and more capable of the highest minde, as yet was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, whiche should haue rule vppon all other things, that is to saye, Man, formed of God for the same purpose, to be a Ruler and a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor, and a King also ouer all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb facs="5"/> and Gods Vicegerent heere on the earth. For it behoueth, that firste of all be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects and a Kingdome, beefore that a King be constituted and appointed. If Man therefore be a King, it behoueth him to knowr and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande his Natiuitie, Rule, Mighte, and Nobilitie, as Hystoriographers commonlye write of Kings. Man is borne of a moste noble Parent, to wit, euen of God himselfe, and of the slyme of the earth, to the ende he should not be forgetfull, or ouer proude. And after that hee was created concerning his owne body, GOD gaue also vnto him a woman, which he should loue euen as hymselfe. For, God his Father did knowe, that it was not good for Man to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Manne was borne or broughte into the worlde, but bare and naked, that hee mighte clothe hymselfe, not onely with wooll or linnen garments, but also to bee apparelled with the comely vesture of Vertue. Againe, Man is not borne hairie after the manner of beastes, to the end he shoulde bee gentle and milde, &amp; not cruel or sauage: for haire growing on the bodie, plainely foresheweth or declareth a fierce or mercilesse minde. Man also is borne but with a weake and a feeble body, that hee
<pb facs="5"/> shoulde not truste in his own strength, as beasts do: but rather to desire helpe and aide of God: and yet notwithstanding hee is ordayned and appoynted a King ouer all strong and mightye Beastes. This King therefore I say, hath noble and princely giftes, by the which he excelleth al other creatures: for he hath another maner of forme than other beastes haue. For brute beastes haue a forme yeelding and bowing downe to the Earth: but Man hath his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce erected vp towardes the Starres (or vp to the Heauens) that he shoulde despise as vaine, all earthly thinges, and so muche the more loue heauenly things: and might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with also thinke, that in respecte of his moste excellent forme, he ought otherwise to liue, thā as the maner is of Beastes. Moreouer, Kinges haue also their Councellors, whose aduise and councelles they vse wisely to follow, euen in the tyme of the friendly banquetting of thēselues. And they haue also their <hi>Caesar,</hi> vnto whom they are compelled to yeelde an accompte of their Stewardeship or Gouernment: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they are reiected from their Kingdome. Euen so likewise vnto Man, who is a King of worldly things, is Reason giuē, as a noble Coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour:
<pb facs="6"/> whose aduice and councell if hee shall folow, he shall bothe wisely gouerne hymselfe, and also all other earthly creatures. It behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth likewise the King to bee prudent in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, that he neither offend subiects, nor yet his Councellors and Courtiers: and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetely to moderate the bridle of Regiment: leaste complaintes be made of hym vnto <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> (or vnto the mightie Emperour) that the Prouince is spoiled: Euen so it behoueth Man (who is a King ouer all worldly things) to bee prouident and wise in vsing things created for hym: specially also an other man who is hys neighboure: vnto whome it is graunted to be of like forme, speache, and reason, and to haue alwayes a care howe he may please <hi>Caesar</hi> his God: that he may long rule well his kingdome: &amp; in the ende obteyne that rewarde which is perpetuall &amp; vnexpressable. And how heerein hee oughte honestly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue hymselfe, these precepts following shall plainly shewe vnto hym.</p>
