      <salute>Good Reader,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou hast here again
these short Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Religion pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
for thy good.
I haue the opinion
of others, whose iudgements I haue
iust cause to reuerence, concerning
the soundnes of them. And I doubt
not but thou thy selfe, if thou shalt
throughly obserue and weigh them,
wilt find abundance of matter cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in few wordes. The fewer and
briefer that the Principles bee, the
sooner are they learned by heart,
&amp; the more firmelie are they retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="3"/>
in memory. They way easily be
by word of mouth enlarged and
amplified by any that hath anie
competent measure of knowledge.
The texts of Scripture whereunto
the Reader was referred before
only by quotations in the margent,
are now expreslie set downe direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
against the wordes, that thou
maiest more readilie see the proofs,
and compare the Principles and
proofes together. There are also
added two Praiers, fit to bee vsed
morning and euening in a familie,
by such as cannot pray without
some such helps. These formes of
Praier, were gathered out of such
Praiers as the Authour of these
Principles hath at diuers times
vsed, by one that hath oft heard
him All âre published for thy good▪
Farewell.</p>
