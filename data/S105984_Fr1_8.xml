   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are three things, especially to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the true seeking and calling vpon God: The first is <hi>Preparation,</hi> before we call vpon God in Prayer. The second is, <hi>Attention</hi> in Prayer: The third and last is, <hi>Thanksgiuing</hi> after Prayer.</p>
   <div type="part">
      <pb facs="15"/>
      <head>A PREPARATION to PRAYER.</head>
      <p>AS touching the first namely, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> we may obserue &amp; vse a kinde of imitation of men, occasioned to communicate with <hi>mortal Princes,</hi> who are obserued to preponder with themselues; first, how to shape their behauiour, and externall <hi>gesture:</hi> Secondly, how to frame their speech to gaine <hi>Attention</hi> of him to whom they speake: and how to auoide the censure of <hi>indiscretion,</hi> in the deliuery of what they affirme, or defend. If such curiosity and carefulnesse be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily obserued, in our communication with men whose breath is in their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils: how much more obseruant and carefull ought we to be, when we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse our selues to speake vnto the <hi>Maiesty of the immortall God?</hi> To intrude abruptly into the presence of this great God, and vnaduisedly to speake vnto him, becommeth not a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner, but bewrayeth an vnsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb facs="15"/>
and an vnprepared heart; rather tempting and dishonouring, then glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the name of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before we presume to present our petitions to God, in hope to be heard; we must prepare our selues, not in our outward gesture, onely in eloquence of words, and Pharisaicall outward holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: But in rightly ordering &amp; dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the affections of the inner man; which, if they be set on carnal, or earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>vanities,</hi> if our harts delight in <hi>the fruits of the flesh,</hi> and <hi>the vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table works of darknes:</hi> (though our words be neuer so good of themselues) we may feare the reward of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife, who brought a <hi>part of their substance</hi> (hypocritical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Concealing therest) &amp; laid that part at the <hi>Apostles</hi> feet. So, if we come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God giuing him good words, keeping back our harts, to serue our own carnal and prophane appetites: Shal we thinke that God wil be content with the leaues
<pb facs="16"/>
of our good words, when we giue the fruits of our hearts to the world? will God take such <hi>hypocrites</hi> by the hād? we must know, that vnlesse we can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnfainedly cast off our <hi>carnall thoughts, corrupt desires,</hi> and <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affections,</hi> it cannot be that God, who <hi>loueth holinesse and truth, in the inward affections,</hi> can looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs, as vpon his <hi>children,</hi> who speake vnto him, as to a <hi>father,</hi> with counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit words, proceeding from vnsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied hearts. When we come therefore vnto God in prayer, <hi>we must depart from all iniquity,</hi> knowing that <hi>hee heareth not sinners,</hi> such as the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> of God cannot win to obedience; nor his threats inforce to <hi>forsake their sinnes;</hi> who yet will aduenture to rush rashly into the presence of God, in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall kinde of praying with the lips, without any premeditation, preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or reformation of the heart, at all. These offer <hi>words</hi> for <hi>deeds: leaues</hi>
         <pb facs="16"/>
for <hi>fruits: Wolues</hi> for <hi>Lambes;</hi> and all manner, halt, lame, blinde, and blemished <hi>sacrifices,</hi> and yet would seeme holy: And so in stead of a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, procure a curse vnto themselues for their hypocrisie. We must consider that <hi>God is a iealous God, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth none guiltlesse, that taketh his name in vaine</hi> as they manifestly doe, <hi>that come neere him with their lips, when their hearts are far from him.</hi> It is a kinde of spirituall adultery, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to seeme wholy to be Gods, and yet inwardly to be meere worldlings. Before we open our mouthes therefore to God, we must cast out of the Temple of God (which is our heart) <hi>all buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and sellers,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> did out of <hi>the Temple of Ierusalem:</hi> for as long as our hearts doe harbour the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of worldly profits, and carnall pleasures, aboue the sincere seruice of God, our heart, the Temple of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, becommeth a den of theeues,
<pb facs="17"/>
that steales away all our godly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to settle them on <hi>Belial.</hi> Let vs looke vnto <hi>the man Christ Iesus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> by whose bloud we are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by whose mediation we are sure to haue our prayers heard of God, and granted; especially, if for our further and more perfect preparation, we can truly obserue the rule of <hi>Christ,</hi> to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue our Enemies,</hi> knowing that <hi>if we forgiue not our brother that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth vs, God wil not forgiuevs, that farre more grieuously offend him.</hi> And therefore Christ counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that <hi>if we bring our sacrifice to the Altar,</hi> namely, if we intend to pray; and <hi>there remember that a brother hath ought against vs, we ought to leaue our offering before the Altar,</hi> that is, forbeare for the time to pray, yet to continue our holy intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to pray; and <hi>to goe first, and be reconciled to our brother,</hi> &amp; <hi>then to come to offer our gift;</hi> namely,
<pb facs="17"/>
our praiers freely vnto <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Christ:</hi> for before we be vnburthened of all <hi>Rancor, Malice, Enuy, Hatred,</hi> and all other <hi>prophane desires;</hi> it is not onely not auaileable, but lamentable, that so many will (as doe) presume to come before God, with hearts so feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fraught with these vnholy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and stagger no more to presse into Gods presence, nay, not so much; as some that come vnto God with most prepared, peacefull, and most sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed consciences. Let such <hi>cast out the bondwoman with her sonne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      <head>ATTENTION IN PRAYER.</head>
      <p>BEing thus prepared, let vs indeuor to yeelde due and true <hi>Attention</hi> in our Prayers, that is, to giue heede to what we pray, to whom we pray, for what we pray, and with what zeale we pray: which are the truest tokens, and greatest arguments, that our prayers are liuely, powerfull, effectuall, and of faith; which properties can neuer be in lip-labour: for there cannot be a more apparant discouery of a rancke Hypocrite, then to make outward shewes of <hi>Deuotion,</hi> with the gesture and lips, and yet the heart to be busied in the cogitation of idle, earthly, and prophane things. And nothing more discouereth an idle heart outwardly, then the wandering of the eye in the time of diuine prayer: for it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and often found by experience, that the eye withdraweth the heart: and if the eye be inconstant, the prayer hath not, nor can haue the due <hi>Attention</hi> of
<pb facs="18"/>
the heart: yet it doth not follow, that although the eye be fixed on any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine obiect, or be shut, that therefore the heart is rightly set on God, for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the eye followes the heart, the cogitation of the heart making the eye to forget it obiect: as when the heart is wandring in the fields of Corne, view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heards of Cattell, and flocks of Sheepe, when it is in the Ware-house, in the Shop, in the Chest, minding bands and payments, ouer-come with pride, plotting reuenge, oppressed with feare, besotted with pleasure, intangled with cares, or otherwise peruerted by any prophane and vngodly cogitations. Prayers made with such an extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant heart, be they in words neuer so holy they are imputed vnto vs as sin: for shall we thinke, that God will heare our prayers, to our profit or comfort, when the thoughts of our harts in the meane time dishonor him? Many pray in their owne familiar language, and
<pb facs="19"/>
         <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
            <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
         </gap>
         <pb facs="19"/>

            <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
         </gap>
         <pb facs="20"/>
yet consider no more what they speake (for want of Attention) then if they spake in an vnknown tongue: &amp; yet such men will hold themselues very deuout, &amp; to haue power in themselues to pray when they list: as if true prayer were of that facility and ease, to vtter, as in an idle tale, and as it seemes by <hi>Beggars,</hi> that tumble out <hi>the Lords Prayer,</hi> with one breath at a dore, &amp; yet minde nothing but their Almes. Such men are to be pittied, and to be wished better to aduise themselues, before they attempt this seruice of God most holy; for <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> is not an easie worke, it is of a deeper straine then a tale, that is but from the tongue to the teeth, from the teeth to the lips, &amp; so into the ayre. <hi>True Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> is cordial, &amp; of that force &amp; efficacy, as it constraineth the heart to <hi>sighes, groanes,</hi> &amp; <hi>teares,</hi> with such <hi>inward feruency</hi> of holy zeale, as tenters the heart with such internall gripes, as may betruly said, <hi>the renting of the heart.</hi>
         <pb facs="20"/>
And the more we feele our hearts thus inwardly sharply touched: so much the more comfort it yeeldeth to the soule of the faithfull Petitioner, yea such, and so great consolation, as he that feeles it cannot expresse it with his tongue, be he neuer so eloquent; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any conceiue or apprehend the sweetnesse of it, that is not exercised and experienced in the same; for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture apprehendeth it not. <hi>No man can say that Iesus is Christ, but by the holy Ghost:</hi> and none can desire <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> but by <hi>the Spirit of God, Flesh &amp; bloud</hi> cannot as much as desire <hi>spirituall things,</hi> spiritually; for <hi>spirituall things are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with spirituall things,</hi> and <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts</hi> are obtained by <hi>spirituall meanes:</hi> And therefore are <hi>words</hi> without the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as naked and bare Incense without fire: but, being inkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in the heart, and sanctified by the holy Spirit of God, who is promised to
<pb facs="21"/>
assist our spirits, they are as a <hi>liuely and acceptable sacrifice to God,</hi> working so powerfully with him, through <hi>Christs</hi> mediation, as they neuer returne empty of whatsoeuer blessing we desire. Prayer can neuer be effectuall, vnlesse there be some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne spirituall obiect of the minde, to moue the attention of the heart, which obiect is God: and we must consider, that when we pray vnto him, or yeeld him any other worship, that we are not to conceiue him, in the forme of any earthly or heauenly, bodily or spiritual creature whatsoeuer: for <hi>in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not to conceiue him, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of conceiuing him aright, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Master</hi> Perkins. God must be conceiued of vs in our prayers, as subsisting in the whole three <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. The Vnity in Trinity, &amp; Trinity in Vnity,</hi> is to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, retayning in minde the distinction
<pb facs="21"/>
and order of all the three <hi>persons,</hi> without seuering or sundring them: for, as they are conioyned in nature; so are they to be conioyned in worship. And therefore, he that prayeth vnto God the <hi>Father,</hi> for the forgiuenesse of his sinnes, must aske it of him, for the merits of <hi>the Sonne,</hi> and by the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>the holy Ghost:</hi> and he that prayeth for the remission of sinnes to <hi>God the Sonne,</hi> must pray that he would procure <hi>the Father,</hi> to grant him pardon, and to assure it by <hi>his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> He also that praieth for the same to God the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> must pray that he would assure vnto him the remission of his sinnes, from <hi>the Father,</hi> for, and by the merits of <hi>his Sonne.</hi> Thus must we apprehend the <hi>Trinity</hi> in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: so shall we auoide that Idolatrous conceiuing of him, imbraced of some, who cannot pray, vnlesse they haue the figure of a humane Creature, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto their bodily eyes, the shape of
<pb facs="22"/>
God <hi>the Father,</hi> in likenesse of an old Man and a <hi>Crucifix</hi> figuring <hi>Christ,</hi> suffring on the Crosse, and the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> by a <hi>Doue,</hi> whose worship can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reputed spirituall, but carnall; and their prayers, not heauenly, but prophane. Prayer is a spirituall action, proper onely to the <hi>children of God, who are Saints by calling, sanctified in Christ:</hi> And they, and none other truly <hi>cal vpon the name of the Lord IESVS:</hi> prophane persons pray not, though they seeme to pray. But most happy is that man, that commeth vnto God, <hi>Father, Sonne, &amp; holy Ghost,</hi> truly prepared, and duly attentiue; he may boldly aske, and confidently assure himselfe, to receiue <hi>grace for grace, and all blessings spirituall,</hi> without limitation, and all <hi>benefits corporall</hi> needfull. If our prayers be made in vs, by him, who hath promised, and hath power to giue what we aske, <hi>shall wee think he will faile to performe?</hi> The
<pb facs="22"/>
         <hi>hope of Hypocrites,</hi> indeede, <hi>shall perish,</hi> &amp; their <hi>prayers</hi> vanish as the smoke: because they wait vpon <hi>lying vanities,</hi> and desire <hi>carnall pleasures,</hi> and <hi>worldly profits.</hi> But <hi>the Lord will surely fulfil the desires of them that feare him,</hi> because their prayers t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>d to the setting forth of <hi>Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to the good of the <hi>Church,</hi> to the remission of their owne sinnes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens, to the obtayning of <hi>Gods graces,</hi> to the increase of the <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of heauenly things,</hi> that they may <hi>walke before God, and be vpright,</hi> that they may do <hi>the works, &amp; bring forth the fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> These are the prayrs that are the <hi>POORE MAMS REST.</hi> These are the <hi>prayers</hi> that wound the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> and that please God bringing <hi>peace</hi> to the <hi>conscience afflicted.</hi> But (which is to be lamented) all men are dull by nature: And <hi>the very Elect,</hi> sometimes weakly disposed to pray. And
<pb facs="23"/>
therefore is euery godly man to vse all holy meanes, to inkindle their hearts, to the right performance of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly duty: And nothing more preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap> in, then <hi>Meditation:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are also very vnapt by nature, &amp; know not how, nor vpon what groūd to lay the foundation thereof: yet, if we can truly frame our hearts to a holy <hi>Meditation,</hi> we shall finde, that it is the very key that openeth our <hi>dull hearts,</hi> lookt vp vnder <hi>griefe,</hi> vnder <hi>feare,</hi> vnder <hi>trouble,</hi> vnder <hi>persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> &amp; <hi>misery:</hi> and sendeth forth by little &amp; little, <hi>the fire of true zeale,</hi> which at length becommeth a <hi>great</hi> flame <hi>of preuailing prayers,</hi> which thing they easily finde, that are conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in this sacred exercise of <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Prayer:</hi> who yet, many times finde themselues most dull, &amp; most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to pray, hauing yet an inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire thereunto which <hi>desire</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not containe: but labouring a while in
<pb facs="23"/>
silence, speaking inwardly to God in <hi>sighes</hi> and <hi>groanes,</hi> at length they speake effectually with their <hi>tongues.</hi> Seeing therefore, that all men neede motiues to stir them vp to payer: let eueryman addresse himself to the word of God, or peruse some godly worke of religious men. And although vocally he cannot read, by reason of his naturall dulnes; yet, if his heart can be but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersant, &amp; duly attend the sence, as the eye obserues the letter, his mind by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little shall mount it selfe from <hi>earth</hi> to <hi>heauen,</hi> fixed on the <hi>Trinity,</hi> whence shall arise such spirituall fruits of <hi>faith,</hi> &amp; <hi>feruency of Spirit,</hi> as shall fill the soule with more sweet consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by inkindled prayer, then the tongue can vtter. And to this end (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) according to the small measure of mine vnderstanding, I haue prefixed before euery prayer, a <hi>Motiue</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,</hi> touching the substance and matter of the Prayer following.</p>

      <head>THANKS-GIVING after PRAYER.</head>
      <p>THe third and last duty in this holy exercise is <hi>Thanksgiuing,</hi> which cannot but follow sanctified praiers, and that with such ioy in <hi>the holy Ghost,</hi> as it cannot but breake forth into most vnspeakable inward thankefulnesse to God, who hath been so graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, not onely to forgiue our sinnes, but to help our infirmities by his <hi>holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> by whom we haue had accesse vnto the Throne of grace, and found such fauour with <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> as we haue obtayned by the holy Ghost, both the will and the power to pray. Also we ought <hi>in all things to giue thanks to God,</hi> for euery <hi>blessing</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> we receiue at his hands, according to the counsell and precept of the Apostle, who commands vs to <hi>giue thanks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies for all things vnto God, euen the Father, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> Ephes. 5. 20.
