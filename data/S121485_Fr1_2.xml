   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE AND <hi>WORTHIE LADY, DAME</hi> AGNES MORRAY, <hi>MISTRESSE OF</hi> STORMONTH.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>MADAME,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>AFter that I had receaved <hi>some woundes in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap> the house of my friends,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Zach 13.6</note> I contracted much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, which brought vpon me so great sicknesse and weaknesse,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.9</note> that I <hi>receaved in my selfe the sentence of death:</hi> In the which estate your L. may easily consider, that such a man as I, both should and would haue deepe meditation of death, and so indeede I had, being resolved to die at that tyme: yet it was the goodwill of GOD to continue my life, which hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued since that tyme, some sixe yeares or more: therefore I thought it was good for me to make better preparation against the next assault of that enemie, which to <pb facs="3"/>all true Christians (as witnesseth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle) is <hi>the last enemie:</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.26</note> and so I set my selfe to recognosce both my terrours and consolations in that first conflict, for remedie against the one, and confirmation of the other. I read in Scripture, in good Christian mens works, and in Heathen writers, so much as could come to my hand concerning death; and gathered the same together as I thought meete for my purpose mixing them in this treatise, as you may see: The trueth is, my first intention in writing, was only to revise the same for mine owne vse: but after that I did let some of mine acquaintance see it, men lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fearing GOD, who told me, I did not well to obscure it, seing it might doe good to others, I gaue way to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and remembered the common axiome, <hi>Bonum quo communius eo melius.</hi> The naturall gift that I haue of vtterance▪ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more Laconick than Atticke, I haue vsed in writting heereof: yea, the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse not only of sentences; but of purpose also I purposely affectate in treating of this subject <hi>Death,</hi> yet labouring to bee plaine: for I thinke, if either information, <pb facs="3"/>or consolation concerning death might be well contryved in as few short aphorismes, as there be letters in an <hi>A, B, C:</hi> it were the better both for the mynd and memory of the patient in that agonie.</p>
   <p>Now the reasons wherefore I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated this little treatise to your L: are: first, because I haue this honour to be your L. kinseman, and of your surname. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because for honour, vertue;
<hi>viz.</hi> Pietie, charitie, sobrietie, I esteeme more of your L. than any one of my kinsfolk and surname. Thirdly, because your L. is not ashamed to professe, I was the man who first taught you the rudiments of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to make you thinke of the way how to liue well. Now I pray GOD that the reading, and meditation of this treatise may be a meane to helpe your L. to die well, I thinke it needlesse to put a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Epistle before so little a Booke, least the head should bee bigger than the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and so the birth monstrous. So I rest,</p>
