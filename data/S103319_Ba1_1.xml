      <hi>A Postscript</hi> To the READERS.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you haue read this, and receiued any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, I am glad (though it be not so much as I could wish you,) if you thinke it idle, why then I see wee are not likely to fall out; for I am iust of your mindes: yet weigh it well before you runne too farre in your censures, least this proue lesse barren of wit then
<pb facs="61"/>
you of courtesie. It is very true (I know not by what chance) that I haue of late beene so highly beholding to <hi>Opinion,</hi> that I wonder how I crept so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her fauour, and (if I did thinke it worthy the fearing,) I should be afraid that shee hauing so vndeseruedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended me beyond my <hi>Hope</hi> or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, will, vpon as little cause, ere long, againe pick some quarrell against me: and it may be, meanes to make vse of <hi>this,</hi> which I know must needs come farre short of their expectation, who
<pb facs="61"/>
by their earnest desire of it seem'd to be fore-possest with a farre better conceit then I can beleeue it proues worthy of. So much atleast I doubted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loath to deceiue the world (though it often beguile me) I kept it to my selfe, indeed not dreaming euer to see it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished: But now, by the ouermuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of some friends, I haue beene constrayned to expose it to the generall view. VVhich seeing I haue done, Somethings I desire thee to take notice of. First, that I am <hi>Hee</hi> vvho to pleasure
<pb facs="62"/>
my friend, haue fram'd my selfe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent out of that vvhich vvould other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise discontent me. Secondly, that I haue coueted more to effect what I thinke truely honest in it selfe, then by a seeming show of Art, to catch the vaine blasts of vncertaine <hi>Opinion.</hi> This that I haue here vvritten, vvas no part of my study, but onely a recreation in imprisonment: and a trifle, neyther in my conceit fitting, not by me intended to be made common; yet some, and it should seeme esteeming it worthy more
<pb facs="62"/>
respect then I did, tooke paines to copie it out, vnknowne to me, and in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence got it both Authorized and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the <hi>Presse;</hi> so that if I had not hindred it, last <hi>Michaelmas-Tearme</hi> had beene troubled with it. I was much blamed by some Friends for withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, to whose request I should more easily haue consented, but that I thought (as indeed I yet doe) I should thereby more disparage my selfe, then content them. For I doubt I shall be supposed one of those, who out of their
<pb facs="63"/>
arrogant desire of a little preposterous <hi>Fame,</hi> thrust into the world euery vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasoned trifle that drops out of their vnsetled braines; whose basenesse how much I hate, those that know mee can vvitnesse, for if I vvere so affected, I might perhaps present the vvorld with as many seuerall <hi>Poems</hi> as I haue seene yeeres; and iustly make my selfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be the Author of some things that others haue shamefully vsurped and made vse of as their owne. But I will be content other men should owne
<pb facs="63"/>
some of those Issues of the <hi>Braine,</hi> for I would be loth to confesse all that might in that kinde call me Father. Neyther shall any more of them, by my consent, in hast againe trouble the world, vnlesse I know which vvay to benefit it vvith lesse preiudice to my owne estate. And therefore if any of those lesse serious <hi>Poems</hi> which are already disperst into my friends hands, come amongst you, let not their publication be imputed to mee, nor their lightnesse be any dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to vvhat hath beene since
<pb facs="64"/>
more seriously written, seeing it is but such stuffe as riper iudgements haue in their far older yeeres beene much more guilty of.</p>
   <p>I know an ▪indifferent <hi>Critticke</hi> may finde many faults as well in the sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this present <hi>Subiect,</hi> as in the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the true nature of an <hi>Eglogue:</hi> moreouer, it altogether concernes my selfe, vvhich diuers may dislike. But neyther can be done on iust cause: The first hath beene answered already: the last might consider that I vvas there
<pb facs="64"/>
vvhere my owne estate vvas chiefely to be looked vnto, and all the comfort I could minister vnto my selfe little enough.</p>
   <p>If any man deeme it worthy his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I shall be glad: if hee thinke his paynes ill bestow'd, let him blame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for medling with that concerned him not; I neyther recommended it to him, neyther cared whether he read it or no, because I know those that vvere desirous of it, will esteeme the same as much as I expect they should.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="65"/>But it is not vnlikely, some vvill thinke I haue in diuers places beene more wanton (as they take it) then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitteth a <hi>Satyrist;</hi> yet their seueritie I feare not, because I am assured all that I euer yet did, was free from <hi>Obseaeuitie:</hi> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am I so <hi>Cynicall,</hi> but that I thinke a modest expression of such amorous conceits as sure with Reason, will yet very well become my yeeres; in which not to haue feeling of the power of <hi>Loue,</hi> were as great an argument of much stupiditie, as an ouer-sottish affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="65"/>
were of extreame folly. Lastly, if you thinke it hath not well answered the title of the <hi>Shepheards Hunting,</hi> goe quarrell with the <hi>Stationer,</hi> who bid himselfe God-father, and imposed the <hi>name</hi> according to his owne liking, and if you, or he, finde any other faults, pray mend them.</p>
