      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been an vsuall thing, gentle</hi> Reader, throughout the whole Scriptures, for later ages, to make recitall of former stories, both concerning the cruell rage of the wicked against the Church of God, and also the tender care the Lord hath had for the defence and deliuery of his: and vpon present experience of the same, haue assembled themselues togeather, not onely to shew foorth Gods glorie by songes of prayse and thanksgiuing, but also to confesse that as they haue heard, so haue they seene: and therefore in the pallaces of Syon was God wel knowen for a refuge, yea for a God most great, &amp; therefore by them most highly to be praysed. Euen so likewyse (since all thinges that are written in the holy Scriptures, are written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might haue hope:) I haue brought to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce (as breefely as I can) the cheefest stories therein conteined for this purpose, that when you haue heard, you may also say, that you haue seene, his great seueritie in the late mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous destruction of his and our Romish enimies, and his accustomed mercie in the deliuerance and preseruation of his children, and so by that meanes be stirred vp to giue all thankes and prayse vnto God, and to haue your hartes firmly stayed vpon him, who is a wall and strong defence to Syon his Beloued, and who continually sits vpon a throne, hauing a Rainebow round about, to assure vs of his fauour to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,

agaynst the waters which the olde Dragon powreth out by the Italian Synagoue of Rome, wherefore seeing he is our defence against the troublesome waues of this lyfe, let vs neuer cease to be talking of the noble actes which hee hath doone, and the great deliuerance which he hath shewed from tyme to tyme: and so take occasion to haue our mouthes filled with his prayses continually: so shall God haue his glorie, and I my whole desire: and thus I rest, praying for thy peace, and wishing (for my brethrens sake) thy prosperitie, O Ierusalem.</p>
