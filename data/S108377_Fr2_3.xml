   <p>IN the yeere 1612. Master Daniel Featlie being in France, Chaplaine to the Embassadour of our Late So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, there came to <hi>Paris</hi> one M. Kneuet, halfe-brother to M. Iohn Foord, an honest &amp; vertuous Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leman the liuing in that Cittie. This M. Kneuet, being, vpon his arriuall there, put in mind, that he was mistaken in the matter of Religion, which is the thing a man should prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie attend vnto; and that before Luther all <hi>knowne</hi> Churches did beleeue that which he saw there in Fraunce openlie professed; tould his brother (M. Foord) he would see one of ours defend it before M. Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie, whom he did esteeme a greate
<pb n="5" facs="27"/>
Scholler. Withall he acquainted. M. Featlie with the busines, &amp; with the point he meant should be discussed. M. Featlie thinking himselfe alone hard enough for the whole Church of Rome, vndertooke it: and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it with the more applause, did prouide himselfe diligentlie for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. At leingth, vpon the third of September, word was sent to M. D. Smith (who being then in towne was entreated to vndertake the cause,) that he should prouide himselfe for the morrow.</p>
   <p>On the 4. of September there met at M. Kneuets chamber, M. D. <hi>Smith,</hi> and M. <hi>Featly.</hi> With M. D. Smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th came his cozen M.<note n="*" place="margin">Since Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</note>
      <hi>Rainer;</hi> &amp; with M. Featly came one M. <hi>Iohn Porie,</hi> who had beene a burgeois (as it was said) in the firste Parlament, in King Iames his time. There were also present M. <hi>Iohn Foord,</hi> M. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Rant, M. Ben: Iohnson, M. Henrie Constable,</hi> &amp; others; not English onelie, but also, Frēch: for M Featly presuming the victory, had made the matter
<pb n="6" facs="28"/>
knowne. The cōference began at noo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: and by agreement, M. D. Smith was this time to defend, M. Featly to dispute. Afterwards vpon another daie, M. D. Smith was to dispute, and M. Featly to defend: the rest, not to entermedle.</p>
   <div type="part">
      <head>THE RELATION.</head>
      <p>THE conditions of this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Master Featlie did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue; for wheras it was to haue beene priuate before it M. Kneuet (for whose sake it was vndertaken) and his brother, onlie; Master Featlie brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght to passe that it was publike; there being many called vnto it, not English onelie, but also French. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly whereas the conference accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to appointment was to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them two onelie, M. Featlie called M. Moulins thither also, though this Minister afterwards changing his minde, did not come.
<pb n="7" facs="28"/>
Thirdlie, he let not M. D. Smith know of the time of Conference but one daie before they were to meete, whereas he (as we may iustlie belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue) had prouided himselfe long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. VVhence one of his frinds said the conference would be exact and elaborate.</p>
      <p>Before they began to dispute. D, Smith said the conference was to be, not of transubstatiation, but of the reall presence onely, which by order of disputation ought to be first. He said also that he was content to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt vnto M. Featlie the opponents part for this daie, so that M. Featlie would promise to let him haue it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daie; otherwise he would by lots trie who that daie should be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. And M. Featlie promising that another daie he should propose arguments for the Catholike <hi>tenet,</hi> he willinglie vndertoke the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants

part. But when according to the manner of Oxford he began to declare the state of the question, &amp; to shew whitall the grounds of the Catholike <hi>tenet,</hi> Featlie cryed out that he would in no case giue way thereunto. D. Smith tould him that himselfe was a Doctour of Oxford, and that he (M. Featlie) was a Graduate of the same Vniuersitie, wherefore there was reason they should obserue their vniuersitie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But M. Featlie tooke this in so ill part, that he said openlie he would rather omit the conference then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it: So that D. Smith was forced herein to let him haue his will, least the expectation of the auditorie should heerevpon haue bene frustrate: or they take occasion to suspect that he sought to decline the cumbat. VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore leauing that his fort wherein he might haue iustlie staid, and
<pb n="9" facs="29"/>
comming out into the open field, he bad M. Featlie bring out his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, such as might suffice to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie before God and men his departure both from the Roman Church and all other auncient whatsoeuer, yea and from the Lutheran too in this point; which need to be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without doubt; for there be not wanting probable arguments to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne à truth most euident.</p>

      <head>THE NOTES OF S. E.</head>
      <p>D. Featlie in his Relation doth acknowledge that he would not permit my Lord of Chalcedon to set downe the confirmations, or shew the groūds, of our <hi>tenet,</hi> and for excuse pretends that it was against the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of the disputation, wherein it was agreed, as he relates, <hi>that Master Featlie at that time should onlie oppose and D. Smith onlie</hi>
         <note n="a" place="margin">He should haue added that <hi>M. Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie should answer another daie:</hi> for this was likwise agreed vppon; but he could not be brought to do it.</note>

<pb n="10" facs="30"/>
and still is the custome in Oxford for the Defendant to do that which my Lord would haue done; and the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie hath conceaued it to appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne (as indeed it doth) to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants part: which M. Featlie cauilling at, in the beginning, shewed himselfe not willing to enter in to the combat with my Lord of Chalcedon if he could haue put it of; and therefore (being conscious of the weakenes of his cause) thought the verie sight of our <hi>tenet</hi> as it appeares to Schollers, would ouerthrowe his, vtterlie; and that euerie word by waie of preface, was an argument to conuince it. The same feare and in the experience of the first conflict much augmented, he betraied againe afterwards when he was called vpon to be defendant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promise, as appeares by the end of the relation, where the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will see with what tergiuersation he did shift it of. And since that time also, in England it self, twice to my knowledge, (I can put the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars downe when time serues) he
<pb n="11" facs="30"/>
hath refused to meete my Lord, in dispute.</p>
      <p>Being himselfe in his Relation to tell the state of the Question, he puts downe a discourse to make the simple Reader giddie, to the end he see not on which side the truth stands, and which of the Disputants haue the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand; whereas the state of the Controuersie is in it selfe cleere &amp; plaine. The Catholikes hold and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that in the holy Eucharist, there is the bodie and blood of our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sauiour <hi>trulie, reallie, and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiallie.</hi> Conc.
