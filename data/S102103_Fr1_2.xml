   <head>To the right worshipfull Syr <hi>Thomas Barrington</hi> Knight, Moses Wilton wisheth increase of that peace, which the worlde giueth not.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S God by that tryall that hee giueth vs of his mercie, knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and goodnesse doeth most forcibly hale vs on in that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedienc which hee so often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for in his word: so, right worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, there is no mā that by any meanes can sooner procure vnto himself good liking and loue of others, than by cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous dealing, and shewing him selfe godlily disposed in all thinges. For though mens harts in these dayes are become very like the stone of Sycilia, the which the more it is beaten, the harder it waxeth, yet wee see many mens hearts enforced to relent by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dealing, not vnlike to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, which being moystned in the warmeblood of a Goat, may be brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb facs="3"/> thoughe otherwise it cannot bee hurt with any fire, be it neuer so hoat, nor broken with any violence, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so strong. We see the horse which erst while was outragiously fierce, yet by gentle handling to be meekned to the saddle: the dogge in like maner whose nature is agreeable to his name, is by gentlenes brought too doe that that is not incident too his nature: I my selfe haue seen a stout harted child shed many salte teares, at the louing speach of him, that with many sharpe stripes could not wring out one. Many thinges els might be sayd to shew this matter, but these that are already set downe being ioyned with the practize of the wicked mentioned in the tenth Psalm, may suffize for the proofe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for there it is written that hee by crouching and bowing himselfe brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that too passe against the poore, which by opē defiance he could neuer compasse, &amp; therfore in the same sense ver. 9. he is cōpared to a fowler, &amp;c. wherefore he must bee more contrary then an enemy, more churlishe then a
<pb facs="3"/> dogge, more vntamed then a wilde horse, more hardharted then the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond whose minde cannot be molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied towardes him, of whose curteous dealing and godly disposition he hath had sufficient triall. And as he cannot but without great vnthankfulnesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēber the one, so can he not without greate vngodlines but highly regarde the other. With al which falts, I might iustly be charged, if after so good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience had of your worships so good dealing towards me I should not, if by any meanes I coulde shew some token of my minde as well thankfull for the same, as also reuerently esteeming of those blessinges of God wherewith it hath pleased his goodnes to beautifie you. Among the which this especially deserueth neuer to be forgotten, that he hath begotten in your mind a loue of his trueth, with an earnest desire to heare &amp; haue the same preached, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lefte very many (I might say the most part of like calling as yet either in vtter hatred or careles contempt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<pb facs="4"/> For (leauing no small number, eyther by authoritie to be corrected, &amp; that in hast, or els reserued (I feare me) for some notable purpose, which they grone for, &amp; wish instantly to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, because their soules are drunken as yet with the cuppe of that whore of Rome, whose constant children they long to shew them selues: (leauing (I say) no small number of these, eyther to be seene vnto by the Magistrate, or to the accomplishing of that purpose, wherof they now begin to be in good hope, by reason they haue bin suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so long: who is he almost amonge those bigger ones, that thinketh not that God is greatly bound vnto him, if after wayting for him an howre, and somtimes more, vntil he haue dressed himself in the English disguise, and wil scarse at the length come to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his word, where if he continue hearing the Lorde speake aboue one howre, he forthwith complayneth of tediousnes, and was before no more carelesse to come, then he is now care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be gone, yea oftentimes he flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb facs="4"/> out as one wearie of the Lorde, and all his companie, and therfore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him to speake to whome he will, neyther regarding the presence of God, from whence he departeth, nor yet making any reckoning of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, which by his example he offereth to many, whom he imbouldeneth to like carelesse contempt of GOD his word. The hearing wherof is euer so much more burdenous vnto him, by how much lesse he perceiueth to agree with his accustomed vanitie. And yet for all this he beareth himself in hand very mightily, that he is a maruellous good protestant: yea and he will either kill him, or die on him that shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the contrary, thinking in deede that he hath deserued well at the hāde of God, if now and then he giue any of his Ministers the hearing of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, though it be with great yrksom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of minde, hungring in the meane time after the world and the pleasures thereof, whereunto he is tyed insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. But let him, and all such knowe for a suretie, that by this kinde of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb facs="5"/> they are so farre from deseruing well of the Gospell, that it sustaineth reproofe by this their so little loue to heare it, so small purpose of hearte to consent vnto it, and no bringing forth of the fruites therof, yea let euery man know that althogh he bestow his time in the hearing, reading, or meditating thereof, yea his goodes and life it selfe in the defence of the same, yet can he not chalenge any wel deseruing of the trueth, but the trueth may iustly of him, because the goodnesse thereof (which is the worke of Gods spirite) hath so rauished his minde, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is nowe deare vnto him, but it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. For who can recompence the word for begetting him to God? doth wisdome cry vnto vs, because she is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect without vs? No, no, it is for our profit that shee would so louingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbrace vs: as for her selfe, though we al perish, she is neuer the worse, if none perish, she is neuer the better. And shal we thinke that our comming to heare her, doth in any respect beautifie or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne her that is perfect without vs?
<pb facs="5"/> some thinke so, I wote it well, yea I would the most were not perswaded so: for then more should be adorned by her, for she lodgeth not, but with the meeke harted ones. O good Lord, who hath bewitched vs with this minde? Surely the very pride of our mind, that suffreth vs not to go to the hearing of Gods word, with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and reuerent purpose of heart cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon God to be profited therby, but rather to furnish out the shewe of hearers, thinking so to come within the preaching of the worde, and to bring it within the compasse of our daunger. Whervpon it cōmeth oftē to passe, that more thankes are giuen to some hearers, for being at a Sermon, by some, then there are vnto God for the benefit of his word taught therin: yea some Preachers also (I feare me) can be contented nowe and then to ioyne with their hearers to rob God of his glory, I meane such as seeke for credit by their auditorie. But leauing these Pickthanke Hearers and Preachers, which carrye the
<pb facs="6"/> prayse from God, vnto that wil of god whervnto he hath foreordained them. I returne. Seeing therefore it pleased God, moreouer and besides many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blessinges bestowed vpon you, to enrich your heart with this preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pearle, of loue to his word (which is a true token of the new man put on: so that the heat thereof now flameth out, to the benefit of many dwelling in Kings Hatfield and the places therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in those parties of Essex, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that godly exercise of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which it pleased god by your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships meanes to bring in thither, that thereby many might bee raysed from their death in sinne, vnto the life which is in Christ Iesus, others confirmed in the fayth, and all dispisers left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all excuse vnto Iudgement: seeing I say it hath pleased God to make you haue such a loue to his word, thereby declaring that ye are of God, and that he hath taken you not onely from the number of Gods professed enemies: but also of godlesse Gospellers, whose name is all that they haue of christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb facs="6"/> I thought my part (the premisses considered) and hauing not only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes when I was in those partes, but since my departure also, experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced your worshippes good dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me to offer vnto your godly protection these fewe dayes trauell in the alone. Englishinge of these M. Gualters Sermons vpon the Prophet Zephaniah, being perswaded that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons shal neuer miisse good intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, where such a loue of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mōs is, wherby I was the rather imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, to request your worships godly patronage against such as can passe by nothing, without some wrāgling. Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing moreouer that ye would allowe and accept in good part this my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how small soeuer, as a token of my thankfull minde, which would not stay to do that that I ought if I cold do that that I cānot. But this I haue don, least I should be vnto your worshippe as the Humble bee is vnto the fayre flower, which when she hath sucked honny out thereof, leaueth it and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth: or like the Swallow, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="7"/> bred in a mans chimney, getteth her self thēce, leauing nothing behind her, but her nest of clay. What profit shall come therof I knowe not, what I would shoulde come, God knoweth: onely my hope is that it shall not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnprofitable: for who dare but go forward, when god threatneth him for standing still? who can sleepe when the trumpet that foundeth out Gods Iudgement cryeth so loude in his eares (awake?) who can but look to the amendment of his, whether chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and seruants, seeing the Lorde threatneth to visit those children and seruantes that are wicked, yea though they belong to the king? Who wilbe holden backe from reforming abuses not onely in himself, but also in those that be vnder him, when hee heareth the Lord say that he wil make a speedie riddance of all such as in meekenesse of heart haue not sought him, and wrought his Iudgement. All which thinges with many other are at large set out in this Prophesie, direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted especially against such which while
<pb facs="7"/> they might, would not for some world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respecte reforme them selues from those grosse enormities, and blind su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions wherwith they were entāg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led: notwithstanding they were ofte called therefroe by the Ministers of God, the Prophetes whome he sent vnto them. The Lorde graunt that we may lay these thinges to heart, and so apply them vnto our selues, that the fearce wrath of the Lord that hangeth ouer our heades, and is already threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fall vpon vs, may bee turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: or, if it must needes come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no warning will serue vs, yet that all those whome the knowledge and appearing of his grace hath called from the lustes and vngodly vanities of the worlde vnto the working of his Iudgementes in lowlinesse of minde may be hidden in that day. But that I breed not irkesomnes in sted of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profit, I cease to speake of these thinges which are more at large and very truly, though plainly laid open in these sermons, shewing as wel the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Prophesie, as applying
<pb facs="8"/> the doctrine therein contained to that vse wherevnto it was first reuealed, which in no age could more fitly bee done, than in this grisly old and down stouping age of the worlde, which by reason of blinde and wilfull ignorance is made drunke with the pleasures of sinne, whose ende is death that stayeth not. And as it may agree with other countries, yet with none better and more fitly than with England, which is now ouerspread with the selfe same abhominations, which the Prophet Zephaniah reckneth vp, as causes why the Lord made a clean dispatch of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da and Ierusalem, as it may appeare to him that shall compare our ouerflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iniquities in England, with those that the Prophet setteth downe in the first and third Chapters of his booke, for the which the fearce wrath of the Lord came vpon them, and for the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the like we also are with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to prepare our selues, for God is no partial God, he is no accepter of persons, and therefore we must needes follow them in punishment, whom we
<pb facs="8"/> are not onely like, but also do go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in sinne. Onely the name of God be magnified for euer more, for that his working grace in the hearts of his little flocke, whome hee promiseth to hide in the day of vengeaunce and wrath, and graunt that the same may take dayly increase in your heart, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to allow of his truth, and that you haue some attending vppon you, who not contented with a ciuill lyfe, (wherwith many deceaue them selues) is inwardly reformed with a hart hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirsting for the appearing of the Lorde Iesus, so the rest what soeuer they bee not stasting of the sweete mercies of God his loue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in Iesus Christ (and therfore attending not vpon you, but that that is yours) may be brought as well to the inwarde feeling, as outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the same goodnes, if it bee his will that vngodlinesse may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in them, or els that they maybe cut of from you as rotten mēbers, not meete for so sound an head, that the immortall commendations of the
<pb facs="9"/> heathen captaine Cornelius, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes follow Syr Thomas Barrington a true Christian Knight, which is, that he feared God, and all his housholde. And thus committing the successe of all things to him that is able to do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding aboundantly aboue that, that wee can either speake or thinke, and your Worship, to the protection of the same Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I end, this 4. of Iune. 1580.</p>
