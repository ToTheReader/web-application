   <p> your well tryed favours h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ve set mee so farre on fire in my fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceedings, that I, that ever hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto followed the endeavors of <hi>Pierce Plainnesse,</hi> seeme now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>or your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to become even a bowe-fellow prodigall, spending the summe of my store to the uttermost, as long as possibly it lasteth.</p>
   <p>If you find any crackt coyne in these my liberall expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet for FOORD's sake, affoord them starling, and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at small faults, excuse me to bee mistaken, and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Friends may it passe for currant, I am not of the humour of the new-Fangling Taylor, that for every new-wrought Suite frames a new fashion: Nor of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>heir pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous Nature, that of themselves being but <hi>Vixins,</hi> face out their attempts with heroicall Lyons lookes: but I alway the same, rest ever forward to intreat, carefull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and daily addicted devoutly to attend Humility.
<pb facs="5"/>
Against biting <hi>Theon's</hi> tooth, I remaine alway patient proofe: and the rather considering the singular sentence of one of the seaven <hi>Sages, viz.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>That even as for a man of understanding, being praysed to be led thereby unto a selfe-loved opinion of his owne lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts: or as selfe-willed presuming on his high deserts, may seeme an especiall argument of no small folly: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for being discommended, to remaine even <hi>amort</hi> with heavy cheere, and drooping mind, figuring his sad lookes, like to the Anatomy of death, is a plain proofe of his scarcity of counsell, want of patience, (which Phylosopher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> hold the soveraign'st vertue that belongs to the qualified indument of mortality) and (which is worse) penury of reason, <hi>Affectus temporare suos.</hi> I propose not this Gentle Reader, as if Stoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally I regarded your judicious censure, but rather portray a <hi>Preludium,</hi> how indifferently I can endure the divers taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reports of the envious: as for your ever regarded judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I account it the sanctuary, wherein my tyred sconce may finde refuge, the chiefe <hi>gresse,</hi> onely whereby my fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble invention ascendeth; the <hi>Colosse</hi> that wholly supporteth my endeavours; yea I reckon it all my being, all my essence, all my good,</p>
   <p>As therefore with a favourable smile, you ere-while enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Parismus</hi> and <hi>Parismenos,</hi> my elder off springs, with so cheerefull an aspect; now cast your lookes on my <hi>Montelyon,</hi> whose forwardnesse to winne fame, you shall perceive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferiour to the promptnesse of the former, although by birth, and course of time the younger. Oh he can acquaint you with the wonders of Chivalry, with admirable acts and doubty deeds, supported alway with a Fayery suffrage, as was <hi>Vlysses</hi> in his ten yeares venture by the ayde of <hi>Pallas.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>Your well-wishing acceptance, and kind conceit of him, is all the recompence I aske for my travell, and I wish no more, so (I trust) you will no lesse, grant this, and make my endeavours prosperous: Deny that, and leave mee so ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly infortunate, as hopelesse for ever of every good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: ever found bountifull in giving the one; so my selfe will not rest ingratefull for the other: that both in one, and one in both, may not onely augment your longing pleasures, which I heartily wish, but also inrich my lasting content, which I hope you as courteously will.</p>
