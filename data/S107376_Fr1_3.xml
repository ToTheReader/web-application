   <head>¶ To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, blame not this thyng I besech thee, which I haue done in this plaine and rude sort, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the simple and vnlearned: whom I did thinke vnable to comprehende in theyr myndes, and to apply vnto their consciences these learned Cōmentaries of this diuine Caluine, vnles they were somethyng ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> expositions of the Hebrue wordes, which would haue bene somethyng darke in our lā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, omitted. Wherfore, as I do professe my selfe to bee one of his scholers, and do prayse God for the same more then for any earthly matter: so do I not of arrogancie alter or chaunge any thing in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges. But because I do know right well that if he were alyue hym selfe, he would suffer all his doings to be applyed to the commoditie of the Church: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now whē I do offer his trauayles to the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of our English nation, who are desirous of the same, I do so present them as may be most comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their conscience, and least tedious to such simple persons as are not able to comprehend all his
<pb facs="3"/> large and learned discourses. And this abbrydge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do I make but in the two first Chapters and in few places besides: puttyng into print at this present, the one halfe of the booke of Daniell, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynyng the first vj. Chapiters, which do treate of the particular hystories wrought by God in hys tyme, and therfore semeth vnto me farre diuerse from the latter vj. Chapters: wherin he prophecieth of all thynges that should come vnto the elect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vntill the commyng of Messias, and toucheth also some thynges that be generall vnto all, euen to the end of the world. The which latter part also I do meane (by Gods grace) to publish for the instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nation in these obscure Prophecies, if I can perceaue this former trauayle to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the godly, which is my desire, and whom I do exhorte in the Lord, to read the Scriptures attentyuely, to meditate the same diligently, to pray continually.</p>
