   <head>THE PRINTER to the Reader.</head>
   <p>FOrasmuch as (gētle Reader) these three voyages lately by our Countreymen perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, do both for the matter of discouerie, for the strange and vnknovven accidentes, for the rare and hard aduentures, and also for the good and discrete order of gouernement, appeare aboue all others most notable and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous: I haue bin especially desirous, by all meanes possible I could, to procure the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication thereof, thinking it too great an iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to our common vvealth, to burie in obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so vvorthy attemptes of our ovvne nation, and to hide the ensample of so good and so vvell a gouerned seruice. And for that (as I vnderstād) many trifling Pamphlets haue bin secretly thrust out, not only vvithout the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Captaynes and executioners of the same, but also rather to the greate disgrace of the vvorthy voyage, than othervvise, I hauing intelligence of a substantiall discourse vvhiche vvas diligently vvritten thereof, and priuately dedicated to my very Honourable Mayster, Sir Christopher Hatton Knight, by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="8"/>
of his ovvne, vvho vvas personally present a Captain in all the same seruice, I haue, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out first making priuie the Authour, procured his Coppie out of the handes of a friende of mine, vvho had the vvriting and perusing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and haue presumed to publish and imprint the same, to the ende that thereby I mighte (gentle Reader) as vvell satisfye thy greedy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, by vnfolding these nevve and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovven matters, vvhereof the nature of man is most desirous, as also to performe that due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vvhiche I ovve vnto my sayde Honourable Mayster, in publishing such things as are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vnto him. And for that the mater is vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to passe vnder the protection of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable name, I haue heerein bin vvilling, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to beare the burthen of the Authoures priuate displeasure, if therevvith he shoulde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervvards be offended, than not by publishing that same, seeme not only to do a publike iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vnto my natiue Countrey, but also shevv a lighte regarde of my duetie, in obscuring the doyngs and trauels of him, or anye of his, vvhose honour (as I am chiefely boūd) I tēder more than my ovvne safetie. And albeit I haue in a fevve p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>aces somevvhat altered from my Coppie, and vvronged therby the Authoure,
<pb facs="8"/>
and haue sought to conceale vpon good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses some secretes, not fitte to be published or reuealed to the vvorld (as the degrees of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude and Latitude, the distance, and true position of places, and the variation of the compasse,) &amp;c vvhiche neuerthelesse, by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and particular Mappe concerning the same, heerevnto annexed, is so sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planed, that easilie any thing apperteyning vnto the voyage, or in this discourse mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, may sensibly be vnderstode: And though the matter be entirelie the Authours ovvne, yet am I contented (for thy sake) rather than the same shoulde not be published, to beare the burthē of blame, and to abide the reprofe of the faultes escaped, taking vpon me that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche of presumption, and hazarding my name to the vvorld, al vvhich things the Author peraduenture taketh for so great disgraces, as vvillingly he vvould not aduēture in his ovvne name the publishing thereof. But specially, for that the commendation of a Historie consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in truth and playnenesse, I haue desired to bring forth, &amp; prefer (before other Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets) the same, knovving that the Authoure thereof, in nothing more than in truth, desireth to maynteyne credite vvith this honourable
<pb facs="9"/>
personage, vnto vvhome vvith his ovvne hand vvritten, he hath priuately dedicated the same, as by the Epistle Dedicatorie may appeare. If therefore thou shalte accept my vvell mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in good parte, and yeelde but deserued prayse to the Authoure for doing, and thankes to me for publishing the same, it shall suffice to make me thinke my trauell vvell therein employed. And so fare you vvell.</p>
