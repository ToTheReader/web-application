   <head>The Printer to the Reader.</head>
   <p>WHereas it hath pleased God to hide me (as he did <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Baruch)</hi> on this <note place="margin">Ierm 36. 26</note> side the seas, notwithstanding the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> sent over two men to seeke me (of whom I hard after they were gone hencee) and I doubt not, but the same God will hide me still, untill I haue done his heavenly Maiestie all that servicc which (in his counsell) he hath appoynted me to do here. I am resolved (through his grace) to be as helpfull as (I can) in pulling downe the tower of Babel. Which to do I am perswaded, every chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is as well bound in conscience as to build up the tower of <hi>Sion.</hi> Promising withall, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, to giue over this course, and humbly to submit my selfe to the censure of authority, for the manifesting of my repentance, when I shall learne, that <hi>Diocesan Bishopps</hi> are by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and (as heretofore, so hear after) with all diligence and humility, to informe my selfe, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that question most necessary to be knowne in these times, of all those that esteeme the kingdome of Christ.</p>
   <p>If I be demaunded, whither I haue not heard of, or sene <hi>D. Downams</hi> Sermon at <hi>Lambith: I</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, I heare that many sound divines doe greiue, that so learned a man should discover such weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb facs="3"/>
But they thinke that the sermon, especially the Epistle was by the instructions of the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> whose chaplaine he is. And <hi>I</hi> see that he doth not answer <hi>M. Iacobs</hi> reasons, though he be carping at his booke: and one other thing of note, which was never yet heard of. viz. That not one Minister of such a perticular congregation, as may, and ought to come togither on the Sabbath, is once named, or specially mentioned, in all the New Testament, but onely <hi>Diocesan</hi> Bishops, from which Bishops those <note place="margin">1 Peter 2. 13 14.</note> Ministers are sent, as governours are sent from the King. So that Mimisters are but curates to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shops, as to those who onely hold their calling im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from <hi>Christ.</hi> Therefore (if this Doctrine be true) me thinkes one prayer in the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Booke should be put out: viz. <hi>Almighty God, who only workest great mervailes, send downe vpon our Bishops and curates the healthfull spirit of thy grace.</hi> For though heretofore it might seeme to us a mervaile, if God blessed Diocesan Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Ministers as being their curates, because they were not (as yet) knowne to be by Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: yet now (if this doctrine be true, that all having charge of congregations, be either Diocesan Bishops, or their curates) we are not to mervaile if God blesse his owne ordinance. But <hi>I</hi> hope that this doctrine and the whole Sermon, and consequently the vsurpation of <hi>Papall Bishops</hi> will be implea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the barre of their conscience, who haue a
<pb facs="3"/>
minde to reade: and understanding to iudge what shalbe written.</p>
   <p>In meane while <hi>I</hi> thought it convenient to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>these <hi>Informations,</hi> praying the brethren of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> not to be offended, if their be any errors in the <hi>Protestation,</hi> or <hi>Treatise of Kirk governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> but to consider, that <hi>I</hi> received them from <hi>Englishmen,</hi> who haue not (belike) perfect intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>Scottish</hi> affaires, but as thinges goe from hand to hand. As may appeare by naming <hi>Leith</hi> to be the place where the Sermon was preached, for which <hi>M. Murray</hi> is imprisoned, notwithstanding the Provinciall Synod, before which it was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched (as <hi>I</hi> heare) approved the same. But that it was preached by <hi>M. Murray</hi> and at <hi>Edinburgh: I</hi> heard not, till after the sermon was imprinted. As for the <hi>Letter,</hi> and <hi>Speach</hi> mentioned in the Title page of this booke, I ioyne them with the other, because they (likewise) informe the Church of the usurpation of Papal Bishops. And the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Letter</hi> doth not onely make good that (which towards the end of the second part of the <hi>Treatise)</hi> is sayd, to this effect: viz That the most learned defendours of the trueth against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Antichrist,</hi> condemne the said usurpation, but also it confuteth sondry pointes of <hi>D. Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nams Lambith</hi> Sermon. And secondly. Because the <hi>Letter,</hi> togither with the <hi>Speach</hi> of so worthy a Counsailor of this State, should be some <hi>Incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
to his Maiesties most Honorable privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell now being, not to depend upon the mouthes of Bishops and their Chaplaines (who, in this case, are rather to be mistrusted of godly wise men, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabs 400. Prophets</hi> were of King <hi>Iehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 king 22, 7,</note>) but closely to sound the iudgment of learned men, (such as doe not'aspire to dignities, and therfore doe not studie to please the mightie) and then to pleade (not for <hi>Baal,</hi> but) for <hi>Christ</hi> his Kingdome in his Church, <note place="margin">Iudg. 6. 31.</note> which he purchased with his most precious bloud.</p>
