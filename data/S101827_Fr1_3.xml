   <head>TO THE PERVSER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O beginne with Apologies, and intreate a kinde Gensure, were to dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Worke, and begge partialitie: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with Ostentation I ranke them both. If thou
<pb facs="6"/>
bee'st wise, pleasing words cannot blinde thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from discerning er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, wheresoeuer they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. If thou bee'st foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, they can neither blāch thy folly, nor make thee thinke better, than thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion leades thee to. Requests from others, may sway our words, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; but our mindes will haue their owne free thoughts, as they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the thing. Internall iudgement is not easily
<pb facs="6"/>
peruerted. In what thou shalt heere meete with, vse the freedome of thy natiue opinion: <hi>Et Lectorem, et Correctorem liberum volui.</hi> I shall euer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse my selfe his debtor, that greets me with repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of Loue. The noblest part of a friend, is an honest boldnesse in the noting of errors. He that tells me a fault, ayming at my good; I must thinke him wise and faithfull: wise, in spying that which
<pb facs="7"/>
I see not: faithfull, in a plaine admonishment, not tainted with flattery. That I haue made it publique, I pleade not the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of friends: that were to play at Hazzard for folly, if it prooue not. I writ it without incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from another; and as I writ it, I send it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade. Rare, I know it is not: Honest, I am sure it is: Though thou findest not to admire, thou maist to like. What I aime at in
<pb facs="7"/>
it, I confesse, hath most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to my selfe; That I might out of my owne Schoole take a lesson, should serue mee for my whole Pilgrimage: and if I should wander from these rests, that my owne <hi>Items</hi> might set me in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens direct way againe. We doe not so readily run into crimes, that from our owne mouth haue had sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation. Yet, as no Phisician can be so abstemious, as to follow
<pb facs="8"/>
strictly all his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions: So I thinke there is no Christian so much his minds master, as to keepe precisely all his resolutions. They may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shewe what hee would be, then what he is. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath too slow afoote, to follow Religion close at the heele. Who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, our dull flesh should wing it with the flights of the soule? He is not a good man that liues perfect; but hee that liues as well as he
<pb facs="8"/>
can, and as humane fraileties will let him. He that thus farre striues not, neuer began to bee vertuous; nor knowes he those transcending ioyes, that continually feast in the noble-minded man. All the externall pleasures that mortality is capable of, can neuer enkindle a flame, that shall so brauely warme the soule, as the loue of vertue, &amp; the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge of the rule we haue ouer our own
<pb facs="9"/>
wild passions. That I might curbe those, I haue writ these: and if in them, thou find'st a line may mend thee; I shall thinke I haue diuulg'd it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Reade all, and vse thy mindes libertie; how thy suffrage falls, I weigh not: For it was not writ so much to please others, as to profit my selfe.</p>
   <closer>Farewell.</closer>
