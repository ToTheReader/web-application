      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His watch-word of Christ,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
if it be not now a word in
season, I knowe not when
euer it was, or will bee:
Would he now vouchsafe
to bestowe a Letter vpon his Church
here on earth; should hee need to alter
the tenour of this? which being the last,
to the last of the seuen Churches, why
may it not (saith an Ancient, vpon this
text) typifie the estate of the last Age
of his Churches? the coldnesse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
himselfe hath expresly foretold.
And if God should now send through
the earth such surueying angels as <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 12</note>
      <pb facs="5"/>
mentions chapter 1; Could they
returne any other obseruation of their
trauailes then theirs; <hi>The whole world
lies in lukewarmnesse?</hi> which makes me
often in my thoughts proportion these
ends of time,<note place="margin">1 King. 1. 1</note> to the like period of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
age when no clothes were enow
to keepe heate in him. <hi>Faith</hi> I grant
is a more radicall, vitall, and necessary
grace; but yet not so wholly out of
<hi>Grace</hi> with the times, as poore <hi>Zeale;</hi>
which yet if by any meanes it might
once againe be reduced into fauour, and
practice, before Time sets, and bee no
more; I doubt not but Christ would
also yet once againe in this euening of
the world, come and <hi>Sup</hi> with vs; A
fauour including all other in it.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> My desire especially is, that this our
Iland might take it to it selfe, as well as
if it had by name bene directed to it;
what would it hurt vs to make an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
benefit and vse of it? Some of
our owne, haue so applied it; (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of their iudgements, or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="5"/>
I say not.) Learned <hi>Fulke</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells
if it were not by a Propheticall
spirit penned for vs: others (in their
<gap reason="illegible: blurred" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eare) more resolutely haue made it a
singular type of purpose for vs. Their
warrant I know not; especially if it bee
true which all trauellers tell you, <hi>That
they finde more zeale at home then abroad.</hi>
Wee are I grant in sundry respects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
to <hi>Laodicea:</hi> Euen the very names
thereof, as well the first and oldest in
regard of the blessings of God, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
Gods Darling, as the latter in regard
of good Lawes and Ciuility, <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
How well do they become vs? As rich
as they, and that in the very same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
of woolles; <hi>Abounding as they</hi>
with many learned <hi>Zenoes,</hi> and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Hieroes: Parallel</hi> in all regards; I
would I could say lukewarmenesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
But I must bee a faithfull and
true witnesse, and yet this is all I haue
to say; It was, as I conceiue, <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceas</hi>
complexion and not her consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
her practice not her orders, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
<pb facs="6"/>
lukewarmenesse not legall, which
Christ strikes at. That fault I find in my
text, the same I finde in our common
Christians, whose spirituall condition
and state is too like the externall situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Country, between the Torrid,
and the Frigid Zones; neither hot nor
cold: and so like <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that if wee
take not warning, or warming, we may
I feare in time come to be spued out of
Gods mouth.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For this present assembly of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
could all the choyce &amp; time in the
world haue better fitted me then mine
ordinarie Lot? If fire bee set vpon the
Beacons, will not the whole Countrey
soone be warned and enlightened?</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For my selfe also, me thinkes it will
better beseeme my yeares to heale,
then to teach my Ancients; to enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
their affections, then to enforme
their iudgements. And whereas <hi>Paul</hi>
bids <hi>Titus</hi> preach zeale with all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
though in mine owne name I
craue your patience, and audience, yet
<pb facs="6"/>
in his name that is the first of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and <hi>Amen,</hi> I counsell him that
hath an eare, to heare what the Spirit
saith to the Churches;
