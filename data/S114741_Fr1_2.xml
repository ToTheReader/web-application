   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Monge other mooste syngular offyces (dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygent reader) which the lord hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be done in the ernest sprete of Hely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, by the forerōners of hys lattre aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce, this is one verye specyall to be noted. They shall turne the hartes of their auncient elders into the chyldren. Mala. iiii. And the vnbeleuers of theyr tyme, to the wysdome of those ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse fathers, as ded Iohan Baptyste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hys fyrste commyng. Luce. i. That is (say the Bedas cap. lxviii. de tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ratione) the fayth and feruent zele of the prophetes and Apostles shal they plant in their hartes,<note place="margin">Bedes prophecy.</note> whych shal in tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se dayes lyue and be among men conuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>saunt, &amp; than wyl breake fourth (sayth he as a verye true prophete) such horry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble persecucyon, as wyl fyrst of all take from the worlde, those myghtye helya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by triumphaunt martyrdom, to the terryfyenge of other in the same faythe of whom some shal becom through that occasion,<note place="margin">2. sortes.</note> most gloryouse martyrs vnto
<pb facs="3"/>
Christ also, &amp; some very wycked Aposta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taes forsaking his lyuely doctrine. For by the seyd Bedas testymony in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnyng of the same chaptre, two most certayne sygnes shall we thā haue that the lattre iudgement daye is at hande. The returne of Israels remnaunt vnto theyr lord God,<note place="margin">2. sygnes.</note> and the horryble perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cucion of Antichrist.</p>
   <p>Conferre with this treated scripture and former prophecye of that vertuous man Bedas, the worldes alteracyon now, with the terrible turmoilynges of our tyme. And as in a mooste clere myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, ye shal well perceyue them at this present, to be in moost quick workynge. And as concernynge the Israelytes or Iewes,<note place="margin">Israely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> I haue bothe seane and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of them in Germanye, mooste fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Christen beleuers. Neyther is it in the prophecye (Osee. iii.) that they shoulde at that daye be all conuerted, no more than they were at Iohan Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tystes preachynge. Luce. i. For as Esaye reporteth, thoughe the posteryte of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob be as the see sande (innumerable) yet shall but a remnaunte of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte than vnto theyr lorde God. Esaie x. And thoughe the Lorde hathe syfted that howse of Israell (as brused corne in a syffe) amonge all other nacyons,
<pb facs="3"/>
Amos. ix. Yet shal not that remnaunt of theirs peryshe, but at that daye be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,<note place="margin">preachers,</note> throughe the onelye electyon of grace, Romano. xi. Nowe concernynge the afore seyd foreronners, in this most wonderful change of the worlde before the latter ende therof. I thynke within thys realme of Englande, besydes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nacions abroade, the sprete of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyas was not all a slepe in good Wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam Tydall, Robarte Barnes,<note place="margin">Tyndale.

Regum. ii.</p>
   <p>These turned the hartes of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into the chyldren, suche tyme as they toke from a greate nombre of oure nacyon, by theyr Godlye preachynges, and wrytynges, the corrupted beleue of the pope &amp; his mastery workers (which were no fathers, but cruel robbers &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers. Ioā. x.) reducynge thē agayn to the true faithe of Abraham and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Gene. xv. and Math. xvi. The pure beleue in Christes birthe and passion, which Adam and Noe sucked out of the first promes of God,<note place="margin">The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> Iacob and Moses out of the seconde, Dauid and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, out of the thirde, and so fourthe the Apostles &amp; fathers oute of the other
<pb facs="4"/>
scriptures, so firmelye planted they in the consciences of manye, that no cruell kynde of deathe coulde auerte thē from it. As we haue for example their consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt discyples, and now stronge witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Martyrs.</note> Iohan Lassels and Anne Askewe, with theyr other. ii. com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panions, verye gloryous martyrs afore God, what thoughe they be not so afore the wronge iudgynge eyes of the world whom the bloudye remnaunte of Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ put vnto mooste cruell deathe in Smythfelde at London, in the yeare of our lorde. M.D.XLVI. in Iulye.</p>
   <p>Yf they be onely (as was Iohan Bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyst) great afore the Lorde by the holye scriptures allowaunce, which are stron<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gelye adourned with the graces of hys sprete, as faythe, force, vnderstandynge wisdome, pacyence, loue, long sufferaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce and suche lyfe.

lyuynge god. Yf their blynd babyes to proue them vnlyke, do obiect agaynst me, the myracles shewed at theyr dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes more than at these, as that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythfull generacyon is euer desyerous of wonders. Math. xii. I wold but kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we of thē, what myracles were shewed whan Iohā Baptystes head was cut of in the preson?<note place="margin">myracles.</note> Marci. vi. and whan Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes the Apostle was byheaded at Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem? Acto. xii. These. ii. were excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent afore God, what though they were but miserable wretches, light fellowes sedycyouse heretykes, busye knaues, &amp; lowsye beggers in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> syght of noble king Herode and hys honorable counsell of prelates. For had not rochettes and side gownes bene at hande,<note place="margin">rochettes.</note> haplye they had not so lyghtlye dyed,</p>
   <p>Yf they allege Steuen,<note place="margin">Steuen.</note> to maynteyne theyr purpose, that he at his deathe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde heauen open. I aske of thē againe what they were whiche se it more than his own persone? Sure I am that their wycked predecessours there presente, se it not. For they stopped theyr eares, whan he tolde them therof. Actoru. vii. Yf they yet bringe fourth the other hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storyes of Apostles and martyrs.<note place="margin">Legendes</note> I ans<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>were them, that all they are of no suche autorite, as these here afore. The popes
<pb facs="5"/>
martyrs in dede, were moche fuller of myracles than euer were Christes, as hys selfe tolde vs they shulde be so. Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>they. xxiiii. Yet wrought fryre Forest, Iohā Fisher, &amp; Thomas More no mira<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cles,<note place="margin">Forest. Fysher.

With that Erasmus ded also ad Huttenū.<note place="margin">Writers.</note> P. M. ad Basparem Agrippam, Albertus Pighius, Riuius, Fichardus, &amp; a great sort more. And as for the holye mayd of kēt with Doctor Bocking, though they wrought great wonders by theyr lyfe, yet apered non at their deathes. Of hys owne chosen martyrs,<note place="margin">Christen martirs.</note> Christ loketh for non other myracle, but that onelye they perseuer faythfull to the ende. Mathe. x. And neuer denye his verite afore men Luce. xii. For that worthye vyctorye of the synnefull worlde, standethe in the inuyncyblenesse of fayth, and not in my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racles and wonders, as those wauerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge wittes suppose. i.

of Iesu Anne Askewe, a gentylwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man verye yonge, dayntye, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, had with that outragynge Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goge, in her. ii. examynacions, about the xxv. yeare of her age, whom she sent abroade by her owne hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge.

hys tyme and after, wyll be reckned but vyle swyne heardes to hym, for the good fauer he bare to Chrystes holye Gospell.

   <p>Now concernynge that blessed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Anne Askewe,<note place="margin">Anne As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewe.</note> which latelye suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the tyrannye of this world for right wisnesse sake.

But no worthynesse in the fleshe, neyther yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye worldlye noblenesse auaileth to god warde, afore whome is no acceptacyon of persone. Actorum x.

Soch a wone was she, as was Lydia the purple sellar,<note place="margin">Lydia.</note> whose har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te the lorde opened by the godlye prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge of Paule at Thiatira, Acto. xvi. For dylygent hede gaue she to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb facs="7"/>
whan it was ones taught wythoute supersticion, &amp; would no lōgar be a false worshipper or ydolatour after the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked scole of Antichrist. But became frō thens forth a true worshipper, worship<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping her lorde God (whych is a sprete &amp; not breade) in sprete &amp; in veryte, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worde of his, Ioan. iiii.

   <p>By her do I here (dere fryndes in the Lord) as ded the faithfull Bretherne in Fraunce, at the cities of Lions and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuna by a lyke faythfull yonge wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man called Blandina,<note place="margin">Blandina</note> Whyche was there put to deathe with. iii. myghtye companyons more amonge other (as thys was) for her Christē beleue, about the yeare of our lorde.

for so moch as it was there so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfestly done amonge yow. Coupled I haue these ii. examples togither, bycau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se I fynde them in so manye pointes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree Blandina was yonge and tender. So was Anne Askewe also.<note place="margin">Anne As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewe.</note> But that which was fraile of nature in thē both. Christ made most stronge by hys grace. Blandina had iii. ernest companions in Christ.<note place="margin">Compani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons.</note> Maturus Sanctes, and Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, so feruently faythfull as her selfe. So had Anne Askewe iii. fyre fellowes, a gentylman called Iohan Lassels her instructour, a preste, and a tayler called Iohan Adlam, men in Chrystes veryte vnto the ende most cōstaunt.<note place="margin">Recāters.</note> With Blā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dina were in preson, to the nombre of x. whych denyed the truthe and were cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relie forsakē of God for it. How manye fell frō Christ besydes Crome &amp; Shax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, whan Anne Askewe stode faste by hym, I am vncerteyne. But I counsell them, as saynte Iohan counselled the Laodycyanes, in the myserable estate they are now in, to hye them through tryed golde of Christ,<note place="margin">Tryed Golde.</note> least they perysh all togither. Apoca. iii. If they had not styll remayned in that chauncell,<note place="margin">The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uncell.</note> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Christe commaunded Iohan in no wyse to measure, Apoc. ii. They had neuer so shamefullye blasphemed, lyke

as Bedas also toucheth in hys former prophecye.</p>
   <p>Prompt was Blandina, and of most lustye corage,<note place="margin">Corage.</note> in renderynge her lyfe for the lyberte of her faythe. No lesse lyue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye and quyck was Anne Askewe in all her enprisoninges and tormētes. Great was the loue, Blandina had to Christ. No lesse was the loue of Anne Askewe. Blandina neuer faynted in torment.<note place="margin">Rakced.</note> No more ded Anne Askewe in sprete, whan she was so terrybly racked of the chaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celler and Ryche, that the strynges of her armes and eyes were peryshed Blā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina deryded the cruelte of the tyraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. So ded Anne Askewe the madnesse of the Byshoppes and their speche men Reade burnynge plates of yron and of brasse had Blandina put to her sydes.<note place="margin">Burned.</note> So had Anne Askewe the flamynge brā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of fyre. Full of God and his veryte was Blandina. So was Anne Askewe to the verye ende. Christ wonderfullye tryumphed in Blandina. So ded he in Anne Askewe, whan she made no noyse on the racke, and so ernestlye afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de reioyced in him. Blandina was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen fourth to wyld beastes to be deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.<note place="margin">Beastes</note> So was Anne Askewe to cruel Bis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shoppes &amp; prestes, whom Christ calleth rauenynge wolues, deuourers, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
<pb facs="8"/>
Mathe. vii. &amp; Iohan, x. Blandina vpon the scaffolde boldelye reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the pagane prestes of theyr errour. So dyd Anne Askewe when she was fast tied to the stake, with stomack rebu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> blasphemous apostata Shaxton with the Bishoppes and prestes genera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyon,<note place="margin">Shaxtō.</note> for theyr manyfest mayntenaunce of ydolatrye.</p>
   <p>Blandina at the stake shewed a vysa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge vnterryfyed. So ded Anne Askewe a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>countenaunce stowte, myghtye and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. Infatygable was the sprete of Blā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dina. So was the sprete of Anne As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kew. The loue of Iesus Christ, the gift of the holy Ghost, and hope of the crow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne of martirdome, greatlye mytygated the paine in Blandina. So ded those. iii worthy graces,<note place="margin">Graces.</note> the terrour of all tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes in Anne Askewe.

to their aduersatyes. So was Anne Askewe very lowlye to true teachers, but scorneful and hygh stomaked to the enemyes of truthe: Many were conuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted by the sufferaunce of Blandina. A farre greatter nombre by the burnynge of Anne Askewe. Though Blandina we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re yonge, yet was she called the mother of martyrs.<note place="margin">Mother.</note> Manye men haue supposed Anne Askewe, for her Chrysten constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye to be no lesse. Blandina prayed for her persecuters. So dyd Anne Askewe most feruentlye. The ashes of blandina and of other martirs, were throwne in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the stood of Rhodanus. What was done with the Ashes of Anne Askewe &amp; her companyons,<note place="margin">Asshes.</note> I can not yet tell.</p>
   <p>All these former reportes of Blandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na and manye more besydes, hath Euse<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bius in Ecclesiastica historia, libro. v. cap. i. ii. &amp;. iii.

And as touchinge Anne Askewe, these. ii. examinacions, with her other knowen handelynges in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande,<note place="margin">Not all deed.</note> are witnesse for her suffycyent. Thus hath not the fyre taken Anne As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewe al whole from the world, but left her here vnto it more pure, perfyghte, &amp; precious than afore, as it wyl also Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han

Lassels within short space. So that concernyng her, it maye well be sayde, that Paule verefyeth. ii. Cor. xii. The strength of God is here made perfyght by weakenes.<note place="margin">Weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> Whan she semed most fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than was she most strōge. And glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye she reioyced in that weakenes, that Christes power myght strongely dwell in her. Thus choseth the lord, the folysh of thys worlde to cōfounde the wyse, &amp; the weake to deface the myghtye. Yea, thynges despysed &amp; thought verye vyle to brynge thynges vnto naught whych the worlde hath in most hyghe reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciō.
