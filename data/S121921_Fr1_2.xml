      <salute>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, MY VERY GOOD LORD, RAPH LORD VRE, Lord President of Wales: Continuance and encrease of all Honor and happinesse, from Christ Iesus.</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable, amongst the many discouragements that haue attended this glorious businesse of the Virginian plantation: none hath been so frequent, and so forcible, as the calumnies and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, raised vpon our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and the Countrey it selfe. These being deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Diuell, and set abroach by idle and base companions, are blowen abroad by Papists, Players and such like, till they haue filled the vulgar eares▪ And hauing once entred, then they run (like wilde fire) from man to man: for as wilde fire, hardly findes a house which is not matter combustible; so these idle tales hardly meete a man who giues not (passage at the least, if not) credit to them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Diuell and his associates (of all sorts) hold
<pb facs="3"/>
and practise this rule,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Calumniare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacter, aliquid <unclear>haeret</unclear>.</hi>
      </note> as a sure Maxime, speake any thing, some will beleeue it; be it neuer so false, some will entertaine it, Truth and Innocencie shall neuer so wipe it off, but some thing will stick behind. Our onely comfort is (next to the assurance of Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the worke) that men of honourable minds, and ingenuous dispositions, and all that are godly-wise, will check and controule these idle and slanderous surmises, as they meet with them: and for their better assistance, encouragement and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in so doing, our Counsell and Gouernours hold it needfull to make knowne to the world, such relations and informations as wee receiue from thence, from men of iudgement and experience, and of approued faithfulnesse and integritie. And therefore though this ensuing Treatise (written by Master <hi>Whitaker,</hi> one of our Ministers in <hi>Virginia</hi>) was spoken there, and sent hither rather for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate vse and encouragement of such, whose purses heere, or persons there were ing<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ged in the action, then with any intent to make it publike: yet for the reasons aforesaid, it was held fit after mature consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to diuulge it, that so the naked and plaine truth may giue a iust affront to the cunning and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured falshoods deuised by the enemies of this Plantation.</p>
   <p>And because the man was once so well knowne to me (as he is still, and euer shall be beloued of me) I was desired by them, that may command mee to peruse the Originall it selfe, and for that I had (as they probably thought) some knowledge of his hand, to consider whether truly or suspiciously it
<pb facs="3"/>
bore his name. And if I found cause of the least suspicion, to reiect it: but if, by true and infallible tokens, to be his hand, then to giue some testimony to the world of a truth so euident?</p>
   <p>Two points therefore I perceiue needfull to bee made knowne,<note place="margin">The f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>rst point: who Master <hi>Whitaker</hi> is that wrote this Treatise.</note> which I desire all men to take notice of, from mee, who haue peculiar reason to know them both, so well, as few or no other can: first, who the Author is; and then, whether this come vndoubtedly from him or no.</p>
   <p>The Author is Master <hi>Alexander Whitaker,</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to the Colonie at <hi>Henrico,</hi> vnder the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the valorous and worthy Knight Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Dale,</hi> with whom also he went: hee was sonne to that reuerend renowned, Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi>: a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Arts of fiue or sixe yeares standing in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge: was seated in the North countrey, where he was well approued by the greatest, and beloued of his people, and had competent allowance to his good liking, and was in as good possibility of better liuing, as any of his time: he had also some meanes of his owne left him by his parents: all which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, he mee<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ely of himselfe, for ought I know, entertained a purpose of going to <hi>Virginia,</hi> to assist that Christian plantation in the function of a Preacher of the Gospell. And hauing after many distractions and combates with himselfe (as he told me) setled his resolution, that God called him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore he would goe: He accordingly made it good, notwithstanding the earnest diswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many his nearest friends, and the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements which he daily heard of, touching
<pb facs="4"/>
the businesse and Countrey it selfe: and arriued there with Sir <hi>Thomas Dale,</hi> by a very speedy and safe passage (scarce of eight weekes long) in May 1611. from whence he hath since then written ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comfortable letters, both to the Counsell and Committies, and his priuate friends: and of late (after he had beene there a yeare and more) hath sent vs this little Treatise, which as I know assuredly to come from him, and to be a great part of it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and all of it subscribed with his owne hand.<note place="margin">The second point That it is assuredly <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his owne hand.</note> So I dare say, if he had thought wee would haue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished it, he would otherwise haue adorned it: for I know (and so doe others that know him) hee is able to haue written it in Latine or in Greeke, and so to haue decked it both for phrase and stile, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ornaments of learning and language, as might shew him no vnworthy sonne of so worthy a father: And I dare say, if he liue, (be it in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia</hi>) he will in due time manifest to the world by true and good euidence, that God hath made him heire, as of diuers of the holy vertues, so of a good part of the learning of his renowned father. And the more liberall am I in giuing him his due, the further he is off from mee, and by that meanes can be the lesse sensible of it.</p>
   <p>Nor speake I this so much for his sake (though I loue him aboue many, and know it aboue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) whose owne deeds will sufficiently approue him. As for the truth which is so much suppressed, and that Christian plantation so much disparaged in this base world: for are they not so impudent as to say▪ who go thither but base and banke-rupt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb facs="4"/>
and who haue no meanes of their owne? or else such as are perswaded and wrought vpon to go? And when they come there, are they not star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and do they not die like dogges? But how false this is in respect of the Countrey, the narration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlaced in this discourse from him that liues there, will declare: and how slanderous the other is to the persons, I shall in some sort make it appeare.</p>
   <p>I therefore hereby let all men know (and malice it selfe shall neuer disproue it) that a Scholler, a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duate, a Preacher, well borne, and friended in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, not in debt nor disgrace, but competently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for, and liked, and beloued where he liued, not in want, but (for a scholler, and as these dayes be) rich in possession, and more in possibilitie, of himselfe without any perswasion (but Gods, and his owne heart) did voluntarily leaue his warme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nest, and to the wonder of his kindred, and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them that knew him, vndertooke this hard, but in my iudgement, heroicall resolution to go to <hi>Virginia,</hi> and helpe <hi>to beare the name of God vnto the Gentiles.</hi> Men may muse at it; some may laugh, and others wonder at it. But will you know the reason? God will be glorified in his owne workes, and what he hath determined to do, hee will find meanes to bring to passe, for the perfecting therefore of this blessed worke; he hath stirred vp able and worthie men to vndertake the manning and managing of it: Magistracie and Ministery are the strength and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes; nay the very life and being of a Christian body politique. Therefore seeing without these all emptying of purses heere, and ventering of persons
<pb facs="5"/>
thither, is to no purpose. God in his wisdome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, and in his mercie prouoked, godly and able men to furnish both these functions: and such as might at home haue liued in places of honour and command, or in fashion competent and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their conditions.</p>
   <p>And this, Right Honorable, is one of the foure Arguments, and as it were plaine demonstrations, that haue conuinced mee to beleeue that assuredly God himselfe is the founder, and fauourer of this Plantation. And I will craue leaue of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to put them downe, because I am of minde, that the want either of knowledge, or considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hereof, hath beene, and is the cause of the error and misprision of the world, touching this busines; and doe thinke that if men did ruminate, and adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly consider of these particulars, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue themselues for their former thoughts, and say plainly, <hi>Digitus Dei est hic.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="1">1 The maruellous and indeed miraculous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance of our worthy Gouernours, Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> Liefetenant generall, and Sir <hi>George Somers,</hi> Admirall, with all their company, of some hundred and fiftie persons, vpon the feared and abhorred Ilands of the <hi>Barmudaes,</hi> without losse of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, when the same houre nothing was before their eyes, but imminent and ineuitable death; as neuer ship came there that perished not, so neuer was it heard of, that any ship wrackt there, but with the death of all or most of the people, saue onely this of ours. Oh how the world should haue rung of it ere this, if a farre lesse deliuerance had happened to
<pb facs="5"/>
any of the Iesuiticall plantations: and surely the Counsell of <hi>Virginia</hi> doe wrong themselues and the businesse: nay they must giue me leaue to tell them they obscure the glorie of God, if they take not order, that a full compleate and plaine narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that whole action, both danger and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be published to the world.</p>
   <p n="2">2 The full discouerie (by meanes of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer deliuerance) of those <hi>Barmuda</hi> Ilands, which hitherto haue been held in the world, as inacces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, so not habitable, but so fearefull, hideous and hatefull, as it seemed a place abandoned of God and Man, and giuen vp to the diuels power and possession, and to bee of all knowne places in the world, a very hell vpon earth, rather then a place for men to dwell in. But those honorable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being by the heauenly Pylot preserued vpon them, where all men else perished, liuing there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a yeare (till they had made themselues two little ships of Cedar) found it so goodly, so ritch, so plentifull, so healthie, and so temperate a Countrey, as in so long a time, scarce three died of 150. In so much as hardly could they get their men away, when they departed: these Ilands being then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, and since possessed and planted by vs, are found a habitation of such safetie and securitie (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no enemie within nor any to be feared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, because the entrance is so difficult:) and of such plentie of all things for life; and of so good temper for health; and fraught with so many rich commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities for satisfaction of the Aduenturers, as for the present they bee euen as a new life and a seminarie
<pb facs="6"/>
to <hi>Virginia:</hi> and for the future times, it is likely will prooue a matter of greater consequence, then most men thinke of, and of more worth, then any Ilands or continent discouered in our age.</p>
   <p n="3">3 The speciall and most fatherly prouidence of God ouer this action, in vpholding it when man had forsaken it, and giuing it life againe when man had left it for dead: for had not Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> and Sir <hi>George Somers</hi> come into <hi>Virginia</hi> from the <hi>
         <unclear>Barmudaes</unclear>
      </hi> euen when they did, the poore Colonie (which during that yeare of their absence, by endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the miserie of misgouernement, had fallen into all extremitie of distresse) had been gone away, and our Plantation possessed by the Sauages: and (which was much more miraculous) when they being come in, and in all about 240. persons, and in such extreame miserie and famine, as the Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Commander was euen forced to yeeld to that which others moued (but himselfe had rather haue died then done) namely to put themselues to the Sea to come for <hi>England,</hi> and quit the Countrey: and when this (full sore against his heart) was put in execution, and euery man aboord, their Orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Armour buried, and not an English soule left in <hi>Iames</hi> Towne, and giuing by their peale of shot, their last and wofull farewell to that pleasant land, were now with sorrowfull hearts go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe the Riuer: Behold the hand of heauen from aboue, at the very instant, sent in the Right Honorable <hi>La war</hi> to meet them euen at the riuers mouth, with prouision and comforts of all kind: who if hee had staied but two Tydes longer had
<pb facs="6"/>
come into <hi>Virginia,</hi> and not found one English man: whereupon they all with as much ioy retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as with sorrow they had come away, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as it were a new entrie and possession, tooke vp their Ordnance and their Armour, and the next day receiued their Honorable Lord Generall, with all ioy and applause, and from that day by Gods blessing they neuer wanting gouernment, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wanted bread, for him that would take paines and do his dutie. If euer the hand of God appeared in action of man, it was heere most euident: for when man had forsaken this businesse, God tooke it in hand; and when men said, now hath all the earth cast off the care of this Plantation, the hand of heauen hath taken hold of it: God therefore bee glorified in his owne worke.</p>
   <p>But it will be heere said by such as are strangers or enemies to this businesse: if this Countrey be so rich and plentifull, and your Commanders so wise and prouident, as you pretend; how could it be that they being there, and not hindered by warre nor inuasions, should fall into such extremities of want, as to be faine to quit the Countrey, and come for England, or else there to starue for want of food.</p>
   <p>Indeed (Right Honorable) this Obiection is of such moment, as though I am vnwilling to be large, yet must I needs spend some lines in giuing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere; which shall be such, I hope, as shall giue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the indifferent, and stop the mouthes of the malignant.</p>
   <p>Let therefore the Christian and courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be pleased to know, that when the two forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="7"/>
Commanders, in the great shippe (called the Sea-Venture) were lost, and yet saued vpon the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudaes,</hi> their Fleet consisting of sixe or seuen ships more, and fraught with almost foure hundred men landed (after a long and terrible tempest) in <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> where so many men wanting their Gouernors, and being too many to be commanded by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony they found there before them, fell first into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and at last into plaine distractions: and so one yeare of misgouernment ouerthrew that body, which till then had prospered, and by good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was brought to so good a state, as at their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they had corne sufficient in store, a haruest in the ground, good store of liuing cattell, and had the Sauages in good correspondencie: but this one, yea our want of gouernment) the mos<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> disasterous accident that euer befell that businesse) brought all to nothing, for it hindered the building of houses, and planting of corne, nay it burnt vp the houses, and consumed the prouisions; so that of good store of poultrie, it left not one aliue, and of six hundred liuing Swine, not three: and which was worse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed our men, and which was worst of all, it lost vs the Sauages, which since hath cost many a man his blood, and to this day is not recouered.</p>
   <p>All this while were the Commanders, and their company in the <hi>Barmudaes,</hi> where no man drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, but all the world held them dea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> men; and being there where none could heare from them, nor they from any others: after almost a years absence, they go out of the rockes, in the two ships themselues there made, and going for <hi>Virginia,</hi> they
<pb facs="7"/>
landed there in the beginning of May; where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to find a full and well planted Colony, of six or seuen hundred men, well stored with corne and cattell: (in assurance whereof, they had carried no liue Hogges with them from the <hi>Barmudaes,</hi> nor other prouisions, more then for a monthes voyage, which they might haue done in as great abundance as they could haue carried) they contrariwise found a poore Colony, of not an hundred men, who had endured all miseries, and more then euer we heard of; all the liue-cattell, corne, and other prouisions spent, and the Sauages their deadly enemies. At which meeting, though there was ioy to see them, who had beene held so long in the bottome of the sea; yet their sweete congratulation was sharpely sauced, when it was knowne they had no prouision of their owne, the Sauages sought their liues, the earth could yeeld none, where none had been plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and if it had, yet in May the old being spent, the new is not readie. All which considered, it soone appeared there was no humane help left on earth, but with all speed to hasten for England for new prouisions: which motion, though so harsh to the honourable Commander, as hee had rather there haue starued, yet being carried by voices, he would not ouer-rule: and so hauing buried their Armour and Ordnance, they went away as wee heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
   <p>All this to be true, I know well, and if any man aske how I know it, for their satisfaction I answere; I haue it from the faithful relation of that religious, valoutous and prudent Gentleman, Sir <hi>Thomas
<pb facs="8"/>
Gates,</hi> then and yet our Liefetenant generall, who being himselfe in his owne person a doer of much, a sufferer of more, and an eye-witnes of the whole, hath since related this and much more vnto mee, face to face: and all that know him, know him for such a man, as well deserues to be beleeued.</p>
   <p>All which then being true (as is also well knowne to many my betters) then let any reasonable man <unclear>iudge</unclear> (especially if hee bee experienced in such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires) if there were not a necessary cause of their comming away, and yet neither fault in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, nor want in the Countrey.</p>
   <p>My fourth and last Argument is, the stirring vp of so many Honorable and worthy persons of all conditions, to disburse so freely and so willingly, such faire summes of money, and some of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a good part of their estate, and that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certaine or apparant hope of speedie profit. This to do willingly and voluntarily, and without assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of gaine, cannot be, but the working of God to some higher end then ordinary. And if it be said, there be some, that wish their money in their purses; it may be so, but for one so base-thoughted man, I dare say we haue many, that wish a great deale more out of their purses, conditionally this happy busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse may take good effect. And this, though it be much, yet in my iudgement is but little, to this that followeth: that God should vouchsafe to stirre vp such able and worthy men, for the functions both of Magistracie and Ministerie, who vpon very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine hope of profit, and most certaine danger of life it selfe, should put themselues into this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="8"/>
and voluntarily vndergoe the danger of sea, and all the miseries and difficulties that necessarily and vndoubtedly attend a new Plantation. To haue done this vpon pressure, or by calling of Superiours or command of a State, had bin little; to haue done it vpon safe and faire tearmes, and without danger, had been no great matter; to haue done it vpon expectation, and assurance of high rewards and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent profit, had been nothing: but to do it volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, vpon sight of danger present and certaine, but of gaine future and contingent; seeing it is contrary to the course of reason, &amp; cānot proceed from folly or madnes (they being wise men) nor from humor and rashnes (being stayed men) nor from malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentednes (being men that liued in good respect at home) nor in the cōceit of meriting (being not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, but of sound religion): It must therfore needs proceed frō y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> extraordinary motiō of Gods Spirit. For if any out of ignorāce or malice do obiect, they had nothing to do at home; it is false and friuolous; false, for they were mē imployed; friuolous, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more had lesse to do thē they, yet would not go.</p>
   <p>As for those that thinke they wanted in England, do they not see how in disgracing the persons, they honor the Countrey? for if they went from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to <hi>Virginia,</hi> because they were in want, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily stay there still; then it followes that <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> is able to supply the wants of England. But how idle and slanderous that imputation is, may easily appeare, if wee take a view of the persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.

what Coronall or Captaine in the Low-countries, but knowes, and will acknowledge, that the Right Honorable, the Lord <hi>La war,</hi> and the Right worthie Knights, Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Dale,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Somers,</hi> bee persons of honor, estimation, and good respect, and had both meanes and imployment at home of their owne: but to speake of them and other religious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Captains, who voluntarily left their easie, pleasant, and wealthy liues in England, and betook themselues to this voyage; I will leaue it to some who are better able to doe it, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert and worth: I will containe my selfe within my element, and speake of them of my owne function: and amongst them, of those two especially, Master <hi>Glouer,</hi> and Master <hi>Whitaker,</hi> because they went by my knowledge, but not by my procurement; for I testifie it for truth, they moued me that they might go; not I them, that they would go. Master <hi>Glouer</hi> an ancient Master of Arts in Cambridge, an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Preacher in Bedford and Huntington-shire, reuerenced and respected, and neuer wanting a competent stipend, yet of himselfe (I know not how, nor why) made knowne his desire to goe to <hi>Virginia,</hi>

      </note> to a Reuerend Preacher in Huntington, and procuring his letters to me; vpon my answere came vp, being a man I had neuer seene before: and so being well liked of the Counsell, and conditions being tendered him to his content, he went away with Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> in Iune, 1611. but being in yeares, and of a weake constitution, endured not the sea and sickenesse of the Countrey, so well as
<pb facs="9"/>
yonger and stronger bodies; and so after zealous and faithfull performance of his Ministeriall dutie, whilest he was able, he gaue his soule to Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus (vnder whose banner he went to fight; and for whose glorious names sake he vndertooke the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) more worthy to be accounted a true Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of Christ, then hundreds that are canonized in the Popes Martyrologe.</p>
   <p>Master <hi>Whitaker,</hi> a man borne, brought vp, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litied, and qualified, setled and prouided for, as you heard before (of whom I haue spoken the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was of long time so well knowne to mee) though he liued as well, and in as good case and credit, as most yong men in our Church: yet volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, and not suddenly; but after serious delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ouercomming (as himselfe said) many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward temptations, and outward discouragements and disswasions; remooued himselfe from a good stipend of valew and certaintie,<note place="margin">About fortie pound a yeare in a cheape Country.</note> and put himselfe into this dangerous voiage, where now he diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preacheth, and Catechizeth: and thereby, and by other Ministeriall duties, publike and priuate (and otherwise also, for he is otherwaies qualitied) he performes daily and diligent Seruice, acceptable to God, &amp; comfortable to our people; ouer whom hee is Pastor: and from whence, as a token of his loue and duetie to the Counsell and Aduenturers, and as a testimonie of the good liking he conceiues of the Countrey (by these almost two yeares expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) hee hath sent vs this plaine, but pithie and godly exhortation, interlaced with narrations of many particulars touching the Countrey, climate,
<pb facs="10"/>
and commodities, worthie to bee knowne of all, especially comming from one of his place and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and of so good experience in the matter he writes of. There is also (besides it may be some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom I know not) Master <hi>Bucke,</hi> an able and painfull Preacher: of whom I can say the lesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was of Oxford, and vnknowne to me; but of whom I haue heard Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> giue a good and worthie testimonie, and he came to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and to this imployment, with the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a right reuerend Prelate:<note place="margin">

And because God would more grace this businesse, and honor his owne worke, he prouided vs such men as wanted neither liuing, nor libertie of preaching at home: (more in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment haue they to answere for, who wanting both, will not only not go themselues, but disparage and

But in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie of this Plantation to put their liues into their hands, and vnder the assurance of so many dangers and difficulties, to deuote themselues vnto it, was certainely a holy and heroicall resolution, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded vndoubtedly from the blessed Spirit of Christ Iesus,<note place="margin">1.

   </p>
   <p>And thus (Right Honorable) you haue the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that haue satisfied my conscience, that this worke is of God, and will therefore stand, though man should vnfaithfully forsake it: and I doubt not, but if many others did know them, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them, they would certainely change their minds, and say with me, <hi>Doubtlesse heere is the finger of God.</hi> As for the continuall calumnies and daily slanders raised of the place, Plantation, and persons that are in it: and the iests of prophane Players, and other Sycophants, and the flouts and mockes of some, who by their age and profession should be no mockers, (for as for the rest, who can expect any better figs from thistles, or any sweeter grapes from such pricking thornes) for all those, I say, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discouragements and deprauements of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I professe I like the businesse the better, and
<pb facs="11"/>
haue more hope of Gods blessing vpon it, euen of that <hi>God, whose wisdome is but foolishnesse with worldly men, and whose wayes are hid from carnall eyes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And these reasons, I confesse, haue so farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed with me, as this Plantation shall euer haue a portion of my poore estate, and my best prayers, and my personall paines, and presence also, if God had not prouided them fitter men for such a worke.</p>
   <p>There is but one thing more, that an indifferent Reader may probably stumble at, which I wil brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and easily remoue. It may bee very well, (will some say) that these Honourable persons, godly Preachers, and valourous Gentlemen out of their good minds, or desire to see forren countries, might put themselues for once into this worke, but doe they hold on, or are they there still? and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, hauing once bin there, will go againe? or being there, would they not full gladly bee at home again, if they could? Indeed, such base words are giuen out by some, but they be either ignorant, or malicious; and how can Ignorance or Malice speake the truth? Ignorance cannot, though it would, and Malice will not, though it can: but will your Lordship, and all men know the truth? Bee pleased then to bee informed, that of all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named persons of imployment, Sir <hi>George Somers,</hi> that famous Sea man, our worthie Admirall, that true and constant friend to <hi>Virginia</hi> (who in his old age left a pleasant seat, a good liuing, and an easie life,<note place="margin">In Dorsetshire.</note> to liue and die for the good of <hi>Virginia</hi>) and that godly good Preacher, Master <hi>Glouer,</hi> haue both

         <hi>Iob</hi> 2.</note> It was the Diuel that said, <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he giue for his life</hi>: and he spake like himselfe. But these Champions of Christ said, All we haue, and euen life it selfe, will we willingly giue, and consecrate to God, that the Gospell may bee preached, and the name of Iesus Christ called vpon in <hi>Virginia</hi>: and so gaue vp their soules to God, &amp; their flesh to nature, honoring, and in a sort consecrating those Heathenish Earths with their happy bodies, more worthie to bee esteemed precious reliques, then thousands that are preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and adored in the Romish Church: blessed and glorious shall their portions bee at the resurrection of the Iust; and in the meane time their names shall florish, when the memory of the wicked shall rot. Of the rest afore named, the worthy Knights, Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Dale,</hi> Liefetenant and Marshall, Master <hi>Whitaker</hi> and Master <hi>Bucke,</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, are now in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and haue been some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers yeares, and euery one almost two yeares: And of them, Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> hath been here once, and is gone the second time: Master <hi>Whitaker</hi> went with purpose to stay three yeares; which as hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued heere, so hee there performes, and intends, for ought I perceiue, rather to augment, then
<pb facs="12"/>
diminish the prefixed number: This Lord <hi>La-war,</hi> our honourable Generall, hauing spent some time there, for want of health was constrained to come home, but with resolution (as his Lordship spake in an honorable presence at his returne, and since hath published) to returne againe, and spend his life in the prosecution of that action. And if the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were as able to furnish and send away his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with a fleete and power, sufficient, as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is ready and resolued to ingage his person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and with him many worthie Gentlemen and Captaines, there would soone be, not a verball, but a reall answere giuen to that question, which is in all mens mouthes so common; <hi>Why goes not the Lord</hi> La-war <hi>againe to Virginia.</hi> And doest thou aske why his Lordship goes not againe? I tell thee because thou that askest the question, and others like thee, will not put to your hands to helpe forward so holy and honorable a worke: when the danger is past, and profit comes in, then wee shall haue partakers enow, but now for laying of the foundation, the world is content to looke on, and aske vs why wee goe not forward; we can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere with good consciences, wee goe forward according to our power, wee moue as wee haue strength, and we moue no faster for want of helpe: let the world be like it selfe, and he that is filthie, let him bee filthie still, hee that rowseth the hogge out of the mire or the worldling out of his sensualitie, doth but trouble himselfe in vaine. But you the noble and worthy Aduenturers, whose hearts God hath touched, whether you bee ingaged in purse

here, or person there, goe forward, and moue on, if not so fast as you would, yet as you may, let this be your comfort (besides the assured hope of gaine in due time) that you moue not against, but for and with God: a little strength doth preuaile better with the streame, then much against it: so great meanes should doe no good, if God were against you, but your weake meanes shall preuaile, seeing you worke with God: Goe forward in that name and by the strength of the Lord your God; and rest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that his goodnesse will either raise you more strength, or will make the strength you haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die able to preuaile: be not therefore faint-hearted, but remember it is Gods cause you haue taken in hand. It may therefore be hindred, but cannot bee <unclear>ouerthrowne</unclear>. If we then, were, so base as to betray and forsake it, God whose it is will stir vp our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after vs, and giue them that good land to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, which wee are not worthie of, and which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our sinnes and sluggishnes can keep from vs: Let vs not therefore to <unclear>our</unclear> owne shame leaue so blessed a worke, to them that follow vs, least the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing ages say of vs:<note place="margin">Prouerb.</note>
      <hi>Why was there such a price put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of fooles who had not hearts to take it?</hi> stand to it therefore and bee not wanting to your selues, and God will neuer bee wanting to you, nor it, till his blessed prouidence hath brought it to passe, that men shall say, God hath made his waies knowne vpon earth, and his sauing health amongst all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and blessed be the Lord God, of <hi>Virginia</hi> world without end.</p>
   <p>And thus (Right Honorable) you may see by

that, that hath been said, in what tearmes our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies now stand and what they want. It may hereby appeare they haue God their friend and protector, they haue honorable and worthie Gouernours, godly and painefull Preachers, a goodly Countrie, and no want of necessaries, since they had gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they onely want the hands and helpe of men willing and able to do such duties of men, as be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in a Plantation, and the expence that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally and almost onely now lyes vpon vs, is the charge of sending away, a competent number of men, the charge whereof wil be about 20. pound a man. If this were done, it would soone appeare, that our cares and cost were at an end, and that a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and comfortable Issue is shortly to bee looked for; which howsoeuer it may be deferred, through the backwardnesse of some, backsliding of others, and coldnesse of all: yet that it will come assuredly in the end,<note place="margin">See the booke called, <hi>The new life of Virginia.</hi>

   <p>
