      <head>The Argument of the seconde Booke, of the Treasure for Trauailers.</head>
      <p>The second booke of the Treasure for Trauaylers, shewing howe by the longitude and latitude of any Cytye, Towne or place, for to knowe the distance in myles vnto them, and also by what poynt or winde of the compasse they be from you. And also there is shewed in this booke, how dyuers notable Cyties, Townes or places, doe beare from the Citie of London, both in <hi>Europe, Africa, Asia and America,</hi> with sundry principall Ilands in the sea, both by what distance they be in myles from London, and what winde or poynt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas they are frō Londō, &amp; also theyr longest day, &amp; the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie aspect, that is to say, howe much the Moone shal chaūge rather or later, then it doth at the Cytie of London: being very necessary for all sortes of traualers eyther by Sea or by Lande: <hi>Written by william Bourne.</hi>

      <head>¶To the courteous Reader.</head>
      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendely Reader, there is conteyned in this seconde Booke, how by the longitude and the Latitude, to knowe the distance vnto what quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the worlde that anye place assigned is from you: that is to saye how many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, (according vnto our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish accoumpt) and by what poynt of the Compasse anye Citie or Towne, or any other notable Place is from you wheresoeuer you bee, vppon the face of the whole Earth.</p>
      <p>And for that the Citie of LONDON is the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, &amp; the famousest place heere in ENGLANDE, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="47"/>
I haue thought it good, to assigne the Citie of London to be the place appoynted, how farre sundrye notable Cities and Townes, and other places worthy of memorye are from the citie of Londō, both their distance in miles, &amp; vnto what quarter of the world they doe beare from the Citie of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, according to their longitude and latirude, accordingly as sundrye authors haue set downe their longitude and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: and also there is contayned in this second Booke, the diuersitie aspecte, that is to saye, how much that the Moone shall change rather or later, then it doth at London, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto the Longitude of the places that are mentioned in this second Booke: and also the length of the longest Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day at the places named in this secōd Booke, according vnto the latitudes of the places sette downe in this seconde Booke. And for that there is no person that hath trauailed generally through the face of the whole earth, therefore they must needes of force folowe such authours, as haue written therof, whether they be true or not: and therefore you must needs take thē as they be, for otherwise I know not how it is possible for to doe it, but onely to folowe the best and most Learned authors that haue written in those causes. And yet the learned men that haue bene afore time, must of force folow those that haue giuen vnto them the notes of the longi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tude and the Latitudes of any places that they haue not bene at them selues, whether they be true or not. And there bee a number of persons, who if they doe fynde but a small fault in any Booke, then by that meanes they will goe about to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the whole matter, often repeatinge the matter, yf they doe fynde any errour in it: as who shoulde saye, what a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man he is, although in all the rest of the whole booke, hee is not able to say any thing thereunto. And it may bee possible, that hee may haue no iudgement in the rest of the causes how necessarie so euer the rest of the substance of the matter is.</p>
      <p>Wherefore (gentle Readers) if you doe finde any fault in
<pb n="2" facs="47"/>
this Booke, then gently geue me warning thereof: and if you doe amende the faultes therin contayned, then I shall bee the more beholding vnto you &amp;c. For as touching the longitude and the latitude of places, men must credit those that haue beene there, for the trueth of the matter: and yet euery man that hath bene at any place, cannot do it, for the .100. person that hath trauailed vnto places, is not able to take the true latitude, but much lesse the longitude of any place. And furthermore, as touching the true distaunce vnto any place assigned, that cannot bee by any one poynt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, as is declared in this Booke. &amp;c. And thus (gentle Readers) I betake you vnto the almightye God for euermore.</p>
