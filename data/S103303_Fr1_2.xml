   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, S<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Lionell Cranfield</hi> Knight, Maister of his Maiesties Court of Wardes, and Liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and one of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties <hi>most Honourable Priuie Councell.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>WHat I haue read of <hi>Sisimus;</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience resolues mee of your Honour: that you are temperate, vertuous, liberall: whereof my sight, hearing, feeling, haue made me, a sensible,
<pb facs="3"/>and iust witnesse. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though I were often discouraged, whilest my vnpractised hand was tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling in this Tract, and thought (as <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he put off <hi>Sauls</hi> armour, because he could not goe with it, beeing not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed) to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, with the losse of some paines: especially seeing, both opportunity, place, and requisite furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were wanting to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour my attempt: yet these reasons, not ceasing to allure me, I followed them, faintly (as I could) so far, as any time would
<pb facs="3"/>giue mee leaue; For as there can be none, more challenging then your Honour: so great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, freely deignd vnto me: so would my negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence (at lest to striue, in some measure) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite them, I considered, sprinkle me, with the fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest blemish of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. And finding your Honour so fit a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, in regard of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious temper of your mind, to Patronize a Worke of this nature, which handleth that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient argument, giuen at the first conquest, of our
<pb facs="4"/>first Parents in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den (Pleasure; and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition) (both so inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to their noblest wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest, and mightiest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring after the flesh, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this respect noteth, their condition to be most dangerous: and consequently, that they haue most neede of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be put in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) whereof I haue apertly, and briefly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the vanity: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the maine, and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed aduersaries of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable care, of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties; I humbly craue your Honourable
<pb facs="4"/>acceptance of it: that it passing vnder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of such vertue, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may bee animated, (like <hi>Adonijah</hi> flying for the safegaurd of his life, to the hornes of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar) to hasten from these extreames, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and safe Pillars of Temperance, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian reioycing, which I haue like wise pitched vp vnto their view, and these will be able, as to defend them from infamy in this life: so to present them blamelesse, in the day of our common apperance. I must acknowledge my
<pb facs="5"/>selfe to haue written this Treatise, in a boisterous Tempest, that by looking downeward, I might not see the threatning clouds ouer my head, nor great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feare their fall: therein imitating <hi>Vlisses;</hi> that stopped his eares with wax; and would be tied to the maine mast of his ship, that he might not heare the <hi>Sirens</hi> to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: so haue I put of with silence, occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this imployment, the busie whisperings, and sometimes the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like clamors, of a distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered multitude: that I
<pb facs="5"/>might reteine patience, in their highest displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which was kindled with no other fire, but of mine earnest, and double industry, in seruing two allied Chappels in one day. For which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, I knowing these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of mine, vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of so graue, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued a iudgement: submissly desire, that the sinceritie of my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may rectifie, or at least excuse my faultes, as your Honour shall meete with them. The Lord speake peace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your soule: and grant
<pb facs="6"/>your Honour many pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous dayes on earth, that God may bee glorified in you, you in his Christ.</p>
