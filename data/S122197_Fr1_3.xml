   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am very loath to trouble you with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, yet at this time you must pardon me; for it is for Gods cause, to exemplifie his glory &amp; providence, that hath put an hook in the nostrils of <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and kept him from devouring poore <hi>Christians,</hi> who yet are in Armes to devoure one another: that hath throwne a stone from Heaven to strike the golden Image to powder, which was stretching it selfe, to overlooke and overtopp the <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Europe;</hi> that hath put an Axe to the great tree, and felld it at a blow, which was beginning to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread the earth, and be a shaddow for the beasts of the field. What, all <hi>Christendome</hi> almost in Armes, and yet the <hi>Turke</hi> not to take the advantage, but to be pulld short by the hand of God, and throwne backward into a graue? Where are your dreaming <hi>Gazettes,</hi> and <hi>Coranto's</hi> now, that talkt of such formidable preparation, and so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand in an Army? Where is the threatning of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and terrifying the <hi>Cossacks</hi> with so many thousand <hi>Tartarians?</hi> Where is their comming into <hi>Hungary,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a new Warre there? What all husht and quiet? Why, then thine be the honour O God, and all power, and maiestie, and goodnesse be attributed vnto thee? For thou hast taken pitty vpon our afflictions, and wilt set vpright thine owne cause, when the children of <hi>Edom</hi> and inhabitants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> cry downe with the walls of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and insult with clapping
<pb facs="3"/> their hands, to see the enemies of the Gospell thriue in their outragiousnesse.</p>
   <p>This then is all I would say vnto you by the way of Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, to giue God the prayse, that the great <hi>Turke</hi> is dead so opportunely, whereby there is hope, that <hi>Europe</hi> shall be preserved from their inuasion, and those affrightings. And the same God, that hath compassionated the generall distresses of <hi>Christendome,</hi> take pittie likewise on the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular passions of <hi>Princes,</hi> that they rage not in their reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor runne too violently forward in their race of bloud and destruction; but admit of peace and pacification to the eternall memory of their vertues, and worthinesse.</p>
