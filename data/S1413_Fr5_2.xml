      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He sicknesse of this <hi>World</hi> is growne so lethargicall, that his recouery is almost despaired: and therefore his <hi>Phisitians,</hi> finding by infallible symptoms that his consumption is not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, leaue him to the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie of his disease. For the <hi>eye</hi> of his <hi>faith</hi> is blinde, the <hi>eare</hi> of his <hi>attention</hi> deafe, the <hi>foote</hi> of his <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> lame, the <hi>hand</hi> of his <hi>charitie</hi> numm'd, and shut vp with a griping couetousnesse. All his vitall parts, whereby he should liue to goodnesse, are in a swoune: he lies bed-rid in his <hi>securitie,</hi> and hath little lesse then giuen vp the <hi>(Holy)</hi> Ghost. It cannot be denied, but that he lies at the <hi>mercie</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> It is therefore too late to tolle his <hi>Passing-bell,</hi> that hath no breath of obedience left in him: I might rather ring out his knell. Yet because there are many in this world, that are not of this world: many sicke of the generall disease of <hi>Sin,</hi> whose recouerie is not hopelesse, though their present state be happelesse; and some, that if they knew but themselues sicke, would resort to the <hi>Poole of Bethes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,
<pb facs="110"/>
the waters of life,</hi> to be cured. I haue therefore presumed to take them apart, and tell them impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially their owne illnesse. Oh that to performe the cure were no more difficult then to describe the Maladie, or prescribe the remedie. I haue endeuoured the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the other to <hi>God;</hi> who can both <hi>kill</hi> and <hi>giue life:</hi> who is yet pleased, by his <hi>word,</hi> to worke our recouery; and to make me one (vnworthy) instrument, to administer his <hi>Phisicke.</hi> Now as the most accurate <hi>Phisitians,</hi> ancient or moderne, though they deliuered precepts in their facultie, worthy of the worlds accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and vse; yet they set them forth vnder some No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Patronage: so I haue presumed, vnder the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of your protection, to publish this (phisicall or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) metaphysicall Treatise: for as the Sicknesse is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, so the cure must be supernaturall. Assuring my selfe, that if you shall vse any obseruation here, and giue it your good word of <hi>Probatum est,</hi> many others wil be induced the more redily to embrace it. My intent is to doe good: and if I had any better Receite, I would not (like some <hi>Phisitians,</hi> I know not whither more enuious or couetous, with an excellent Medicine) let it liue and die with my selfe. God conserue your (either) health; and giue you, with a sound body, a sounder faith; whereby you may liue the life of <hi>Grace</hi> heere, of <hi>Glory</hi> hereafter.</p>
