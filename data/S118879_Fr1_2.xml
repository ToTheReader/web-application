For as mouche as he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thereby not onely to kill and destroy the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of souche, as by this plague he pourposeth to take out of this mortall lief: But also, wythout repentaunce and tourning to his mercy in Christe before death, the soule of souche as departe from hence, muste neades perishe by goddes iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente: And not onlie this to be theande of souche as it pleaseth god to strike to death, by this his ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaunte and messanger the plage of pestilence.

synne he pourposeth too punysshe vs wythall, their losse and dampnatyon shalbe requyred at oure handes. For the dyscharge of my selfe, and alsoo for the beter instructyon of souche as haue cures wythin thys Diocesse of Worcester and Gloucester (and yet not beste hable too dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge them), and farther more for the proffyte and saluacyon of the people, emonges whome it maye please God too sende hys fearefull plague of pestylence: I haue thoughte it niy boundon duetye (seyng at all tymes I can not comforte the sycke my selfe) too collecte or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intoo some shorte sermonde or homelye a medycyne and moste presente healpe for all men agaynste the plague of pestylence: And in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same alsoo too prouyde some presente remedye for souche as shalbe infected wyth that desease. And for the better vnderstandynge of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dycyne, I wyll vse thys ordre, that all Physy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyons learned doo vse in theyr practyse of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sycke. Fyrste, I wyll shewe the cheafeste cause of the pestylence: And then what remeadye is beste too bee vsed agaynste it, and to heale it when it hath infected anye manne. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe I wyll speake herein some what as other Physycyons haue doone: yet because they haue spoken alreadye more then I canne in the matter, thoughe it bee a greate deale lesse then the matter of the desease requyreth, (for none of them haue shewed anye ascertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned remeadye, be theyr reason neuer soo good) I wyll breafelye as by the way somewhat speake
<pb facs="3"/>
of thys desease, as they doo: But as a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of Goddes woorde, and as a Physycyon for the soule, rather then for the bodye, intreate of the syckenesse and the remeadye thereof, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therthe aduyse and counsell of goddes woorde. Whoo supplyeth all thynges omytted and not spoken of, concernynge thys moste daungerouse plagues by souche as haue wroten, besydes the scrypture of God, theyr mynde touchynge the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same. For in deede the chiefest causes of all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues and syckenesse, is synne: whyche remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge wythin all menne, worketh destructyon, not onelye of the bodye, but alsoo of the soule, yf remeadye be not founde.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Li i. de dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se. feb. cap.</hi> 5.</note> And wheare as Galien sayeth that <hi>Omnis pestilentia fit a putredme aeris</hi>: that is too saye, all pestylence commeth by the corruptyon of the ayer, that bothe beaste and man drawynge theyr breathes in the ayer corrupte, draweth the corruptyon thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too them selues, he sayeth well: yet not y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughe.

For as he sayeth in the same place, that heate and moysture dystem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated be moste daungerouse for the creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the worlde, yet that is not ynoughe. As <hi>Ezechiel</hi> sayeth,<note place="margin">

         <hi>Psalm.</hi>
      </note> and dye at the lefte a thousande fould, the plage shall not touche hym that sytteth vnder the protection of the highest. And where as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath many good and probable argumentes in thys matter touchynge the cause of pestylence that it should come some time by reason of souche humors as be in the body disposed and apte to cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupte, then is the man quickelye (by drawing and breathyng as well the corruption of hym self, as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> infection of the ayer) infected. And that souche hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors as be grosse and inclined to corruptiō, riseth of yuell and immoderat diet, and the infection ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hys origynall and begynnynge from souche beastes, carinnes, and other lothsome bodies that rotte vpon the face of the earthe not buryed: or els from moorishe standynge, and dampyshe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, sinckes or other souche vnholsome moistu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, soo that towardes the faull of the leafe, bothe the ayer that man lyueth in, as alsoo mans bodye it selfe bee more apte and disposed to putrifaction more in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> time then in any other tyme for diuerse naturall causes. These causes are to be considered as naturall and consonaunte to reason: yet there bee reasones and causes of pestylence of more waight, and more worthye of deape and aduysed considerations and aduertisementes then thies be. And the more, because they lye within man (&amp; be marked but of very fewe) and hide them selues secretely tyll they haue poysoned the whole man both bodye and soule. For in dede phisicions that write, medle with no causes that hurte man, but suche as come into man from with out, as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors

(they saye) take theyr infectyon from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holsome meate and yuell dyet, or els from the corruption of the ayer wyth souche lyke.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Math.</hi> 15.</note> But our sauyoure Christe sheweth that oure corruptyon and syckenes riseth from within vs, as I wyll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare hereafter in the causes that the scripture tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth of pestylence and al other dyseases. Requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe you diligentlye to loke vpon the same, and to reade it in your churches: that the people may vnderstand both the cause of this goddes plage of pestylence, and howe too vse them selues in the time of this sickenes or anye other that shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto them by goddes appointmente.
