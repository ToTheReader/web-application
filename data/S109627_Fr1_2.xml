   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bin
lately main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in an
<hi>Academicall</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute,
That the best
travailing is in
<pb facs="3"/>
maps and good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours:
because
thereby a man may
take a view of the
state and manners
of the whole world,
and neuer mix with
the corruptions of
it. A pleasing opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for solitary pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
who may
<pb facs="3"/>
thus travell ouer
the world, though
confined to a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.
And, indeed,
it is a good way to
keepe a man inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;
but withall as
Ignorant. Our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary
Traueller
may passe for a wise
man, as long as hee
<pb facs="4"/>
converseth either
with dead men by
reading; or by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
with men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
But let him
once enter on the
stage of publike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and hee
will soone find, if he
can bee but sensible
of contempt, that he
<pb facs="4"/>
is vnfit for Action.
For ability to treat
with men of seueral
humours, factions,
and Countries; duly
to comply with thē,
or stand off, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
shall require,
is not gotten onely
byreading of books,
but rather by stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
<pb facs="5"/>
of men. Yet
this euer holdstrue;
The best scholler is
fittest for a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller,
as being able
to make the most
vseful obseruation:
Experience added
to learning, makes
a perfect Man.</p>
   <p>It must, therfore,
<pb facs="5"/>
be confessed, That
to fit men for Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation,
the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of forraine
Countries is most
necessary: This
kingdom iustly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in many noble
Instruments, whose
Abilities haue been
perfitted by that
<pb facs="6"/>
meanes. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
it cannot bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
that many men
while they ayme at
this fitnesse make
themselus vnfit for
any thing▪ Some goe
ouer full of good
qualitie, and better
hopes; who, hauing
as it were emptied
<pb facs="6"/>
themselues in other
places, return laden
with nothing but
the vices, if not the
diseases of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
which they
haue seene. And,
which is most to bee
pittied, they are
commonly the best
wits, and purest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles
<pb facs="7"/>
of sound
knowledge, that are
thus corrupted.
Whether it be, that
they are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
assaulted with
vice then others; or
whether they doe
more easily admit
any obuiousimpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
howeuer it be;
<pb facs="7"/>
fit it is, That all
young Trauellers
should receine an
Antidot against the
infectious Ayre of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Countries.</p>
   <p>For this purpose,
diuers learned men
haue prescribed
rules and precepts:
which haue done
<pb facs="8"/>
much good, howeuer
in many things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue.
For as hee
that read a Lecture
to <hi>Hannibal</hi> of the
Art of war, shewed
that himself was no
souldier, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vnfit to teach a
great Commander:
so He, that neuer
<pb facs="8"/>
trauelled but in his
Books, can hardly
shew his learning,
without manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his want of
experience.</p>
   <p>It hath therefore
been much desired,
that some men who
had themselues bin
Trauellers, &amp; had
<pb facs="9"/>
made lest vse of
their trauels, would
giue some vnfailing
directions to others.
Such are here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to thee; &amp; in
such a volume, as
they may be an help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
though vnchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable
cōpanion of
thy trauell. Pitty it
<pb facs="9"/>
is that such monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of wisedome
shold haue perished
for the Authours
sakes: men famous
in their times for
learning, experiēce
nobility, &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of place; but
the losse would haue
beene thine, which
<pb facs="10"/>
maist now reap the
benefit. Thy fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
acceptance
may occasion others
to publish larger
peeces of this kind,
to the increase of
their own honor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
for the good of
the noble youth of
this florishing king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
