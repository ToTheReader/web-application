   <p>Neuerthelesse, sith it hath pleased hym to wyll me to attempte thys enterpryse (whose request to againe saye, or commaundement to wythstand in no case I might,) I haue the boldlyer, vnder the banner of his Protectyon aduenturxed to endaunger theese firste fruites of my trauayles. Where in I doo as yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudge my selfe to stande in farre more safetye and lesse daunger, then those others doo, of whome I made mertyon before: for that if in theyr doinges any errour might haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely bene espised, it could hardelye haue beene wyncked at, eyther for theyr singuler know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and learnynge where in they did excell, or for theyr tipenesse of iudgemente, whyche well nigh passed all mennes credite.</p>
   <p>But as for me, if oughte there bee dopre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in thys small treatyse, worthy repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension (as one submittynge my selfe to the iudgemente of others,) yet I desire of thee gentle Reader, graunte of fauourable skan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge: whyche I truste easelye wythout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinynge, I shall at thy handes obtayne: For
<pb facs="9"/>
that what so euer hathe chaunced to escape me, maye bee adscribed to my imperfectnesse, (whome I yelde to thy iudgement) or impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to youthe, and so the easlyer be remytted, or at leaste dissymuled. Neyther thyncke I that I coulde be so incircumspecte in sit pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynge of wordes, ne so exacte a translatoure, that I coulde (thoughe mooste I couetie it) please and satisfye of eache one hys fantalye: Suffiseth it me therefore, if amonge suche a companye, some: amonge so many, shall seeme all together not to reiect these my simple tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayles.</p>
   <p>And to the end I may indue the frendlye Reader to conceyue the better opynyon of thys small booke, I shall shewe to thee what profitte and commoditye is annexed to the same, and howe muche doothe auayle the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge of good hystoryes. And then haue I to speake to the obloquy of certayn persones, whyche seeme greatly to disalowe the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latynge of Historiographers, and other good authoures, foorthe of diuers languages into hys owne mother tounge: where by they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracte and depriue the trauaylers in those af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of theyr prayse whych moste worthely oughte to ensue theyr sayde laboures.</p>
   <p>And as touchynge the first poynt, which is to expresse the profitte and commodytye whyche doo ensue the reuoluynge and often perusyng of hystoryes, and to declare of what force and effecte they are to quycken and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage others to atcheue the lyke, the saying of worthye Themistocles seemeth to proue suffycyently: who in hys first youthful yeres
<pb facs="9"/>
gaue hym selfe wholye to followe luste and sensualitye, regardynge nothing but ryotous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and satisfying hys fantasy, but so soone as Melciades obtained oportunity, and wan throughe hys prowesse and manhode greate victoryes of Themistocles, who alwaye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had bene drowned in folly (and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) conferrynge the life of Milciades with that of hys, dyd in shorte space so aultare him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe, as if he had neuer bene anye suche kynde of persone.

To whome Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles aunsweared that the victoryes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questes of Melciades would not permit hym anye longer to sleepe or slumber.</p>
   <p>Of suche force and efficacy, and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of others, that of one who to fore was a member skante worthye to lyue in a common welth, the example of that other made a valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt and mooste victoryous conqueroure. Whyche thynges beinge so. who dothe dou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e howe requisite and necessarye historyes are: in whyche are contayned suche noumber of notable examples, of men more famous farre then was Melciades. Whyche histories like as they are to be had in estimation, and great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to be regarded for the worthinesse of them, whose actes they recount, so are they highlye to be hadde in pryce, for that by mean of them onlye those gestes of suche menne are so ryfe in memory, that in manner they doo yet lyue, and seme presentlye to put them in practyse. For why, hath not Virgill that deuyne Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et by his worthye verses geuen Troye suche
<pb facs="10"/>
perpetuitye, that it doothe as yet seeme to burne, wyth an inextinguible fire: whych elsse doubtlesse had peryshed together with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge of that consnmynge flame.</p>
   <p>Who shoulde nowe haue bene able to recite the worthye prowesse of famous Achilles, if Homere hadde not crowned the same wyth eternitye? And that whych is more, (that I maye saye wyth mightye Alexander,) what hadde it auayled that worthy Achilles? what hadde it auauntaged dyuers other valyaunte menne to haue aduentured theym selues to suche daungers, to haue attempted so hearde enierpryses, Finallye to haue declared theym selues alwayes inuincible, if suche theyr vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toryes, that theyr manhoode, those theyr ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e vertues shoulde haue beene wyth theym ouer whelmed in the earthe, and peari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in that small coffen? Whyche doubtlesse hadde hapned, if the worthynesse of wryters hadde not chalenged and deliuered them from that lamentable destiny. Where hadde the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, the fame and glory of the Romaines. the Grecians, the Macedonians, the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and dyuers other victoryous Natyons beene nowe become? They hadde certesse ben quite worne oute by antiquity, decaied by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of ages, and geuen place to tyme, if the fame of them so deceassed, had not ben shrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the pardurable seereclothes of famous wryters, (as Lyuius, Plutarche, Curtius wyth others whome I here passe ouer,) and theyr sayde factes farsed wyth the pure poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the wrytinges, and monumentes of
<pb facs="10"/>
such men as those wer moste soueraign pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiues agaynste suche putrefactyons.</p>
   <p>And thus muche as touchynge the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and well nyghe requisite knowledge of Historyes. Nowe resteth it to speke a worde or two to satisfye the mislikynge of certayne personnes, wyth suche as haue trauayled in translatinge dyuers authoures foorthe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther languages into thys our mother tonnge. For the aucthorisinge and defence whereof, (me seemes) the woordes of the famous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoure Apollonius doothe auayle not a lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Who commyng by chaunce into the schole where Tullye was, beynge but a chylde as yer, and apperceiuing his for wardnesse in ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, and hys naturall inclinatyon to the same, sayde: Truelye Cicero I commende thee, and bewail grestly the chaunce and case of the Grecians. For why, ful wel that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Orator apperceiued that Tully should in processe of time bereft y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Gretians of theyr ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acinesse in all sciences (where in they myghte worthely at those daies claim singularitye to thē selues) and communicate the same with y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Romains and others. Which thyng though Culli did not as an interpretor of any, yet did he it so, that he semed as an erpositor to mani. For looke what absolutenesse or perfection anye of the Grecians, the Hebricians or any other straunge nations hadde throughe their laboure and trauayle attayned vnto in leat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, and lefte wrytten in theyr languages, for the prolytte and behoufe of theyr country menne, whyche was neyther commodious or profytable to bee knowen. All that hathe
<pb facs="11"/>
he by hys industry left most eloquentlye pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in the Laten tounge, a language more rife and familiare then those from whence he desumed them. And lyke as manye had failed of that knowledge whych they nowe haue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyred vnto, had not Tully txoden forth vnto them suche easy pathes, tyghte had there bene no fewe among vs in thys our region, which had not as yet attayned vnto any vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of so many histories, and wyth them sō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye other thynges worthye to be knoweu, had not the diligence of Translators, &amp; theyr paynes imployed in that behalf, remoued and cleared the thycke mistes of theyr ignorans, where by it may appeare that suche as busye them selues for the furtheraunce and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of others, are not only worthy to be void of reprehensyon vndepryued of theyr wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued prayse, but are also to bee encouraged to perseuer in those theyr well doinges. And where as some theyr be whyche obtecte that throughe these translatyons, the affectynge and desyre of the attaynynge of the Greeke, Latyne, Italian and other tounges dooth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, and is the lesse soughte after, who seeth not howe friuolous and vaine that theyr say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is. For as it is very absonant that anye one who hath the perfect vse of corn &amp; grain, and tasted the plesauntnesse there of, woulde refuse the same to be fed wyth Acornes, so is it no lesse dissonant to say, that anye man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ones tasted the pleasaunte puritye of the Greke and Latine tounges, woulde (for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the same,) fal to the barbarousnesse (in respect) of thys oure Englyshe tounge. But
<pb facs="11"/>
lyke as Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es hathe not so indifferently delt wyth all men, to instruct and shewe them the vse of corne, for whyche some muste of force content them selues to be fed wyth Acornes. So for that eche man hathe not attayned the knowledge of those languages, in whych not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wythstandinge many thinges are worthy to be knowen, some must neades contente them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues to wade only in the troubled streames of Translators: for that they are not able to attayne to the well spryng it selfe: with tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations if they had any manner waye soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the decay or hinderaunce of learnynge or knowledge. Doubtlesse in those so manye so famous menne, whyche haue sustayned so greate paynes in that behalfe greate folly and ouersight might haue bene imputed that they wold haue busied them selues so many yeres about so harmfull studies. But so muche are the mindes of men nowe depraued with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce, and puffed vp wyth pride, that they can not only broke the wel meanyng mindes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but narowly examine and try the errours of others. Being sure in the meane time that they them selues wyll attempt no such enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise: (warely preuentyng what men myght fortune to report by them,) worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled to Esopes dogge.
