   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>Inde Gentlemen, and honest boone Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I present you here with a merrie conceited Comedie, called <hi>the Shoomakers Holyday,</hi> acted by my Lorde Admiralls Players this present Christmasse, before the Queenes most excellent Maiestie. For the mirth and pleasant matter, by her Highnesse graciously accepted; being indeede no way offensiue. The Argument of the play I will set downe in this Epistle: Sir <hi>Hugh Lacie</hi> Erle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> had a yong Gentleman of his owne name, his nere kinsman, that loued the Lorde Maiors daughter of London; to preuent and crosse which loue, the Earle caused his kinsman to be sent Coronell of a companie into France: who resigned his place to another gentleman his friend, and came disguised like a Dutch Shoomaker, to the house of <hi>Symon Eyre</hi> in Tower streete, who serued the Maior and his houshold with shooes. The merriments that passed in Eyres house, his comming to be Maior of <hi>London, Lacies</hi> get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his loue, and other accidents; with two merry Three-mens songs. Take all in good worth that is well intended, for nothing is purposed but mirth, mirth lengthneth long life which, with all other blessings I heartily wish you.</p>
