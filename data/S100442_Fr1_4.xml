   <l>THat stately place, that princely bowre</l>

   <l>King dauids house, and temple now</l>
   <l>is quight and cleane disgrac'de.</l>
   <l>Yet sitting still with booke in hand</l>
   <l>we here may plaine beholde</l>
   <l>The state of ech thing as it was,</l>
   <l>in times that were of old.</l>
   <l>Where Christ did preach, where Christ did suppe,</l>
   <l>where Christ did fast and pray,</l>
   <l>Where Christ was caught, where christ was whipt,</l>
   <l>where theeues did him betraye:</l>
   <l>Where he a precious raunsome paid</l>
   <l>for man who had offended;</l>
   <l>Where he was buried; where he rose,</l>
   <l>and eke where he ascended.</l>
   <l>

Where <hi>Annas</hi> kept his pompous court,</l>
   <l>where <hi>Caiphas</hi> palace stoode;</l>
   <l>Where wicked <hi>Pilate</hi> dwelt, that did</l>
   <l>condemne most guiltles blood.</l>
   <l>This and much more is here discourst</l>
   <l>by him that both had read</l>
   <l>And seene with eye, full thirtie yeeres,</l>
   <l>where hee his life had lead.</l>
   <l>Whose worke and paines as they deserue</l>
   <l>much thankes and hartie praise.</l>
   <l>So Timme his guerdon well deserues</l>
   <l>of all men in these daies.</l>

   <l>As also for his other paines</l>
   <l>that passed haue his quill.</l>
   <l>Who like a candle wastes himselfe</l>
   <l>in giuing light to others?</l>
   <l>Moe such God graunt to take like care,</l>
