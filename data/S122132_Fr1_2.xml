      </gap> poisoned, and wounded vnto death, we ought daie and night without ceasing, to complaine and lament before God, to watch and pray vnto God for remission of our sins,
<pb facs="3"/>
yet should we not despaire of life. The true Phisition of our soules came downe from heauen, &amp; through his passion hath he made vs a plaister for our wounds, onely let vs vse it and lay it to the sore. The faithfull Samaritane poureth oile and wine into our wounds, taketh vs vp to cure and to heale vs, onely let vs follow him, &amp; fashion our selues after his image. He is the brasen serpent without sinne, whome with the eyes of faith we must behold hanging, and lift vp vpon the crosse for vs, hee taking our sinnes vppon himselfe, giueth vs his owne innocencie.</p>
   <p>If the burthen of sinne now oppresseth and grieueth vs, we ought to runne vnto him, he shall ease vs &amp; giue vs rest, for his bloud washeth awaie our sinnes, him hath the father giuen vnto vs to be our righteousnesse and redemption.</p>
   <p>Besides this great treasure that God hath giuen vs in Christ, he is set foorth vnto vs, especially in his passion, for a patterne or example, whereby we may learne to die from sin, and finde a preseruatiue against vices to come. For selfeloue and high esteeming of a mans owne selfe is the wel-spring of all vice, Consider that Christ was not proude himselfe of his owne highnesse, but tooke vpon him the shape of a seruant, &amp; come to serue vs, humbled him most lowly, loued not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe sought not his owne, desired not his honor, but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of his father: all despite and reproch fell vpon him. If we ponder this by saith, all greedy loue of our selues shall fall away.</p>
   <p>The obedience of Iesu in true beleefe considered, expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and healeth our disobedience, and the idolairie of our owne carnall heart. With his obedience couereth he the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of all men, so farre as we abide in the obedience of faith, that Christ be dearer vnto vs than the whole world, for the which cause we freely giue ouer our selues into his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
<pb facs="4"/>
suffering all things for his sake. Pride and vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie is healed through Christs humilitie and contempt, which he suffered for vs manifolde. Learne of me (saith he) for I am meeke and lowly of heart. Why are wee so greadie of temporal things, when Christ the Lord of heauen and earth became for vs so poore, hanging bare and naked vppon the crosse? The chast pure life of Iesus Christ expelleth in vs all vncleannesse of the flesh. Also his martirdome, anguish and trouble which in his flesh hee suffered for vs, quencheth the lust and concupiscence of the flesh.</p>
   <p>O how euill doth it become a beleeuer, to be irefull and greedie of vengeance, when his fore-runner, beeing in most humilitie like vnto a sheepe, praied for his enemies?</p>
   <p>Enuie and hatred is highly expelled, if we consider the excellent deepe loue of Iesu towards vs. Gluttonie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of life shall fall awaie from vs, if we well remember that Christ for vs dranke vineger mixt with gall.</p>
   <p>As it is here shewed in certaine points, euen so against all vices and blemishes of the soule, there may remedie be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> sound in the passion of Christ, if it bee rightly vsed in the contemplation of faith. The old Adam ought we to lay aside, to mortifie the members vppon earth, and to put on Christ the Lord, as the new wedding garment. In the crosse ought to be our exercise, our ioy, comfort, and life.</p>
   <p>Herevnto also helpeth vs our heauenly father, who vnto vs his children (whom he most entirely loueth) suffreth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold passions, afflictions, troubles, and anguishes, sicknesse, pouertie, and persecution to come: to keepe vs vppon the crosse, least we as negligent people gape for temporall earthie things. And if we will needs follow our owne lusts, he hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our waie with thornes, nourturing and humbling vs through trouble, that we being tried and purified as the gold
<pb facs="4"/>
in the fire, may crie and call vnto him, and that we may giue our earthly things, seeing we finde no quietnesse in them. He bringeth vs into the land of promise, howbeit through the wildernesse, through much trauell and labour. Blessed are they that in patience without murmuring, suffer the Lorde to worke, and doo faithfully follow him.</p>
   <p>All this, and more than I can saie, ought to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration and exercise, when we celebrate the supper of the Lord Iesu, that wee so sprinkle the bloud of Christ in our heartes, and drinke it into vs, that it may worke in vs, and bring forth fruit. Our eies and hearts we ought to lift vp in to heauen, and consider what the bread and wine pointeth vs vnto, namely, vnto the bodie of Christ, that was offered vp vpon the crosse for our sinnes, and to his bloud, that was shed for the washing awaie of our offences: and that we fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our selues vnto his image, and practise also such loue one towardes another. This is the proofe that Paul speaketh of, with the which a faithfull beleeuer ought to exercise himself before, and in the Lords supper examining well his faith and loue, which out of the loue of God towards vs, is kindled and increased. First ought a man to consider the excellent loue of our Lord Iesus Christ, who so loued vs, that he died for vs. And seeing that he biddeth vs to so high a feast of his grace we ought also to ponder the same, in such sorte, that wee bee thankfull vnto him, and prepare our selues thereafter.</p>
   <p>Saint Paul saith, that there is a feeding with milke, and a feeding with strong meate, which is to bee obserued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature and propertie of those that receiue the meate. And in the Church of God there be three sortes of men, as the same, by the high illuminated goodwise teacher Augustine, and by others is written.</p>
   <p>First, there be men, which hauing spent their former
<pb facs="5"/>
time past, in pastime and wantonnesse of the world, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the carefull end thereof, (as they be inwardly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the grace of God) haue vndertaken to cease and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from sinne, and from all occasions of sinne, &amp; in most diligent wise, as neere as they can, with the assistance, grace and helpe of God, to be circumspect and warie thereof: albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they are yet weake, and haue not so strong a spirite, as to laie aside and despise all worldly things out of hand. And these are the right true beginners of repentant and penitent persons: though they be not new beginners, yet are they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the Lord so deare, that all things cannot sufficiently commend and praise it.</p>
   <p>This is witnessed vnto vs by the holy Gospell, of the vnthriftie sonne: who when with shamefull riot hee had wantonly consumed his inheritance, did in time of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame hunger, conuert and turne againe to his louing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and receiued not onely gracious forgiuenesse of his tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, but also speciall tokens of his fathers loue: as the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the kisse, the fat calfe, the sweete minstrelsie and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodie. This is the first anker of true repentance. This is the first state concerning the blessed swineheard, who forsaking the hogges wiih the coddes, (draffe or swillinges) that hee sometimes greedily filled his belly withall, and returning to his louing father, is now in his first comming againe to his mercifull father, graciously taken vp, receiued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
   <p>Who so now with this vnthriftie sonne forsaketh his sinnes, and comming agayne in true and heartie repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance vnto God his most louing and gracious Father, saith meekely: O Father, I am not worthie to bee called thy sonne, for I haue sinned against heauen and before thee, O make nice one of thy hired seruants. To him shall the father
<pb facs="5"/>
denie nothing. Who so nowe with an vnfained heart and mouth may speake this vnto God, and truely and vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeketh Iesus, assuredly hee findeth him, and hath with him a cheerefull supper. Looke vnto whom God in his great mercie giueth such a tast of his geace, let him render thanks and praise vnto almightie GOD, let him nowe looke for it, that the Father who hath receiued him, will also nourture him in his owne schoole, and through manifolde aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties furnish him, prepare him, and make him more perfect. Hee hath beene fedde with the milke, hee must learne also to knowe, what harde meate meaneth. Through aduersitie and trouble, some chaunces, hee must bee tempted and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, whether hee haue ought in him of the blessed seede that groweth vpwardes vnto eternall life. Which thing shall well appeare and bee made manifest, if in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and troubles, hee bee not choaked with the thornes, nor troden downe by the high waie side, nor withered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the stones, but founde fruitfull in a good and fertill ground.</p>
   <p>Other men there bee, which are called reformers, to whome belongeth somewhat more than there doth vnto the other. For like as it appertaineth to the first repentant or prnitent persons, that they continually and feruently, with the confession of their sinnes vnto God, with sorrowe and lamentation, with praier, watching, and chastising of the the bodie, doo breake out a waie from theyr olde sinnes, harnessing and arming themselues agaynst others for to come, and earnestly withstanding and forsaking their owne euill and naughtie customes, (if they minde to bring foorth fruite, and not to fall awaie againe:) Euen so the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in the seconde order and manner, after the harde
<pb facs="6"/>
rooting out of vice and wickednesse, must still exercise them selues in the will of God and in good works, seeking diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience thereof in holy Scripture, and of those teachers who by reason of long practise, and by the Scriptures, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare and teach the same waie. When these men in such a stedfast purpose to walke and practise themselues in the will of God with his grace and power, doe goe vnto the supper of the Lord, they inwardly with ioy and fruit of the godly feast are nourished and refreshed. For who so desireth to cleaue vnto vertue and to a godly life, shall no where find the same so euidently and plaine, as in Christs passion, whereof hee is mindfull at the supper with faith and thankesgiuing.</p>
   <p>The third sort of men are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>lled perfect: not that anie man here in time may be perfect, as to lacke nothing, or to haue no sinne in him, but therefore are they named perfect, because theyr exercise is such, that after long accustomate doing of vertuous deeds, after many spiritual fruits brought forth by them in patience, after many temptations, which they with the help of God haue ouercome. They haue so who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled and cast downe themselues before God, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with him, that they are become one spirite with Christ their head, whom they cleaue vnto, whose crosse and holy passion they follow without fainting, so farre as theyr wit and power may suffer, being dead from the world &amp; the flesh, following onely the Lord Iesu Christ, suffering with him, and liuing with him. These with their minds &amp; harts step somwhat higher than the others, hauing their dwelling in heauen, in the sweet contemplation &amp; beholding of Gods Almightinesse, wisedome, and goodnes, with feruent deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which men also by inioying of the said feast, according to their beleefe and ferue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> loue, receiue the more excellent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ruites, whereby they may expell the temptations that they
<pb facs="6"/>
like not. For the deuill keepeth no holy daie, he sleepeth not, runneth about as a roaring lion: he ceaseth not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these men continually get them to their weapons, with the consideration of the passion of Christ. Abraham the good friend of God, must stil driue awaie the rauenous birds from the sacrifice, till the Sunne goe downe, and till a man cheerefully saie, In peace will I laie me downe and take my rest, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>This probation must be well taken heed vnto, for many men not iustly considering themselues, neither right discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this meate from others, receiue the foode of life vnto death. Not that this holy bread was instituted and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Christ, to hurt any man, but because the euil man doth wickedly receiue that which is wholsome, &amp; abuseth it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough vnbeleefe. Therefore iustly doeth Paul exhort, that there be first had a diligent examination of a mans selfe, &amp; that then he eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup. Thus let euerie man take good heed to his owne state and vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this banket may set him forward, not vnto his hurt but to eternall life.</p>
   <p>Who so taketh not heed vnto this difference, &amp; to him selfe, as (alas) carnall people do, which are not spiritually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed. The same faileth oft in many things, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh to flie high, yea, higher than his knowledge &amp; power may attaine. Hereof then it also proceedeth (as we see before our eyes) that so fewe folkes come to steadfast amendement, namely, euen hereof, that when men are not exercised in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerning of Gods matters from others, a mad headie motion of sensualtie prouoketh them inordinatly to sitte highest at the table, wheras yet they are not worthie of the lowest place, and so will they forthwith possesse the seate roiall, afore they haue found the asses, or kept the sheepe, as of Dauid &amp; Saul
<pb facs="7"/>
in figure it is read. But thus ought it not to bee: for though the grace of the holy Ghost vse not long fetches about, yet commeth no man sodainly to the happiest step. I speake after the common course, as it beseemeth vs to talke and do in the Church of God, namely, after the ordinance which he hath appointed vs.</p>
   <p>Behold Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being so perfect in the law, that the world could not accuse him, being also chast, earnest, feruent and well exercised in all vertues, whom God that had sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated him from his mothers wombe, would cal to his seruice. Though he was taken vp into the third heauen, and saw se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets that no man can expresse, yet doth not he trust so much thereto, as (by reason of that great grace) to magnifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and to take vpon him the office of preaching, before he being taught at <hi>Gamaliels</hi> feet, and baptised and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Ananias,</hi> had perceiued in himselfe, and proued, that same which he afterwards out of the perfectnes of the spirit, might distribute abrode vnto al Christendome. This is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture laughed to scorne of the vnexpert, proud, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse: but who so hath eares circumcised with the feare of God, will thinke more vpon the matter.</p>
   <p>He that will sit now at the table of the high king let him diligently consider what hee receiueth in his soule through faith, namely, the body end bloud of Iesus Christ, which fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and nourisheth him to eternall life, and draweth him to God, altereth him, and maketh him steadfast, which the outward bread taken with the moueh, doth point and leade vnto: yea, let vs ponder, how great loue, and what an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Christ ther setteth before him, that he also must prepare the like: that is, that he to his power must follow the loue, life and passion of Christ, to the intent, that hee being wounded with Christs loue, &amp; fastned with him vpon the crosse, may
<pb facs="7"/>
abide in him vnto the end.</p>
   <p>For in the passion of Christ, is the instrustion of the way which we ought and must follow vnto eternall life. There al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is information where and how the same waie and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting truth is shewed &amp; found. Thus the penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the waie, the reformer the vndoubted vnwandring truth: the perfect, the verie life eternall, which is Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and there is eternall peace. God graunt, that all they which reade this little booke, and consider this matter, may so burne in loue and feruent deuotion, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and liue in Christ, and he in them for euer, <hi>Amen.</hi>
