   <head>A PRAYER FOR
the Morning.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Lord GOD,
heauenlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
when I
doe consider
how many wayes and by
how many sortes of sinnes
I haue offended thee night
and day; and doe duly call
to minde how graciously
thou hast kept mee this
night, &amp; how many bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
and fauours I haue
receiued of thee (without
number:) I am euen asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
at my great ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and doe vtterly
condemne my selfe of
highest rebellion against
thee.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="20"/>
Many haue beene the
dayes, weekes, months and
yeares, that thou hast here
afforded me to liue; and in
all the time of my life he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therunto,
thou hast gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
preserued mee,
plentifully releiued me, &amp;
continually kept me vnder
thy fatherly protection, in
all my nights and dayes;
and hast beene euermore
watchfull ouer me; that I
haue from time to time,
from night to day, and
from day to night, beene
euer sustained through
thy grace, though I haue
some times felt thy corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
rod by some crosses
for my sinnes, yet haue
they beene euer easie, in
comparison of my deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings;
<pb facs="21"/>
and profitable vnto
me.</p>
   <p>Lord pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
me my sinnes, forgiue
my manifold offences,
wash me throughly by the
blood of Iesus Christ my
Redeemer, and clense me
from all my pollutions,
for they are many, and I
am ashamed that euer I
gaue way vnto them.</p>
   <p>But now Lord, now,
though late, I pray thee to
leade me by thy Spirit in
more obedience; stay me,
that I runne not this day
into any vnseemely or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
actions; withholde
mine eyes from vanities;
keepe vnder the vngodly
affections of my corrupt
heart, that though they
<pb facs="21"/>
may begin to worke sin in
me, Lord suppresse them
before they come to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
   <p>Disperse Lord, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
all the clouds of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and errors, that dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
mine vnderstanding,
and giue me wisedome
rightly to know thee, and
thy Sonne Christ, and
what he hath done for my
soule; and through thy
grace restraine me this day
from that thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to shun: and
let me doe nothing, but
what may please thee, then
whatsoeuer I shall thinke,
speake or determine, shall
be to thine owne glorie,
profitable to my selfe and
others.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="22"/>
Preserue me from the
secret and hidden snares
of Satan, who is restles to
allure me to sinne, inticing
me to imbrace the vanities
of the world, and to yeeld
to the lusts of mine owne
corrupt nature.</p>
   <p>But Lord, as I haue by
thy prouidence, past the
darkenesse of this night, &amp;
doe now enioy the joyfull
benefit of the light of this
day: so let me this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
all the workes of
darkenesse; and as the day
doth administer light vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my corporall eyes, the
better to doe the works &amp;
offices of my calling; so let
the light of thy Spirit, O
Lord, shine in my soule,
that I may walke in the
<pb facs="22"/>
light of thy truth in true
obedience, to the good
example of others.</p>
   <p>Thou hast allotted me a
calling in this life; giue me
power &amp; wisedome right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to performe it: my best
endeuours can little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
without thy blessing
and direction; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I humbly pray thee to
prosper whatsoeuer I take
in hand this day.</p>
   <p>Blesse mine vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
O Lord, that I may
rightly know and be able
truely &amp; faithfully to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
what belongeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my place and calling.</p>
   <p>Blesse the health of my
body, the strength and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
vse of my limbes &amp;
senses, which of them
<pb facs="23"/>
selues are weake, and may
soone decay without thy
blessing.</p>
   <p>Increase O Lord, and
confirme my faith, grace,
wisedome, and obedience
euerie day more and more,
that I may euerie day
more and more dye vnto
sinne, and be made stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and more perfect in
righteousnesse.</p>
   <p>Heale O Lord, all my
corporall and spirituall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
and dispose my
heart, that I may be euerie
day more and more mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that this my life is
short, and that this day
may be my last day: and let
me so walke this day, as if
it should be the last day of
this my mortall life; that
<pb facs="23"/>
I may be assured of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
entrance into
that life which is eternall,
with Christ my Redeemer.</p>
   <p>And vntill that last day
shall come, O Lord, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
thee in the name of
Iesus Christ, that this day
and all the rest of my daies
and nights, may be pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
and blessed vnto
me; the day for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of my calling, the
night for my rest, vntill I
come to my finall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
rest with thee and
thy Sonne, to whom with
thy blessed Spirit, I ascribe
all honour, praise and
glory. Amen.</p>
