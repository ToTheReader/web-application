   <l>I Deeme that no man doubts, but games and al our chiefe delights,</l>
   <l>VVere first deuisde to daūt the dumps of pēsiue payned sprights.</l>
   <l>To cleare the clowds of drowping cares, and mists of mournful mind,</l>
   <l>And banish bale, that heauy harts in cheerlesse chaines did bind.</l>
   <l>And more than that, to further health, by mouing to and froe,</l>
   <l>That in our lumpish lustlesse limmes, no dire disease might groe:</l>
   <l>VVhich otherwise (set sport aside, and sweete delightfull glee)</l>
   <l>In idle bodies breedes of force, as we by proofe do see,</l>
   <l>Not much vnlike the standing lakes, in durtie dampish groundes,</l>
   <l>VVhere water hath no power to passe, most noisome filth aboundes.</l>
   <l>If games were thus found out at first, for minde and bodies ease,</l>
   <l>Aswell to quit that one of griefes, as th' other of disease:</l>
   <l>VVhy then? of force it follow must, that those delights are chiefe,</l>
   <l>And most to be imbraste, that lend to either part reliefe.</l>
   <l>VVhich if be so, I neede not blush; or deeme it my disgrace,</l>
   <l>If Hawkes and Spanels I preferre, and set in hiest place.</l>
   <l>For truly no deuise delights, the minde of man so much,</l>
   <l>No game so gladsome to the limmes, there is no pleasure such,</l>
   <l>No Phisicke fitter to remoue the dregges of direfull paine,</l>
   <l>And to restore to former life, the feeble force againe.</l>
   <l>Of Spanels first I meane to speake, for they begin the glee,</l>
   <l>VVho being once vncoupled, when they feele their collers free,</l>
   <l>In roysting wise about they raunge, with cheerfull chappes to ground,</l>
   <l>To see where in the champion may, some lurking fowle be found.</l>
   <l>A sport to vew them stirre their sternes, in hunting to and fro,</l>
   <l>And to beholde how nature doth hir power in Spanels sho:</l>
   <l>VVho scoure the fields with wōdrous skil, and deale in cunning sort,</l>
   <l>As though indeed they had conspirde, to make their master sport.</l>
   <l>VVhat merier musicke can you craue? what note but halfe so good?</l>
   <l>As when the Spanels crosse the ronne, of Feasants in the wood?</l>
   <l>Or light vpon the little Poutes, where they haue lately bene?</l>
   <l>Assuredly no better glee, is either heard or seene.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>So as by Hawkes doth pleasure grow, vnto the gazing eie,</l>
   <l>And dogges delight the listning eares, before the hawkes do flie.</l>
   <l>VVhat dolt so dull but takes delight, when once the Spanell springs</l>
   <l>The fearfull fowle, and when the hawke lies long vpon hir wings?</l>
   <l>VVhat sense so sad, what minde so mazde, but settes his sorowes by,</l>
   <l>VVhen once the Falcon free begins, to scud amid the skie?</l>
   <l>To turne and winde a birde by sleight, and eke at last to slay</l>
   <l>VVith strong encounter, doues and duckes, and euery other pray?</l>
   <l>The pretty Partridge, Rayles and Quayles, that haunt the open field?</l>
   <l>And from hir mountey to enforce the Hearon haught to yeeld?</l>
   <l>By binding with hir close in cloudes, in maner out of sight?</l>
   <l>For noble Peeres and cheefest States, a passing pleasant flight?</l>
   <l>So small a birde, so large a fowle, at such a loftie gate,</l>
   <l>To reach and rappe, and force to fall, it is a game of state.</l>
   <l>No fellow to the flight at Brooke, that game is full of glee,</l>
   <l>It is a sport the stowping of, a roysting Hawke to see.</l>
   <l>And if she misse, to marke hir how she then gettes vp amaine,</l>
   <l>For best aduauntage, to eneaw the springing fowle againe.</l>
   <l>VVho if be landed as it ought, then is it sure to die.</l>
   <l>Or if she slippe, a ioy to see, the Hawke at randon flie,</l>
   <l>And so for head to slea the fowle, a noble sport to vew,</l>
   <l>In my conceyt no pleasure like to Hawkes, I tell you trew.</l>
   <l>It settes the senses all to worke, there may none idle bee,</l>
   <l>The tung it lures, the legges they leape, the eie beholdes the glee:</l>
   <l>The eares are busied eke to heare, the calling Spanels quest,</l>
   <l>Do tell me then what sense it is, that respite hath to rest?</l>
   <l>And more than that, the hart it leapes, and laughes for ioy to think</l>
   <l>How such a slender hawke should cause, so huge a fowle to shrink.</l>
   <l>This kinde of sport doth banish vice, and vile deuises quight,</l>
   <l>VVhen other games do foster faults, and breede but base delight.</l>
   <l>No idle thought can harbor well within the Falconers braine,</l>
   <l>For though his sportes right pleasant be, yet are they mixt with paine.</l>
   <l>The toile he takes to find the fowle, his greedy lust to slay,</l>
   <l>The fowle once found cuts off cōceits, &amp; driues il thoughts away.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>He lures, he leapes, he calles, he cries, he ioyes, he waxeth sad,</l>
   <l>and frames his moode, according as his hawke doth well or bad.</l>
   <l>Dame Venus harbors not in holtes, no Cupide haunts the hilles,</l>
   <l>Diana dwelles in open place, with bow hir game she killes.</l>
   <l>In wooddes no wanton Goddesse woonnes: in Cities soiournes sinne,</l>
   <l>There vice in vawts &amp; dungeon dwelles, the lecher lurks within.</l>
   <l>Dianas traine doth loue the laundes, they long abrode to rome,</l>
   <l>But bawdie Venus ympes embrace, the loitring life at home.</l>
   <l>To dice, to daunce, to coll, to kisse, to carde the time away,</l>
   <l>To prate, to prancke, to bowle, to bowse, and ripple out the day.</l>
   <l>To checke at Chesse, to heaue at Maw, at Macke to passe the time,</l>
   <l>At Coses, or at Saunt to sit, or set their rest at Prime.</l>
   <l>Both Ticktacke and the Irish game, are sportes but made to spende,</l>
   <l>I wote not I, to what auaile those trifling games do tende,</l>
   <l>Vnlesse to force a man to chaufe, to chide, to sweate, to sweare,</l>
   <l>To brawle, to ban, to cursse, and God in thousand parts to teare.</l>
   <l>At cockepit some their pleasures place, to wager wealth away,</l>
   <l>VVhere Falkners only force the fields, to heare their spanels bay.</l>
   <l>VVhat greater glee can man desire, than by his cunning skill,</l>
   <l>So to reclaime a haggarde hawke, as she the fowle shall kill.</l>
   <l>To make and man hir in such sort, as tossing out a traine,</l>
   <l>Or but the lewre, when she is at large, to whoup hir in againe?</l>
   <l>VVhere birds, &amp; beasts, &amp; ech thing else, their fredom so embrace,</l>
   <l>As let them loose, they will be thralde no more in any case.</l>
   <l>VVhat finer feate than so to ympe a feather, as in vew,</l>
   <l>A man would sweare it were the olde, and not set on anew?</l>
   <l>VVhen hawkes are hurt and broosde, by rash encounter in the skies,</l>
   <l>VVhat better skill, than for their harmes a powder to deuise,</l>
   <l>To drie the bloud within the bulcke, and make his Mummie so,</l>
   <l>As no Phisition greater Arte, on pacients can bestow?</l>
   <l>To cure the crampe, and eke the cray, the stone that lies within,</l>
   <l>The Philanders, the Frounce, the Goute, the Panthas, &amp; the pin,</l>
   <l>The Rie, the Rhewme, the Canker, and both lice and mytes to marre,</l>
   <l>And all such wormes, as with your hawks do wage cōtinual war:</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="6"/>To make hir mewe when time requires, to bowse and eke to bath.</l>
   <l>By cunning skill to cause hir cast, such glit as breedes hir skath.</l>
   <l>To cut hir hoodes, to shape hir gesse, hir tyrets, and hir line,</l>
   <l>VVith Belles, and Bewets, Veruels eke, to make the Falcon fine:</l>
   <l>Beleue me is no common skill, no bare or base deuise,</l>
   <l>But meet, for ciuill courtly men, that are reputed wise.</l>
   <l>VVhich if be so, then yeelde me thankes, that beate my busie brow,</l>
   <l>And tooke this toile for thine auaile, to teach thee when &amp; how</l>
   <l>To worke this practise and deuice. Accept the Printers paine,</l>
   <l>VVho shewes thee sundry shapes of hawks, though litle to his gain.</l>
   <l>Both he and I can do no more, than offer our good will,</l>
   <l>And all to further thy delight, and adde vnto thy skill.</l>
   <l>VVhich if we do, we haue the hire, of both our meanings than,</l>
   <l>You cannot do a better deede than thanke the painfull man.</l>
