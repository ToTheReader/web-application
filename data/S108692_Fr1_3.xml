   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou art to bee admonished (good Reader,) that in this translation of <hi>Corderius,</hi> I haue referred into the Margents, all the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall constructions which cannot be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in our owne tongue, but by over-harsh phrases; and made references unto them most commonly with an asteriske or little starre. Least whil'st wee seeke to get Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar and Latine, wee lose purity or proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in our owne tongue, and bring in barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme in steade thereof. And therefore at each Asteriske, the learner is to be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that ever in construing, parsing, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Latin, out of this English translation, he forthwith cast his eye from the text un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the margent, to the like marke: yet so as that withall, hee ever in the second place, give phrase for phrase; <hi>viz.</hi> unto our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish phrase, to give the like proper Latine



<pb facs="6"/>
phrase, and so likewise in construing and parsing, or reading the English out of Latine: To the end to learne both Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar and phrase, propriety and purity in both tongues together: and also for the more ready and full vnderstanding of the matter therein contained. This course I have upon good advice and triall, found most speedy, sure, and profitable. What is already done, with so great paines, and care, in weighing every word and phrase, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to these purposes, and that, as it were by houres stolne either from my sleepe or necessary recreations, in the midst of my continuall imployment in my calling, (which requireth a whole man,) accept in good part, and what is defective, future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions shall (God willing) supply. Vse it carefully and constantly, according to the directions in the Grammar-schoole: and try whether, by the blessings of th' almighty, it will not performe whatsoever is promised therein concerning it.</p>
   <p>For the Coines, so oft mentioned in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are French coines and differing from ours, I have advisd with sundry lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both of the French and English, skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

in the French tongue, and haue heere set them downe, according to their severall valuations in our coyne, so neere as we have beene able to judge; and ever in the booke likewise, so neere as I could conveniently. These here being first perfectly gotten, all in the booke will be very plaine.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>As,</hi> with the French is called <hi>un-sould</hi>: short it is pronounced, a <hi>sou</hi>; which in Dutch called a <hi>stiiver</hi>; in Latine <hi>stive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> or <hi>sestertius.</hi> And ten Dutch <hi>stivers</hi> make our E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>glish shilling; so that a <hi>stiver</hi> is more then a penny. Thus <hi>As</hi> is taken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in French; though with the Romans it is taken otherwise. <hi>Calep.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Solidus</hi> with the French doth common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifie the same with <hi>As</hi>: yet sometimes <hi>solidus</hi> doth signifie a shilling with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> French, and six <hi>sowes</hi> make their shilling, as sixe <hi>stivers</hi> make a shilling in Dutch.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Semis</hi> is halfe of <hi>As</hi> or <hi>solidus</hi>; the French call <hi>semis, deux-liards,</hi> two far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, though we cannot utter it just: for a <hi>lard</hi> is not just a farthing.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Quadrans</hi> is the fourth part of <hi>As,</hi> in French <hi>un-liard,</hi> somewhat more then a farthing.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>Sextans</hi> is the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>xt part of <hi>As,</hi> in French <hi>un-double.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Decusses</hi> is ten <hi>Ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>s,</hi> in French <hi>dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soulds,</hi> in Dutch ten <hi>stivers,</hi> in English a shilling. Though <hi>Calepine</hi> differ herein.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Denariolus</hi> is the twelfth part of <hi>As,</hi> in French <hi>un-denier.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Denarius</hi> is a cotne as much as ten <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narioli,</hi> in French <hi>vn-carolus,</hi> about our penny, or somewhat more.</p>
   <p>These are the principall coines here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: what thou thinkest amisse in these, or any part hereof, or of any of my indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, signifie to me in courtesie: so thy love shall both much further and encourage mee to the accomplishing of the worke. Whereunto desiring with all the helpe of thy prayers, unto him whose all my travels, and thoughts are, I commend thee to his Grace, and rest</p>
