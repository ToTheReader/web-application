      <hi>THE PREFACE</hi> TO THE IMPARTIAL Protestant Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OWSOEVER, Courteous Reader, this manner of writing may at first seeme strange vnto thee, as not being warranted by the like exāple of any former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne Authour, yet if pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicate passion, rhe chiefe Nurse of heresy, forestal not thy iudgement, I make no doubt but thou mayst gather hence some light, for thy better direction, and guiding out of those intricate labyrinths of Nouellisme, wherein ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy education, thy coldnesse in searching, or the insatiable malice of mis-information of thy owne woluish Pastours haue already intangled thee. Neither would I haue thee therefore the lesse to regard it, in that the front thereof is pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
<pb n="6" facs="4"/> by the name of Epigrammes, for many good things haue been imparted to the world vnder that title, and more perhaps in this, then (if I were not my self the Authour I would say so) in most thou hast seen: but mis-conceiue me nor, I speake not heer of a stile, for it is a thing which I least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, knowing my self as farre behind many in that, as I am beyond them in my intention and<note n="(1)" place="margin">See Epig. <hi>2.</hi>
      </note> scope wherat I ayme: it is the manner only of my writing wherof I speake, and in regard of that, I dare confidently bid thee expect more, then by the title thou canst expect. For I haue not through the whole produced any material thing against the professours of thy pretended Church, which I haue not satisfied from their owne vndeniable confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, either their owne words (as for the most part they are) set downe in the margent, or els, where that is not capable therof, a faithful referēce being made vnto the place, where they affirme the thing I inferre against them: and al this (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the multiplicity of the citations) <hi>with that care and diligence, that thou shalt not, I hope, haue much cause to except against it; sure I am with that sincerity, as not to become an aduersary vnto my self, by erring against my conscience:</hi> for (to vse yet further thy owne so much esteemed D.<note n="(2)" place="margin">D Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's App. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

   <pb n="7" facs="4"/>
   <p>But heer me-thinks I heare my self accused not to haue in some places so strictly obserued the chief lawes of an Epigramme: I grant I haue not; yet hath not this fault, if heer it be a fault, proceeded forth of ignorance, for I know an Epigramme should be brief &amp; acute: the first rule I acknowledge my self to haue sometymes transgressed, the second not so much as perhaps some of your Ministers could haue wisht: but howsoeuer, it is not vpon such exact lawes that I haue stood; al my study was how I might best frame thē to doe the most good; which if they effect, I haue what I wish. Neither doe I doubt but among so many seueral dispositiōs of men, they may find some fit subiect to work on; since al are not moued with one manner of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, nor euery one takes delight in the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of writing. For as those who are by the sting or bite of the Tarantula distract of their senses, though musike be the best phisike for them al, yet are they not al holpen by the same tunes, but by such particular lessons only, as by some hidden qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity best agreeth with the nature of euery one. So those who are infected with the poison of heresy, though they be al to be cured by the heauenly mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sike of that<note n="(3)" place="margin">

Why may I not then, since there be yet diuers who are not moued by any of these, iustly make a tryal if by the help at least of this tune, this manner of writing I meane, they may recouer their senses, especially since it is not the skilfulnesse of the Musitian, but the direct hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the patients vayne, which workes the cure? If this take effect, it shal not be the last lesson, which (if God spare my life) I wil tune to this key. Meane while (freindly Reader) I referre this to thy impartial and careful perusal: in hope thereof I rest, committing thee to the protection of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and earnestly beseeching him that he would vouchsafe <hi>to</hi>
