      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Sermon was, by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Authoritie, stiled the
Authors owne funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Most fitly: whether
wee respect the time, or the
matter. It was preached not many dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death; as if, hauing done this, there
remained nothing for him to doe, but to die:
And the matter is, of Death; the occasion and
subiect of all funerall Sermons. It hath beene
obserued of this Reuerend Man, That his
Faculty in Preaching continually encreased:
and, That as hee exceeded others at first; so,
at last hee exceeded himselfe. This is his last
Sermon; I will not say, it is therefore his best;
because, all his were excellent. Yet thus much:
A dying Mans words, if they concerne our
<pb facs="4"/>
selues; doe vsually make the deepest impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as being spoken most feelingly, and with
least affectation. Now, whom doth it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
to learn, both the danger, and benefit of
death? Death is euery mans enemy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
hurt to all; though to many, hee be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of greatest goods. This enemy we must
all combate dying; whom hee liuing did almost
conquer; hauing discouered the vtmost of his
power, the vtmost of his crueltie. May wee
make such vse of this and other the like prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiues,
That neither death, whensoeuer it
shall come, may seeme terrible; nor life te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious;
how long soeuer it shall last.</p>
