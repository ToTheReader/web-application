   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas about some two or three yeares since, I published a Tractate in Latine called <hi>Mnemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a,</hi> concerning the Art of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie: diuided into three bookes, according to the threefold kindes of Artificiall remembring, that are therein prescribed; and haue beene since importuned by diuers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o publish it in English: I haue answered their request, so farre as I iudged it fit, by publishing the third booke thereof, which is
<pb facs="3"/> plaine and easie for any mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; whereas the two first bookes are for Schollers onely, that are skilfull in Logicke and Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Yet haue I not tyed my selfe to such strict lawes as a Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor should, but haue altered where I thought good, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, examples, and method<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> thereof, with all libertie, to make it the more easie for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the common sort Writings (I confesse) are simply the most happie keepers of any thing in memorie, and doth for speed and certaintie go beyon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> any art of Memorie: but a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> cannot alwayes write that which commeth into his minde, (as when he is riding vpon a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or lyeth awake in his bed, or is among companie at dinner, or in a throng of people, or is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb facs="3"/> hindered by any the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion) therefore it will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie for him then, to helpe his memorie some other way, at least till he can set downe that in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which he would remember. And to this purpose serueth this Art; which if you shall aduisedly reade through, and marke with diligence the precepts and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that you may well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand euery Chapter, as you go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, without hastening to the end, before you come to it by due order, (like a man that would leape ouer a stile before he comes at it) I doubt not but you shall finde it very plaine and easie, and exceeding profitable for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance both of businesses and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations, and no way hurtfull to the facultie of the naturall memorie; but rather very vsefull
<pb facs="4"/> for the corroboration and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening thereof. For the memorie being daily accustomed to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling of sentences forgotten, and that by one or two words thereof, (as this booke directeth) is thereby much quickned in her dutie, and the wit the more shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. For nothing requireth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall exercise more then the memorie: neither is there any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie that waxeth sooner dull for want of exercise, then the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. This one thing I desire to be fauourably censured, that if in the examples which I giue for the illustration of the practise of this Art in the fourteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there appeare ought to be phantasticall, it may be excused by this reason, that in this Art I go about to instruct the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie, which is the seruant of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.
<pb facs="4"/> In which respect it fitteth well, that I deliuer some conceits which are phantasticall. And thus haue I ventured to put these my labours vpon common construction, hoping they shall finde no lesse fauourable accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among the iudicious, then the Art of Stenographie, which long since I published, hath found.</p>
