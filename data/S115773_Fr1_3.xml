If all the authorized writings of a godly and learned Divine are much to be regarded, then how much more are those writings to bee esteemed, which are set forth by publike Authority, as of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Majesty, of the Archbishops, Bishops, and the rest of the representative Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are assented unto by all the rest of the Clergy, and are confirmed by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb facs="6"/>That the booke of Common prayer is thus established, the Act for the uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Common prayer, set in the beginning thereof, testifieth. Also every one, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the Ministery of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> first subscribeth, <hi>That the booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer containeth in it nothing contrary to the Word of God, and that it may lawfully so bee used, and that hee himselfe will use the forme in the said booke prescribed in Publike prayer, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments, and none other.</hi> As it is in Canon 36. That the booke of ordering of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons is likewise ratified, the six and thirtieth Article of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion established, declareth, saying: <hi>The Book of Consecration of Archbishops, and Bishops, and ordering of Priests and Deacons, lately set forth in the time of</hi> Edward <hi>the sixt, and confirmed at the same time by Authority of Parliament, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all things necessarie to such Consecration and ordering: neither hath it any thing that of it selfe is superstitious and ungodly. And therefore, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever are consecrated or ordered according to the Rites of that booke, since the second yeare of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed King</hi> Edward, <hi>unto this time, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, shall be consecrated or ordered according to
<pb facs="6"/>the same Rites, we decree all such to be rightly, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and lawfully consecrated and ordered.</hi> That both the bookes of Homilies now printed in one Volume and distinguished in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Tomes, are approved by the whole Clergy, it is manifest by every ones subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the third Article to be subscribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, afore receiving any order or degree in the ministery, whereof the words are, <hi>That he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the book of Articles of Religion agreed upon by the Archbishops,</hi>
      <note place="margin">In Canon 36.</note>
      <hi>and Bishops of both Provinces, and the whole Clergie in the Convocation holden at London in the yeare of our Lord God, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand five hundred sixtie and two: and that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth all and every the Articles therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, being in number nine and thirty, besides the Ratification, to be agreeable to the Word of God.</hi> And in the five and thirtieth Article therof it is said, <hi>The second booke of Homilies, the severall ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles whereof we have joyned under this Article, doth containe a godly and wholesome Doctrine, and necessary for these times, as doth the former booke of Homilies, which were set forth in the time of</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>the sixt: and therefore we judge them to be read in Churches by the Ministers diligently and distinctly, that they may bee understanded of the

      <note place="margin">The Eleventh Article concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of man, referreth unto the <hi>Homily of Iustification,</hi> wherein the most whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Doctrine thereof, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, is more largly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.

      </note> The great authority of the Homilies may also appeare out of the Titles of both Tomes of them. The Title of the first Tome is, <hi>Certaine Sermons or Homilies appointed to bee read in Churches, in the time of the late Queene</hi> Elizabeth <hi>of famous memory And now thought fit to be reprinted by Authority from the Kings most Excellent Majesty.</hi> The Title of the second is, <hi>The second Tome of Homilies, of such matters as were promised, and entituled in the former part of Homilies: set out by the Authority of the late Queenes Majesty: and to be read in every Parish Church agreeably.</hi> There are no writings of any Author whatsoever, whereunto the Church ascribeth so much authority, as to the Bookes of Divine Service, having ordained them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together with the holy Scriptures to bee publikely read in every congregation of the Land. Now some will say, It appeareth by these relatings, that great is the respect which we owe unto the said bookes of the Church; but yet we are to receive no delivery in them, but what we know agreeth with the Word of God. In which saying of many of these times there is contained a greater defect, than all doe observe therein. For first by so saying,
<pb facs="7"/>they attribute not such authority, as is due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church their Mother; they duely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not her loyalty unto Christ her Head. S. <hi>Paul</hi> propoundeth the Church her fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity or faithfull obeience to be a patterne for imitation, where he saith: <hi>As the Church is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto Christ,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.24.</note> so let the wives bee to their owne husbands in every thing.</hi> Put case, that in that her fundamentall Doctrine there were some deliveries not in all respects so perfect as are the Scriptures of God our Father, yet it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her loving nature and prudence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound unto us any matter for our hurt. Yea, what we suppose to be imperfect, wee may make that use thereof, for which it was by her intended, and be much benefited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Secondly, by that their limitation they imply, that they have an ability to judge the understanding and wisdome of their mother. And if they bee demanded, whence they have received so great an extraordinary abilitie, as to judge of their mother the Church her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Doctrine? The common answer is, by their reading the holy Scriptures: They not seriously considering what is written in them also,<note place="margin">Acts 8.30, 31.</note> That how can one reading the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="8"/>Scriptures understand them, except some man guide him?<note place="margin">Malachi 2.7.</note> And that the Priests lips is to keepe knowledge, and the people is to seeke the Law at his mouth. The Clergie of the Church is to teach the common people of the same. The lay people in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and applying the Scriptures are to be guided by the Priesthood or Clergy. And before it hath beene declared, that the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Clergy with one mouth and consent have borne witnesse, <hi>That there is not any thing in the Booke of Common Prayer, which is contrary to the Word of God: And that the booke of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies doth containe a godly and wholesome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and necessary for these times to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed of the people.</hi> Seeing then all the guides in the Church, all the ordained keepers of knowledge, all such from whom the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are appointed to seeke the Law, or spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall instruction and teaching, doe testifie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the truth and profitablenesse of the bookes of the Divine Service, can any one justly accept against any deliverie in them, unlesse he doe assume unto, himselfe for to outsee the whole Clergy of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> The <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> hath so greatly
<pb facs="8"/>confirmed the authority of his Church, that he hath said:<note place="margin">Mat. 18.17.</note> Whoso neglecteth to heare the Church, let him (or her) be unto his people as an Heathen, and a Publicane. Wherefore it is our bounden duty most diligently to heare, read, and meditate on every particular delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in those fundamentall bookes composed by the perfectest wisdome of the Church our mother, and to frame our mindes and lives according to every prescription in the same, which doth in any wise concerne us. And we thus honouring the Church our spirituall Mother, God our heavenly Father will give us his blessing, <hi>Hee will send us light in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, readinesse and obedience in our will, discretion in our words and actions, true, serious, and loyall indeavours,</hi>
      <note place="margin">As wee are taught to pray for; in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Prayet next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Letany in the late <hi>Fast Booke.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>for the peace and prosperity of</hi> Ierusalem, <hi>the unity and glory of this Church &amp; State; That so we may love it, and prosper in it, full of grace in this life, and be filled with glorie in the life to come, through Iesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</hi>
