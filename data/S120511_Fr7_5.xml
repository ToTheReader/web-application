   <head>TO THE RIGHT Honorable and Noble Lady, the Lady <hi>Anne Harrington:</hi> Grace and comfort from God the Father, and the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ, be multiplied.</hi>

      <salute>MADAM,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>VVHen I had seriously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought my selfe, in what Doctrine especially to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my Ministerie, in the place in which the Lord had by so <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>strange a prouidence</hi> settled mee: Amongst other things, I was vehemently incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to study <hi>the Cure of the Feare of Death;</hi> both because it may be vsually obserued, that the most men are <hi>in bondage,</hi> by reason of <hi>these Feares;</hi> as also because I am assured, that our <hi>liues</hi> will become: more <hi>sweet,</hi>
      <pb n="646" facs="339"/>
yea, and more <hi>holy</hi> too, when the feare of death is remooued. And the rather was I incited hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, because I haue obserued some defect about this Point, in the most that haue written about Death. I am not ignorant of the censure which many may giue of this proiect, as accounting it an impossible thing to bee effected: but my trust is, that godly and discreete Christians will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine censure, when they haue throughly viewed my reasons.</p>
   <p>My vnfained desire to doe ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto Gods Church, in relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing such Christians herein, as are not furnished with better helpes, hath emboldened me to offer this Treatise also to the publike view. I haue presumed in your <hi>Honors</hi> absence to thrust forth this Treatise vnder the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi> of your <hi>Honors</hi> name: and withall, I desire heartily to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my thankefulnes for the many fauors shewed vnto me &amp; mine,
<pb n="647" facs="339"/>
while your <hi>Honor</hi> was pleased to be my hearer. I should also much reioyce, if my testim my (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the singular <hi>graces</hi> God hath bestowed vpon you, &amp; the many <hi>good workes</hi> in which you haue abounded in the places of your abode) might adde any thing either vnto your <hi>Honours</hi> prayses in the Churches of Christ, or vnto the establishment of the comfort of your owne heart in God, and his Sonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>
   <p>I haue not made choyse of your <hi>Honour</hi> in this Dedication, for any speciall fitnesse in this Treatise for your <hi>Honours</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in respect of your age, or absence in a place so far remote; for my earnest trust is, that God will adde yet many yeres to your happy life on earth: and besides, I haue had heretofore occasion to know how little you were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to dye, when the Lord did seeme to summon you by sicknes.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="648" facs="340"/>
That GOD, which hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled your heart with heauenly gifts, and so made you an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of so much good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment vnto that most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Princesse with whom you now liue; and towards whom, you haue shewed so much faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obseruance, and dearenesse of affection, and carefulnesse of attendance; euen the Father of mercie, and God of all consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, encrease in you all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall blessings, and multiply the ioy of your heart, and make you still to grow in acceptation, and all well-doing.</p>
   <p>Humbly crauing pardon for my boldnesse herein, I commit your <hi>Honor</hi> to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which will build you vp to eternall life: resting</p>

      <signed>Your Honors in all humble obseruance,
