      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O exhort euery man to the learning of Grammar, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to attaine to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the tongues (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is contained a great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of wisedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) it would seeme much vaine, and little needfull: for so much as it is knowne, that nothing can surely be ended, whose beginning is either feeble or faultie: and no buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be perfect, when as the foundation &amp; ground worke is ready to fall, and vnable to vphold the burden of the frame.

      </gap>lly of diuers waightie things, when he hath it. The which hath seemed to many very hard to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>mpasse aforetime, because that they, who profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d this Art of teaching Grammar, did teach di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Grammars, and not one, and if by chance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ey taught one Grammar, yet they did it diuersly,
<pb facs="3"/>and so could not do it all best, because there is but one bestnesse, not onely in euery thing, but also in the manner of euery thing.</p>
   <p>As for the diuersity of Grammars, it is well and profitably taken away by the Kings Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties wisedome, who foreseeing the inconuenience, and fauourably prouiding the remedie, caused one kind of Grammar by sundry learned men to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently drawne, and so to be set out, onely euery where to be taught for the vse of learners, and for the hurt in changing of Schoolemasters.</p>
   <p>The varietie of teaching is diuers yet, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes will be, for that euery Schoolemaster li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that he knoweth, and seeth not the vse of that he knoweth not, and therefore iudgeth that the most sufficient way, which he seeth to be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest meane, and perfectest kind, to bring a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to haue a through knowledge therein.</p>
   <p>Wherefore it is not amisse, if one seeing by tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all an easier and readier way, then the common sort of teachers do, would say what he hath proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and for the commodity allowed, that other not knowing the same, might by experience proue the like; and then by proofe reasonable iudge the like<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> not hereby excluding the better way when it is found, but in the meane season forbidding the worse.</p>
   <p>The first and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>heifest point is, that the diligent Master make not the Scholler hast too much, but that in continuance and diligence of teaching make him to rehearse so, that while he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly that that is behind, he suffer him not to goe forward. For this posting hast, ouerthroweth and hurteth a great sort of wits, and casteth them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an amazednesse, when they know not how they shall either go forward or backeward, but sticke
<pb facs="3"/>fast as one plunged, that cannot tell what to doe, or which way to turne him: and then the Master thinketh the Scholler to be a dullard, and the Scholler thinketh the thing to be vneasie, and too hard for his wit: and the one hath an euill opinion in the other, when oftentimes it is in neither, but in the kind of teaching. Wherefore, the best and cheifest point throughly to bee kept is, that the Scholler haue in minde so perfectly that that hee hath learned, and vnderstand it so, that not onely it be not a stoppe for him, but also a light and help vnto the residue that followeth. This shall be the Masters ease, and the childes incouraging, when the one shall see his labour take good effect, and thereby in teaching the lesse tormented: and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall thinke the thing the easier, and so with more gladnesse readie to goe about the same.</p>
   <p>In going forward, let him haue of euery decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Nounes, and coniugation of Verbes, so many seuerall examples as they passe them, that it may seeme to the Schoolemaster no word in the Latine tongue to be so hard for that part, that the Scholler shall not be able praiseably to enter into the fourming thereof. And surely the multitude of examples, if the easiest and commonest bee taken first, and so come to the stranger and harder, must<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eedes bring this profit withall, that the Scholler shall best vnderstand, and soonest conceiue the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the rules, and best be acquainted with the fashion of the tongue. Wherein it is profitable, not onely that he can orderly decline his Noune, and his Verbe, but euery way, forward, backward, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ases, by persons: that neither case of Noune, nor person of Verbe can be required, that hee cannot without stop or study tell. And vnto this time I count not the Scholler perfect, nor ready to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="4"/>further, till he hath this alreadie learned.</p>
   <p>This when he can perfectly doe, and hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euery part, not by rote but by reason, and is cunninger in the vnderstanding of the thing, then in rehearsing of the words, (which is not past a quarter of a yeares diligence, or very little more to a painfull and diligent man, if the Scholler haue a meane wit) then let him passe to the Concords to know the agreement of parts among themselues, with like way and diligence, as is afore described.</p>
   <p>Wherein plaine and sundry examples, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall rehearsall of things learned, and specially the daily declining of a Verbe, and turning him into all fashions, shall make the great and heaute labour so easie, and so pleasant for the framing of sentences, that it wil be rather a delight vnto them that they be able to do well, then paine in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an vnused and vnacquainted thing.</p>
   <p>When these Concordes bee well knowne vnto them, an easie and a pleasant paine, if the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds be well and throughly beaten in, let them not continue in learning of their rules orderly, as they lie in the Syntaxe, but rather learne some prettie booke, wherein is contained not only the eloquence of the tongue, but also a good plaine les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of honestie and godlines, and thereof take some little sentence as it lieth, and learne to make the same first out of English into Latine, not seeing the booke, or construing it thereupon. And if there fal any necessary rule of the Syntaxe to be known, then to learne it, as the occasion of the sentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth cause that day. Which sentence once made well, and as nigh as may be with the words of the booke, then to take the booke, and construe it, and so shall he be lesse troubled with the parsing of it, and easiliest carry his lesson in minde.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>And although it was said before, that the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler should learne but a little at once, it is not meant that when the Master hath heard him a while, he should let him alone, (for that were more negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for both parts) but I would all their time they be at schoole, they should neuer be idle, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes occupied in a continuall rehearsing and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king backe againe to those things they haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and be more bound to keep well their old, then to take forth any new.</p>
   <p>Thus if the Master occupy them, he shall see a little lesson take a great deale of time: and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquiring and examining of the parts and the rules, not to bee done so quickly and speedily as it might be thought to be: within a while, by this vse the Scholler shal be brought to a good kind of readinesse of making, to the which if there be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned some vse of speaking, (which must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be had) he shall be brought past the wearisome bitternes of his learning.</p>
   <p>A great helpe to further this readinesse of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and speaking shall be, if the Master giue him an English booke, and cause him ordinarily to turne euery day some part into Latine. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise cannot be done without his rules, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth establish them and ground them surely in his mind for readines, and maketh him more able to speake suddenly, whensoeuer any present occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is offered for the same. And it doth help his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning more a great deale to turne out of English in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Latine, then contrary.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, we see many can vnderstand La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, that cannot speake it, and when they reade the Latine word in the booke, can tell you the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish thereof at any time: but when they haue layd away their bookes, they cannot contrariwise tell
<pb facs="5"/>you for the English the Latine againe, whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you will aske them. And therefore this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise helpeth this sore well, and maketh those words which hee vnderstandeth to be readiest by vse vnto him, and so perfecteth him in the tongue handsomely.</p>
   <p>These precepts well kept, will bring a man cleane past the vse of this Grammar booke, and make him as ready as his book, and so meet to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: whereof it were out of season to giue precepts here. And therefore this may be for this purpose enough, which to good Schoolemasters and skilfull are not so needfull: to other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and lesse practised it may be, not onely worth the labour of reading, but also of the vsing.</p>
