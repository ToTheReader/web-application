   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ever esteemed, that the imployment of those Talents, either naturally bestowed on man by God, or acquired by study and industry, ought more properly yea and of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rather to be imployed in the service of our King and Country, than to be made use of in the satisfaction of our private humours. I doe here (in acquittance of that generall obligation) adventure to offer up this poore mite of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, among the many learned &amp; elaborate workes which the choyce wits and learned pens of our age produce in all kindes. It is but a translation: the originall belonging to a very learned and reverend French Author, whose
<pb facs="4"/>fluent style, and profound learning so happily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in his owne language, made mee not a little timorous to undertake to make him speake English, being iustly apprehensive as well of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him wrong, as disgracing my selfe: but the zealous desire <hi>I</hi> had to be serviceable to all such studious and worthy persons, who haply not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the French language, are yet desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to enable and adorn themselves with those vertues and qualities requisite for such who by an honest and noble ambition doe any way ayme to be rightly usefull for the service of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne in the most eminent offices and charges of this great Empire, did so farre over-rule me, as I rather choose to undergoe that hazard, than to bereave them of so great a benefit by my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-much bashfulnesse. Now though the practise of those things contained in this Treatise, belong properly to such choyce persons whose vertues, excellent endowments, or advantage of birth, together with our Soveraignes favours make capable for the conduct of weighty affaires, yet doth the speculative part thereof indifferently appertaine to all generous spirits. I shall not need any further to commend the Author, his
<pb facs="4"/>worke will sufficiently speake for him. The onely favour <hi>I</hi> am to require is for the Translator, who if he have not sufficiently acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or have come short of those lively expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions appearing in the originall: consider (gentle Reader) that few Painters have ever beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to equalize the purtraits drawne by <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> in any there most exact copies. It would therefore prove an unexcusable arrogancy in me, should <hi>I</hi> have the least imagination of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into comparison with so excellent a French Penne, by any English of mine: if you please therefore to excuse my defects, and accept of my good desires you shall therein much incourage me to undertake the like labours in whatsoever I shall suppose may conduce to publicke utility.</p>
