      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsidering the vniuersall infection of this contagious disease of the Soule, VNIVST ANGER, and the manifold per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious euils which it worketh, both priuate and publique, I thought good to prescribe out of Gods word, some remedies for those Patients which are committed to my cure, whereby they might eyther bee preserued from these feuerlike fits, which cause men outwardly to shake and tremble, when as inwardly they are most inflamed, or els haue their heate somewhat allayed and abated, when they are already fallen into them. The which my prescript I thought at the first should haue beene communicated to no more then mine owne Patients, till I was perswaded by more skilfull Phisitions then my selfe, that the publishing thereof might redound to others profit And therefore desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing more then to exercise my poore talent to the glory of my maister who bestowed it, and the benefit of my fellow seruants, for whose good also I haue receiued it, I willingly condescended to their motion. And for as much, as I had onely shadowed a rude draught without colour or countenance, I was faine to take a review of my worke, altering some things, and adding others as it were new lineaments,
<pb facs="127"/>which I thought more fit for the Presse then for the Pulpit. If any thinke me too quicke in practise, they will (I hope) excuse me, if they consider that I make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of my slender skill, not in the vitall parts, but in the feete of the soule, namely the affections, and yet the curing of them, or but this one of them, may greatly redound to the benefite of the whole, for as the diseases of the feete doe grieue the heart, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the head, and the curing and healing of them doth ease and comfort both, so when the affections are distempered being infected with the contagion of our originall corruption, euen the chiefe parts of the soule, the Vnderstanding and Will, are not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle disturbed and disordered, by receiuing from them their contagious pollution. And therefore he who can skilfully purge these neather parts shal ease the higher, by drawing downe those corrupt humours which do offend and annoy them. Seeing then, there may come by my practise great good with little danger, I haue the rather aduentured the cure: being contented to vndergoe the censure of some for too much hast, who (I feare mee) are in these cases as much too slow, to the end that I may to the vttermost of my skill bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit many. The Lord who is the onely true Phisition of soules diseased with sinne, blesse this and all other my indeauours that they may bee profitable for the setting forth of his glory, the benefit of my brethren, and furthering the assurance of mine owne saluation.</p>
   <closer>Amen.</closer>
