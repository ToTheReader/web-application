      <hi>To the right worshipful S. Iohn</hi> Zouch of Codner Knight R.B wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a blessed life, happy dayes with great increace of vvorship.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst the sundry woorks of many anciēt, learned &amp; wise men (right vvorshipful) I fide no one thing more generally cōmended then the trauel that procureth profit &amp; vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to the common welth: for to this end al the estate of mans life tēdeth, that vvhilst vve cōtinue in this base territory heer, our vvhole indeuour should be imploied to the ben fit of our cuntrey in some respect. And for this cause the moste renovvned Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and famouse Princes of the vvorld in times past had alvvaies diligent care to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce such as by their pollicy conserued their kingdomes in publique trāquilitie, or by their valiantnes vanquished their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, or by iustice suppressed the vvicked either els by their vvritings &amp; learned docu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments instructed the Vulgaritie to vertuous liuing. Anaxarchus amōgst the Phenicians alovved best of the maintainers of ciuil con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cord, Numa Pompilius exhorteth the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ro recompence those largly that retur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned victorious from any battail, Promotne
<pb facs="3"/>us willed the Egiptians to make great accoūt of those that were true Iusticiaries. And Bias king of the Argiues, commaunded his people aboue all others, to honour &amp; reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence moste their vvriters and teachers of vvisedōe. Octauian and Mecenas gratified virgil the lerned poet, with such rich presēts that Seruius who vvriteth of him, affirmeth that in short space hee was valued tobe worth six M. Sesterns, vvhich amounteth to tvvo hundred M. crovvnes, such zeale vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to vertue reigned in the noble Peares of that age, that they accoūted those gifts best bestovved which vvere imploied vpō them that vvere singuler in any facultie, to then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tēt that others in hope of prefermēt, might the rather be incouraged to immitate their steps. If that lack of liberalitie be found in the princes of this parfet time, in remune. rating the vertues vvhich abounded so plen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifully in the nobilitie of those obscure day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es vvherin nature (vvithout the knowledge of the eternall) bare the onely svvay, hovv much it is to be lamented I refer to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of those that by reading may discerne the praises belonging iustly vnto the one, and by present sight may beholde the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults of the other</p>
   <p>If a greater desire to pleasure their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
<pb facs="3"/>vvas found in that people which vvere gouerned only by the instinct of nature, thē there is in those vvhich novv may be direct<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed by that pure &amp; most blessed operatiō of the spirit of God: vvhat punishmēt is due to their rechelesse negligēce let those that read the sacred Scriptures discide, vvhere it is moste apparant to be seen, vvith vvhat vigor God punished the vnprofitable seruāt, hovv he cōmaūded that euery tre vvhich brought not forth good frute, shuld be hevvē dovvn and cast into the fire. These threatnings (if nothing els vvould moue) should stir vp e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man to make some increce of those ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents vvhich God hath lent him, rather then through slouthfulnes to bury them in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie vvithout reaping gaines to them selues, or yeelding a iust account to God, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefit to their countrey, trevv allegeance to their prince, furtherance to their childrē, or pleasure to their freends to vvhome they be bound. To auoid these incōueniences &amp; to eschevv the infamy that breedeth through idelnes: I thought it good to imploy my dili<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gence in translating this small Treatise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring rather to bee accounted a profitable Bee: then to be suspected for a hurtfull Drone, for though the Volume be not large, nor my laboure great: yet possible,
<pb facs="4"/>there is as great consolation to be found for the repentant sinner as in bigger Tomes.</p>
   <p>And because I vvould signifie vnto your vvorship, the good vvil I beare you and the desire I haue to acquit some parte of those curiesies vvhiche I haue receiued at your hands, I haue presumed to craue your patro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nage, to this the first frutes of my labour, ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ping that you vvil vouchsafe the acceptāce thereof in suche parte as vvith good vvill I offer it. And though that it scape not free frō the cēsures of some vvhose delight is to carp at euery light occasion, yet if it may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your fauourable liking, my desire is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and so (vvith remembrāce of my du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie) I take my leue, wishing helth to your per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sō, vvorship to your parentage, and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroussuccesse in all your indeuours.</p>
