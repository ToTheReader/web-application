   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN AND GENTLE REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and specially to my owne Parishioners of <hi>Drowfeild</hi> and <hi>Staunton,</hi> of whom I haue had <hi>Charge, and to whom I wish sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation</hi> and safety of soule in <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Christian Reader, I haue led my life aboue fortie yeeres in two seuerall places, to wit, in <hi>Drowfeild,</hi> in the Countie
<pb facs="3"/> of <hi>Darby,</hi> of which Church I was Vicar fifteene yeeres; and at this present in <hi>Staun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> wherein I doe now liue, and haue beene resident these twenty and seuen yeres. In the former place my Charge was great and wide, and beeing occasioned often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (as dutie required) to visit the Sicke there, and in some other places neere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning: whereof some were Lunatike, and troubled in their passions and extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Others, I found fearfull of Death and Damnation, and therfore to haue need of ghostly counsell and cōfort in
<pb facs="3"/> their molestations and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities: and finding not much matter of that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect in the visitation of the Sicke, contained in the Booke of Common Prayer, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and bridle their outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious humours and mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: I bethought my selfe, it were expedient for mee to inuent and deuise, by Gods assistance, some necessarie helpe, both for mine owne vse, and for more full dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my dutie in such cases. And therefore not daring to presume of my selfe, either to pray or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade of the sodaine in such fearefull and lamentable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents:
<pb facs="4"/> I presently deuised to my simple skill, to inuent and dispose partly of my selfe, and partly by collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of other Authors, such matter, and obserue such method therein, as might be to the better performance of my dutie towards God, the quieting of the afflicted soule, the comfort of my deare flock, and also some helpe to such of mine owne Calling, as were at that time as ignorant as my selfe. And hereupon I tooke mee to my pen and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and so did set down this plaine and simple Treatise in writing, which for the most part thereof hath lyen by mee
<pb facs="4"/> many yeeres, seruing onely mine owne turne in time of neede, and as occasion was offered. And albeit I had thought neuer to haue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished or committed it to the Presse in my life time; yet now being old, and not so well able to performe mine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Pulpit, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as I haue beene in times past, by reason that my sight and memory, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther powers of nature fayle mee; I thought good to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid idlenesse, to reuiew and present this small volume to you my fore said flockes, and to offer you a little taste of my first fruits, and so to leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
<pb facs="5"/> mee in writing some pledge &amp; taken of my loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, whereby you may the better remember mee, when the mould hath couered my body, and the Magots and Wormes consumed my fraile flesh. And if any others besides you shall be quickned and strengthened thereby in their greatest griefes, &amp; last combates, I shall in heart bee most glad, and thinke my paines the better bestowed: And therefore haue beene bold to offer this my myte to God &amp; your charitable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation &amp; allowance: Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crauing pardon, if in any point I haue giuen occasion of
<pb facs="5"/> offence or mislike, in omitting any part of my duty therein, either towards God and your selues, or in committing any offence unto others that are more learned &amp; iudicial them my selfe, who willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge mine owne want and infirmity in these my last and declining yeeres: and therefore submit my selfe to the censure of those which are of riper wit, and profounder knowledge; for I speake not to them, but to the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and simple sort like my selfe. Wherefore as I haue plainly set it forth, only for the instruction and comforts of the ignorant and afflicted:
<pb facs="6"/> So (I beseech thee gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to permit it to passe with out thy curious carping, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning therein any fault or defect wherein I haue failed, and friendly accepting my good meaning towards the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Soule, and troubled Conscience, for whose sake I haue published it to the view of the world, which I framed first onely for the vse of mine own flock: whose safegard and saluation. I tender in my heart; &amp; so commit them and the Reader to Christ Iesus.</p>
