   <head>THE AVTHOVRS EPISTLE TO THE well-wishing Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y desire (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader) is, to teach thee Patience, but compendious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I must confesse I was unwilling to undertake this Subject, which perhaps may seeme strange, and move thee to aske this question:
<pb facs="4"/>
Is it not copious enough? Yes indeed is it; and this very reason had almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded me not to meddle with it. It is too copious, too abundant, insomuch that I knew not what first, what last to treat of: and, beleeve me, there is no Subject, whereupon I could more enlarge my selfe. I have had long since a world of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it, so that I could with as much facility, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, have written great vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, as small and lesser bookes. But I more regard the benefit and utility of my Reader, then the bulke and ostentation of the work. Shouldest thou read much
<pb facs="5"/>
and consider little, forget the beginning before thou commest to the end, what would all this availe thee? In very truth, a copious and fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>unting discourse, will helpe but little to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Patience. For this respect I have contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my booke within this compasse and strict limits, written but little, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically &amp; succinctly, the better to helpe my Readers memory, illustrate his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and incite his will. I may well say I have rather selected, then colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the contents of this booke. And perhaps, if God spare me life and health, I
<pb facs="5"/>
may publish more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: meane while accept these for a taste. Farewell my good Reader, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose thy selfe to Patience, a thing of all others the most necessary.</p>
