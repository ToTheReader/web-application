                 <title>A iustification of the Church of England : Demonstrating it to be a true Church of God, affording all sufficient meanes to saluation. Or, a countercharme against the Romish enchantments, that labour to bewitch the people, with opinion of necessity to be subiect to the Pop of Rome. Wherein is briefly shewed the pith and marrow of the principall bookes written by both sides, touching this matter: with marginall reference to the chapters and sections, where the points are handled more at large to the great ease and satisfaction of the reader.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Reuerend Father: I humbly craue your <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> to take notice of the <hi>Causes,</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of my writing; and your <hi>Patronage</hi> to countenance it.<note place="margin">The occasions of my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. 1 Particular.</note> I <hi>euer</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a great blessing of God, and it is <hi>still</hi> the ioy of my heart to record, that in my stronger yeeres I was thought worthy to be employed in the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp of some <hi>Nobles,</hi> and many other yong <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the best sort (whose names here to insert might happily be censured ambition in me) in the Learned Tongues, Mathemaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Arts, Musicke, and other both <hi>Diuine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Learning; and that Many of them haue since risen to great places and dignities in our Church and Common wealth. And it was afterwards my great griefe, to heare, that any of them, or of their Parents (by mee
<pb facs="3"/> much honored) should be seduced or drawn to embrace the present Religion of the Papacy, and to separate frō our so excellently-reformed Church. The falling away of persons of so Noble birth and place, &amp; after such education, likely also to be means by their examples and reputation, to draw others to the like defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made a deepe impression of sorrow in my soule, and wrought a desire to seeke their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery.<note place="margin">1 More gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> I saw also a generall inclination of many sorts of people to returne againe to the Old Religion (as they called it) vpon a strong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that the Protestants Religion was new, and but of yesterday: although we daily cry downe all nouelties in Religion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to embrace nothing which is not of the ancient faith,<note place="margin">Iude verse <hi>3.</hi>
      </note> once (or first) deliuered to the Saints. These considerations excited and vrged me, by that bond of loue and duty, wherewith I feele my selfe bound, both to my late dearely beloued yong Nobles and Gentlemen in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and to our whole Church and State in generall,<note place="margin">The purposes and ends of my writing.</note> to addresse my selfe to writing, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect and perfit that, which I had long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, obserued and taught: both to put those former in mind of such grounds of sound Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which in their youth (both by pulicke
<pb facs="3"/> Sabboth-dayes Sermons, and by priuate Schoole-Catechizings on Frydayes, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conferences) they had learned of me; and to confirme those grounds with Inuincible Reasons and Allegations: And also to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue my Talents (such as they are) to the best seruice of the whole Church, our Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soueraigne, the State in generall, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular soule, for their eternall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall happinesse; by instructing the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> confirming the <hi>right beleeuers</hi> and <hi>good Subiects,</hi> reducing the <hi>errant,</hi> staying the <hi>weake</hi> and <hi>waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> or confounding the <hi>obstinate:</hi> and thereby (so much as in me lyeth) working a happy <hi>peace, loue, vnity,</hi> and <hi>vnanimity</hi> amongst all.

<pb facs="4"/> to fit it the best way to the Persons to whom I intended it; and to these times. I saw, that bookes of all sorts are infinitely multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world: and that neither men of great place, nor many others, haue time afforded from their necessary affaires to read many bookes, or any large discourse. I thought it therefore (though the most <hi>painfull,</hi> yet) the most <hi>profitable</hi> course, <hi>diligently</hi> to <hi>collect,</hi> and <hi>faithfully</hi> to <hi>relate,</hi> with all possible <hi>breuity</hi> and <hi>perspicuity,</hi> the substance of that which former learned <hi>Authors, Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Histories</hi> haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered: what the <hi>Romish Doctors</hi> haue proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>obiected,</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> (especially <hi>English</hi>) haue substantially <hi>answered,</hi> (so much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth my purpose and the points which I handle) that the Reader might haue in one view and volume, the <hi>Pith</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> of the best bookes written on both sides, touching these matters, as an <hi>Epitome</hi> of them all. And withall pointing to the bookes, chapters and sections,<note place="margin">By marginall notes for the most part.</note> or pages of them all, as an <hi>Index,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the vnsatisfied where he may read of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point more at large.

         <hi>Iusti. Lipsij Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica.</hi> See his Prefaces.</note> hath taken this course, without any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to himselfe, but rather with the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
<pb facs="4"/> of his diligence and learning: wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Emperour, Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> (which haue no leisure to read great bookes) briefe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorismes</hi> methodically deliuered by him, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore in the most learned Authors owne words, and quoting their bookes. <hi>Vt quae optima sunt, aut per me cognoscatis, aut mecum recognosca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> saith he to those great Estates, That either by me yee may <hi>know</hi> these excellent things, or with me <hi>call</hi> them againe <hi>to minde.</hi> And herein (saith he) <hi>Verè dicere possum, omnia esse nostra, &amp; ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil.</hi> All things (in the booke) are mine, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Because the <hi>matter</hi> was the Authors (whō he cites) the whole inuention and <hi>order</hi> was his owne. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in diuine Controuersies, is esteemed to haue done the greatest seruice to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by collecting the <hi>substance</hi> of the learned large writers of Controuersies into one body, <hi>cōfuting</hi> (as he could) what was against, and <hi>confirming</hi> what was for that Church. I haue followed these great wits, though <hi>longo interuallo,</hi> a great Way behind them, in the <hi>manner,</hi> not in the <hi>matter</hi> of their writing. I know it vnfit for me (yea, vnfit for a Christian, and I hate it in my heart) to bean Author or <hi>Inuenter</hi> of new <hi>opinions</hi> of Religon. We must learne of S. <hi>Iude,</hi>

Such graue and holy Authors words (as vndeniable witnesses) add <hi>waight</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> to my discourse, more then from my selfe it could haue, and it will be a great ease to the Readers (as Iudges) to haue the <hi>whole pleadings abridged,</hi> and laid in one <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
