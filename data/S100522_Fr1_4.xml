   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is fallen out much beside our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,<note place="margin">Wee did expect nothing lesse then warre.</note> that the storme of warre should now againe begin to blow, when we did esteem that the mercy of GOD and justice of our Prince had setled our Land in a firme peace for many generations, at least for many daies &amp; ever, while some appearance of provocation should have arisen from us, for the kindling of the wrath of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged enemies, whose furie, though we know well, not to be quite extinguished, yet we did surely think it would not breake forth in haste in any publick and open flame, til some new matter had been furnished, or some probable colour of a new quarrell could have beene alleadged against us.</p>
   <p>When we have scattered that cloud of calumnies,<note place="margin">We have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing that can bee pretended with any goodly colour for the breach of the late pac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>fication.</note> which by their tongues and pens they had spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad of our rebellion, &amp; many other odious crimes, when by our frequent supplications, informations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances, declarations, and other writs, wee have cleared aboundantly the justice of our cause, the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of our proceedings to all the ingenuous minde of the Yle, and to so many of our neighbour nations, as have beene desirous to cognosce of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, when our gracious and just Prince, in the very heat of his wrath, raised alone by their mis-informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even while armes were in his hand, hath beene
<pb facs="6"/> moved with the unanimous consent of all his English Counsell of all his Commanders, and whole armie, to acknowledge us good and loyall Subjects; And after a full hearing of our cause in his Campe, to professe his satisfaction, to pronounce us free of those crimes which before were falsely blazed of us, to send us all home in peace, with the tokens of his favour, with the heartie embracement of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e about our own long neglected businesse; praising God and blessing the King. The martiall mindes among us, panting for languor to be imployed over sea, for the honour of the Crowne; in spending their bloud against the insolent enemies of his Majesties house: While these are our only thoughts; It was more then
<pb facs="6"/> marveilous to us, that first the dumbe and obscure whisperings, and at once the loud blasts, the open threats of a new more terrible and cruell warre then before should come to our eares, that our Castles should be filled with strāgers, be provided with extra ordinarie victuals and munition, as against a present assault, or long siege: Many of our Nobles tempted to leave our cause; numbers of assayes made to breake the unitie of all our Estates; and at last our Parliament commanded to arise, the Commissioners thereof, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long and wearisome journey to Court, for the clearing of some surmised mistakes about moods and formes of proceedings, refused presence; a Parliament in England indicted (as the rumour goeth) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade that Nation, our dearest neighbours, with whom our cause is common, to imploy their meanes and armes against us, that so our old nationall and immortall warres may be renewed to make sport to Prelates, &amp; a bridge for the <hi>Spainyard</hi> or <hi>French</hi> to come over Sea, and sit downe masters of the whole Yle, when both Nations by mutuall wounds are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled for defence against the force of an enemie, so potent as either <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spaine</hi> are this day of them selves without the assistance which too like shall bee made them by the Papists of the Yle, and many more, who will not faile to joyne for their owne ends with any apparent victory.</p>
   <p>Wee admire how it is possible that intestine armes without any necessity should be takē up at this season,<note place="margin">Compassion hope, and all reason call now for peace at home, that at last we may gett some order of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad.</note> when all the Forces the whole Yle can spare, are most earnestly called for, by the tears of his Ma. only sister, by the bloud &amp; long desolation of her most miserable Subjects, by the captivitie and banishment of all her hopefull Children, Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> lying dayly under
<pb facs="7"/> the hazard of the <hi>French</hi> hang man at <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp; Prince <hi>Robert</hi> of the <hi>Austrian</hi> at <hi>Vienne,</hi> the rest of that royall bloud, lying so many yeares with their Mother, banished in a strange Countrie: Pietie would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to put up all our homeward quarrels, though they were both great and manie, let be to forge any, where none reall can be found; Yea, hope would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure us to try now, if ever, our Armes on those spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Nations, the hereditary enemies of our Religion and of our Yle, when God hath made them contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible by the cleare successe hee giveth dayly to every one that riseth against them: <hi>Banier</hi> with a wing of the <hi>Swed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>sh</hi> Armie, dwelling in spite of the Emperour all this yeare in the heart of his Countries, a part of <hi>Weymers</hi> forces with a litle help frō <hi>France</hi> triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>Rhene,</hi> for all that <hi>Baviere, Culen,</hi> the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> or <hi>Spainiard</hi> can doe against them: That very great and strong <hi>Armado</hi> all utterly crushed in our eyes by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> alone, without the assistance of any. The very <hi>French,</hi> not the best sea men, having lately beaten oftener then once the <hi>Spanish</hi> navies in the <hi>Mediterrian.</hi> Shall we alone sit still for ever? shal we send alwayes nought but base contemptible &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided Supplications to these intractable Princes? shall we feed our selves still with their scornfull promises, which so oft wee have found to our great disgrace most false? yea, rather then to beate them, by that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of power which we have, if God will give us an heart to imploy it, rather then to pull downe those tyrants, who have shed rivers of Protestants bloud, who hath lōg tred on the persons of our nearest friends, and in them, on our honour; Is it now meet we should choose to goe kill one another alone for the
<pb facs="7"/> bearing up of Prelates tailes, and that of Prelates as unworthie of respect as any that ever wore a Mytre. Let our kindred, let our friends, let all the Protestant churches perish, let our own lives &amp; estates run never so evident an hazard, yet the Prelates pride must be borne up, their furious desire of revenge must be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate; all their <hi>Mandamus</hi> in these dominions must be execute with greater severitie and rigour then those of their brethren are this day in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spaine,</hi> or those of their grand-father at <hi>Rome.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To us surely it is a strange <hi>Paradox,</hi> that a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England,<note place="margin">The Canterburian faction deserveth not so well of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land that armes in their favour ought to be taken against Scotland.</note> so wise, grave, equitable a Court, as in all bygone times it hath ever proven, should bee thought in danger at any time, let be now to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by any allurement, by any terrour, to submitt themselves as Varlets and Pages to the execution of the lusts, the furies and outragious counsels of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turberrie</hi> and his dependars, for they know much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then we, that the maine greevances both of their Church and State, have no other originall, no other fountaine on earth but those men. Who other but they have keept our most gracous Prince at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Countrie almost ever since he came to the Crowne? For whose cause have Parliaments these many yeares beene hindred to meet, and when they haue met, beene quickly raised, to the unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grief and prejudice of the whole land, and of all our friends abroad. By whose connivence is it that the idolatrous Chappels of both the Queenes in the most conspicuous places of the Court are so gorgeous and much frequented? Whose tollerance is it that at <hi>London</hi> three Masse-priests are to bee found for one Minister, that three hundreth of them reside in the
<pb facs="8"/> cittie in ordinat, and six thousand at least in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. If yee trust the Jesuites Catalogue to <hi>Rome?</hi> Whence comes their immunitie from the Lawes, who have sett up Cloysters for Monks &amp; Nuns, let bee houses for open Masses in divers cities of the Kings dominions? Why is our correspondence with the <hi>Pope</hi> no more secret, but our Agents avowedly sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; his <hi>Holinesse Nuntioes</hi> received here in state, and that such ones as in publick writs have lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed with unspeakable reproaches the person and birth of that most sacred Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Such actions, or at least long permission of such abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doe they flow from any other but his Grace, the head &amp; heart of the Cabbine Counsell. Did any other but hee &amp; his creatures, his legs and armes hinder al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies our effectual alliance with the <hi>Sweeds</hi> &amp; <hi>French,</hi> when their armies did most flourish in <hi>Germanie</hi> for the relief of the oppressed Churches. Why was that poore Prince the king of <hi>Boheme</hi> to his dying day keept from any considerable help from <hi>Britaine?</hi> How was these young Princes the other yeare permitted to take the fields with so small forces, that a very meane power of a silly commander beat them both, tooke the one captive, and put the other in his flight to an evident hazard of his life. Who moved that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Prince after his escape to take so strange a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell as the world now speake off, and when he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged, who did betray both his purpose and person to the French king, could any without the Cabbine understand the convey of such matters, and within that Cabbine does any come without his Graces per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission? Is not that man the evident author of all the Scotish broyles? Are not his Letters extant, his
<pb facs="8"/> holy hands interlynings of the Scotish service to bee seene, his other writtes also are in our hands, making manifest that the beginning and continuance of that cursed worke hath no spring without his braine.</p>
   <p>When the King himselfe after ripe advertisement and all about him both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> had returned in peace, who incontinent did change the face of the Court, and revive that fire, which in the heart of the Prince and all his good Subjects was once closse dead.</p>
   <p>That a Parliament of England will not onely let such a man &amp; his complices goe free,<note place="margin">Wee offer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct by the writ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>unded (for what dare not effronted impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence attempt) we would require that sage Senat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they passe any bloudy sentence of war against us, to consider a little the quality of that party for whose cause they take arms, we offer to instruct to the ful sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the whole world of free &amp; imprejudicat mindes, not by flying reports, not by probable likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, not by the sentences of the gravest &amp; most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne judicatories of this land, our two last generall <hi>assemblies</hi> &amp; late <hi>parliam:</hi> who at far greater length &amp; with more mature advisement did cognosce of those causes then ever any <hi>assembly</hi> or <hi>parlia:</hi> among us since the first foundation of our Church &amp; kingdom did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve upon any matter whatsoever; All those means of probation we shall set aside and take us alone to the
<pb facs="9"/> mouth of our very adversaries. If by their own testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie we make it evident that beside bookes, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and Bishops which make the proper &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular quarrel of this nationall Kirk against them, they are guilty of grosse <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> plaine popery, and of setting up of barbarous tyrannie, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon quarrell of the Kirk of England of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Kirks, and of all men who delite not to live &amp; dye in the fetters of slavery. If we demonstrate, not so much by their preachings and practises amongst us, as by their maximes, printed with priviledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your selvs, which to this day, though oft pressed thereto, they have never recanted. If wee shew that yet still they stifly avow all the articles of <hi>Arminius,</hi> a number of the grossest abominations of popery, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the authoritie of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they urge conclusiōs that will force you without any reluctance, so much as by a verball protestation, not onely to give way unto any iniquitie whatsoever, either in Kirk or State whereto they can get stollen the pretext of the kings name, but also to lay down your neck under the yoke of the king of Spaine, if once he had any sitting in this Yle, without any further resistance, though in your Church by force that Tyrant should set up the latine Masse in place of the Bible, and in your State, for your <hi>Magna-Charta</hi> and acts of Parliament, the Lawes of Castile, though in your eyes he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the whole race of the royall familie, though the remainder of the Nobilitie and Gentrie in the Land should be sent over by him, some to worke in fetters in his Mines of <hi>Peru,</hi> others in chayns to row all their dayes in his gallayes in the <hi>Mediterrane,</hi> for all these or any other imaginable acts of tyrannie that could
<pb facs="9"/> escape the wicked head of any mad <hi>Nero,</hi> of any monstrous <hi>Caligula;</hi> these men doe openly take upon them to perswade that no kinde of resistance for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence can bee made by the whole States of a Land, though sitting in Parliament, with a most harmonious consent, no more then the Jewes might have done against <hi>Nabuchadnezar,</hi> or the Christians of old a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pagane Emperours, or the Greeke Church this day against the grand <hi>Signieur</hi> in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that all our forbeares both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> in their manifold bickerings against the misleaders of their Prince; against the tyrannizing factions of Court, were ever Traitours and Rebels, and ought to have loosed their head and Lands for their presumption to defend their Liberties, against the intollerable insolencies of a pack of runnigate Villanes for their boldnesse, to fasten the tottering Crowne upon the head of their Kings, all such Services of our Antecessours to King and Countrie, were treacherous insurrections.</p>
   <p>If for all these their crimes I make speake before you no other witnesses then our owne tongue,<note place="margin">Armes needlesse taken in so evill a cause, can not but end in an untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repentance.</note> I trust they shall not remaine in your mindes the least shaddow of any scruple, to beleeve my allegations, nor in your wills the least inclination to joyne with the Counsells of so polluted and self-convicted persons.</p>
   <p>And if to men whose open profession in their printed Bookes, let be secret practises leads to so wicked ends, so farre contrarie to the glorie of God, to the honour and safetie of our King, to the well of us all, whether in Soule, Body, Estate, Children, or any thing that is deare to us, yee would lead
<pb facs="10"/> your armes against us; we beleeve the Lord of Hosts, the righteous judge would be opposite to you, and make hundreds of your men in so evill a cause flee before ten of ours. Or, if it were the profound and unsearchable pleasure of the God of Armies, to make you for a time a scourge to beate us, for our manifold transgressions; yet when ye had obtained all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates intentions, when wee for our others sins were tred under your feete, wee would for all that hope to die with great comfort and courage, as defenders of the truth of God, of the Liberties and Lawes of our Countrie, of the true, good, and honour of the Crown and Royall Familie; All which as we take it, one of the most wicked and unnaturall faction that ever this Isle did breed, are manifestly oppugning; yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we could not but leave in our Testament to you our unjust oppressors the legacie of an untimous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for when ye have killed thousands of us, &amp; banished the rest out of the isle, when on the back of our departure, your sweete Fosters the Bishops have brought the Pope upon you and your Children; or when a <hi>French</hi> &amp; <hi>Spanish</hi> invasion doth threaten you with a slavish conquesh; Wil ye not then all, &amp; above all our gracious Prince regrate, that Hee hath beene so evill advised, as to have put so many of his brave Subjects to the cruell sword, who were very able and most willing to have done him noble service against these forraine usurpers? Would not at such a time, that is too likely to be at hand, if our Prelates advises now be followed, both his Majestie, and all of you who shall remaine in life, bee most earnest recallers; not onely of your owne Countrie-men, (many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands whereof ye know have lately by Episcopall ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
<pb facs="10"/> beene cast out from their homes, as farre as to the worlds end, among the savadge <hi>Americans,</hi>) but also the reliques of our ruine from their banishment, with as great diligence as in time of <hi>Fergus</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the inhabitants of this Land did recall our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, when by the fraud &amp; force of a wicked facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they were the most part killed; and the rest sent over sea in banishment.</p>
   <p>It were better by much, before the remeedilesse stroke be given, to be well advised, then out of time to sigh, when the millions of lost lives, when the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of our true Religion, when the liberties of both the nations, once throwen away by our owne hands, can not againe be recovered.</p>
   <p>To the end therefore that such lamentable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences may be eshewed,<note place="margin">In this nick of time very poore wittes without presumption may venture to speake to Parliaments.</note> and your Honours the more animate to deny your power to those, who now possiblie may crave to have it abused against us, without cause, beside numbers of pressing reasons, wherewith I doubt not every wise man amongst you is come well enough instructed by his owne conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and which I trust shall be further presented in plentie by these of our Nation, who have ever beene at the head of our affaires, whom God hath still enabled to cleare the justice and necessitie of all our proceedings hitherto, to the mindes of all, save our infatuat adversaries, whom superstition and rage hath blinded. If it might be your Honours pleasure, when all the rest hath ended, I could wish, that even unto me a little audience were given, my zeale to the truth of God, to the peace of this Isle, to the honour of our deare &amp; gracious Soveraigne, imboldneth me to offer even my little myte of information. This
<pb facs="11"/> is a period of time, when the obstinate silence of those who are most obliged by their places and guifts to speake, must open the mouth of sundrie, who are not by much so able; verie babes, yea stones must finde a tongue, when Pharisees deny their testimonie to <hi>Christ:</hi> Dumbe men will gett words when a Father, when a King, let be a whole Kingdome, by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of a few is putt in extreame perrill of ruine; An Asse will finde language when the devouring Sword of an Angell is drawne against the Master; Nothing more common then the speaches of very Oxen, before any calamity of the Common-wealth; The cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>iking of Geese did at a time preserve the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitoll; <hi>Amicla</hi> was lost by too much silence; The neglect of the voice of a Damosell, the contempt of Cassandraes warning, the casting of her in bands, for her true but unpleasant Speach, did bring the <hi>Troyane</hi> Horse within the walls, and with it the quick ruine both of the Cittie and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
   <p>I hope then that the greatnesse of my undertaking may purchase mee a little audience;<note place="margin">An offer deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a little au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> For I offer to make you all see with your own eyes, and heare with your owne eares the <hi>Canterburians</hi> to declare by their owne tongues, and write downe under their owne hands their cleare mindes, to bring into our Church <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> and compleet Poperie, and in our State a slaverie no lesse then <hi>Turkish.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If ye finde that I prove my offer, I trust I may bee confident of your wisedomes, that though <hi>Cicero</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, &amp; with him <hi>Demosthenes</hi> as a second, &amp; <hi>Orpheus</hi> with the enchantments of his tongue and harp, as a third marrow, should come to perswade, yet that
<pb facs="11"/> none of you shall ever be moved by all their oratorie, to espouse the quarrels of so unhappie men.</p>
   <p>If I faile in my faire undertaking, let me be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of temeritie, and no houre of your leasure be ever againe imployed, in taking notice of any more of my complaints; But till my vanity be found, I wil expect assuredly from your Honours one hearing, if it were but to waken many an able wit, &amp; nimble pen, in that your venerable House of Convocation; Numbers there, if they would speake their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, could tell other tales then ever I heard in an out-corner of the Isle, far from the secrets of State, and all possibilitie of intelligence, how many affaires in the world doe goe.</p>
   <p>It is one of the wonders of the world, how many of the English Divines<note place="margin">The silence of the English Divines is prodigious.</note> can at this time be so dumbe, who could well, if they pleased, paint out before your eyes with a Sun-beame all the crimes I speake off in that head &amp; members.</p>
   <p>It is strange that the pilloring of some few, that the slitting of <hi>Bastwick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

      </hi> and <hi>Burtowns</hi> nose, the burning of <hi>Prinnes</hi> cheeke, the cutting of <hi>Lightouns</hi> eares, the scourging of <hi>Lilburne</hi> through the cittie, the close keeping of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and the murthering of others by famine, cold, vermine, stinke, and other miseries in the caves and vaults of the Bishops houses of inquisition, should binde up the mouths of all the rest of the Learned. England wont not in the dayes of hottest persecution, in the very <hi>Marian</hi> times, to bee so scant of faithfull witnesses to the truth of Christ, wee can not now conjecture what is become of that Zeale to the true Religion, which wee are perswaded lyes in the heart of
<pb facs="12"/> many thousands in that gracious kirk; we trust indeed that this long lurking, and too too long silence of the Saints there, shall breake out at once in some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreths of trumpets and lampes, shining and shouting, to the joy of all reformed Churches, against the camp of these enemies to God, and the King; that quickly it may be so, behold I here first upon all hazards doe breake my pitcher, doe hold out my Lampe, and blow my trumpet before the Commissioners of the whole Kingdom, offering to convince that prevalent faction by their owne mouth, of <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> Poperie, and Tyrannie.</p>
