      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Airely disposed Friends: Since the world (of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques)
for custome-sake at least, would take it
else in scorne; it being growne so coy and squea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,
or, good City-Dame, so much affecting, as
we see, Court fashion, that with an oyly tongue shee must be
complemented with; otherwise in stead of courtesie nothing
but curiositie can be expected. Bowing therefore to, rather
then of singularitie offering to infringe her doted-on Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
customary proceedings, that <hi>Momus</hi> so might haue lesse
cause to carpe and mow at what he cannot mend, or <hi>Zoilus</hi>
to bite and snarle at it, by this importunity I yeeld to be thus
ceremonious, Preface-wise to salute a World of (some cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and capricious, no doubt, others more friendly) Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and thy selfe, perhaps, a more iudicious, and so lesse
supercilious Censurer: for satisfaction to such thy selfe, being
somewhat here is to be said of this ensuing Treatise; let mee
find fauour to be borne with, in speaking these few words,
more for fashion sake then else, of that thou knowest before, or
canst not but streight-waies collect, from the but viewing the
first Pages of this present Historie.</p>
   <p>Historie her <hi>Encomium</hi> needs not farre fetching, so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in our mouthes, the Life, Light, and Mistresse of
<hi>Prudence:</hi> Life of past; Light of present; Directresse of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
actions: memorizing Monument, and Trophey of the
worlds ages and minoritie; Glasse of Time; Historie so
conspicuous in it selfe, enueyled in the robes of Poesie, if
<pb facs="4"/>
worthily commendable, in many a famous forreine Nations
gests, I may well thinke it no wayes disallowable in our owne;
how-e're obscuritie like a <hi>Cymmerian</hi> night, hath ouer-clouded
the infancy of this our Iland! still bearing sway with most,
thereby yet prouing vs not degenerate in that, from our not
curious Ancestors, in conseruation of Antiquities, we quit as
little, if not lesse industrious to obserue and note the same!
when notwithstanding, with the enuious Mans, and curious,
our eyes gaze on our Neighbours ground, his manners, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
looking to our selues, neare home. We better skill the
warres of <hi>Troy</hi> and <hi>Thebes,</hi> with the <hi>Pharsalian</hi> fields, the halfe-feyned
fights of <hi>Hercules, Achilles Turnus, Hector</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
(I will not say of <hi>Amadis, Don Quixot,</hi> and such like) then as
Heroike, if not more warlike, and worthy to be renowned
martiall spirits of our owne; <hi>Danes, Saxons, Romans, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Brittons,</hi> and other noble Captaynes here at home; the
great <hi>Britannicus Caesars, Cassiuelane, Guider, Hengist, Arthur,
Egbert, Rollo, Alfred, Marcia's, Elfled's,</hi> and their equalls, as
truely glorious and worthy Wights, in this our Sea-encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past
little <hi>Bryttaine</hi>-World, as euer were those halfe-deified
and Pagan-sainted <hi>Heroes,</hi> of whose acts <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Hesiods,</hi>
the <hi>Mantuan</hi> and <hi>Theban</hi> Poets layes in that so famous and
triumphant wise resound! yet then I feare, we should not be
the true, plaine, downe-right, shall I say, or fantastique <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>-men,
if Apes, Toyes, Monkeyes, Parrots, and Baboones,
or yond-sea Owles, other Country-far-fetcht and new-fangle
fashions, were not more fancy-able to our braine-sicke hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and plausible to our nice palats, then wiser and better
obiects, more profitable and fitting matters, in staid and
setled iudgements, nearer concerning both our selues and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
home. Which being so, sans enuy be it spoken, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
our too generally corrupted iudgements, in applause
of any nouell monstrous (I might say Monsters) manners, as
more especially strangers gugawes, and to the present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
forreine stories neare or farre before our owne; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the same lie more vntrimd and trodden vnder foot; since,
what Scholers studie see wee? as nor Merchants traffique for
those things, how good so-e're, that are but seldome sought
for, want vent, and are not saleable. This yet, incited me the
more to trie new wayes, that Noueltie it selfe, and Nouelists
fancying fancie pleased, and others, the best at least, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Albion</hi> and her Worthies might by this meanes, at all
hands receiue some, though the meanest part of their true
lustre, due, ancient and deserued glorie.</p>
   <p>The ayme of this discourse, the full scope of our <hi>Bryttish</hi> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie,
so diuided, that according to the ten great Reall or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
changes of Estate, each seuerall Booke or Ode, from
such mutation, take their subiect and beginning in historicall
order, and from some partie of prime note, denomination;
the first treating of our first Founder <hi>Samothes</hi> and his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
called <hi>Samothes;</hi> the second <hi>Albion,</hi> of him chiefe actor
in the same; the third the <hi>Giants</hi> of their rude regiment; the
fourth named <hi>Brute,</hi> of his next stablishing a Kingdome; fift
<hi>Mulmutius,</hi> of his re-vniting the distracted Prouinces; sixt
<hi>Caesar,</hi> of his conquest, and the <hi>Roman Caesars</hi> gouernment;
the seuenth entituled <hi>Hengist,</hi> of his foundation of the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Heptarchy; eight <hi>Sueno,</hi> of his, and the then rapines and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of the <hi>Danes;</hi> ninth <hi>Gulielmus,</hi> of his <hi>Norman</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
tenth <hi>Iacobus,</hi> of him a plant of that pacifique Oliue,
fortunate Peace-maker, of famous memorie HENRY the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth;
now anew also planting peace, and vniting foure
Kingdomes; whose other stories on that occasion are briefly
there displayed. In all which passages, what is lesse lightsome,
or delightsome, impute it, if not to the obscuritie and harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the matter, to his weaknesse, that yet was and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
far as able, to giue all best contentment in that kinde.
That Poesie should shadow Historie, such <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, and
pleasant studie, I may hope to find out Patrons for protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as well as patterns, and those right ancient and worthy, for
imitation and excuse! What nouell is should not for nouelty
distaste; the <hi>English</hi> Poeme glosse to the stranger Idiome,
that speaks perhaps such barbarous States-matters, like our
<hi>English</hi> Lawes, but rude; the marginall notes seruing for il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration
to them both, supplying the defects, guiding and
supporting the course of Historie: other Annotations, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyses,
or Explications proposing order, pointing at method,
light and life of all discourse; as they cannot but yeeld some
profit, how-e're painefull and laborious to me, I wish to thee
as vsefull and commodious, not doubting then thy well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of the same! The Title, suiting to the Treatise,
<gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>-<hi>Albion,</hi> or <hi>Antiqua-Albion,</hi> should seeme to promise <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bions</hi>

   <p>Not censuring before thou reade; not reading with preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
opinions of thine owne or others; and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
all, before thou haue read all. As I shall
much expect such censure, and approue it; so
shall I most respect the Censurer! I
will not be so rash or harsh to say,
commend, or else come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend;
yet doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thus with
