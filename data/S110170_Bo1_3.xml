   <p>Now all good Ladds, to whose reading this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Jigge shall come, I would not haue ye mistake my meaning in the Song, that ye should goe about the streetes singing it, or chaunt it at her doore, ere she be by in a morning, No, God forbid, that would but breed domesticall disquietnesse, and if man and wife should happen to fall out about it, I (not knowing how neere the Tripe tub stands) might bring him in more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Can shot then I am aware of. Therefore I pray ye conceit it after my owne entending, that is, a Sorrowfull Sonnet for euery friend of his to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on least their fortunes should prooue so monstrous as his and they run into perill of hanging themselues, vpon so extraordinarie a conclusion.</p>

      <head>Heere followeth the rare atchieuement of the widdowe, from her house behinde the Shambles, how she was conuayed thence to London Bridge, and made a Bride vpon a very short warning.</head>
      <p>Yea marie Sir, now ye come to the matter I long
<pb n="13" facs="11"/>
to heare of, by reason of the diuers reports bruted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad thereof, and whether it were so heroycally acted, as some haue heard it from his owne lippes. Was it possible, that she (hauing such honest well willers and frends, at home at her house at dinner) could chuse no other time to slip away, but euen at such a time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to discredite her selfe? Was her coloured excuse to buy a bat and an apron, and falls it now out so that she bought a husband? O World full of falshood, O women most deceiptfull, when ye are least suspected. But went she then directly to the Bridge or no? No, she went not then thether, but one of her Sisters, counterfetting a sudden sicknesse, the other (beeing the fatter of the twaine) was made the instrument of fetching her to an intended Banquet: where wine walking lustely about, and manie merrie matters familiarly disputed on, it was set downe for an irreuocable determination, that no remedie, the Tripe-wife must dine next daye at her louers house. But it is wonderfull to speake on, with what zeale she paced thither, her apron in her hand all the way, which she had not so much leasure as to put on, but looked still behinde her, least she should bee caught vp for waight and fashion. We, as anie kinde heart in like case would doo, doubting her comming, because she had so often dissembled with others, trudges to her house: but happie did hee esteeme that lost labor, when at his returne backe againe he found her where he wold haue her.</p>
      <p>Now the Sisters lay on load for him, because hee had promised them large requitall: and how the tyme was wasted in conference, I know not, but wel I wot, home he would not let her goe that night, for now hee
<pb n="14" facs="12"/>
had her at such an aduatantage, as he neuer expected the like, if he should now let her scape.</p>
      <p>But in good sadnes they are much to blame, that say they whitled her with wine, and so (after some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceremonies theretoo belonging) drew a promise of marriage from her. It is verie unlike it should bee so, because that night before she went to bed, she prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted she would none of him. Oh, but the old dog beide sure: and though the man himselfe were somewhat ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, yet by good instructions he began to chere vp his spirites.</p>
      <p>Now you that be louers tell mee whether it were hot signe of loue or no, when the Widdowe (sitching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe by the fire) hee valiantly (coming behinde her) pulled her stoole from her, when downe fell she, and lie by or vpon her, with that learned and wittie aduerbe in his mouth, <hi>Keepe the widdow waking.</hi> Well, I know not whether these words are able to enhaunt or no, or what strength or vigor the manly acting of them hath: but either thorough them, or her late sitting vp that night she tooke such a surfet, that needes shee must to bed. And yet me thinkes that labour might full well haue been spared, because she had so little while to rest her selfe: and rising againe so early, it might bring manie a qualme ouer a wiser womans stomacke than hers.</p>
      <p>But would you imagine, a woman of her tender yeres, little aboue three score at the vttermost not dare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to aduenture on the water in the broad daye light, could so suddenly conceive such a hardie peece of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, as sooner-timely in a morning, to passe through his cellar, and so enter a boate lying readie for her, to
<pb n="15" facs="12"/>
sayle so farre as Pepper Alley, and there to S. <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> Church: where because the Church man was not readie, she must needes passe a larger circuite. But I can tell ye wherefore that was: marrie to stop theyr mouthes, that said she durst not be married by daylight, therefore she despised two a clocke in the morning: A figge for them that dare not be married at ten a clock in the forenoone, and afterward home to dinner of her owne prouison, brought thether the day before. Here was a cunning bob for the rest. Call ye him a foole or a simple fellow, that had the wit to compasse such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployt: Well masters, sit you at the vpper end of the table, kisse and snowtch the Widdow neuer so much: there is one sits nether most, hee hath an eye to his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and whatsoeuer you but barely hope for, hee is the man I tell ye, must carrie the wench away.</p>
      <p>Oh, but well fare the frend that made such hast for the license: few wooers are beholding to such a deere <hi>Damon,</hi> And not at that time onely did he stand him in some sted, but in the countrie likewise he stucke closely to him. If he reward him not well for his paynes, he is verie much too blame: for both his countenance and credite were no meane helpes to him. Hold him then the best string to your bow (Neighbour) in getting the Tripe-Wife.</p>
      <p>Thus haue I been as good as my word vnto you, my verie kinde and honest Neighbour, in sending you this briefe collection of your adventures: nor knowe I how to extoll sufficientlye your great deseruings, though iniquitie of time somewhat obscure your valor, reproach fully throwing this bone for you to gnawe on,
<pb n="16" facs="13"/>
that had your labour been bestowed in better sort, than for a basket of Tripes and Chutterlings: some one or other would haue spoken to our Antiquarie, to haue written foure lines at the least in praise of your passing proceeding. But seeing it is no better,</p>
      <lg>
         <l>Giue loosers leaue to prate their fill,</l>
         <l>The Tripes are thine both good and ill.</l>
         <l>What others say, take thou no care,</l>
         <l>Puddings and Tripes are chapmens ware.</l>
