   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE AND VER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVOVS, HIS SINGVLAR GOOD LADIE, THE LADIE IANE Vicountesse Mountague, all honour and happinesse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing perswaded (Right Noble Lady) by some friends, for publike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to make this colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of words common, which at first was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only for priuate vse, (as written in my youth, at the request of a worthy Gentleman, one whose loue preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led much with me) I could not find in heart to send it forth, no better furnished than with a bare Title; least like an vnknowne Infant, it should be exposed to ouer hard vsage, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture scornefully reiected, aduenturing abroad without countenance of any friend or commander. Vpon sure knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="3"/>
of your most honourable disposition, and former experience of your Ladyships fauour toward me, I am emboldned to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this little Pamphlet vnto your honour, with hope that by your Patronage it shall not onely be protected from iniuries, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so finde fauourable entertainment, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps gracefully admitted among greatest Ladies &amp; studious Gentlewomen, to whose reading (I am made beleeue) it will not proue altogether vngratefull. And although I may well be taxed of folly or presumption, that for credit of a slender trislle, craue the assistance of so eminent a person, yet such (I confesse) is my care thereof (since I must not deny it for my owne) and my duty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion so affected to your honour, and all yours; that I haue, (hoping of your Ladiships pardon) wilfully repelled all reasons which might disswade me, choosing herein not so much what may seeme most seemely, as what I suppose most behoouefull for me.</p>
   <p>Accept therefore I beseech your Honour, and receiue vnder your noble tuition this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vocabulary Treatise, which hauing beene many years restrained of liberty, is now glad of enlargement, especially recommended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so worthy a Patronesse. The glorious Sun
<pb facs="3"/>
loseth not the least point of his heighth by liberall lending downe his light, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with his influence the lowest creatures; neither is any eminency disgraced, that easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condescendeth to others desired good: which is also confirmed by the Poet, who saieth;
<q>
         <l>Conspicitur nunquam meliore potentia causa,</l>
         <l>Quàm quoties vanas non sinit esse preces.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Not thinking needfull therfore to trouble your Honour with many words of entreaty (vpon assured confidence of your wel known Charity and goodnesse) I conclude, sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wishing to your Ladiship, the best that may be wished, and resting my selfe euer.</p>
