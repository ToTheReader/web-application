<pb facs="4"/> thee, saies the Prophet to Edom. Now as it is a matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that may support our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in a wette seed-time, in a cold winter, in a darke night, that a joyfull harvest, a warme summer, a lightsome day <hi>will come,</hi> so it is matter of feare in a joyfull harvest, in a warme summer, in a bright day, that after these a wet, and a weeping seed-time, a cold and a pinching winter, a darke and a gloomy night <hi>may come.</hi> The time may come when wee may say, <hi>Loe the summer is past,</hi> the raines, and the cold are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<pb facs="4"/> and the <hi>shadowes of the evening stretched out</hi> may tell us that then <hi>the day goes away,</hi> and that wee may <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 4.</note> then say, <hi>Woe unto us.</hi> As this successive entercourse of conditions in the times of evill should keepe us from a fainting succumbency, and an umbesee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming despondency of spirit; so in the time when our mountaine seemes strongest, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts seeme to bee most setled, it should keepe us from security, and <hi>setling upon our lees.</hi> It is good to feare the worst in our best condition, and so to feare
<pb facs="5"/> the worst as to provide and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it. Though <hi>Iob</hi> had some probable grounds to say, <hi>I shall die in my nest,</hi> yet <note place="margin">
         <hi>Job</hi> 29. 18.</note> hee never so rocked and lulled himselfe asleepe with the conceite of a perpetuity of his prosperity, but that hee feared what might, and what did come. <hi>I feared</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Job</hi> 3. 25.</note>
      <hi>a feare, and it came upon mee, and that</hi> (saies hee) <hi>which I was afraid of, is come unto mee.</hi> He never so hoped in hope, but withall in his best estate hee feared a feare. Never any man on earth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a more glorious peace then
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Salomon</hi> did, and yet never any Prince that had, and made greater preparations for warre. <hi>Hee had dominion over all the Region on this side the River, and hee had</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 4 24, 25, 26</note>
      <hi>peace on all sides round about him, And Iudah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his Vine, and under his Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, from Dan to Beer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba, all the daies of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon. And Salomon had forty thousand stalles of Horses for his Charets, and twelve thousand</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>Horse-men.</hi> Here was great peace and safety, and yet great provisions against a danger that might happen. His wisedome is exemplary, and it is wisedome to follow it. Since all earthly felicities are mutable, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and calamities may come in their roome, it is singular wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as to foresee them, so to provide for comfort and safety in them. It was a wise speech of <hi>Crates</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> when hee forsooke <hi>Thebes</hi> after it was repaired, and so fortified: <hi>I</hi>

      <hi>need not,</hi> said hee, <hi>a City that Alexander or some</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>other may overthrow.</hi> He thought it a folly to trust to any City or hold for his safety, which might not bee able to withstand <hi>Alexanders,</hi> or another ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies power. That was the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pitch of his prudence and providence; and so farre should Christians goe, but must yet withall goe farther, not onely not to betrust their safety with any thing in a mans power, but to seeke their comforts and their safety in such an hold and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niment as is above the reach and power of an <hi>Alexander,</hi> or any other man. Such an hold,
<pb facs="7"/> and such a Tower there is to bee had. That's the gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Lord, that though hee will bring changes and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of our conditions, and turne our comforts into feares, yet hee will never put us into such feares, nor put us upon such streights, as that wee shall bee left comfortlesse or Towerlesse. Hee hath in the hardest, and worst that can befall us, provided us the <hi>Tower of his Name;</hi> to which, wee may runne, and to which if wee doe runne, wee shall finde succour and safety. So that looking upon godly and
<pb facs="7"/> righteous men, will a man say of them, as <hi>Balaam</hi> said when hee looked upon the Kenites, <note place="margin">
         <hi>Num.</hi> 24 21.</note>
      <hi>Strong is thy dwelling place, and thou puttest thy nest in a Rocke?</hi> And what ever sad condition then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall a Christian, what need his spirit bee perplexed, and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with feares? When hee hath put his nest in a rocke, why should any thing put his heart in a feare? But this is our folly, and our weakenesse, that God having provided us so strong a Tower as his Name is, that wee take not the advantage of the
<pb facs="8"/> strength of this Tower, that wee make no more hast unto, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. It is said of <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 11</note> that <hi>hee was a silly Dove without heart;</hi> and well it were if the same might not as truly be said of us. To be a Dove <hi>without gall,</hi> that's commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, but to bee a Dove <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heart,</hi> that is neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable nor safe. <hi>A rod,</hi> saies <hi>Salomon, is for him that is voyd of heart.</hi> That <note place="margin">
         <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 13.</note> man must needs lie open, and be exposed to the judgements of God that fall upon the world. A Dove-like, <hi>Innocency</hi> our
<pb facs="8"/> Saviour requires in us, <hi>Bee innocent as Doves;</hi> but a Dove-like <hi>sillinesse</hi> not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nor fearing the Fowlers nets and snares hee cautions against when hee requires a Serpentine wisedome. And yet the Dove is not so silly but when shee sees a danger, and is in feare of her enemy, <hi>she can dwell in the rocke,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ier.</hi> 48. 28.</note>
      <hi>and make her nest in the sides of the holes mouth.</hi> The Dove is not without heart, but in her feare and danger shee will seeke shelter in the Rocke. To get into
<pb facs="9"/> this Tower of Gods Name how would it settle and se▪<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cure our hearts, and quiet <note place="margin">Sub tecto Imbrem exaudire. Adag.</note> our spirits in the saddest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions? How good is it to heare the raine rattle upon the tyles when a man sits under the roofe? When <hi>Moses</hi> gave warning of that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full storme of haile and fire mingled with it, such of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> servants as feared the Word of the Lord, made their <hi>servants and cattell flie into their houses,</hi>

         </gap>1.</note> such as regarded not so faire warning left them <hi>abroad in</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/>
      <hi>the field.</hi> When the storme came, who were the wiser and the safer then? then both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties saw how good it was to bee housed in a storme. And what is an house to this Tower of Gods Name? when so much safety in an Egyptian cottage, what will the safety of a mans person, and the serenity of a mans spirit bee within the covert of so strong a Tower? But who shall bee the men that shall have the benefit of <hi>this Tower?</hi> Such as bee <hi>Gods friends.</hi> And who bee Gods friends?
<pb facs="10"/> Such as have their <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in heaven.</hi> They that have their <hi>conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heaven</hi> are the <hi>friends</hi> of the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and they that are the <hi>friends</hi> of God shall have the <hi>Name of God</hi> for their <hi>strong Tower.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that I have joyned these texts, and treatises toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one, they having such correspondence with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference each to other.</p>
   <p>And now (most Noble, and my much <hi>Honoured Lady)</hi> they comming forth
<pb facs="10"/> to publique view, I make so bold as to tender and present them to your <hi>Honour,</hi> as a publique testimoniall of my thankefulnesse to you. I must ever acknowledge mine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements unto you, such as transcend possibility of any retribution on my part, and must leave that unto him that can and will repay you seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold into your bosome. I must with all thankefulnesse to God acknowledge your Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in your favours, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and encouragement to mee in the worke and labour
<pb facs="11"/> of my Ministery. There is mention made in Scripture of <hi>Hezekiah's acts, and</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 32. 32.</note>
      <hi>his goodnesse.</hi> Acts, and goodnesse, that's a glorious commendation. Wee read of his father <hi>Ahaz,</hi> his <hi>Acts, and of all his waies, first</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 28, 26.</note>
      <hi>and last;</hi> but wee read of no <hi>goodnesse.</hi> They bee Acts, and Goodnesse, good Acts that make the Name sweete and Honourable. And what were <hi>Hezekiahs Acts and Goodnesse?</hi> I finde amongst other, two of speciall note, The one was that <hi>He encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged</hi>
      <pb facs="11"/>
      <hi>the Levites that</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30. 22.</note>
      <hi>taught the good know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord.</hi> His encouragement of the Levites was his Honour: there was an Act and Goodnesse, an Act of Goodnesse indeed. And in that Act of Goodnesse doth your Honour share with him. The other Act, and Goodnesse of his was that <hi>hee made a poole and a conduit, and</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 20.</note>
      <hi>brought water into the City.</hi> His purse was going for the benefit of others, and the good of many. And herein have you followed him

That the text points out one cause why <hi>Dorcas</hi> was raysed from the dead, namely that God out of compassion to the poore granted the life of that holy woman at the instance of their prayers. And if God at the instance of the prayers of
<pb facs="14"/> the poore whom shee had shewed mercy to, raised <hi>Dorcas</hi> from the dead, then how much more will hee at the prayers of the poore continue, and draw out their lives that doe draw out their bowels to the poore? It is certaine that God will have an eye for good over such as have had a good eye to the poore. He will bee a Tower to such in a time when a Tower will bee of greatest vse.
