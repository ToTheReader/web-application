   <p>This weake worke was intended your worthy Father now deceased, vnto whom so many bonds of alliance, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, of ancient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued beneficence so straitly tied, so deeply engaged me; and whom therefore next after mine Honourable Patron, and that Worshipfull Societie, wherein I spent so much time, and whereof I

For, to omit that God hath furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed you with some abilities of learning that he had not, that he hath called you sooner and entred you earlier, you haue the more day before you: Your worthy Father hath broken the ice to you, he hath laid you to your hand a good foundation of religious courses in that Familie that you are to be Head vnto hereafter; he hath setled neere you and obliged vnto you <note n="*" place="margin">M<seg rend="sup">•</seg> T.

gratious goodnesse you haue already made entrance into.

Let all laid together pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with you to make you as the more carefull to affect and embrace all good meanes of helpe and furtherance therein; so the more forward and diligent from time to time instantly and incessantly to craue further grace at his hands, by whose strength we all stand; who as he hath begun this his gratious worke in you, so is alone able to finish it (and I doubt not but he will so doe) to his owne glory in you, and your eternall glory with him. And to this purpose may this loose discourse afford you any the least helpe, I shall esteeme it a sufficient recompence of my labour in the publishing of it, what euer the issue be otherwise: If any other beside shall reape benefit thereby, I desire but that God may haue the praise of it, and my selfe onely their prayers. Howsoeuer it proue, it shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a testimonie of the sincere loue and respect that he beareth and oweth to you and the house you come of, who both is and shall by Gods grace alwayes continue</p>
