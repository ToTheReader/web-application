(most excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams) which draweth not
alone our Clime, but euen
all the Nations of Europe to
wonder; hath now diuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

and brought it forth in England, (thē a quiet fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-mother

since, sent it to me to apparrell in our English fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions,
desirous (for his sake whom it most ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth)
that it might principally do your Ladiships
seruice. It was when I receiued it, exceeding rich

in French imbroderie, and if nowe, either by my
want or dulnes, it seeme patch'd, or too homely:
with the beames of your gracious eyes, (most rare
creatures) shine vpon it, and then the worst of
my penns earthines doubtlesse shall be stellified.
Our Realme boasts not naturally of silkes, which
are gaudie and soone vanishe, but of her playne
broad-cloth, which is comlie and durable; if such
like be my <hi>Paraphras</hi> vpon this French ground, I
am all I would be, sith I desire nothing more then
to giue his liuing name Poets eternitie. To you is
due this tribute, and to you most humbly I tender
it, vowing to liue best pleased, when I am eyther
able, or can doe your Honours seruice: beeing (though a worme) as great an adorer of your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
as the mightiest whosoeuer.</p>
