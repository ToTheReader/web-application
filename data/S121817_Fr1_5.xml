      <hi>George Gascoigne, in the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of the noble Arte of Venerie.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>AS God himselfe declares, the life of man was lent,</l>
      <l>Bicause it should (with feare of him) in gladsome wise be spent.</l>
      <l>And Salomon doth say, that all the rest is vaine,</l>
      <l>Vnlesse that myrth and merie cheere, may follow toile and paine.</l>
      <l>If that be so in deede, what booteth then to buylde,</l>
      <l>High towers &amp; halles of stately port, to leaue an vnknown child?</l>
      <l>Or wherefore hoord we heapes of coyne and worldly wealth,</l>
      <l>VVhiles therwithall that caytif care, cōmes creeping in by stelth?</l>
      <l>The needie neighbors grudge to see the rychman thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>,</l>
      <l>Such malice worldly mucke doth breede in euery man alyue.</l>
      <l>Contention commes by coyne, and care doth contecke sew,</l>
      <l>And sodeine death by care is caught, all this you know is true.</l>
      <l>Since death is then the end, which all men seeke to flye,</l>
      <l>And yet are all men well aware, that <hi>Man is borne to dye,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>VVhy leade not men such liues, in quiet comely wise,</l>
      <l>As might with honest sport &amp; game, their worldly minds suffise?</l>
      <l>Amongst the rest, that game, which in this booke is taught,</l>
      <l>Doth seeme to yeld as much content, as may on earth be sought.</l>
      <l>And but my simple Muze, both myrth and meane mistake,</l>
      <l>It is a meane of as much mirth, as any sport can make.</l>
      <l>It occupies the mynde, which else might chaunce to muse</l>
      <l>On mischiefe, malice, filth, and fraudes, that mortall men do vse.</l>
      <l>And as for exercise, it seemes to beare the bell,</l>
      <l>Since by the same, mens bodies be, in health mainteyned well.</l>
      <l>It exercyseth strength, it exercyseth wit,</l>
      <l>And all the poars and sprites of Man, are exercisde by it.</l>
      <l>It shaketh off all slouth, it presseth downe all pryde,</l>
      <l>It cheres the hart, it glads the eye, &amp; through the ears doth glyde.</l>
      <l>I might at large expresse how earely huntsmen ryse,</l>
      <l>And leaue the sluggish sleepe for such, as leachers lust deuyse.</l>
      <l>How true they tread their steps, in exercises traine,</l>
      <l>VVhich frisking flings &amp; lightbraind leaps, may seeme always to staine.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="5"/>Howe appetite is bred (with health) in homely cates,</l>
      <l>VVhile Surfet sits in vaine excesse, &amp; Banquet breeds debates.</l>
      <l>How cries of well mouthd hounds, do counteruaile the cost,</l>
      <l>VVhich many a man (beyond his reach) on instruments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>ath lost.</l>
      <l>How setting of Relayes, may represent the skyll,</l>
      <l>VVhich souldiours vse in Embushes, their furious foes to kyll.</l>
      <l>How Foxe and Badgerd both, make patterns (in their denne)</l>
      <l>Of <hi>Plotformes, Loopes,</hi> and <hi>Casamats,</hi> deuisde by warlike men.</l>
      <l>How fighting out at Bay, of Hart, Bucke, Goate, or Bore,</l>
      <l>Declares the valiant <hi>Romains death,</hi> when might may do no more.</l>
      <l>How sight of such delights, doth scorne all common showes,</l>
      <l>Of Enterludes, of Tumblers tricks, of antikes, mocks, &amp; mowes.</l>
      <l>And how the nimble Hare, by turning in hir course,</l>
      <l>Doth plainly proue that <hi>Pollicie,</hi> sometime surpasseth force.</l>
      <l>The Venson not forgot, most meete for Princes dyshe:</l>
      <l>All these with more could I rehearse, as much as wit could wyshe.</l>
      <l>But let these few suffice, it is a <hi>Noble sport,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>To recreate the mindes of Men, in good and godly sort.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>A sport for Noble peeres, a sport for gentle bloods,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>The paine I leaue for seruants such, as beate the bushie woods,</l>
      <l>To make their masterś sport. <hi>Then let the Lords reioyce,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Let gentlemen beholde the glee, and take thereof the choyce.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>For my part (being one) I must needes say my minde,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>That Hunting was ordeyned first, for Men of Noble kinde.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>And vnto them therefore, I recommend the same,</l>
      <l>As exercise that best becōmes, their worthy noble name.</l>
