      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He first chapter of genesis declareth how that at the be gynnynge whan the water was now in his place, God sayde: Let the earthe brynge forth grene grasse and herbe, that beareth seede, and frutefull trees, that may beare frute euery one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his kynde &amp;c. Genesi, i. And so it came to passe. Afterwarde vpon the fourth daye made he lyghtes in the sirmamente of heauen: one greater lyght for the daye, &amp; a lesse for the nyght, namely the Sonne and the Mone, and made them to be tokens, and not to haue influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vpō these nethermost bodies, as the Philosophers &amp; oure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticatours haue wrytten hyther to, Contrary vnto it y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> god sayeth
<pb facs="3"/>
here, how that they shuld be vnto tokens, &amp; how that the earth was fruteful or euer the starres &amp; lygh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes were made.</p>
   <p>Now where as they shewe any thynge y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is his doynge, and not theyrs: he onely doth great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Psal. c. xxxv. he couereth the skye with cloudes, he prepareth rayne for the earth, &amp; maketh the grasse to growe vpon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes. Psal. c. xlvi. therfore are not they the cause of tempestes or stormes, nether of good wethers or frutefulnes in these nethermost creatures, whether it be in man, beest, or frute: but are tokēs only. For the which cause God doth oft warne vs in the lawe. Leuiti. xx. Deut. xviii. And in the prophetes Iere. xxvii. Esa. xlvii. y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we shulde regarde no heauen gaser, no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of starres, nor soythsayer
<pb facs="3"/>
because they haue no power to chā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge the tyme nor y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> course of heauen wherfore me thinke it a fooly she thinge, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we are so afrayed where no feare shulde be, and that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde so many vayne pronostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyons. why do not we rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyse, in so moche as all thinges are in Gods hand, and gouerned by Iesus Christe. Muste not all thinges be subdued vnto him. i. Cor. xv. Heb. ii. Can any creature of his, werke otherwise then he wyll haue it? Or how so euer they worke, do not al thynges turne to our best? No doute. Put thou thy trust then in god. and be sure, that as longe as he is thy frēde (which he hath promised to be if thou loue him &amp; his worde) ther cā nothyng harme the: And as for the plages y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> shal happē this yere vnto the per secuters and enemyes of Gods
<pb facs="4"/>
worde, (yf thou cleue vnto it) thou nedest not feare thē nor be afraide of thē: but certaynlye mayste thou loke to be pertaker not only of his outwarde blessinges this yeare, but of the toye for to come, whiche is euerlastynge.</p>
