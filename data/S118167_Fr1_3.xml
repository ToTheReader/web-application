   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD Reader, in seeking to shun
that Monster Idlenes, and hauing a
desire by all honest meanes possible,
to benefit this my natiue countrie of
England, and finding my abilitie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
insufficient to performe
the same, I haue thought good to set
downe some experiments that my selfe haue had concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
fish and fruite: of which two things, especially of
fruite, although many authors haue more learnedly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
yet many of them being strangers, inhabiting in Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
far differing from ours here in England, doe also
for the most part teach how such fruite as their countries
bring forth are to be vsed, of which kind of fruites here
in England we haue litle or no vse. As also concerning
fish, there are none that haue written in our vulgar tong
to anie purpose that euer I haue seene, sauing that one
Maister Churchey hath procured to be translated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
a Treatise compiled by a stranger, a Morauian (as
I take it.) Howbeit by reason the translator (as it should
seeme) had no great experience in that matter, he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that shall practise, shall find great want in that booke
to supplie his desires that way. Notwithstanding the good
indeuour of Maister Churchey is greatly to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
neither is my meaning herein to say what may be said
in these matters, but onely what things my selfe haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
and practised. And if I should set downe by way of
<pb facs="4"/>
preface, the exceeding great benefit that might grow to
this Realme, by practising to haue aboundance of the two
foresaid cōmodities, the preface would grow to a greater
volume then now the whole booke containeth. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I know that many men can say more then my self
can do herein, yet I also beleeue that most men know not so
much: for whose sake I haue compiled this litle trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
by which, if they take either profit or honest pleasure,
I haue my desire. Farewell.</p>
