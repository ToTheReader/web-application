   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bsence, among approoued frends
disseuers not affect, neither can
the change of aire chaunge resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
minds. In absence your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
toward me hath been appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
which I haue studied to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite,
but can no way equall: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles
abilitie shall not hinder
endeuour; but I will doo what I
may, whereby shall bee manifest
what I would. But least I seeme to call my credite in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
with you by too long circumstance (of which I assure
my selfe you make no doubt) I will leaue protestations, &amp; go
forward with my purpose. Sir, so it is, that in your late em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
about her Maiesties affaires, hauing left the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of <hi>Gerileon</hi> vnfinished, I chaunst to heare of a newe
part fully ended, by an excellent Scholler (I assure ye) as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
attained to the vnderstanding of <hi>As in praesenti.</hi> His ripe
wit, rare learning, and excellent Science, hath plentifully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
in sundrie inuented bookes of newes; wherein how
euer he hath audaciously abused sundrie well deseruing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages,
by attributing to them victories, when they at that
time came not neere the enemie; yet hath hee been liberally
rewarded (after six pence a sheete) of the Book-binder hys
Arch-workmaister. For this sea-swolne Sycophant, can no
sooner heare the thunder cracke, but he interpretes it to bee
the roaring of Cannons, the confusion of enemies, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
to the English. Then ouer his Kan of <hi>Canarie</hi> wine:
nay, soft and faire, his labour gets no such allowance; for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
truly, and in good sooth, ye see this world is hard, &amp; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
drink than Barley yeelds, cannot be spar'd. Yea, say ye so;
well, sith we are all English-men, let it bee so: and ouer hys
Ale-pot let him ruminate. Now, in such a month at <hi>Lisbone,</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
fire consumed so manie <hi>Hambrough</hi> ships of Corne; witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by them that in three yere b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>fore, neuer left the Realme
of <hi>England:</hi> them a valiant <hi>Suffolke</hi> Gentleman, (as indeede
he is) at such a sight tooke such a prize; at another, one so
rich, as it is almost incredible to report: when God knowes
the worthy Gentleman came home, and hardly had saued his
owne. Sundrie of these could I set downe, beside that paltry
rude ryme, wherein an honourable personage of this Realme
was so palpably abusde. But what cares hee? not a Barley
corne: for he calls himselfe a Canonier, and in the discharge
of pot-shot, cares not at whom he leuell, so he fasten on the
white, that by diminutiue degrees is drawen from the strings
of his Stationers purse. But I remember ye tolde mee once,
his newes-buyer is no Stationer, yet I am sure he is a Ballad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller,
and hath a whole Armie of runnagates at his reuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that swarme euerie where in <hi>England,</hi> and with theyr ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauld
songs infect the Youth of this flourishing Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.
I maruell who the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ell is his Printer: and but that
I am assured, it cannot bee done but by some mans helpe of
that profession, I should hardly be perswaded, that anie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
of so excellent a Science would bee so impudent, to
print such odious and lasciuious ribauldrie, as <hi>Watkins Ale,
The Carmans Whistle,</hi> and sundrie such other. But it may be,
there is some wainscot fac'd fellowe, that is abel to print no
good thing, found out to be his instrument: if it be so, it were
not greatly amisse, might my censure serue for a determinate
sentence, that he might dance at a Cartes tayle the Car-mans
whistle, till his backe were as well seasoned as his face. But
this belongs to higher powers: returne wee to our first man.
Who, how euer his credite may bee impayred by the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of vntrue newes, it hath not been a little recouered by
the exquisite Translation of Fortunes Defier <hi>Andrugio.</hi> For
this is to be prooued, he so followed his Author, that not the
best Scholler in the worlde can reprooue him of digression.
Indeed (as I take it) it was first written in broken English, &amp;
<pb facs="6"/>
so I am sure it is printed: for if he had not in some measure
the English tongue, he woul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> be vtterly mute. But here may
a question be mooued, if this that I affirme bee true; where
shall we haue <hi>Gerileon</hi> by him Englished, sith he vnderstands
not French? Why easely. Is it not a Fiction first deuised
in French? Yes So shall it be in English. Why tell mee, art
thou so impudent to abuse the worke of so noble a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
as the French Author was; wherein such excelent pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
such morrall prudence, such singular conceipted passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are included? Go too, let me not take thee publishing a
counterfet part thereof in print: if I doo, I will hang Saint
<hi>Peters</hi> Church Corner with such Scutchions of thy shame,
that <hi>Mannering</hi> musing what it should meane, shall neuer
cease bestirring him with his tip-staffe, till at Landen Hall all
the Ballad-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ingers be gathered into one Assembly; and there
in rime doggrell (like thy Winter bitten Epitaph) carroll thy
rude conceipts. But whether runne I? Let this bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
for a warning, and so wil I leaue him to the mercie of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wit. Beseeching you to proceede, as you haue begun in
that delectable Hystorie, which as it is much desired for the
delightfulnes therof; so shal you be no lesse commended for
your diligence therein.</p>
