   <head>TO THE CVRTEOVS AND <hi>well disposed Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing euerie way willing, though no waie able, out of my manie and manifold trauels to bring foorth some substantial and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious inuention for the auoiding of idlenesse, and relieuing the present misery, which the fortune of warres, together with the want of profitable labors hath brought vpon vs: I could not (on the sodaine) bethinke my selfe of a better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie, then how to imploy the poore and maimed persons of this land, who (hauing their hands only) might be sufficiently able to worke vp these sweet and profitable fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balles, for the benefit and pleasure of the rich. And as I haue alreadie in my booke of Remedies against famine, freely and plainly deliuered, sundrie new and cheape kinds
<pb facs="3"/>both of meate and drinke to bee vsed in a dearth of victuall; so if now in the scarsitie of fewel I may also proue so happy, as to bring forth a cheape and sauing fire to warme and cherish their cold and frozen limmes, with the recompence of their labours, I shall bee greatlie encouraged to deuote and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the fruits of some of my intermissiue houres vpon these and such like charitable and godly vses. But without all question if the rare and excellent spirits of this land, might haue their best inuentions by some act of Parliament priuiledged to thēselues for some reasonable time, with some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable part of the gaines reserued for the succour of the poore (a matter well moued of late, but crossed and swallowed vp, I know not how in the bare and naked word of <hi>Monopolies</hi>) I would not doubt, but though <hi>priuatum commodum</hi> be the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in euerie Artists intention (as it is in all manuall and mechanicall trades) yet that <hi>bonum publicum</hi> would also follow and flow abundantly in the execution and publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such ingenious deuises: out of which maine root manie large and plentifull bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb facs="3"/>of gainfull imploiments, for idle and vagrant persons, were by all probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence likely to arise and spring.</p>
   <p>In the meane time whilest these long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued fauours doe yet remaine rather to bee wished of all then hoped of anie, I haue thought good to kindle such a fire, as I hope ere long will blaze in his full brightnesse, both in the halles and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of diuers Noble men and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of this land, who finding the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene their former fires of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole, and this newe and sweete composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both themselues, and by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple also manie other persons of inferiour qualitie, will bee readie as well for their owne good, as for the reliefe of their poore and distressed neighbours (which almost in euerie place of this land are readie euen with teares &amp; prayers to craue either chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or emploiment toward the maintenance of themselues and their poore families) to giue all the best furtherance which they may, and that with all speedie and diligent expedition.</p>
   <p>And so hauing satisfied your long and
<pb facs="4"/>earnest expectation in this my new concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fire, I hope you will affoord me the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence which I am to require at your hands, which is nothing els but <hi>veniam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munere posco.</hi>
