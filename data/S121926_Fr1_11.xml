   <head>THE PREFACE, To those of the Romish CHVRCH.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Masters, who would discerne true coyne from that which is adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will not content himselfe with looking on the superscription, the stamp, colour, &amp; round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof, but going on a little farther, will come to the triall of the substance of the mettall, will take the touchstone, and draw thereon, to examine the goodnesse or insufficiencie thereof. Euen so to discerne true Religion from false, and to know the Church of Iesus Christ in this confusion of so many, that are like thereunto, we must not be contented with the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, which you call representatiue, but we ought to goe straight on to the onely Scriptures, which are the foundation and pillers of the true cause in matters that concerne Religion. And if we had stayed there, we should not see at this day such horrible confusions in Christendome, neither yet this mixture of cockle with good corne, and there would remaine nothing but pure wheat in the garnar and store-house
<pb facs="13"/>
of the Church. And would to God that some of the auncient Bishops could haue contented themselues with the marches established by the holy Ghost, the greatest part of the world should not now be wandering in the auncient pathes and footsteps of Gentilisme, against which the Apostles, and many other infinite numbers of the most excellent and worthie men haue foughten and obtained the victorie, through shedding of their bloud. Should not this exquisite ballance, square, and canon of the Scripture, this rule of right and veritie haue beene sufficient to teach vs whatsoeuer belongeth to the whole perfection of our beleefe? We ought not to haue beene ignorant of these beautifull markes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie: That there is no other proofe of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion but by the Scriptures, if any controuersie arise where to find the bodie, that is to say, the Church, that it ought not to be sought amongst our words, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his words who is the truth, and knoweth his bodie, to wit, Iesus Christ. It was thither that the Bishops should haue led the Gentils, to teach them to worship one onely God, to make them turne from their old superstitions and idolatrous customes, by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence whereof they haue beene forced to worship their false Gods and creatures, and should not haue giuen way to so many things, which are so farre from hauing any warrant in the holy Scriptures, that they are meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradictory thereunto. It is after this manner that it hath seemed good vnto the wisedome of man to iest and play with the high and holy mysteries of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; It is after this manner that thinking onely to winke at things, and that through tolerating of the lesser euill, to eschew greater inconuenience, this holy
<pb facs="13"/>
spring of Christian pietie hath beene infected by the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie mud of Paganisme, from whence those deludges haue proceeded, which haue ouerwhelmed some fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points of our saluation. And would to God that those zealous ones without knowledge had taught their Neophytes to thinke it abhomination, to suffer themselues to be led away by degrees vnto such things as at first seemed pleasant, we should not see at this day such pestilent doctrine, neither yet those superstitions and ridiculous ceremonies, which haue caused as well in times past as in these dayes, so many troubles in Christendome. But this is their reward, who haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to preferre the Church to the Scripture, and man to God, as if it were more expedient to find out the head by the proofe and testimony of the members, then the members by the testimonie of the head. I am exceeding sorie to consider, that when the time of appearing before the tribunall seate of God shall come, the damned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles shall know their markes and liueries on you, and that in great aboundance, as this present table of your conformities vnto their fashions and customes, shall clearely and faithfully beare record. But let vs exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how this filthinesse hath corrupted that beautie that was among you. Those poore Gentils, liuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Empire of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, when the Church of Christ was taking a little breath, and did enioy some peace and rest after so many persecutions and martyrdomes of her children, beganne to enter therein in great throng, and by multitudes. But how? hauing lately renounced the polluted slauerie of their Gods, of Gentilisme, of worshipping of images; and their feete being as yet foule with the dirt of their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries.
<pb facs="14"/>
And that which helped very much to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance those old ragges, was because they began to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Christian Religion, being well ripe in yeares, and full of gray haires, which was the cause why they could not so suddainely shake off such customes as they had sucked with their mothers milke. But behold here the very finall accomplishment of euill fortune, to wit, the conniuence of the greater part of the Bishops at such er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, who not hauing discouered a farre off such daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as might ensue and follow vpon this lenitie, and licence graunted by them, some more some lesse accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their humors, hauing tolerated these abuses, Paganisme tooke its owne place, and Gentilisme passed farre aboue that measure which was prescribed by the Oracles of God. They thought with themselues that they had laboured much for the aduancement of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, if at the first they could but onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert them from worshipping of their Gods, thereafter to send them vnto such Christian Saints as were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased: but this was nothing else but a changing of the name and not of the thing it selfe. They ought in the space of so many ages to haue found out some remedie for this disease: but in stead of abolishing and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these abuses, we see the same daily confirmed, yea, moreouer a farre greater encrease of this dirt and dregs of the Heathen, in lieu of the pure drop of true pietie and Christian simplicitie. Euen so farre are we from any hope to see the same reformed, sith the lesuits haue vndertaken at a set price to defend those errors, and haue published in their writs, that Christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may lawfully make vse of the ceremonies of the Gentils, which is as much as if one would say that God
<pb facs="14"/>
maketh vse of the Deuils lawes for the weale of his people. And thus it is that the Romish Church, establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by vnreasonable reasons, aduanceth in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner euen vnto this day, yea, and commaundeth and authoriseth euill customes in place of good lawes, and the reliques of Gentilisme in great plentie, in stead of the puritie of the Gospell. Your opinion was, that the spirituall kingdome of Iesus Christ should haue beene gouerned like the Monarchies of this world, whose ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers beare with many of their subiects faults, to the end that they may haue peace with strangers; but it is not so: for as touching so farre as directly concerneth the true knowledge of God, and of the puritie of his seruice, of the estate of the conscience, of the nature of Ecclesiasticall gouernment, we ought to haue recourse vnto the Canonicall bookes, and not vnto popular abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: they are the precepts of faith that ought to be layd open vnto the people, and not those preiudicate opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, coloured with deuotion, against which the holy Fathers haue foughten so couragiously. In the end, this little Treatise will declare vnto you how that your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is borded with those totters and rags of Gentilis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. God graunt you the grace to acknowledge the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie thereof, that you may depart from thence, and enter in league with her which is most beautifull, to wit, the Church wherein we liue, which is well pleased with such ornaments, as her spouse Christ Iesus our Sauiour hath giuen her, to whom be glory and honour for euer.</p>
