   <head>The Preface to the
READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>IVE me leave (good Reader) to informe thee by way of Preface,
of three points. The first concernes <hi>D. Potters Answere to Charity
Mistaken.</hi> The second relates to this <hi>Reply</hi> of mine. And the third
containes some <hi>Premonitions,</hi> or <hi>Prescriptions,</hi> in case <hi>D. Potter,</hi> or
any in his behalfe thinke fit to rejoyne.</p>
   <p>2. For the first point concerning <hi>D. Potters Answere,</hi>
      <note place="margin">A generall consideration of D. Potters Answere.</note> I say in
generall, reserving particulars to their proper places, that in his whole
Booke he hath not so much as once truly and really fallen upon the
point in question, which was, Whether both Catholiques and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
can be saved in their severall professions. And therefore <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
Mistaken</hi> judiciously pressing those particulars, wherein the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
doth precisely consist, proves in generall, that there is but one true Church; that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are obliged to harken to her; that shee must be ever visible, and infallible; that to separate
ones selfe from her communion is Schisme; and to dissent from her doctrine is Heresie, though
it be in points never so few, or never so small in their own nature; and therefore that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of points fundamentall, and not fundamentall, is wholy vaine, as it is applied by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.
These (I say) and some other generall grounds <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> handles, and out of
them doth cleerely evince, that any least difference in faith cannot stand with salvation on both
sides: and therefore since it is apparent, that Catholiques and Protestants disagree in very many
points of faith, they both cannot hope to be saved without repentance: and consequently, as we
hold, that Protestancy unrepented <hi>destroies Salvation;</hi> so must they also believe that we cannot
be saved, if they judge their own Religion to be true, and ours to be false. And whosoever dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guizeth
this truth, is an enemy to soules, which he deceives with ungrounded false hopes of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
indifferent Faiths, and Religions. And this, <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> performed exactly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that which appeares to have been his designe, which was not to descend to particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes,
as <hi>D. Potter</hi> affectedly does, namely, Whether or no the Roman Church be the only
true Church of Christ; and much lesse whether Generall Councells be infallible; whether the
Pope may erre in his Decrees common to the whole Church; whether he be above a Generall
Councell; whether all points of faith be contained in Scripture; whether Faith be resolved into
the authority of the Church, as into his last <hi>formall Object,</hi> and <hi>Motive;</hi> and least of all did he
discourse of Images, Communion under both kinds, publique service in an unknown Tongue,
Seven Sacraments, Sacrifice of the Masse, Indulgences, and Index Expurgatorius: all which and
divers other articles <hi>D. Potter</hi> (as I said) drawes by violence into his Book: and he might as well
have brought in Pope <hi>Ioan,</hi> or Antichrist, or the Iewes who are permitted to live in Rome, which
are common Themes for men that want better matter, as <hi>D. Potter</hi> was forced to fetch in the
aforesaid Controversies, that so he might dazle the eyes, and distract the mind of the Reader,
and hinder him from perceiving that in his whole Answere he uttered nothing to the purpose,
and point in question: which if he had followed closely, I dare well say, he might have dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his whole Book in two or three sheets of paper. But the truth is, he was loath to affirme
plainely, that generally both Catholiques and Protestants may be saved: and yet seeing it to be
most evident that Protestants cannot pretend to have any true Church before <hi>Luther,</hi> except the
Roman, and such as agreed with her, and consequently that they cannot hope for Salvation▪
if they deny it to us; he thought best to avoid this difficulty by confusion of language, and to fill
up his Book with points which make nothing to the purpose. Wherein he is lesse excusable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="2" facs="18"/>
he must graunt, that those very particulars to which he digresseth, are not fundamentall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
though it should be granted that they be errors, which indeed are Catholique verities. For
since they be not fundamentall, not destructive of salvation, what imports it whether we hold
them or no, for as much as concernes our possibility to be saved?</p>
   <p>3 In one thing only he will perhaps seeme to have touched the point in question, to wit, in
his distinction of points fundamentall, and not fundamentall: because some may thinke, that a
difference in points which are not fundamentall breakes not the Vnity of Faith, and hinders not
the hope of salvation in persons so disagreeing. And yet in this very distinction, he never speaks
to the purpose indeed, but only saies, that there are some points so fundamentall, as that all are
obliged to know and <hi>believe</hi> them explicitely, but never tells us, whether there be any other
points of faith, which a man may deny or <hi>disbelieve,</hi> though they be sufficiently presented to his
understanding, as truths revealed, or testified by almighty God; which was the only thing in
question. For if it be damnable, as certainly it is, to deny, or disbelieve any one truth witnessed
by almighty God, though the thing be not in it self of any great consequence, or moment; and
since of two disagreeing in matters of faith, one must necessarily deny some such truth; it clearly
followes that amongst men of different Faiths, or Religions, one only can be saved, though their
difference consist of divers, or but even one point, which is not in his own nature fundamentall,
as I declare at large in divers places of my first part. So that it is cleere, <hi>D. Potter</hi> even in this his
last refuge and distinction, never comes to the point in question, to say nothing that he himselfe
doth quite overthrow it, and plainly contradict his whole designe, as I shew in the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of my <hi>first Part.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>4 And as for <hi>D. Potters</hi> manner of handling those very points, which are utterly beside
the purpose, it consists only in bringing vulgar mean objections, which have been answered a
thousand times, yea, and some of them are cleerely answered even in <hi>Charity Mistaken;</hi> but he
takes no knowledge at all af any such answeres, and much lesse doth he apply himselfe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
them. He alleadgeth also Authors with so great corruption and fraud, as I would not have
believed, if I had not found it by cleere, and frequent experience. In his second <hi>Edition,</hi> he hath
indeed left out one or two grosse corruptions, amongst many others no lesse notorious, having as
it seemes been warned by some friends, that they could not stand with his credit: but even in this
his second <hi>Edition</hi> he retracts them not at all, nor declares that he was mistaken in the <hi>First,</hi> and
so his reader of the first <hi>Edition</hi> shall ever be deceived by him, though withall he read the <hi>Second.</hi>
For preventing of which inconvenience, I have thought it necessary to take notice of them, and
to discover them in my <hi>Reply.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>5. And for conclusion of this point I will only say, that <hi>D. Potter</hi> might well have spared
his paines if he had ingeniously acknowledged, where the whole substance, yea and sometime
the very words and phrases of his book may be found in farre briefer manner, namely, in a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
of <hi>D. Vshers</hi> preached before our late soveraigne Lord <hi>King Iames</hi> the 20. of Iune 1624. at
<hi>Wansted,</hi> containing <hi>A Declaration of the Vniversality of the Church of Christ, and the Vnity
of Faith, professed therein,</hi> which Sermon having been roundly and wittily confuted by a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Divine, under the name of <hi>Paulus Veridicus,</hi> within the compasse of about 4. sheets of
Paper, <hi>D. Potters Answere to Charity Mistaken</hi> was in effect confuted before it appeared. And
this may suffice for a generall Censure of his Answere to <hi>Charity Mistaken.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>6 For the second, touching my <hi>Reply:</hi> if you wonder at the Bulke thereof, compared either
with <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Concerning my Reply.</note> or <hi>D Potters Answere,</hi> I desire you to consider well of what now I am
about to say, and then <hi>I</hi> hope you will see, that I was cast upon a meere necessity of not being
so short, as otherwise might peradventure be desired. <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> is short I grant, and yet
very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ull, and large, for as much as concerned his designe, which you see was not to treat of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Controversies in Religion, no not so much as to debate, whether or no the Roman
Church be the only true Church of Christ, which indeed would have required a larger Volume,
as I have understood there was one then comming forth, if it had not bee prevented by the
Treatise of <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> which seemed to make the other intended worke a little lesse sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
at that time. But <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> proves only in Generall out of some Vniversall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
well backed and made good by choice &amp; solid authorities, that of two disagreeing in points
of Faith, one only without repentance can be saved; which ayme exacted no great bulk. And
as for <hi>D. Potters Answere,</hi> even that also is not so short as it may seem. For if his marginall notes
printed in a small letter were transferred into the Text, the Book would appear to be of some
bulk: though indeed it might have been very short, if he had kept himselfe to the point treated by
<hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> as shall be declared anon. But contrarily, because the question debated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> and <hi>D. Potter,</hi> is a point of the highest consequence that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and in regard that there is not a more pernitious Heresy, or rather indeed ground of Atheisme,
then a perswasion that men of different Religions may be saved, if otherwise forsooth they lead a
kind of civill and morall life: I conceaved, that my chief endeavour was not to be employed in
answering <hi>D Potter,</hi> but that it was necessary to handle the Question it selfe somewhat at large,
and not only to prove in generall, that both Protestants and Catholikes cannot be saved; but to
shew also, that Salvation cannot be hoped for out of the Catholique Roman Church; and yet
withall, not to omit to answere all the particulars of <hi>D. Potters</hi> Book which may any way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="3" facs="18"/>
To this end I thought it fit, to divide my <hi>Reply</hi> into <hi>two Parts;</hi> in the formet whereof, the
main question is handled by a continued discourse without stepping aside to confute the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of <hi>D. Potters Answere,</hi> though yet so, as that even in this first <hi>Part,</hi> I omit not to answere
such passages of his, as I find directly in my way, and naturally belong to the points whereof I
treat: and in the second <hi>Part</hi> I answere <hi>D. Potters</hi> Treanse, <hi>Section</hi> by <hi>Section,</hi> as they lye in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
I heer therefore intreat the Reader, that if heartily he desire satisfaction in this so important
question, he doe not content himselfe with that which I say to <hi>Doctor Potter</hi> in my second <hi>Part,</hi>
but that he take the <hi>First</hi> before him, eyther all, or at least so much as may serve most to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of being satisfied in those doubts which presse him most. For which purpose I have caused
a Table of the Chapters of the first <hi>Part,</hi> together with their Titles and Arguments, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
before my Reply.</p>
   <p>7. This was then a chiefe reason why I could not be very short. But yet there wanted not
also divers other causes of the same effect. For there are so severall kinds of Protestants through
the difference of Tenets which they hold, as that if a man convince but one kind of them, the
rest will conceive themselves to be as truly unsatisfied, and even unspoken to, as if nothing had
been said therein at all. As for example, some hold a necessity of a perpetuall visible Church, and
some hold no such necessity. Some of them hold it necessary to be able to prove it distinct from
ours; and others, that their businesse is dispatched when they have proved ours to have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
visible: for then they will conceive that theirs hath been so: &amp; the like may be truly said of
very many other particulars. Besides it is <hi>D. Potters</hi> fashion, (wherein as he is very far from being
the first, so I pray God he prove the last of that humour) to touch in a word many triviall old ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
which if they be not all answered, it will, and must serve the turne, to make the more
ignorant sort of men believe, and brag, as if some maine unanswerable matter had been subtily
and purposely omitted; and every body knowes that some objection may be very plausibly made
in few words, the cleere and solid answere whereof will require more leaves of paper the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> one.
And in particular <hi>D. Potter</hi> doth couch his corruption of Authors within the compasse of so few
lines, and with so great confusednesse and fraud, that it requires much time, paines, and paper
to open them so distinctly, as that they may appear to every mans eye. It was also necessary to
shew, what <hi>D. Potter</hi> omits in <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> and the importance of what is omitted, and
sometimes to set down the very words themselves that are omitted, all which could not but adde
to the quantity of my <hi>Reply.</hi> And as for the <hi>quality</hi> thereof, I desire thee (good Reader) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that whereas nothing is more necessary then books for answering of books: yet I was so ill
furnished in this kind, that I was forced to omit the examination of divers Authors cited by <hi>D.
Potter,</hi> meerely upon necessity; though I did very well perceive by most apparant circumstances,
that I must probably have been sure inough to find them plainly misalleadged, and much wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and for the few which are examined, there hath not wanted some difficulties to doe it. For
the times are not for all men alike; and <hi>D. Potter</hi> hath much advantage therein. But truth is
truth, and will ever be able to justify it self in the midst of all difficulties which may occurre. As
for me, when I alledge Protestant Writers as well domesticall as forraine, I willingly and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
acknowledge my selfe obliged for divers of them to the author of the Book entituled, <hi>The
Protestants Apology for the Roman Church,</hi> who calls himselfe <hi>Iohn Brerely,</hi> whose care, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and fidelity is so extraordinary great, as that he doth not only cite the Bookes, but the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
also, with the place and time of their printing, yea and often the very page, and line where
the words are to be had. And if you happen not to finde what he cites, yet suspend your judgment,
till you have read the corrections placed at the end of his book; though it be also true, that after
all diligence and faithfulnesse on his behalfe, it was not in his power to amend all the faults of
the print: in which prints we have difficulty enough for many evident reasons, which must needs
occur to any prudent man.</p>
   <p>8. And for asmuch as concernes the manner of my <hi>Reply,</hi> I have procured to doe it without
all bitternesse, or gall of invective words, both for as much as may import either Protestants in
generall, or <hi>D. Potters</hi> person in particular; unles, for example, he will call it bitternesse for me
to terme a grosse impertinency, a <hi>sleight,</hi> or a <hi>corruption,</hi> by those very names, without which I
doe not know how to expresse the things: and yet therein I can truly affirme that I have studied
how to deliver them in the most moderate way, to the end I might give as little offence as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
I could, without betraying the Cause. And if any unfit phrase may peradventure have escaped
my pen (as I hope none hath) it was beside, and against my intention, though I must needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that <hi>D. Potter</hi> gives so many and so just occasions of being round with him, as that perhaps
some will judge me to have been rather remisse, then moderate. But since in the very title of my
<hi>Reply</hi> I professe to <hi>maintaine Charity,</hi> I conceive that the excesse will be more excusable amongst
all kinds of men, if it fall to be in mildnesse, then if it had appeared in too much zeale. And if
<hi>D. Potter</hi> have a mind to charge me with ignorance or any thing of that nature, I can, and will
ease him of that labour, by acknowledging in my selfe as many and more personall defects, then
he can heap upon me.<note place="margin">Rules to be observed if <hi>D. Potter</hi> intend a Rejoynder.</note> Truth only and syncerity I so much valew and professe, as that he shall
never be able to prove the contrary in any one least passage or particle against me.</p>
   <p>9. In the third and last place, I have thought fit to expresse my selfe thus. If <hi>D. Potter,</hi> or
any other resolve to answere my <hi>Reply▪</hi> I desire that he will observe some things which may tend
<pb n="4" facs="19"/>
to his owne reputation, the saving of my unnecessary paines, and especially to the greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of truth. I wish then that he would be carefull to consider, wherein the point of every diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
consists, and not impertinently to shoot at Rovers, and affectedly mistake one thing for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
As for example, to what purpose (for as much as concernes the question betweene <hi>D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi>) doth he so often and seriously labour to proue, that faith is not resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the authority of the Church, as into the formall <hi>Obiect</hi> and <hi>Motive</hi> thereof? Or that all
points of Faith are contained in Scripture? Or that the Church cannot make new Articles of
Faith? Or that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it signifies that particular Church or Diocesse, is not all one
with the universall Church? Or that the Pope as a private Doctor may erre? With many other
such points as will easily appeare in their proper places. It will also be necessary for him not to put
certaine Doctrines upon us, from which he knowes we disclaime as much as himselfe.</p>
   <p>10 I must in like manner intreat him not to recite my reasons and discourses by halfes, but
to set them down faithfully and entirely, for as much as in very deed concernes the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the thing in question; because the want sometime of one word, may chance to make
void, or lessen the force of the whole argument. And I am the more solicitous about giving this
particular caveat, because I finde how ill he hath complied with the promise which he made in his
Preface to the Reader, not to omit <hi>without answere any one thing of moment in all the discourse
of Charity Mistaken.</hi> Neither will this course be a cause that his <hi>Reioynder</hi> grow too large, but it
will be occasion of brevity to him, and free me also from the paines of setting downe all the words
which he omits, and himselfe of demonstrating that what he omitted was not materiall. Nay I
will assure him, that if he keep himselfe to the point of every difficulty, and not weary the Reader,
and overcharge his margent, with unnecessary quotations of Authors in Greek and Latin, and
sometime also in Italian and French, together with proverbs, sentences of Poets, and such gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
stuffe, nor affect to cite a multitude of our Catholique Schoole divines to no purpose at
all; his Book will not exceed a competent size, nor will any man in reason be offended with that
length which is regulated by necessity. Againe before he come to set downe his answere, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his Arguments, let him consider very well what may be replied, and whether his own obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
may not be retorted against himselfe, as the Reader will perceiue to haue hapned often to
his disadvantage in my <hi>Reply</hi> against him. But especially I expect, and Truth it selfe exacts at his
hand, that he speak cleerly and distinctly, and not seek to walk in darknesse, so to delude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
his Reader, now saying, and then denying, and alwaies speaking with such ambiguity, as that
his greatest care may seeme to consist in a certaine art to find a shift, as his occasions might chance,
either now, or heereafter to require, and as he might fall out to be urged by diversity of severall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
And to the end it may appear, that I deale plainely, as I would haue him also doe, I
desire that he declare himselfe concerning these points.</p>
   <p>11 First, whether our Saviour Christ haue not alwaies had, and be not ever to haue a visible
true Church on earth: and whether the contrary doctrine be not a damnable Heresy.</p>
   <p>12 Secondly, what visible Church there was before <hi>Luther,</hi> disagreeing from the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, and agreeing with the pretended Church of Protestants.</p>
   <p>13 Thirdly, Since he will be forced to grant that there cā be assigned no visible true Church
of Christ, distinct from the Church of Rome, and such Churches as agreed with her when <hi>Luther</hi>
first appeared, whether it doe not follow that shee hath not erred fundamentally; because every
such errour destroies the nature and being of the Church, and so our Saviour Christ should haue
had no visible Church on earth.</p>
   <p>14 Fourthly, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did not fall into any fundamentall errour, let him tell us
how it can be <hi>damnable</hi> to liue in her Communion, or to maintaine errours, which are knowne
and confessed, not to be fundamentall, to <hi>damnable.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>15 Fiftly, if her Errours were not damnable, nor did exclude salvation, how can they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
from <hi>Schisme,</hi> who forsooke her Communion upon pretence of errours, which were not
damnable.</p>
   <p>16 Sixtly, if <hi>D. Potter</hi> haue a minde to say, that her Errours are damnable, or fundamentall,
let him doe us so much charity, as to tell us in particular what those fundamentall errours be. But
he must still remember (and my selfe must be excused, for repeating it) that if he say the Roman
Church erred fundamentally, he will not be able to shew, that Christ our Lord had any visible
Church on earth, when <hi>Luther</hi> appeared: and let him tell us how Protestants had, or can haue
any Church which was universall, and extended her selfe to all ages, if once he grant, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church ceased to be the true Church of Christ; and consequently how they can hope for
Salvation, if they deny it to us.</p>
   <p>17 Seaventhly, whether any one Errour maintained against any one Truth, though never so
small in it selfe, yet sufficiently propounded as testified or revealed by almighty God, doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Nature and Vnity of Faith, or at least is not a grievous offence excluding Salvation.</p>
   <p>18 Eightly, if this be so, how can <hi>Lutherans, Calvinists, Zuinglions,</hi> and all the rest of disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
Protestants, hope for salvation, since it is manifest that some of them must needs erre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
some such truth as is testified by almighty God, either fundamentall, or at least not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall.</p>
   <p>19 Ninthly, we constantly urge, and require to haue a particular Catalogue of such points as
<pb n="5" facs="19"/>
he calls fundamentall▪ A Catalogue, I say, in <hi>particular,</hi> and not only some generall definition, or
description, wherein Protestants may perhaps agree, though wee see that they differ when they
come to assigne what points in particular be fundamentall; and yet upon such a particular Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
much depends: as for example in particular, Whether or no a man doe not erre in some
point fundamentall or necessary to salvation; and whether or no <hi>Lutherans, Calvinists,</hi> and the
rest doe disagree in fundamentalls, which if they doe, the same Heaven cannot receiue them all.</p>
   <p>20 Tenthly, and lastly, I desire that in answering to these points, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he would let us knowe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
what is the doctrine of the Protestant English Church concerning them, and what he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
only as his owne private opinion.</p>
   <p>21 These are the Questions which for the present I finde it fit and necessary for me to aske
of <hi>D. Potter,</hi> or any other who will defend his cause, or impugne ours. And it will be in vaine to
speake vainely, and to tell me, that a Foole may aske mere questions in an houre, then a wise man
can answer in a yeare; with such idle Proverbs as that. For I aske but such questions as for which
he giues occasion in his Book, and where he declares not himselfe but after so ambiguous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
a manner, as that▪ Truth it selfe can scarce tell how to convince him so, but that with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and ill-judging men he will seeme to haue somewhat left to say for himselfe, though Papists
(as he calls them) and Puritans should presse him contrary waies at the same time: and these que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
concerne things also of high importance, as whereupon the knowledge of Gods Church,
and true Religion, and consequently Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ation of the soule depends. And now because hee shall
not taxe me with being like those men in the Gospell, whom our blessed Lord and Saviour char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with laying heavy burdens upon other mens shoulders, who yet would not touch them with
their finger▪ I oblige my selfe to answer upon any demand of his, both to all these Questions, if
he finde that I haue not done it already, and to any other, concerning matter of faith that he shall
aske. And I will tell him very plainely, what is Catholique doctrine, and what is not, that is, what
is defined or what is not defined, and rests but in discussion among Divines.</p>
   <p>22 And it will be here expected, that he performe these things, as a man who professeth lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
should doe, not flying from questions which concerne things as they are considered in their
owne nature, to accidentall, or rare circumstances of ignorance, incapacity, want of meanes to be
instructed, erroneous conscience, and the like, which being very various and different, cannot bee
well comprehended under any generall Rule. But in delivering generall doctrines we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
things as they be <hi>ex natura rei, or per. se loquendo</hi> (as Divines speak) that is, according to
their natures, if all circumstances concu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>re proportionable thereunto. As for example some may
for a time haue invincible ignorance, even of some fundamentall article of faith, through want of
capacity, instruction, or the like, and so not offend either in such ignorance or errour, and yet we
must absolutely say, that errour in any one fundamentall point is damnable, because so it is, if we
consider things in themselues, abstracting from accidentall circumstances in particular persons: as
contrarily if some man judge some act of vertue, or some indifferent action to be a sinne, in him it
is a sinne indeed, by reason of his erroneous conscience; and yet we ought not to say absolutely,
that vertuous, or indifferent actions are sinnes: and in all sciences we must distinguish the generall
Rules from their particular Exceptions. And therefore when, for example, he answers to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
whether he hold that Catholiques may be saved, or whether their pretended errours be
fundamentall and damnable, he is not to change the state of the question, and haue recourse to
Ignorance, and the like, but to answer concerning the errours being considered what they are apt
to be in themselues, and as they are neither increased nor diminished, by accidental circumstances.</p>
   <p>23 And the like I say of all the other points, to which I once againe desire an answere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any of these, or the like ambiguous termes, <hi>in some sort, in some sense, in some degree,</hi> which
may be explicated afterward as strictly or largely as may best serue his turne; but let him tell vs
roundly and particularly, in what sort, in what sense, in what degree he understands those, &amp; the
like obscure mincing phrases. If he proceed solidly after this manner, and not by way of meere
words, more like a Preacher to a vulgar Auditor, then like a learned man with a pen in his hand,
thy patience shall be the lesse abused, and truth will also receiue more right. And since we haue
already laid the grounds of the question, much may be said hereafter in few, words, if (as I said)
he keep close to the reall point of every difficulty without wandring into impertinent disputes,
multiplying vulgar and threed-bare objections and arguments, or labouring to prove what no
man denies, or making a vaine oftentation by citing a number of Schoolemen, which every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uny
brought up in Schooles is able to doe; and if he cite his Authors with such sincerity, as no time
need be spent in opening his corruptions, and finally if he set himselfe a worke with this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that we are to giue a most strict accompt to a most just, and unpartiall Iudge, of every period,
line, and word that passeth under our pen. For if at the latter day we shall be arraigned for every
idle word which is spoken, so much more will that be done for every idle word which is written,
as the deliberation wherewith it passeth makes a man guilty of more malice, and as the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the matter which is treated of in bookes concerning true faith and religion, without
which no Soule can be saved, makes a mans Errours more materiall, then they would be, if questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
were but of toyes.</p>
