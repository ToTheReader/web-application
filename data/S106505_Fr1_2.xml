      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, I know not how you will take this presumptiō of mine, in venturing so farre vppon your manifold fauours, as to defende my poore paynes by your names prerogatiue: If
<pb facs="3"/> well accepted, I haue all I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, if otherwise, good will was the offender, and your self being a Iudge, censure him with what penaltie it shall please you to appoint him.</p>
   <p>Concerning this present worke, let it eyther condemne or commend it selfe: for great words cannot better it, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling speeches impayre t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e worth of it: Gold is tryed by the touch, good bookes by their worth, and the wise are not so skilfull in the one, but iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment makes them as capable of the other.</p>
   <p>But these harsh times are become the greatest enemies to Schollers, for eyther enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous detraction intrudes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb facs="3"/> to disgrace them, or grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple niggardl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>nesse beares the purse to regarde them: So that the giuing of bookes, is now tearmed but beggerie, &amp; the requiting of serious stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies feeles no taste of liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
   <p>Thus falles it out with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of good wittes, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their great paynes to bee slenderly regarded, and their long lingred hopes in the end quite frustrated: are compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to harder extremities then fitteth their deserts, or stands with the credit of such thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse men to suffer them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
   <p>Therefore most fortunate may I tearme my selfe, that
<pb facs="4"/> neuer yet happened to meete with such an iron nature: but fearing least I should, I am the bolder to shelter my selfe still vnder your worshipful fauour, a most liberall father and friende to the learned, and one that suffers not the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est mans paines to passe vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited.</p>
   <p>To you I giue this little labour of a farre greater loue, and to her (whome God hath blest you with all) some porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: As God hath lincked yee together not to bee deuided, so ioyntly take betweene yee this true testimony of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and God make it as pleasing to you both in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as (though it cost me som
