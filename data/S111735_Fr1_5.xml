   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous reader, diuers of my frendes
(that haue obserued, my former readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
in exposing the liues and vertues, of
many worthy personages deceased, that
their good examples might liue, in the
imitation of their posteritie) have char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me to be to remisse, in setting forth
the life, death, and vertues, of the most learned, right vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
&amp; best beloued gentleman, Sir Phillip Sidney Knight.
But I satisfied my frendes, with this reason that I certifie
vnto the generall reader, <hi>vid.</hi> that the error that I sawe
some hasty writers to commit, for lacke of true instructiō,
and the iniurie that they did, vnto so worthy a gentleman,
in publishing his History, not hauing knowledge of the
one halfe of his vertues, (to shunne the blame of two such
capitall wronges,) moued me, to be headfull, that I publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
nothing but truth of so true a Knight. Frō this feare,
through zeale proceeded my slownes in writing, which
cannot come to late, when good Sir Phillip Sidney liueth
euer. And for the comfort of those that loued him, or
would be like vnto him, I further say, that the imitation of
his vertues, will eternize their praises, whether they liue
long, or die soone: for vertue is immortal. Thus wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the wish of al good desiers to the frendly
reader I ende, commending vnto the
same my ready seruice.</p>
