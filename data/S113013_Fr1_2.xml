      <hi>To the Right woorshipful, SIR EDWARD PARHAM Knight, Seriant Major of the Regiment of the Right honorable The LORD VAVX, in the seruice of the King of</hi> Spayn <hi>in the</hi> Netherlandes.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N my late passage down from London to Graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send by Tiltboat, there chanced among others, two gentlemen at that present also to pas, beeing both of millitarie profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but differently disposed in their determinations touching the sides they went to serue on, for after some
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
course of speech that passed among the compagnie: the one discouered his intentiō to go ouer into the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes</hi> to serue the King of <hi>Spayn,</hi> and the other manifested his purpose to go to serue the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> but because each of them seemed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed with reason for his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to think himself as wel able to defend it as hee seemed willing to follow it, all the compagnie out of a curiositie weare verie desyrous to heare what by either could be sayd, but yet with a prouiso that no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience or falling out between them vpon it might ersue, and therefore they desyred them, that before they
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
began seriously to argue the matter, they should pas their woordes to each other vpon their honors, that without iniurying one another in particular, each might haue his free speech, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his own determined cours, &amp; that their argunig beeing ended, their should no exceptions be taken, either by them or anie of the compagnie, for oght that had bin spoken, but that both they &amp; all the rest of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnie (their discours beeing ended) should in ciuil and courteous manner carrie themselues, &amp; so take their leaues of each other, when their wayes lay to bee seperated.</p>
   <p>To this all agreed, and these
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
twdyn gaue each other their handes, vpon the conditions, &amp; there vpon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan between them a Toung-combat, wherein neither of both were slayn or maymed, and because it may bee some recreation vnto you to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how the matter passed, I thoght good now at my soonest leasure, &amp; as wel as my memorie would permitt mee, to penne it down, &amp; to present it vnto your view, to whome I hold my best endeuours obliged, &amp; thus kissing your handes I take my leaue, wishing vnto you the atchyving of all honor, answerable vnto your noble valour and courage.</p>
