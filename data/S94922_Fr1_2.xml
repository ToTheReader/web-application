      </gap>uch as set forth bookes to the viewe of the world, which passe vnder the protection of noble perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages (besides the dread of offending wise men) I should run into one of these three errours, either to praise your H. and W. by adulation, praise my selfe by ostentation, or praise my worke by seeking to bring men into admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. I purpose none of all these The first I leaue, least my wordes should empaire your worthines. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, I refrain, because I find nothing in my self which can deserue praise. The third I will avoide, for if my labor hath bene so wel imployed, as it may please you right H. and W it is able enough to praise it selfe. I therefore present these my three bookes of Diuinitie, Philosophie, and Poetrie (comprized together in one volume) vnto you three right H. and W. (who are linked &amp; vnited together in an indissoluble band of amitie &amp; fraternitie) humbly requesting that you will countenance thē with fauour, &amp; patronage them by your authoritie, that therby they may eschew the reproches of malitious tongues, and bleare the enuious eies of such as prie at other mens faultes in the water, which cause things seeme big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then they be, but regard their owne faultes, as through small nets, which cause things to seeme lesse. In so doing, you shall giue me cause to reioice in my trauell, and occasion by thankfulnes to acknowledge my bounden duetie. Thus leauing your Honour and Worships to the direction of the Almightie, I cease, referring my selfe to your good opinions.</p>
