      <hi>TO THE RIGHT WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull M. Iohn Hutton Esquier, George</hi> Gifford wisheth health and increase of worship.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is more then halfe a yeare (Right Worshipfull) since I handled this Parable of the Sower, in a Sermon at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Being instantly vrged by a friend which heard me, to put it in writing, although I was very vnwilling, for sundrie considerations, yet I made some promise if leasure should serue. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when I would very gladly haue been relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at her hands whom I promised, I could by no meanes obtaine it. I haue therefore at the last so nigh as I could, set downe in writing, that which I then vttered in speaking: I know that I haue omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some things in the particular applications, and exhortations which I made: and also I haue added somewhat which either then came not to minde, or els time did not serue to handle. I ambold to present and dedicate this my poore trauell vnto your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, moued therto with diuers respects, at thinking
<pb facs="4"/>my self in duty bound, not only with this cōmon and generall bond that ye are one which long time haue professed the glorious Gospell of Iesus Christ: but with diuers more speciall, which are so well knowne vnto you, that it were needlesse for me to recite thē: onely thus much, seeing I was borne and brought vp vnder you, my parents receiuing benefits daily from you, I thinke I ought, when as I am not able to make any recompence, at least to shew some token of a gratefull minde. But especially I am moued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, with consideration of the greatest blessing which all my kinred haue enioyed by you now so long, in prouiding and procuring their spirituall instruction. I pray you accept of my good will, and account of me as one that prayeth to the Lord for you, that he will multiplie and increase his good gifts still in you, to the glorie of his holie name, the benefit of his Church, and your endles comfort in Iesus Christ. Amen.</p>
