   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Vdicious Readers,</hi> in this busie time I know you will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how I dare bring forth <hi>new Proiects</hi> shadowed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a glorious <hi>Title</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <hi>Errours,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store <hi>Trading,</hi> when men of farre greater vnderstanding doe find themselues puzled, grauelled, and almost at their wits end, accounting the taske to exceed all the labours of <hi>Hercules.</hi> The presumption, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, is great. Yet when I had called to mind that Action of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> how he tumbled vp and downe his <hi>Tub</hi> very laboriously at such time, when all his Neighbours prepared themselues for Armes, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued likewise to do somewhat, and by toffing too and fro the barrell of my Conceits, albeit barren and inferiour vnto many thousands in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to encourage others to lend their hands vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Publicke prop,</hi> if not perpetually to secure it, yet for a time to stay it, vntill their wisdomes had concluded on stronger meanes. Among many <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,</hi> which I haue heere produced, perhaps they may light on some not to bee contemned. At the least those which are <hi>Thriftie,</hi> will con mee thankes for reprehending of <hi>multiplicities of Law Suits and Prodigality:</hi> Both which do keep our <hi>State</hi> in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ballance. The one vice disunites our hearts from
<pb facs="4"/>
the harmony of Concord; making vs vnworthy of the Communion of Saints, and consequently of the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> and the other disperseth our substance, that wee cannot yeeld sufficient supplies to saue the honour of our <hi>Countrey.</hi> What a masse of treasure doe we yeerely spend in forreigne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities? What abundance of Silkes doe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume on our backes? What a deale of Gold and Siluer lace? while the wary <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who hath the <hi>Indies</hi> in possession, contents himselfe with his owne Fashion and lesser moderation both in Apparell and Diet. The <hi>Dutch</hi> they follow no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant Attires. Euery man is distinguished in his Ranke: some by wearing a Copper Chaine, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a Siluer; and the Nobler of Gold. In <hi>France</hi> the meaner sort of women weare Hoods of Taffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, other of Satten, and the better of Veluet. No man intrudes into anothers vocation. But with vs, <hi>Ioane is as good as my Lady,</hi> Citizens Wiues are of late growne Gallants. The Yeoman doth gentilize it. The Gentleman scornes to be behind the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Yea, many are not ashamed to goe as braue as the <hi>King.</hi> And if a Wiseman chance to taxe them for their prodigall humour: They will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that it is for the credit of the <hi>Kingdome;</hi> which indeed is a most weake excuse: for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the publike damage, and losse ought not to be termed honourable, as not safe nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy for a discreet Inhabitant to vaunt of. Such gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die sights neuer last aboue a nine dayes wonder, nay, sometimes one only day, like your Pageants,
<pb facs="5"/>
and then the memory becomes stale, their Silkes out of fashion. But the example, like a Leprosie, is transferred from the Court to the Citie, from the Citie to the Countrey. Of these and many other abuses, which our <hi>State</hi> had need to looke into, I purpose in this <hi>Treatise</hi> to discourse, submitting the necessitie of their Reformation to the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> consideration, as is meete and conuenient. In the first Part I will endeuour to remoue the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of <hi>Religion,</hi> in the Second the Diseases of the Common-wealth: And in the Third Part I will discouer the certainty of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> which shall restore vs to all worldly Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
