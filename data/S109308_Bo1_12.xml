   <head>To <hi>Endimion</hi> Porter.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>HOw safe (<hi>Endimion</hi>) had I liv'd? how blest,</l>
      <l>In all the silent privacies of rest?</l>
      <l>How might I lengthen sleeps, had I beene wise</l>
      <l>Unto my selfe, and never seene thine Eyes?</l>
      <l>My Verse (unenvy'd then) had learn'd to move</l>
      <l>A slow, meeke pace; like sober <hi>Hymns</hi> of love</l>
      <l>By some noch'd-Brownist sung; that would indeere</l>
      <l>His holy itch, to some chaste Midwives Eare:</l>
      <l>The pleasure of ambition then had bin,</l>
      <l>To me lost in the danger, and the sinne:</l>
      <l>The Mirtle Sprig (that never can decay)</l>
      <l>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> had not knowne, nor Wreaths of living Bay:</l>
      <l>In stead of these, and the wild Ivy Twine,</l>
      <l>(Which our wise Fathers justly did assigne,</l>
      <l>To him that in immortall Verse exceeds)</l>
      <l>My Brow had worne, some homly Wreath of Weeds:</l>
      <l>
         <pb n="51" facs="35"/>And such low pride is safe: for though the Bay</l>
      <l>Lightning, nor Winds can blast, yet Envy may.</l>
      <l>If hidden still from thee, I should have lesse</l>
      <l>To answer now, for glory, and excesse:</l>
      <l>My surfets had not reach'd the cunning yet,</l>
      <l>To seeke an expiation from their wit:</l>
      <l>For more than Village Ale, and drowsie Beere,</l>
      <l>(Cawdles, and Broth to the dull Islander)</l>
      <l>I nere had wish'd; now, My Man, hot, and dry,</l>
      <l>With fierce transcriptions of my Poesie;</l>
      <l>Cryes, Sir, I thirst! then strait I bid him chuse</l>
      <l>(As Poets Prentices did surely use</l>
      <l>Of Greece, and Rome) some cleere, cheap Brook; there stay,</l>
      <l>And drinke at Natures charge his thirst away:</l>
      <l>Though Fasts (more than are taught i'th Kalender)</l>
      <l>Had made him weake; this gave him strength to sweare;</l>
      <l>And urge, that after <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>race</hi> the divine</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Maecenas</hi> knew, his Slaves drunke ever Wine:</l>
      <l>So whilst <hi>Endimion</hi> lives, hee vowes to pierce</l>
      <l>Old <hi>Gascoine</hi> Caske, or not transcribe a verse.</l>
      <l>If never knowne to thee, missing the skill</l>
      <l>How to doe good, I should have found my ill</l>
      <l>
         <pb n="52" facs="36"/>Excus'd: Th'excessive charge of Ink, and Oyle,</l>
      <l>Expence of quiet sleepes, and the vaine toyle,</l>
      <l>In which the Priest of Smyrna tooke delight,</l>
      <l>(When he for knowledge chang'd his precious sight)</l>
      <l>Had scap'd me then; now whilst I strive to please</l>
      <l>With tedious Art, I lose the lust of ease.</l>
      <l>And when our Poets (enviously miss-led)</l>
      <l>Shall finde themselves out-written, and out-read;</l>
      <l>T'will urge their sorrow too, that thou didst give</l>
      <l>To my weake Numbers, strength, and joy to live.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But O! uneasie thoughts! what will become</l>
      <l>Of me, when thou retir'st into a Tombe?</l>
      <l>The Cruell, and the Envious then will say,</l>
      <l>Since now his Lord is dead; he that did sway</l>
      <l>Our publique smiles, opinion, and our praise,</l>
      <l>Till wee this Childe of Poesie did raise</l>
      <l>To Fame, and love; let's drowne him in our Inke;</l>
      <l>Where like a lost dull Plummet let him sinke</l>
      <l>From humane sight; from knowledge he was borne;</l>
      <l>Unlesse Succession finde him in our scorne.</l>
      <l>Remembrance, never to Repentance showes,</l>
      <l>The wealth wee gaine, but what wee feare to lose;</l>
      <l>
         <pb n="53" facs="36"/>Thou art my wealth; and more than Light ere spy'd,</l>
      <l>Than Easterne Hills bring forth, or Seas can hide:</l>
      <l>But thus when I rejoyce, my feares divine,</l>
      <l>I want the fate, still to preserve thee mine:</l>
      <l>And Kings depos'd, wish they had never knowne</l>
      <l>Delight, nor sway; which erst they toyl'd to owne.</l>
