   <p>Wherefore auoiding to sing vnto these deafe Adders which haue stopt their eares, charme the charmer neuer so wisely; I addresse my speech vnto you, poorer in spirit, yonger in
<pb facs="7"/> malice, who although you sit in darknes, yet hate not the light; though you know not truth, yet loue not lies.</p>
   <p>All meanes I am sure to detaine you in errour are by your pretended spirituall Fathers of Rome daily practised; force, torture, persecution, forbidding of you to read the labours of all them in whose forehead the Character of the Beast is not. A practice so much the more abominable, because the proofes and arguments which are produced by the professors of the reformed religion against the vse of <hi>Rome,</hi> are chiefely taken out of the word of God, the Scriptures of our saluation; which to deny vnto the world, what is it but to take the Sunne out of the firmament? and to forbid men to read, What is it but with <hi>Nahas</hi> to pull out the right eyes of <hi>Israel,</hi> euen the cleere eye of true faith, that they may be led by blinde guides headlong into all perdition?</p>

         </gap>g. 9.</note>When the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> saw themselues vnable to stand against <hi>Israel,</hi> they sent Messengers to <hi>Iosua</hi> in old and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne garments, rent and torne shooes, hauing sowre drinke in their bottles, dryed and moulded bread in their bagges, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that they came from far, &amp; dwelt a great way off frō Israel. To which, while the people gaue ouer-light credence, counselling not as they were wont at the mouth of the Lord; they made with them an vnaduised league, and sware a peace to be repented. With the like fraud, vnder false pretence, and borrowed ragges of antiquity and succession, doe the Romish Masters, at this day, insinuate themselues into the hearts and fauour of such who giue no eare vnto the Word and Oracles of God. And not so onely: but as <hi>Iezabel</hi> to auoide the iust pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment due vnto her whorish and Idolatricall beastlinesse, entertained <hi>Iehu</hi> with a painted face,<note place="margin">2.

   <p>I haue therefore, according vnto the measure of grace giuen me, in these my labours, vnscarfed the Papall policie, and laid open the mysterie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> shewing you her filthy parts, the very dregs of her cup: that seeing there lyeth much Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders poyson vnder her tongue, which you perceiue not; much gaule, much bitternesse, which by the lying glosse of false hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie is hidden from your eyes, you may at the last finde
<pb facs="8"/> whither they haue led you; and to what place, all this while, blind fold yee haue trauelled, and that your feet stand not in the gates of <hi>Sion,</hi> nor yet in the Prophets house at <hi>Dothan;</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Reg. 6.</note> but that you are in the middes of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the implacable enemy of the true <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Which, that it may be the better brought to passe, I will pray also with the Prophet,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 6.20.</note>
      <hi>Lord open the eyes of these men, that they may see.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Your Missals, the solemne formes of publique Seruice, I haue vndertaken to examine, prouing out of them the Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and such other Sophisters (by which they go about to maintain the grosseness of errours) to be meere mockeries not obserued in the Liturgies of the Romish Church. I haue also studied to shew vnto you the abhominable false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, superstition, and Idolatry, in the Breuiaries, and Masse-bookes contained; that when you see how the open religious seruice of God, is prophaned and falsified, you may iudge what faith or sincerity they keep in their priuate writings; and say with that great Physition, <hi>Si aqua praesocat, quid insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sorbebimus;</hi> If we be strangled with the purest water what then shall we drink?</p>
   <p>One thing let me especially commend to your considerations. Whereas it is a common opinion that your Missals &amp; Legends, of late time set forth, are more reformed then the old and obsolete; It is farre otherwise: for there is no blasphemy so great, nor superstition so absurd, to be found in the one, which is not as palpably deprehended in the other. For as of Masse-bookes the Romane Breuiarie, set forth by the authority of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and ratified by <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> is held the tersest and most reformed: So the Legend published by <hi>Aloysius Lypomanus,</hi> is accounted the flower of Legends: But to speake the truth, these aboue the rest, by many degrees, surmount in all spirituall wickednesse, in all falshood and blasphemy.</p>
   <pb facs="9"/>
   <p>I haue not onely therfore vsed the testimony of the later Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends and Missals, but of the former also; for that in many things the Romane Breuiarie not onely taketh hands with the most barbarous Legends of <hi>Lombardy</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> but it seeemeth for the most part, either taken out of the Missals of <hi>Sarisbury</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> or at the least to imitate them in their Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
   <p>Neither can any man iustly blame me in this proceeding; seeing the vse of <hi>Sarum</hi> is neither disanulled, nor exaucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but that it may be still sung, and vsed by the Priests in their celebration: as it may appeare by the Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> dated in the yeare one thousand fiue hundred and seuenty the day before the Ides of Iuly, and in the first yeare of his Popedome: in which, though all other Missals be recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note n="a" place="margin">Nisi ab ipsa prima institutione a sede Apostolita appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata vel consuitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine quaevil ipsam stituto super du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

I thanke God I feare the Lord, and tremble at his iudgements; before my eyes are all the rabble of false accusers, <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, Haman</hi> the <hi>Agagite,</hi> the wicked Iewes that slandered Christ, whose shamefull seed is a pillar of Salt to all posterity. I remember also the three accusers of <hi>Narcissus,</hi> to whom the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vengeance, fire, languishing, and blindnesse sorted, as euery one imprecated to himselfe, if he accused falsly. Wherefore let there be no preiudice, I beseech you, either of the cause it selfe, or of my person but as you are zealous of your owne saluation, so peruse the high and heynous crimes, blasphemy, idolatry, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, falshood, Antichristianisme, which I obiect against the publique forme of your worship, and the daily practice of your policie.

To him, with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, bee all Praise, Power, Might, and Maiesty ascribed, in the Congregation of all Saints, world without end, Amen.</p>
