Hereby also the true Orthographie, that is, the true writing of many hard English words, borrowed from the Greeke, Latine and French, and how to know one from the other, with the interpretation thereof by plaine English words, may be learned &amp; known. And children hereby may be prepared for the vnderstanding of a great number of Latine words: which also will bring much delight and iudgement to others, by the vse of this little worke.</p>

And thus praying, that God of his vnspeakeable mercies, will blesse both your Honours and Worships, I do with all good wishes to you all, with all yours, as to mine owne soule, humbly take my leaue.</p>
