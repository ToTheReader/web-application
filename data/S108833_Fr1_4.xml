   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ngenious Reader, in this subiect of Witch-craft which I here present vnto thee, thou art not ignorant, what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie, difficultie, difference, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and contradiction hath among Authors and learned men in all ages arisen. From the offusion of generall ignorance, or superstitious blindnesse herein, willing to withdraw the vulgar illusion; I haue endeauoured De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiuely to declare what portion of some more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in such vncertainties, God &amp; Nature hath destined and allowed. It is not any worth either arrogated vnto my selfe, or derogated from others, but my studious desire and vehement affection in this particular, together with some speciall experience and paines vpon diuers occurrents, and occasions extraordinarily hapning, that hath drawne me forth to offer my opinion as the widdowes mite, more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in good will, and hearty affection, then in true value or deserued esteeme. If it may only giue occasion vnto a more exquisite pensell, it is the heigth of my intention, and a complete recompence of my endeauour. For this cause, and for common easie reading and apprehension, I haue purposely auoided, and discontinued the smooth thrid of a continued laboured stile, and haue for the most part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and inserted a plaine texture, of a more vulgar and carelesse phrase and word. The enuious haply may cauill,
<pb facs="7"/>
that a Physition out of his owne supposed precincts, should rush into sacred lists, or enter vpon so high points of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, as by an vnauoidable intercurrence, doe necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insert themselues in this proposed subiect. Diuinitie it selfe doth herein answer them. In the theory of Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, it is the dutie and praise of euery man, to be without curiositie fruitfully exercised.</p>
   <p>For as touching matter of Diuinitie, as it falleth out, or is incident in the discourse of this small Treatise, I onely propound such reasons and considerations therein, as in common are allowable and commendable in euery Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man, and therein I doe neither vsurpingly controule others, nor controulingly conclude my selfe, but willingly submit vnto the graue censure and dictature of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reuerend Diuine. If therefore (good Reader,) I haue here published or communicated vnto thee ought thankes-worthy, as it is by me freely intended vnto thee; so let it not from me be vnfriendly extended by thee. If I haue in ought erred, let it be thy praise and goodnesse to make thy vse thereof without abuse. If thou hast former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought amisse, and doest here reade that is more right, be not ashamed to acknowledge thy better knowledge. If thou list not to know, then know, that truth shall iudge thee, and iustifie her selfe without thee.</p>
