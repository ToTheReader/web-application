   <head>¶The preface. Syr Thomas More to the chrysten readers.</head>
   <p>IF any man mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle (as I wene some wyse menne wyll) that euer I wold vouchsaufe to bestow any time about makynge an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swere to the pacyfyers dyaloge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syderynge his faynt &amp; his feble rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonyng: I can not in good fayth wel excuse my selfe therin. For as I so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynly went in hande therwyth, and made it in a breyde: so whā I synnys considered how lytell nede it was, I merueyled myne owne selfe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented to, that I hadde not regarded the boke as it was wurthy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any one worde let it euyn alone.</p>
   <p>¶How be it good reders what one thynge or twayne specyally moued


<pb n="iii" facs="3"/>
me to make answere to it, and how it happed me to fall in hand therwyth, and to spende and lese a lytell tyme about it, to make the mater the more playne vnto you: that thynge shall I shew you.</p>
   <p>¶As soone as myne apologye was ones come out abrode, anone herde I worde that some were very wrothe therwyth. And yet in my mynde had there no man cause, neyther precher, nor pacyfyer, no nor none heretyke neyther. For I hadde but spoken for my selfe, and for good folke, and for the catholyke fayth / without reproch or reprofe to any mannes person, or wyllyng any man any harme y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> were wyllyng to mende. And who so were wyllyng to be nought styll, had cause to be wroth wyth hym self you wote well and not with me.</p>
   <p>¶But all this wolde not serue me / for very wroth were they wyth me. Howbeit theyr causelesse anger dyd


<pb facs="4"/>
not gretely greue me. For I was not so farre vnreasonable, as to loke for reasonable myndes in vnreasonable menne.</p>
   <p>¶But than herde I shortely that thykke &amp; threfolde the pennys went to wurke, and answeres were a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, diuerse, by dyuerse very great cūnyng mē. And of this trayuayle of such great moūtayne hyllys, I herd myche speche made, almoste euery weke: so ferforth that at laste it was tolde me for trouth, that vnto one ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell pyece, one greate cunnynge man had made a long answere, of twelue whole shetys of paper, wryten nere to gyther and with a smale hande.</p>
   <p>¶But in good fayth I coulde but laugh at that. For as for that pyece, I was very sure that the cūnyngest man that coulde come therto, neyther in tenne shetys nor in tenne querys neyther, wryte as nere as he coulde, sholde neuer answere it well.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="iiii" facs="4"/>¶For that pyece was the answere y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in myne apalogye I make, as you se there vnto certayne sermons, wherin my dyaloge was towched for wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge agaynst Tyndals false trans<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lacyon. And wherin was also defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded agaynst my confutacyon, Tyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals wyse chapyter, in which agaynst my dyaloge he laboreth to proue that the worde was before the chyrche / &amp; in all his chapyter neuer towcheth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> poynt / and the sermon that defended hym, walketh as wyde as he.</p>
   <p>¶It was tolde me as I say that an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swere was made to that place / and what shyfte there was founde to the remanaunt, that coulde I not here. But to the fyrst poynt I herde saye that there was deuysed, 'that where as I reherse that the precher spake of poysoned brede, I rehersed hym wrong. For he spake but of moulden brede. And this pyece it was tolde me that in y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> new answere it was reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

      </gap>y</p>
   <p>¶But come the boke abrode onys, I shall sone abate that corage. For fyrst syth he taketh recorde y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he sayd but mouldy brede: yf I brynge wyt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse also that he said poysoned bred, than can his wytnesse stande hym in none other stede, but for to proue for hym that he sayd bothe.</p>
   <p>¶Secundly shall I proue that he sayd poysened brede, by such meanes that men shall se by reason, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> though the tother were possyble: yet was it farre vnlykely.</p>
   <p>¶Finally shal I ferther proue, that though y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> man had sayd not poysened brede but onely moulden brede: yet shall I proue I saye, that as the case stode, that same not poysened brede but moulden brede, was yet for all that a very poysened worde.</p>
   <p>¶Heryng therfore that this gaye boke was made of the .xii. shetys of paper, &amp; lacked but ouerloking, &amp; that many mo were ī hand y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> shortly shold


<pb n="v" facs="5"/>
come out: lyke as an husband, whose wife were in her trauayle, herkeneth euery hande whyle, and fayne wold here good tydynges: so syth I so myche herde of so sore trauayle of so many, so cunnynge, aboute dyuerse answeres, I longed of theyr longe laboure to se some good spede, and some of those fayre babes borne that they trauayled on.</p>
   <p>¶And when these great hyllys had thus trauailed longe, from the weke after Ester tyll as myche afore My<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>mas: the good houre came on as god wold, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> one was broughte a bed, with sore labour at laste deliuered of a dede mouse. The moder is yet but grene good soule, &amp; hath nede of good kepyng: women wote what caudell serueth agaynst her after throwes.</p>
   <p>¶Now after that the boke was out and came into myne handes / and that I sawe the maner and the fashyon therof: two thynges onely moued me to wryte and medle wyth yt.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>One that I sawe therin folowed and pursewed, the selfe same shrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed malicyouse intent that was purpo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed in his fyrst boke of diuysyon / that is to wyt to make thordynaryes with fere of slaunder and oloquye, seue theyr dutyes vndone and lette here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyques alone / and ouer that wyth an euyl newe chaunge of good old law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, labour to putte heretyques in co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rage, and therby decaye the fayth.</p>
   <p>¶This was in dede the very spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyall poynte that made me wryte yet agayne. And yet founde I so lytle reason in hys reasonynge, that me thought yt sholde not nede. For thys wyste I very well, that who so euer had wyt, and wold conferre and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pare to gether, the wordes of hys answere wyth the wordes of myne Apologye, sholde sone perceyue that hys answeres were euyn very dull and dede.</p>
   <p>¶But thenne was there a nother


<pb n="vi" facs="6"/>
thynge that I consydered in yt / why<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che poynte vnprouyded for, myghte soon deceyue the reader. For all be yt the pacyfyer hath in some places put in myne owne wordes where yt plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed hym: yet hathe he for the moste parte vsed a prety crafte, to mysse re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>herse my mater and leue my wordes oute. Ye and besydes this, the man hath in some places lefte oute some of his owne, &amp; mysse rehersed them / to make the reader wene, that in the reprouynge theym, I hadde wryten wronge.</p>
   <p>¶Now had I supposed to remedy those thing{is}, &amp; make him an answere in thre or foure leues, wyth onely poyntynge the reader to the places, wyth wrytynge in what lefe he shold fynde the mater. For the word{is} ones redde: the trouthe sholde shewe yt selfe.</p>
   <p>¶But whyle I was thus mynded and went there about: hys answere


<pb facs="7"/>
in his dialoge had foūden such a way wyth walkynge to &amp; fro, kepynge no maner order, and therwyth makynge me seke so longe for some one place, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I saw wel I shold soner answere hym all new, then fynde out for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thynges the place that I sholde seke for.</p>
   <p>¶I made therfore in few days<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> this answere that you se. And some suche places yet as I had happed to finde, I haue remytted the reader vnto in myne apologye / where for his redye findyng, I haue nōbred him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>the lefe. And yet haue I for some folke done somwhat more to. For I se wel sure<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly many men are nowe a dayes so de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lycate in readynge, and so lothe to la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour, that they fare in other bokes as womē fare with theyr primer, which though they be content to saye some tyme y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fyftene psalmys, &amp; ouer y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the psalmys of the passyon to, yf they fynde them al fayre lette out in order


<pb n="vii" facs="7"/>
at length: yet wyll they rather leue theym all vn sayde, then turne backe to seke theym out in other partyes of theyr prymer.</p>
   <p>¶And therfore leste some readers myghte happe in this boke to do the same: some places of thapologye myche necessarye and not longe, that wyth myche sekynge I fortuned to fynd out, to ease the reders labour, &amp; make all open vnto hym, I haue put in also, into myne answere here. Ye and yet ouer thys in the thynges of moste weyghte, I haue put into thys boke hys owne wordes to. And so shall you good readers wythout any payne of sekynge, haue all the mate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> playn and open afore your yien, that ye shal well se that I loue the lyght, no lesse thenne thys pacyfyer wolde fayne walke in the darke. For as the darke is in this mater all hys auaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tage: euen so ys veryly the lyghte in lyke wyse myne.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="8"/>And where as there are some that cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mende his answere, for the compen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyouse breuite therof and shortnesse: I nothinge therin enuye the mannes prayse. For lyke as no man can make a shorter course then he that lacketh both hys legges: so cā no man make a shorter boke than he that lacketh as wel wordes as mater. And yet when by the places conferred well to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the feblenesse of his answere shall appere: then shall he lese the prayse of shortnesse to. For when yt shall wel be sene, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he sayth nothyng to the purpose: then shall eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ry wise man thynke hys boke to longe by all to gether. And that ye may wel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue that so it is in dede, let vs now leue of the preface and fall vnto the mater.</p>
