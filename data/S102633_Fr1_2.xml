   <p>The consideration of the dutie which euery Christan is in Conscience bound to performe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To aduance the glory of God by whom he was created, and vpon whom he wholy dependeth;
<pb facs="3"/>and also to further the good of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Image of God, and fellow mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with him of the same misticall bodie of Christ, compelled me to take in hand the Translation of these two Sermons following, as being the good which I (hauing opportunitie of time and place to accomplish) might in no wise omit. They were first preached and published in the Netherlandish Dutch, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the people of God in those parts, which being also my desire in this place, I according to my slender ability haue tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated and published them here; and as a token of the respect I beare vnto your worth, and of the thanks I owe vnto you for the many fauourable fruites of your loue, am bold to tender them vnto your acceptance, and commit them vnto your Patronage.</p>
   <p>They may fitly be tearmed the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizing of the <hi>body of sinne, a touch stone for a Christian,</hi> or, a <hi>Receipt for a sicke soule,</hi> for they (ioyntly) containe matter suting vnto these three titles, and vse full for all sortes of men, as well those that <hi>have a name to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue
<pb facs="3"/>but are dead,</hi> hauing a shew of Religion, but want substance; as those that are Christians indeed, and in truth, <hi>Whose prayse is not of men but of God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But being loath to be too troublesome vnto you with abundance of words, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you vnto the booke it selfe, which (being iealous of mine owne errors and insufficiencie, I submit vnto your judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous censure) euer consecrating my selfe vnto you for your seruice in all that I am or shalbe able to performe, and my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto God for your safetie and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in bodie and soule: and thus I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly take my leaue,</p>
