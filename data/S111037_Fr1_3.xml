         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>. There hath been lately published a Pamphlet entituled <hi>The Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of lewd, idle froward and inconstant Women.</hi> This patched and mishapen hotch-potch, is so dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that if <hi>Socrates</hi> did laugh but once to see an Asse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>,</hi> so a franticks writer doth aptly chuse giddy fauorites.</p>
   <p>The Author of the <hi>Arraignment,</hi> and my selfe, in our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours doe altogether disagree; he raileth without cause, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vpon direct proofe. He saith, women are the worst of all Creatures, I prooue them blessed aboue all Creatures: He wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that men should abhorre them for their had conditions: I proue that men should honour them for their best dispositions he saith, women are the cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap>, I proue, if there be any offence in a woman, men were the beginners. Now, in that it is far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e more woman like to maintaine a right, then it is man like to offer a wrong, I conceiued that I could not erre in my choyse, if I did direct a labour well intended, to worthy young youths, which are well disposed.</p>
   <p>When you haue past your minority, or serued your Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships vnder the gouernment of others, when you begin the world
<pb facs="4"/>for your selues, the chiefest thing you looke for is a good Wife.</p>
   <p>The world is a large field, and it is full of brambles, bryers, and weedes: If there be any more tormenting, more scratting, or more poysonable weede then other, the Author hath collected them in his lothsome Pamphlet, and doth vtter them to his gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy company.</p>
   <p>Now my selfe presuming vpon your worthy and hanest dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, I haue entred into the Garden of <hi>Paradice,</hi> and there haue gathered the choysest flowers which that Garden may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord, and those I offer to you.</p>
   <p>If you belieue our aduersury, no woman is good, howsoeuer she be vsed: if you consider what I haue written, no woman is had except she be abused.</p>
   <p>If you belieue him that women are so bad Creatures, what a dangerous and miserable life is marriage?</p>
   <p>If you examine my proofes to know directly what women are, you shall then finde there is no delight more exceeding then to be ioyned in marriage with a Paraditian Creature. Who as shee commeth out of the Garden, so shall you finde her a flower of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, answerable to the Countrey from whence she commeth.</p>
   <p>There can be no loue betwixt man and wife, but where there is a respectiue estimate the one towards the other. How could you loue? nay, how would you loath such a monster, to whom <hi>Ioseph Swetnam</hi> poynteth?</p>
   <p>Whereas in view of what I haue described, how can you but regardfully loue with the vttermost straine of affection so incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable a Iewell.</p>
   <p>Some will perhaps say, I am a woman and therefore write more for women then they doe deserue: To whom I answere, if they misdoubt of what I speake, let them impeach my credit in any one particular: In that which I write, <hi>Eue</hi> was a good woman before she met with the Serpent, her daughters are good Virgins, if they meet with good Tutors.</p>
   <p>You my worthy youths are the hope of Man-hoode, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall poynt of Man-hoode is to defend, and what more man-like defence, then to defend the iust reputation of a woman. I know that you the Apprentises of this Citie are as forward to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="5"/>the good, as you are vehement to put downe the bad.</p>
   <p>That which is worst I leaue to our aduersary, but what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently best, that I commend to you: doe you finde the gold, I doe here deliuer you the Iewell, a rich stocke to begin the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, if you be good husbands to vse it for your best aduantage.</p>
   <p>Let not the title of this Booke in some poynt distaste you, in that men are arraigned, for you are quit by Non-age. None are here arraigned, but such olde fornicators as came with full mouth and open cry to Iesus, and brought a woman to him taken in adultery, who when our Sauiour stoopt downe and wrote on the ground, they all fled away. <hi>Ioseph Swetnam</hi> saith, <hi>A man may finde Pearles in dust,</hi> Pag. <hi>47.</hi> But if they who sled had seene any Pearles, they would rather haue stayed to haue had share, then to flye and to leane the woman alone, they found some fowle reckoning against themselues in our Sauiours writing, as they shall doe who are heare arraigned. And if they dare doe like, as our Sauiour had the womans accusers, <hi>He that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne throw the first stone at her;</hi> so let them raile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst women, who neuer tempted any woman to be bad: Yet this is an hard case. If a man raile against a woman, and know no lewdnesse by any, he shall proue himselfe a compound foole. If he rayle at woman, who in his owne experienced tryall had made many bad, he shall shew himselfe a decompounded K. I doe not meane Knight: The best way is, he that knoweth none bad, let him speake well of all: he who hath made more bad then he euer intended to make good, let him hold his peace least hee shame himselfe. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
