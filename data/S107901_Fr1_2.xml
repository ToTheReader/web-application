      <hi>The Preface.</hi> Heere beginneth a little treatise or booke named <hi>Iohn Maundeuile</hi> Knight, borne in England in the Towne of S. <hi>Albone,</hi> and speaketh of the wayes to Hierusalem, to Inde, and to the great Caane, and also to <hi>Prestor Iohns</hi> land, and to many other countries, and also of many meruailes that are in the holy land.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as the land ouer the Sea, that is to say, the holie land, that some call the land of Bihest, among all other lands is most worthie and soueraigne, for it is blessed, hallowed and sacred of the precious bloud of our Lord Iesus Christ, in the which land it liked him to take flesh and bloud of the Virgin Marie, and to enuiron that land with his owne feete, and there he would do many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, preach and teach the faith and the law of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men, as vnto his children, and there he would suffer manie reproues and scornes for vs, and hee that was king of heauen and hell, of earth, of aire, of sea, and land, and of all things that are contained in them, would alonely be called king of that land, when hee said, <hi>Rex sum Iudaeorum,</hi> I am King of the Iewes: For at that time it was the land of Iewes, and that land he chose before all other lands, as the best and most worthie of vertues of all the world. And as the Philosopher saith: <hi>Virtus rerum in medio consistit,</hi> that is to say, the vertue of things is in the midst: and in that land hee would lead his life, and
<pb facs="3"/> suffer passion and death of the Iewes for vs, to saue and deliuer vs from the paines of hell, and from death without end, the which was ordained to vs for the sinne of our father <hi>Adam,</hi> and our owne sins also: for as for himselfe he had none euill done nor deserued, for he neuer thought ne did any euill, for he that was king of glory and of ioy might best in that place suffer death. For hee that will doe any thing that he will haue knowne openly, he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime it openly, in the middle place of a towne or of a Citie, so that it may be knowne to all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the citie. So he that was king of glorie and of all the world would suffer death for vs at Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, which is the midst of the world, so that it might be knowne to all nations of the world, how deare he bought man, that hee made him with his hands to his owne likenesse, for the great loue that he had to vs: Ah deare God, what loue hee had to his subiects, when hee that had done no trespasse would for his trespassours suffer death: for a more worthie cattel he might not haue set for vs, then his owne blessed body, and his owne precious bloud the which he suffered for vs, right well ought men to loue, worship, dread and serue such a Lord, &amp; praise such an holy land that brought forth a Lord of such fruite, through the which each man is saued, but if it be his owne default. This is that land prepared for an heritage to vs, and in that land would he die as seased, to leaue it to his children. For the which each good christian man that may and hath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, should strength him for to conquere our right heritage &amp; purchase, out of the euill peoples hands,
<pb facs="3"/> for we are cleped christian men of Christ our father, and if we be the right children of Christ we ought to challenge the heritage that our father left vs, &amp; take it out of strange mens hands. But now Pride, Couetise, and Enuie, hath so inflamed the hearts of the Lords of the world, that they are more busie to disherite their neighbours, then to challenge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere their right heritage aforesaid. And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people that would put their bodies and their cattell for to conquere our heritage, they may not do it without lords: for assembling of the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a chiefe Lord, is as a flock of sheepe without a shepheard, the which depart asunder, and wot not whither they shall go. But would God the worldly Lords were at a good accord, &amp; with other of their common people, would take this holy voyage ouer the sea, I trust well that within a little time our right heritage before said, should be reconciled and put into the hands of the right heirs of Iesu Christ.</p>
   <p>And forasmuch as it is long time that there was any generall passage ouer the sea, &amp; that many men desire to heare speaking of the holy land, and haue thereof great solace and comfort.</p>
   <p>Wherefore yee shall heare by me <hi>Iohn Maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile</hi> Knight, which was borne in England, in the towne of Saint Albones, and passed the sea in the yeare of our Lord Iesu Christ, a thousand iii. C. on the day of Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> and there remained long time, and went through many lands, &amp; many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, kingdomes &amp; Iles, and haue passed through Turky, and through Armony, the little &amp; the great, through Tartary, Persia, Surry, Araby, Egypt
<pb facs="4"/> the high and the low, through Libia, Chalde, and a great part of Ethiope, through Amazony, through Inde the lesse &amp; the more, a great part, and through many other Iles which are about Inde, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people dwelleth of diuers lawes and shapes. Of the men of which lands &amp; Iles I shall speake more plainly: and I shall declare part of the things what they are when time shall be, after it may best come to my minde, and specially for them that will and are in purpose for to visite the holy citie of Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and the holy places that are thereabout, and I shall tell the way that they shall hold thether; for I haue many times passed and ridden it with good company, and with many Lords.</p>
