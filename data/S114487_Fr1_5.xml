   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Church of God in the world, is of higher esteeme then the world it selfe. It is the fruition of our Lord Iesus Christ. He was crucified for it, and without it nothing can be accounted good. But as our Redeemer inuiteth vs to enter and to continue therein for our saluation, so Satan endeuoureth to make men wander from the right way to their damnation. He blindeth them, to the end they may take that for the Church that hath but the name thereof, holding them in error, seducing them by a worldly glorious pompe, and so makes them disdaine the true Church, principally because it is subiect to persecution in the world: wherein they that honour not the Maister cannot che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the seruants: in such sort, that not acknowledging any other Church, then that which hath triumphed, for many ages together, in the bloud of those Martyrs whom it hath killed, they demand with great importunitie, what, and in what parts of the world the Chatholicke Church hath bene, if that which so long and so peaceably hath obtained the title thereof be not the same? Where was it hid (say they) during the fiue ages last past? They are instant vpon vs, that at the least we shew them some one, in the whole course of so many yeares, that hath beleeued that, which in our times hath bene so much extolled vnder the name of Reformation.</p>
   <p>This historie of the Christians called Waldenses &amp; Albin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses will satisfie those that can reade it without passion. For therein appeares, that for these last foure hundred and fiftie yeares, there haue bene (especially in Europe) a great number, in diuers kingdomes and countries, which haue made profession of a religion altogether conformable to the word of God, and the doctrine which hath bene receiued in the reformed Churches; hauing mourned vnder the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="6"/>
of Antechrist, wherein they shined like precious stones in a dunghill, and roses among the thornes. They seemed to the world but as abiect men, but God beheld them as his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and gaue them eyes to see, and eares to heare, and an heart to vnderstand the truth. And as he made way to his iudgements, by leauing those to the spirit of amazednesse that had forsaken his word: so he hath made way to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in withdrawing this remainder of his people from the Temples polluted with idolatries, causing the sacred inward ministerie of his Spirit to worke in them, prouiding them temples, and preseruing them from the infection of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ministerie, defiled with infinite humane inuentions.</p>
   <p>The writings of the said Waldenses and Albingenses, which haue bene miraculously preserued vnto this present time, make good in this historie the puritie of their religion, and iustifie them against the imputations of their aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. They make it appeare vnto the world, that they haue had for the foundation of their faith, the Simbole of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, allowing also of that of Athanasius: for the rule of their obedience, the eternall law of God: for the substance of their prayers, the Lords prayer. And finally that they haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued the Sacraments instituted by our Lord Iesus Christ in the selfe same puritie wherein he first ordained them. And also that they haue alwayes liued vnder a good and holy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, carrying themselues in regard of their manners and conuersation according to the same word, which is the rule of their faith. And yet neuerthelesse we shall make it appeare, that for all these things, without which no man can be a true Christian, they haue bene cruelly condemned to death, bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, sacked, burnt, cursed, and persecuted with violence of armes.</p>
   <p>Without reason then is it demanded, where the Church was in these ages last past, since it appeares that the almost
<pb facs="6"/>
infinite numbers which the Popes for righteousnesse sake haue put to death, were the Church, how contrarie soeuer to the Church of Rome and the Popes, in whatsoeuer they were contrary to the Church of God.</p>
   <p>Now forasmuch as the first point of the truth which these faithfull Martyrs haue maintained, concerneth God, who is without beginning and without end, without whose command there is nothing true or auailable, it must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow that the inuentions of men must giue place when God speaketh, especially the truth being as ancient as the lye. And we must also acknowledge, that they that haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in former ages in one onely God by Iesus Christ, haue bene the true members of the Church, making the Catholike Church, in what part of the world soeuer they haue bene pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Now it appeares by the doctrine and confession of the faithfull (whereof much is spoken in this historie) that they haue alwayes put their hope in the liuing God, expecting sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and life by no other meanes but by the Sonne of God. If then: for these things they haue bene slaughtered, what wrong is done vnto those that are guiltie of the same sinnes, by those bloudie desires which they haue to banish those out of the world whose mouthes by reason they cannot stop, if seeming to seeke the Church in ages past, they be sent vnto those faithfull whom such as themselues haue put to death. Haue they not rather reason to be thankfull vnto God with vs, for that the violent assaults of Satan haue bene alwayes in vaine, because the Church hath euer continued in the person of Gods seruants victorious by faith, and triumphant by martyrdome: which we haue not measured in this histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie according to the crueltie of their punishment, but the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and goodnesse of the cause? It will adde much to the glory of God, to follow this bloud by the trace, gathering together the certaine proofes of the faith and constancie of millions of
<pb facs="7"/>
witnesses, who haue sealed the truth with the losse of their owne liues. They whose hearts God shall moue to enlarge this historie, by the true narration of what hath passed touching this subiect, in those places where it hath pleased the Lord to make them grow &amp; increase (as there is no Kingdome, State, Principalitie, nor almost Citie, towne, or village in Europe, where this innocent bloud hath not bene shed) shall adde much to the edification of his Church, when many shall contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the notice thereof that which God hath done in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ages, that we may know where and how he hath preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it.</p>
   <p>In this holy employment, we need not doubt of the venome of wicked tongues, the scoffes of Atheists and profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. A stomacke ill affected loues nothing but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto it, and the wicked haue nothing in esteeme, but what is conformable to their vitious humour. If the quippes of the wicked should haue bene an hinderance to the seruice we owe vnto God and to his Church, we had giuen ouer this historie before we had written three lines thereof: for it hath bene snarled at by diuers vpon the first bruit thereof, what then may we thinke they will do, when they shall see that they neuer thought we could so truly haue maintained. Doubtlesse passion will extort from malignant mindes the suggestions of the malignant, in counterchange whereof (hauing aduertised thee, gentle Reader, that in the first page and inscription of this historie, thou hast the name, the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the intention, the fruite, and the end, in a few lines) I will pray to the eternall God for those that wrong vs, that he would be pleased to make them know the truth, and giue vnto vs whom he hath placed and planted in his house, after the conflicts of this life, that portion which he hath reserued in heauen by his welbeloued Sonne our Lord Iesus Christ, to whom be all honour glory, and power for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
