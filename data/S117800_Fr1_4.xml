      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or to such onely this Maiden <hi>Guide of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> desires accesse. The detracting broode, whom Malice hath begot on Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, shee holds not worthy of her Salutation, much lesse of her Service. Shee knowes that <hi>Hercules</hi> after his fifty Labours, grappell'd with Envy, and expects the like encounter. These Fly wits (that search all over a body for a sore, and where they cannot finde they make one) imitate in this their great patron Momus, who
<pb facs="7"/>
(when he could not espy any member, or feature in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> justly liable to detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) cride out upon the creaking of her pantables. They raile at the Ages past, condemne the Present, and already judge the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. These severe Iudges will have a man as serious in his first Booke as his last Will. Some of them lately have not spared even <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's</hi> first borne, incōparable, and inimitable Sir <hi>Phillip Sydney,</hi> whose <hi>Arcadia</hi> they confine onely to the reading of Chambermaids; a censure that can proceede from none but the sonnes of Kitchinmaids. Let me pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, if I thinke not his very Skull yet retaines more:
<pb facs="7"/>
witt then the passive braines of these wretched things, betweene whose Soules, and Knowledge, there is a Gulfe. But how come I to descend to these poore Abjects, whose infle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xible dullnesse, and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, Reason herselfe cannot bend. I confesse nothing could make mee voutsafe them a word, were I not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with their vnder vallu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that truth Worthy who (next her Kings) is the first glory this Iland can boast of. A man deserving both the Lawrels, and the Crowne to boote,<note place="margin">The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Crown</note> design'd him by the Votes of many brave Spirits, who discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in him all the requisits of a King but the Title.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="8"/>This is no digression, Noble Reader; for the Guide I have given you, is also the Champion of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and of her sacred seed, of which he was the first in worth, though not in time. Are you enflamed with a Desire of Domesticall Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Imitate the truly great <hi>Sydney,</hi> whose onely Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is far above all my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. Can you with the Arcadians boast your selfe ancienter then the Moone? If you live out of vertues Shine, your Antiquity does not illustrate, but obscure you. Hath Fortune sterv'd the rest of humanity to feed you? Without learning you are as blinde as your God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse. Hath Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd
<pb facs="8"/>
her utmost Art on you? Without Knowledge you are, at the best, but an unhabited Paradise. Blush then to sit in the Theater, one stone upon another. Shame forbids that your inward, and outward sight, should have one and the same Horizon. Which igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie that you may eschew, emulate the ever famous, ever blessed <hi>Sydney,</hi> who is as far above the Envy, as the Ʋnderstanding of his Detracters, more capable of a Bastinad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> then an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</p>
   <p>Now for this true Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Honour▪ I assure you shee had never kiss'd your hands, but that I fear'd another would send
<pb facs="9"/>
her to you without or Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, or my consent. Heaven be praised, shee comes not from me with such labour that she needs a Midwife to bring her forth. She is now by my Command come to waite on you: If you follow her close, she will bring you into the embraces of her Mistresse, betweene whose armes Posterity shall find you sleeping. Which su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme humane happinesse is unfainedly wish'd you, by</p>
