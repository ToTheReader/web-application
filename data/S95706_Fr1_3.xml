   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue ben moued partly by the holynes and goodnes of your lyuyng / partly by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and loue that your grace beareth towarde holy study / &amp; lernynge / to write some thyng vnto your good grace / of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formacion and bryngyng vp of a Christen womā: A matter neuer yet entreated of any mā / amonge so great plentie and variete of wyttes &amp; wryters. For Xenophon &amp; Aristotel gyuyng rules of house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kepynge / and Plato makynge preceptes of orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the cōmon weale / speake many thynges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteynynge vnto the womans office and dewte: And saynt Cyprian / saynt Hieronyme / saynt Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose / &amp; saynt Augustine / haue entreated of may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and wydowes: but in suche wyse / that they appere rather texhort &amp; coūsayle them vnto some kynde of lyuyng / than to instruct and teche them. They spende all theyr speche in the laudes &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of chastite: whiche is a goodly thynge and syt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng for those great wytted and holy men: Howe be it / they write but fewe preceptes &amp; rules / howe to lyue: supposyng hit to be better / to exhort them
<pb facs="6"/>vnto the beste / and helpe them vp to the hyghest: than to enforme &amp; teache the lower thynges. But I wyll let passe all suche exhortatiōs / bycause eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bodye shall chose and pyke out the wayes of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng / out of these mennes authorite / rather than of my fātasie: and I wyll cōpyle rules of lyuyng. Therfore in the fyrste boke / I wyll begynne at the begynnyng of a womans lyfe / and leade her forth vnto the tyme of maryage. In the seconde / from maryage vnto wydowehede: howe she ought to passe the tyme of her life well and vertuously with her husbande. In the last boke I enforme &amp; teche the wydowhed. And bicause the matter coude nat be other wyse handeled / there be many thynges tolde in the fyrst boke / perteynynge vnto wyues &amp; wydowes: and moche in the seconde belongynge vnto vnmaried women: and some in the thyrde {per}<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynyng vnto all: Lest a mayde shuld thynke that she nede to rede but onely the fyrste boke / or a wyfe the seconde / or a wydowe onely the thyrde. I wyll y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> euery of them shall rede all. In whiche I haue ben more short / thā many wold I shuld haue ben. Nat withstandyng who so consydreth wel y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cause of myne entent / and taketh good hede / shall fynde hit done nat without a skyll. For in gyuynge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes / a man ought specially to be brefe: leste he soner dull the wyttes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> reders / thā teche them / with longe bablynge. And preceptes oughte to be suche / that euery body maye soone can them / and beare easily in mynde. Nor we shulde nat be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the lawes that Christe and his disciples / 
<pb facs="6"/>Petre / Paule / Iames / Iohn̄ / and Iude taught vs: where we maye se that they gyue vs y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> diuine preceptes brefe and shortly: For who can beare in remembrance those lawes / whiche they beare nat well in mynde / that haue spende theyr holle lyfe in study of them. And therfore haue I neither thrust in many examples / nor gone out of my matter to entreat generally of vice and vertue / whiche were a large felde to walke in: vnto thēde that my boke myght be nat only redde without tediousnes: but also be redde often. More ouer though the precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes for men be innumerable: women yet maye be enfourmed with fewe wordes. For men must be oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cupied both at home &amp; forth abrode / bothe in theyr owne matters and for the cōmon weale. Therfore hit can nat be declared in fewe bokes / but in many and longe / howe they shall handle them selfe in so many and diuers thynges. As for a woman hath no charge to se to / but her honestie and chastyte. Wherfore whan she is enfurmed of that / she is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appoynted. Wherfore theyr wyckednes is the more cursed and detestable / that go about to perisshe that one treasure of women: as though a man had but one eie / and an other wolde go about to put it out. Some wryte fylthye and baudye ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. Whiche mē I can nat se what honeste excuse they can ley for them selfe: But that theyr corrupt mynde / and swelled with poyson / can breathe non other thyng but venom / to distroye them that are nere vnto hit. But they call them selfe louers / and I beleue they be so in dede / ye and blinde &amp; madde
<pb facs="7"/>to withall. And though thou loue / canst thou nat opteyne thyne owne / except thou infecte all other therfore? In my mynde no man was euer banys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed more ryghtfully / thā was Ouide / at lest wise if he was banisshed for writyng the crafte of loue. For other write wāton and noughty balades / but this worshipful artificer / must make rules in god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dis name &amp; preceptes of his vnthriftines / a schole maister of baudry / &amp; a cōmon corrupter of vertue. Nowe I doubt nat but some wyll thynke my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes ouer sore and sharpe. Howe be it the nature of all thynges is suche / that the way of vertue is easy and large vnto good mē / and the way of vice contrarye / strayte and roughe. But vnto yll men neither the way that they go in is pleasant / nor y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> waye of vertue large and easy inough: and seyng it is so / hit is better to assent vnto good men than ill: and rather to reken y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bad folkes opinion false / than the good mennes. Pythagoras the philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher / &amp; other of his schole / in the descriptiō of this letter. Y. say / that whan a man is paste the fyrste difficulte of vertue / all after is easy and playne.</p>
   <p>Plato gyueth coūsayle to chose the best way in ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uynge: whiche way vse &amp; custome shall also make pleasant. Our lorde in the gospell saythe / that the way into the kyngdome of heuē is strayte / nat by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is so in dede / but bycause fewe go it: except a man wold coūt his wordes false / where he saith: My yocke is swete and my burthen lyght. Orels where he promyseth / that there is no mā that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goth any thynge for his sake / but he shall haue far
<pb facs="7"/>more for it agayne / yea and that in this lyfe. And what was ment therby / but the pleasures of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Therfore I se vnto whom my preceptes shal seme rigorous and sharpe / that is yonge mē / that be ignorant / wanton and vnthriftye: whiche can nat ones beare the syght of a good woman. And lyke as rāke horses neye vnto euery mare / so they go about euery tryflyng &amp; pyuysshe wenche / that hath a pleasure to be loked vpon &amp; loued. and they wolde haue theyr folye to be allowable by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tytude of mysdoers. As who sayth / the agrement &amp; abusion of people myght chaunge the nature of thynges. Hit is no newes / that il folke hate them that auyse them well. For Theophraste whan he wrote of this same matter / &amp; spake moche of mari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>age sadlye and wysely / he sette commen harlottis in his toppe. And one Leontium the concubyne of Metrodorus / started out and babled forthe a boke without all reasō / or shame / agaynst that mā most excellent in wisedome and eloquence: whiche dede was thought so intollerable / y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> as though no more hope of goodnes were lefte / ther rose vp a {pro}uerbe of that matter / that the nexte remedy was to seke a tre to go hange vpon. Saynt Hierome wryteth of hym selfe vnto the holye mayde Demetrias in this wyse: More than thyrty yere ago / I wryte a boke of virginite / in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whiche I must nedes speke agaynst vice and patefy the trappes of the deuyl / for the instruction of the maide that I taught: the whiche wrytyng many be agreued withal: whan euery one taketh the matter / as said by hym selfe / 
<pb facs="8"/>and wyll nat here me as an exhortour and counsel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loure / but lothis me as an accuser and rebuker of his doynge. Thus saythe he. Lo what maner of men we shall displease with teachynge them ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouslye: verely suche as were a shame &amp; rebuke to please: but sad men / chaste maydes / vertuous wyues / wyse wydowes / and fynallye all that are true christen people / nat onely in name but also in dede and with their hertes / wyll stande on our par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie / whiche knowe and agree all in this / that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge can be more mylde and gentyll thā the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes of our fayth. From y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whiche Christe graūt vs neuer to declyne our mynde and pourpose one heares brede. I haue put in remembrāce of theyr duete the good and holye women but sleyghtly / o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nowe and than I take vp sharpely: bycause I sawe that only techyng auayleth but a lytel / vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to those that strugle with the leader / and muste be drawen. Therfore haue I spoken sometyme the more playnly: that they myght se the filthynes of theyr condicions / as hit were paynted in a table / to thintēt that they shulde be ashamed / and at last leaue theyr shamefull dedes: And also that good womē shuld be gladder to se them selfe out of those vices / and labour more to be furder from them / &amp; to entre in to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> abitacle of vertue. For I had leauer as saint Hieronyme counsayleth / auēture my sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefastnes a lytell whyle / than ieoperde my mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: so yet that I wolde nat fall in to any vnclenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: whiche were the greattest shame that can be / for hym y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> shulde be a maister of chastite: wherfore
<pb facs="8"/>often tymes the reder must vnderstāde more in sē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence thā I speke in wordes. And this worke most excellent and gratious quene / I offre vnto you in lyke maner as if a peynter wolde bringe vnto you your owne visage and image / mooste counnyngly peynted. For like as in that purtrature you might se your bodilye simylitude: so in these bokes shall you se the resemblaūce of your mynde &amp; goodnes: bycause that you haue bene bothe mayde / wyfe / and wydowe / and wyfe agayne: as I praye god you maye longe contynue: and so you haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led your selfe in all thordre and course of your lyfe: that what so euer you dyd myght be an example vnto other to lyue after. But you had leauer the vertues to be preysed than your selfe: howe be hit no man canne preyse the vertues of women / but he must nedes cōprehende you in the same preyse: howe be it your mynde ought to be obeyed. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you shall vnderstande / that many lyke vnto you be preysed here / by name expressely: but your selfe spoken of continually / though you be nat na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For vertues can neuer be preysed / but they muste nedes be preysed with all / that be excellent in them / thoughe theyr name be nat spoken of.</p>
   <p>Also your dereste daughter Mary shall rede these instructions of myne / and folowe in lyuyng / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che she muste nedes do: if she ordre her selfe after thexāple that she hath at home with her of your vertue and wysedome. Nor there is no doubt / but she wyll do after them / and excepte she alone of all other / dysapoynt and begyle euerye mannes opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion / 
<pb facs="9"/>she muste nedes be bothe very good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / that is comme of you and noble kyng Henry y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> viij. suche a couple of mates: that your honour &amp; vertue passe all craftes of preysynge. Therfore all other women shall haue an example of your lyfe and dedes: and by these bokes that I haue dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated vnto your name / theys shall haue rules and preceptes to lyue by: and so shall they be bounden vnto your goodnes / bothe for that / whiche it selfe hath done in gyuyng example: and that hit hath ben thoccasion of my wrytyng. And so I pray god gyue your good grace longe well to fare. At Bruges the yere of our lorde. M.D. and .xxiij. the v. day of A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prile.</p>
