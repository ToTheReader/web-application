amongst all the conceits you shall finde in
this Booke, all are not pithie, though the

so, the brauery of the learned is so great a blemish to him
that hath little, that he feareth to proceede, not daring to step a
foot without a pardon. Such are the ingenious inuentiōs (right
noble minded and courteous Ladies) so plentifully sent to your
perusing, that (were it not the bountiful respect of your gentle
iudgements, did assure me to taste of your friendly fauour) <hi>I</hi>
