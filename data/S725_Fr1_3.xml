      </gap> know thy selfe, I was not without much vnwillingnes drawn to preach this Sermon at the Crosse, not being ignorant either of mine owne weakenesse, or of the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse of so great a taske, and with much more vnwillingnesse was I ouercome to commit it to the presse, for my resolution was that as my subiect is of the Rainebowe, so my Sermon should haue beene like the Rainebowe, not a permament but a vanishing Bowe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to the eies of some few, not remaining to be scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the iudgements of all; for <hi>comes calami calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/> as there are many colours of that Rainebowe in the cloudes, so I am sure there will be many censurers of this my Rainebowe at the Crosse; that of the Apostle may be applyed, <hi>vnus sic, alter autem sic,</hi> one iudging after this manner, another after that, one speaking well, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ill. But as commaunding Authoritie was the cause of the former so ouerruling importunitie, hath effected the latter, and now like an infant new borne, my Bowe is come naked into the world, and without a case. It was the saying of the spouse in the Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, wee haue a little sister and shee hath no breasts; and I may say the like of this; I haue a little birde and shee wanteth wings; yet flie shee must into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ayre, and shift for her selfe: But alas what can shee doe, before her winges bee growne, or her sicke feathers come to ripenesse? It is impossible that shee should escape, and not be torne in peeces by the sharpe eied vultures, (the Time-consuming critickes) of our time, except some princely Eagle shall in pittie to so poore a wanderer, shadow her with the winges of protection; Your Honorable disposition Right Noble Lord, in giuing incouragement to the Ministers of Christ, hath emboldened this little birde to shroud her selfe vnder the roofe of your Honorable fauour, and my selfe to dedicate this firstlinge of my studies vnto your Lordshippe, whome (with a most thankefull heart) I must euer acknowledge, my first incourager in my worke, since I haue beene a poore and vnworthy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer in the vineyard of Christ. And if at this time I may obtaine your Honorable loue in accepting this small token of my thankefulnesse, for those many and
<pb facs="4"/> vndeserued fauours, conferred vpon me by your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and by that most Noble Knight (your Right worthy Sonne) Sir <hi>William Spencer,</hi> I shall receiue a most comfortable incitement to goe one forwards in my studies, and bee for euer bound to praie for a blessed increase of all graces spirituall and temporall, both for this life and the life to come, vnto your Lordshippe, your Honorable Sonne, with his Right Noble Ladie, all your Honourable progenie, and their posteritie for euer: Resting vntill Death.</p>
