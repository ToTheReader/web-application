      <hi>Barnabe Barnes</hi> his Preface to the honourable and discrete Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue apportioned my foure bookes of Offices (wherin certaine speciall qualities and principles are expressed for generall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and the choise both of ciuill and martiall ministers in euery Commonwealth) vnto the foure vertues cardinall. For as much therefore as royall treasure (being the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of euery state, without which no principalities can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, or augment) ought to be mistically couched within the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine treasure Temperance (which is the moderator &amp; guide of her other three sister vertues ensuing) I therefore haue placed Temperance in this first Paralel, considering the resemblance which it should haue with a Princes treasure, so well in the manner of getting &amp; leuying, as in the sauing &amp; disbursing of mony by discrete moderation; which office of Treasurers possesseth the first booke of these offices.</p>
   <p>Prudence the substance of my second booke (deciphered &amp; figuredin the secret counsellors office) participateth of that reasonable moderation, which is expressed in the first. Also Temperāce the treasurer with a gracious mildnes &amp; motherly decency prudently pondereth and examineth all her actions, which are right noble and many, with her passions. Yet is it contrauertible whether temperance be passionate or no; though one of her sweetest graces gouerneth in patience.</p>
   <p>My third booke comprehendeth Iustice, which is in all causes seasoned with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite moderation and taste of ingenuous temperance, and prudence: temperance being of it selfe an indifferencie void of extremitie, viuely representeth Iustice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incorporate with equitie and prudence: because with a certaine prouident cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection it iustly weigheth all things in the balance of reason.</p>
   <p>My fourth booke (in the same rancke conteining certaine qualities of a true soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier) heroically representeth Fortitude; which with Temperance expressed in her patience, with Prudence in her foresight, and actions of honourable perill, with Iustice in the execution and maintenance of right, without any tolleration of publicke violence sisterly combineth: whereas semblably temperance in her bridling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining of inordinate appetite, prudence in her stout and constant equabilitie, Iustice in her seuere and firme equalitie (being merely pure from all blemishes of feare and affection) are all in themselues a fortitude.</p>
   <p>This is a diuine harmonie representing mentally by due distribution of humane charitie, the sacred vnison of mans soule sanctified with God. This is that mysterie
<pb facs="9"/>
which <hi>Hermes, Salomon, Pythagoras, Solon, Plato, Socrates, &amp; Aristotle,</hi> haue all of them oracularly shadowed in their eternities of wisedome: and by these foure are all blessed Monarchies, Kingdomes, Commonweales, and policies susteined, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, directed and protected, that is by Temperance, Prudence, Iustice and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, shadowed as I said in the Treasurer, Counsellour, Iudge, and Souldier: for they be moderate, wise, iust, and valiant alike; that not any difference of their places is discerned, which of them may be greater or lesse then another.</p>
   <p>To this harmonious consent or concordance (whose ground in v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ison consisteth of a <hi>medium,</hi> which is the moderator or nauel-string of this unspeakeable musicke, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the concealed and misticall accord of the numberlesse starres and planets contuning by the ineffable power of the most Almightie God in number and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonie; by which sacredforce he worketh his will in all creatures: from fat all influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of which diuine torches of light, by the most miraculous power of the most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie mouer, all worldly chaunces happen; which some not well aduised haue called the wheele of fortune) there are extreames by the most metaphisicall disposition ordained preuaricating or transgressing those foure diuine centres, or moderators, which I doe thus denominate, define, and distribute.</p>
   <p>To Temperance therefore my first countertenor, one base, and one alie: for out of discords with the countertenor (being moderator) is the concord composed of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmonie. The base hereof is couetous and vnnecessarie penurie when ability doth sufficiently reabound; the triple or alteis raised from extreame profusion or excesse, making a shrill and riotous confusion of all: one of these extreames continually conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in basenesse and the other in haughtinesse throughout; as in the rest ensuing.</p>
   <p>To Prudence which is my second countertenor or moderator, the base falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to follie; the triple or alte lifteth it selfe into malicious wilinesse and calliditie. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth follie participate with the first being couetousnesse, in that it wanteth a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable discretion to make vse and comfort of Gods blessings bestowed: In extreame opposition thereof malicious craft or wilinesse accordeth with the first alte, that in publike and priuate affaires, it is a secret consumer; as extreame profusion or prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie wasteth both publike and priuate treasure; the persons qualitie being considered.</p>
   <p>Thirdly to iustice which is my next moderator, the vile base is dissolute indulgence or secure lenitie, when honestie by the couin of iniquitie lieth mortally wounded, and iniquitie scaping punishment receiueth honour and support: the triple or alte, extreme crueltie. Dissolute lenitie therefore in this consenteth with the first base which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led couetousnesse or vnreasonable sparing; for as much as contrarie to reason, it coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a confusion of other mens estates by sparing the wicked; as couctise doth of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens possessions by sauing of her owne, herein alluding to the second base which is follie: because such kind of foolish pittie or mercie (as some men ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>e it) cannot haue any taste of discretion or charitie. Likewise extreame crueltie consenteth oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely with the first alte prodigalitie thus; by being so lauish and prodigall of blood as that other is of treasure: and with the second alte being craftie wilinesse; that in the prodigall effusion of blood, or in the tragicall end of impious, nefarious and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous treasons, conspiracies, and murthers, malicious craftinesse from crueltie diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>
Fourthly to fortitude (which is the last moderator) the base is basenesse of spirit or pusillanimitie, proceeding from inordinate sloath, feare, and luxurie, which is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, or rather mancipation of the mind to slauish and brutish affections, passions and perturbations, when appetite tyrannizeth ouer reason: the triple or alte audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temeritie. Pusill animitie therefore in this consenteth with miserable and auari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious sparing (which is the first base) that it is as fearefull and miserably parsimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious of a little harish blood, when honourable causes sommon it like a iudge in skarlet iustly to defend his owne with the guard of his heroicall spirits, and to contend for right; as that other basenesse is of treasure when speciall reasons doe most require a liberalitie: and with the second base being follie thus; that there can not appeare any more foolishnesse, then when people timerously and basely without resistance damne themselues voluntarily slaues to the tyrannous gallies of their owne inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enemies, wheras with a little paines and knitting of themselues vp together they might restraine or vanquish them both: also with the third base, which is secure leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for what weakenesse and abiection of mind can be discerned in one more then in another? for lenitie wilfully confoundeth euery priuate and publike estate; whereas basenesse or softnesse of spirit or pusillanimitie (the persons qualitie being respected) doth the same. Furthermore audacious temeritie, which violently without reason doth precipitate it selfe into perils herein oppositely concordeth with prodigalitie being the first alte; that it is more profuse (if possible) in effusion of blood, in rash partitipation and abbarretting of mutinies and quarrels then that other excesse is of treasure, of vnreasonable and inconsiderate expenses riot and surfeits: and with the second alte which is malicious wilinesse and calliditie; that whereas wrath and the venemous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of reuenge doth in a kind of desperation and temeritie, rush into the turbulent seas of danger: so doth malicious wilines by the secret labyrinths, snares, &amp; curious traps of mortall villainies make vp the mouth of mischiefe to bring about her diuelish designes; both of them being alike deepe in blood: and with the third alte or triple (being cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie which is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ast consent in opposition with audacious temeritie) herein appeareth the finall concord of these discords euen that which reason and nature teacheth vs; how no greater cruelty can be shewed then that a man either vpon mere malice or some other hellish and fierie passion of wrath or blind affection (as a principall in the murther of himselfe (should rashly, violently, and irremediably croude into the speare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed troupe of perils, as <hi>Curtius</hi> and <hi>Decius,</hi> one mounted in armes on horseback to satisfie the wrath of the gods, vpon the maine carriere entred and was swallowed vp in the fierie gul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>e, which prodigiously did exhale sulphurous and vnquenchable flames: the other being consul, armed in a Romane lacke or brigandine (as <hi>Liuy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth) did single on the same fashion run with full speede in gallop amid the battels of his enemies the Latines: and sacrificed himselfe for weale of the Romane hoast; where he thrasting his life into the very throats of his enemies choaked them that swallowedit.</p>
   <p>So that to conclude with this consent of discords; being the certaine confusion of euery the most florishing state where it tragically noiseth; as the first harmonious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance of the sphoericall vertues is the corroboration and amplification of euery kingdome which is formerly noted: so doe I say that Temperance is valiant, iust, and wise: Prudence is temperate, valiant, and iust; Iustice is wise, temperate, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
<pb facs="10"/>
valor is iust, wise and temperat. In opposition semblably because the geometricall &amp; analogicall harmonie draweth these other rebels, excrescents, or excrements of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue rather, to this vniuersall muster, that they may be precisely viewed and measured by the cube of reason; receiuing prest and wages answerable to their natures and qualities: also for as much as it may be misconstrued by such as are more learned, or some that percase louen opposition, I will leaue this as a Paradox, whether auaritious misers be foolish, vniust, and timerous, whether timerous persons be miserable, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and vniust, whether vniust men be timerous, miserable and foolish, and whether fooles are vniust, timerous and miserable. In opposition likewise <hi>ex diametro,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prodigals in their actions generally be not audacious, cruell, and craftie: whether craftie knaues to fet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>h about their diuises be not prodigall, audacious, and cruell: if cruell fellows in their hopes or rather feares be not craftie, prodigall, and audacious: and if audacious persons in their distracted humors of desire, reuenge &amp; coller proue not cruell, craftie and prodigall. For a man (if he would perfectly know the secrets of gouernment) must warily serch forth these infestious leprosies of States; considering how there is not any good or bad in man-kinde, which is not contained in these oppositions: the causes of which euils being perfectly knowne, and presently remoued, all their effects of daunger must of force presently be drawne away with them. And he which cannot skill of this my concatenation, my wheele, or rather the true loue knot, and labyrinth of vertues with their opposites (though in other matters he vainely thinke himselfe wise) yet shall vndoubtedly misiudge of other mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, attributing and adiudgeing improperly good and bad qualities to people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary their depraued or natiue inclinations: nay moreouer I dare affirme, that he which shall perfectly learne and practise this Lesson shall soone attaine the true knowledge of himselfe.</p>
   <p>To conclude therefore, least I stand vpon these points more curiously then accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, I say that those kingdomes or Commonweales are blessed and victorious, whose Treasurers are valiant, iust, and prudent; whose counsellers are temperate, valiant &amp; iust: whose iudges are prudent, temperate, and valiant, whose captaines are iust, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and temperate: such as for example <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> whom <hi>Liuie</hi> magnifieth for his excellent quickenesse and dexteritie fit for all noble offices; as in the whole course of his life temperate and decored with moderation; as in his admirable wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and sagacity to counsaile and direct in the most serious affaires of his countrey; as of his Iustice and skill in the lawes, which was incomparable; with his great courage &amp; valor in the wars, which was inuincible: al which I mentioned in my second booke. And in such accōplished magistrates which by these instructiōs here insuing are made absolute is cōteined the whole morall force of a most gratious &amp; ample monarchie.</p>
   <p>These my beneuolent (though simple) Elucubrations, recommending heartily to your honorable constructions, I wish your welfare as mine owne; which if you with good Aequanimitie shall take fauourably, then haue I wonne the largest stipend of my studies that I could either trauaile or wish for. But if persons of vnindifferent cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and iudgement (as amongst many, there bee which may more then saltly taxe my labours) shall shew some seueritie more then criticall, their malignitie cannot preuaile; because I shall accompt no time mispent, which tending so much to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit of our yong country men is bestowed vpon such morall considerations.</p>

      <signed>Yours resolued and assuredly B. B.</signed>
