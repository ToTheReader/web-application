      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Diuines of the olde Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were their Morall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers: These receiued the <hi>Acts</hi> of an inbred law, in
<pb facs="4"/>
the <hi>Sinai</hi> of Nature, and deliuered them with manie expositions to the multitude: These were the Ouerseers of maners, Correctors of vices, Directors of liues, Doctors of vertue, which yet taught their people the body of their naturall Diuinitie, not after one maner; while some spent themselues in deepe discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of humane felicitie and the way to it in common; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thought best to applie the generall precepts of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or decencie, to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb facs="4"/>
conditions and persons: A third sort in a mean course betwixt the two other, and compounded of them both, bestowed their time in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the true lineaments of euery vertue and vice, so liuely, that who saw the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, might know the face: which Art they significantly termed <hi>Charactery.</hi> Their papers were so many tables, their writings so many spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king pictures, or liuing ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whereby the ruder mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude might euen by their
<pb facs="5"/>
sense learne to know vertue, and discerne what to detest. I am deceiued if any course could be more likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile; for heerein the grosse conceit is led on with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and informed while it feeles nothing but delight: And if pictures haue beene accounted the books of idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, beholde heere the benefit of an image without the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. It is no shame for vs to learne wit of Heathens, neither is it materiall, in whose Schoole we take out a
<pb facs="5"/>
good lesson: yea, it is more shame not to follow their good, than not to leade them better. As one therefore that in worthy examples hold imitation better than inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have trod in their paths, but with an higher &amp; wider step; and out of their <hi>Tablets</hi> haue drawen these larger portraitures of both sorts. More might be sayd, I denie not of euery vertue, of euery vice: I desired not to say all, but enough. If thou do but read or like these, I
<pb facs="6"/>
haue spent good houres ill; but if thou shalt hence ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure those vices, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou thoughtest not ill-fauoured, or fall in loue with any of these goodly faces of vertue; or shalt hence finde where thou hast anie little touch of these euils, to cleere thy selfe, or where any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in these graces to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it, neither of vs shall need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of our labor.</p>
