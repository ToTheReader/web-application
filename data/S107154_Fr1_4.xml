   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I did firlie sett my hande to thys woorke, I thoughte nothyng lesse (moste noble Kyng) than to write any thyng that afterwarde should be presented to your maiestie. Only my mynde was to teache certaine introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherby they that are touched with some zeale of religion myght bee instructed to true godlynesse. And this trauayle I tooke principally for my contremen the Frenchemen, of whō I vnderstode very many to hunger and thirst for Christe, but I sawe very fewe that had rightly receiued so much as any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knowlege of him. And that this was my meanyng, the boke it selfe declareth, beyng framed after a simple and playne maner of teachyng. But when I perceyued, that the furious rage of some wycked men hath so farre preuailed in your realme, that in it there is no roome for sounde doctrine: I thought I should doo a thyng worthe my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, all in one worke bothe to geue an instruction for them, and to declare a confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you: wherby ye may learne what maner of doctrine that is, agaynst which those furious men burne in so great rage, who at this day trouble your realme with sweard and fyer. For I will not feare to confesse, that I haue in this woorke comprehended in maner the summe of that selfe same doctrine, agaynst which they crie out, that it ought to be punished with prisonment, banishement, condemnation without iudgement, and with fyer, that it ought to be chaced away by lande and sea. I knowe in dede with how haynous informations they haue fylled your mynde and eares, to make our cause most hatefull vnto you: but this of your clemencie ought you to weye, that there shalbe no innocence, neither in wordes nor dedes, if it may be enough to accuse. Truely if any, to bryng the same in hatred, shall allege that this Doctrine whereof I now go about to yelde accompt vnto you, hath ben long agoe condemned by consente of all degrees, and atteynted by many iugementes allready geuen in iudicial courtes: al that he sayth shall amount to no more but that it hath partly ben violently throwen downe by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>anding and power of the aduersaries therof, and partly ben traitorously and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently oppressed with their lyes and suttle practises and sclaunders. Herein is violence shewed, that without hearyng the cause bloody sentēces are pronoūced against it: here in is Fraude, that it is without deseruyng accused of sedition and euel doyng. And that none may thynke that we wrongfully complayne of these thynges, you your selfe can beare vs witnesse, moste noble Kyng, with how lyeng sclaunders it is dayely accused vnto you: as, that it tendeth to no other ende but to writhe from Kynges their scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters oute of their handes, to throwe downe all iudges seates and iudgementes, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte all orders and ciuile gouernementes, to trouble the peace and quiete of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to abolish al lawes, to vndo all proprieties and possessions, finally to turne al thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vpsyde downe. And yet you heare the smallest portion. For horrible thynges they spreade abroade among the people: whiche if they were true, the whole worlde myghte worthily iudge it with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> mainteiners therof, worthy of a thousande fiers and gallowes, Who can now maruell that a common hatred is kindled agaynst it, where suche moste wrongfull accusations are beleued. Loe, thys is the cause that all degrees agree and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire to the condemning of vs and our doctrine. They that sit to iudge, beeing rauished with this affection pronounce for sentences their freconceiued determinations whyche they brought from home with them: and thinke that they haue well enough discharged their duties if they commaunde no man to be drawen to execution, but suche as are founde gylty eyther by theyr owne confession or by sufficient witnesse. But of what fault? of that condēned doctrine, say they. But by what law cōdemned? Herein should haue stande the succor of defense for them, not to denie the doctrine it selfe, but to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine it for true. But here is all libertie ones to mutter vtterly cutt of from vs.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>Wherefore I doe not vniustly require, most victorious king, that it maye please you to take into your owne hande the whole hearing of the cause whiche hetherto hath ben troblesomly handled or rather carelesly tossed without al order of law, more by outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heate than iudiciall grauitie. Neyther yet thynke, that I here goe about to make myne owne priuate defense, whereby I may procure to my selfe a safe returne into my natiue contree, to whiche althoughe I beare such affection of naturall loue as becometh me: yet as the case nowe is, I not miscontentedly want it. But I take vppon me the common cause of all the Godly, yea and the cause of Christe himselfe, whiche at thys day hauing ben by all meanes torne and troden downe in your kyngdome, lyeth as it were in despeired case, and that in dede rather by the tyranny of certaine Pharisees, than by your owne knowlege. But howe that cometh to passe, it is not here nedeful to tell: truely it lyeth in great distresse. For thus farr haue the vngodly preuailed, that the truethe of Christ, be not destroyed beyng chaced away and scattered abrode, yet it lyeth hydden as buried and vnregarded: as for the silly poore Chirch it is eyther wasted with cruell slaughters, and so dryuen away with banishmentes or dismayed with threatens and terrors that it dare not ones open her mouth. And yet stil they continue with such rage and fercenesse as they are wont, thru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ting strongly against the wall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy bending and the ruine whiche themselues haue made. In the meane tyme no mā steppeth fourth, to set hymselfe in defense agaynst suche furies. And they, if there be any suche, that will moste of all seme to fauor the truthe, say no more but that it were good to pardon the error and vnskilfulnesse of ignorante men. For thus the good natured men forsoothe do speake, calling that error and vnskilfulnesse whiche they knowe to be the most certaine trueth of God: calling them ignorante men, whoes witt they see that Christe hath not so despised but that he hath vouchesaued to communicate to them the mysteries of hys heauenly wysedome. So muche are all ashamed of the Gospell. It shalbe your office (most noble King) not to turne away your eares nor youre mynde f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ō so iust a defense: specially when so great a mater is in question: namely how the glorie of God may be mainteined safe in earth, how y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> trueth of God may kepe her honor, how Christ may haue hys kyngdome preserued whole among vs. Thys is a mater worthy for your eares, worthy for your iugement, worthy for your royall throne. For, euen this thoughte maketh a true King: to acknowlege hymselfe in the gouernance of hys kyngdome to be the minister of God. Neyther doth he now vse a kyngdome but a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie, which reigneth not to thys ende that he may serue the glorie of God. And he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that loketh for a long prosperitie of that kyngdome, whiche is not ruled by the scepter of God, that is, by hys holy worde: forasmuche as the heauenly Oracle can not proue vayne whereby it is proclaymed, that the people shalbe scattered abrode where prophecie sayleth.<note place="margin">Pro. xxix.xviii.</note> Neyther oughte the contempt of our basenesse to withdrawe you from thys purpose. We verily knowe right wel, howe poore and abiecte silly men we be, namely in the sighte of God miserable sinners, in the sight of men most despised per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones, yea and (if you wil) certaine excrementes &amp; outcastes of the world, or whatsoeuer vil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>r thing may be named: so that there remaineth nothyng for vs to glorie vpon before God, but hys onely mercie whereby we are without any our deseruing receiued into the hope of eternall saluation: and before men, nothyng but our weakenesse, whiche among them it is taken for a most great shame to confesse so much as in countenance. But our doctrine must be auaunced hye aboue all glorie of the worlde, muste stande vnuanquishable aboue all power: because it is not oures, but the doctrine of the liuing God and of hys Christe,<note place="margin">Dan. ii.xxxii. Esai. xi.iiii. Psa. ii.ix.</note> whome the Father hath appoynted Kyng to beare rule euen from sea to sea, and from the riuers euen to the endes of the earth: and so to beare rule, that strykyng the whole earth wyth the onely rod of hys mouth, he may breake it with all the iron and brasen strength, with all the golden and syluer glittering therof, as it were potters vessels: as the Prophetes prophecie of the royaltie of his kingdome. Our aduersaries in dede do crye out to the contrary, and say that we falsly pretende the woorde of GOD, whereof we be most wicked corrupters. But howe thys is not only a malicious sclaunder, but also a notable shamelessnesse, you your selfe by reding our confession, may according to your wysedome iudge. Yet here it is also good to say som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, eyther to moue you to willingnesse and hedefulnesse, or at the least to prepare you a way to the reding of it.<note place="margin">Ro. xii.vi</note> Paul, whē he willed al prophecie to be framed to the agreable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Fayth, hath set a most sure rule wherby the expounding of Scripture ought to
<pb facs="4"/>
be tryed. Now if our doctrine be examined by thys rule of Fayth, the victorie is allredy in our handes. For, what doth better or more fittly agree with Fayth, than to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege our selues naked of al vertue, that of God we may be clothed? emptye of all good, that of him we may be filled? the bonde seruantes of sinne, that of him we may be made fre? blinde, that of hym we maye be enlightened? lame, that of hym we maye be made streight? feble, that of hym we may be vpholden? to take from our selues all mater of glorieng, that he alone may be glorious on hie, and in him we may glorie? Whē we say these and such like thinges, they interrupt vs and cry out, that by thys meane is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen I wote not what blinde light of nature, fained preparations, freewill, workes meritorious of eternall saluation, together with their supererogations: because they can not abide that the whole praise and glorie of al goodnesse, vertue, righteousnesse, and wisdome shoulde remayne in God. But we rede not that they were blamed that haue drawen to much out of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> fountayne of liuing water:<note place="margin">Iere. ii.xiii.</note> on y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> contrary syde they are sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuked which haue digged to themselues pittes, broken pittes, which are not able to holde water. Againe what is more agreable with Fayth, than to promyse to themselues that God wil be to them a fauourable Father, where Christ is acknowleged to be a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and procurer of fauor? than assur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>dly to loke for al thinges ioyfull and prosperous at hys hande, whoes unspeakable loue towarde vs hath proceded so farr, that he hath not spared his only begotten sonne,<note place="margin">Rom. viii xxxii.</note> but that he gaue hym for vs? than to rest in sure loking for saluation and eternall lyfe, where we thynke vpon Christe geuen of the Father, in whom such treasures are hidden? Here they stepp in against vs, and crye out that thys certaintie of affiance is not without arrogance and presumption. But as nothing of our selues, so al thinges ought we to presume of God: and we are for none other reson spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of vayne glorie, but that we should learne to glorie in the Lord. What is there more<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Consider (most mightie Prince) al the partes of our cause,<note place="margin">i. Timo. iiii.x. Ioh. xvii.iii.</note> and thynke that we are worse than any kynde of wycked men, vnlesse you playnly fynde that we are in troble and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at because we put our trust in the liuing God: becaue we beleue that this is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lyfe, to know one true God, and hym whom he hath sent Iesus Christe. For thys hope some of vs are bounde in irons, some are whypped, some are caryed about in moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kage, some are condemned without iugement, some are most cruelly tormented, some escape, away by flight: but al are distressed w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> troble, al are most terribly accursed, torne with sclaunders, and handled in most haynous wise. Now loke vpon our aduersaries (I speake of the degree of Prestes, at whoes becke and wil the other exercise ennimities against vs) and consider with me a litle while, with what zele they be caryed. As for the true religion, which is taught in the Scriptures, &amp; which ought to be holden certaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong al men, they easily geue leaue bothe to themselues and other to be ignorant of it, to neglect &amp; despise it: &amp; they thynke that it maketh smal mater what euery man beleue or not beleue concerning God and Christ, so that he do with an vnexpressed Fayth (as they cal it) submit hys mynde to the iugement of the Chirch: neither are they much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued if it happen that the glorie of God be defiled with manifest blasphemies, so that no man lift vp hys fynger agaynst the supremicie of the Apostolike sea, and authoritie of our holy mother the Chirch. Why therfore do they with so great crueltie and fercenesse fight for the Masse, Purgatorie, Pilgrimages, and such trifles, so farr fourth that they say that without most expressed Fayth (as I may so call it) of these thinges, godlinesse cā not stande, wheras yet they proue not that any of these thynges come out of the word of God: Why so, but because their belly is their God, their kitchen is their religion: which being taken away, they thynke that they shall not onely be no Christians, but also no men? For though some of them do plentuously glutt themselues, and other some lyue with gnawyng of poore crustes: yet they liue all of one pott, whiche without these war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning helpes should not only waxe colde, but also throughly freese. Therfore how much more euery of them is careful for hys belly, so much more earnest warrier he is for their Fayth. Finally they all endeuor themselues to thys, to kepe still eyther bothe kingdome safe, and their belly full: but of pure zele none of them sheweth any token be it neuer so little. Neither yet so do they cesse to sclaūder our doctrine, and by al the colors that they can to accuse and defame it, wherby they may bryng it into hatred or suspicion. They cal it newe, and lately forged: they cauill that it is doutefull, and vncertayne: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde by what miracles it is confirmed: they aske whether it be mete that it should preuayle agaynste the consente of so many holy Fathers, and the moste aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente
<pb facs="5"/>
custome: they presse vpon vs to cōfesse it to be schismaticall, whiche moueth warr againste the Chirche, or that the Chirche hath lyen dead in many ages in whiche no suche thyng hath ben heard of. Last of all they saye that there nede no argumentes, for (say they) it may by the frutes be iudged of what sorte it is, namely which hath bredde so huge a heape of sectes, so many turmoyles of seditions, so great licentiousnesse of vices. Truely full easy it is, for them, to triumph vpon a forsaken cause before the lyght bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and ignorant multitude. But if we might also haue our turne likewise allowed vs to speake, verily thys sharpe heate woulde sone be cooled wherewith they doe so with full month and as licentiously as vnpunishedly some agaynst vs.</p>
   <p>Firste whereas they call it newe, they dooe greate wrong to God, whoes holy worde deserued not to be accused of newenesse. To them in dede I nothing dout that it is new, to whom Christ is new, and hys Gospell is new. But they which knewe that preaching of Paule to be olde,<note place="margin">Rom. iiii xxv.</note> that Iesus Christ dyed for our synnes, and rose agayne for oure iustification, shall fynde nothyng newe among vs. Wheras it hath long lyen hidden vnknowen, and buried: that is the fault of the vngodlynesse of men. Nowe sithe it is by the bountifulnesse of God restored to vs, it ought at least by ryght of full restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to receiue agayne the title of auncientie.</p>
   <p>Out of the same fountayne of ignorance springeth thys, that they take it for doutful and vncertayne. Thys verily is it which the Lorde by hys Prophet complayneth, that the oxe knew hys owner,<note place="margin">Esa. i.iii.</note> and the asse hys masters stall, but hys people knewe not hymn. But howsoeuer they mocke at the vncertaintie of it: if they were dryuen to seale theyr owne doctrine with their owne blood and with losse of their lyfe, men mighte see howe much they set by it. But farre other is our affiance, which dredeth neyther the terrors of death, nor yet the very iugement seate of God.</p>
   <p>Wheras they require miracles of vs, they deale vnreasonably wyth vs. For we coine no new Gospell, but holde fast the selfe same Gospell for confirming of the truth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of al the miracles do serue that euer Christ and his Apostles haue done. But thys thyng they haue speciall aboue vs, that they can euen to thys day confirme their faith with cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall miracles. Yea but rather they allege miracles, which may weakē a minde other wyse wel stablished: they are so eyther tryflyng and worthy to be laughed at, or vayne and lyeng. And yet, although they were neuer so monstruous, they oughte not to haue ben of any value agaynste the worde of God: forasmuche as the name of God oughte both in euery place and euery time to be hallowed, whether it be by miracles or by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall order of thynges. Thys false color myght paraduenture haue made the better shew,<note place="margin">Mar. xvi.xx. Acte. xiiii.iii.</note> if the Scripture did not informe vs of the lawful ende and vse of miracles. For, Marke teacheth that the sygnes which folowed the preaching of the Apostles were sett fourth for the confirming of it: Likewyse Luke also sayth that the Lord dyd beare wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the worde of his grace, when signes and wonders were shewed by the handes of the Apostles. Wherwith wholly agreeth that sayeng of the Apostle, that when the Gospell was preached,<note place="margin">Hebr. ii.iiii.</note> saluation was confirmed by thys that the Lorde did beare witnesse to it with signes, and wonders, and diuerse powers. But those thinges whiche we heare to be the sealinges of the Gospel, shal we turne to the destroyeng of the credit of the Gospell? those thinges which are appointed onely to stablishe the trueth, shal we applye to confirming of lyes? Therefore it is mete that the doctrine, whiche (as the Euangelist sayeth) goeth before miracles,<note place="margin">Ioh. vii.xviii. &amp; viii.l.</note> be firste examined and tryed. If that be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, then it maye lawfully take confirmation of miracles. But of a true doctrine (as Christe teacheth) thys is the marke, if it tende not to the seking of the glorie of men, but of God. Sithe Christe affirmeth thys to be the profe of doctrine, miracles are wrongfully estemed whiche are drawen to any other ende than to glorifie the name of God alone. And we oughte to remember that Satā hath hys miracles, which although they be iuggling deceites rather than true powers, yet are suche as may decciue the ignorante and vnskillfull. Magicians and enchaunters haue been alwaye famous in miracles: wonderfull miracles haue nourished idolatrie: whiche yee doe not proue to vs that the superstition of Magicians and idolatrers is lawfull. And wyth thys batterynge ramme in olde tyme the Donatistes dyd shake the simplicitie of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, for that they excelled in miracles. Therefore we doe nowe make the same answere to oure aduersaries which Augustine then made to the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes:<note place="margin">
         <hi>In Iho. trac.</hi> 13.</note> that the Lorde hath made vs ware agaynste suche miracle workers, when he
<pb facs="5"/>
foretold that there shold come false Prophetes, which with lyeng signes and diuers won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders shold,<note place="margin">Mathe. xxiiii.xxiiii. 1. Thess. ii.ix. ii. Corin. xi.xiiii. <hi>Hieron. in prefa. Ierem.</hi> ii. Thess. ii.xi.</note> if it were possible, bryng the elect into error. And Paule hath geuen warning that the kyngdome of Antichrist should be with all power, and signes, and lyeng won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. But these miracles (say they) are doon not of idoles, not of sorceres, not of false prophetes, but of the Saintes. As though we knewe not that this is the craft of Satan, to transfigure himselfe into an Angell of lyght. In olde tyme the Egyptians worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Ieremie which was buried among them, with sacrifices and other diuine honors. Did not they abuse the holy Prophet of God to idolatrie? And yet by suche worshipping of his tombe they obteined that they thought the healyng of the styngyng of serpentes to be the iust rewarde therof. What shall we say: but that this hath ben and euer shall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be the moste iust vengeance of God, to sende strength of illusion to them that haue not receiued the loue of truth, that they may beleue lieng? Therfore we want not miracles, and those certaine and not subiecte to cauillations. As for miracles whiche they bring foorth for themselues, they are mere illusions of Satan, forasmuch as they leade awaye the people from the true worshippyng of their God to vanitie.</p>
   <p>Moreouer they do sclaunderously sett the Fathers agaynst vs (I meane the auncient Fathers and the writers of the age as yet more vncorrupted) as though they had them for mainteners of their vngodlynesse: by whose authoritie if the debate were to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the better part of the victorie (to speake euen most modestlie) wold bend to our side. But wheras many thynges haue ben excellentlye well and wisely written of those Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and in some thynges, that hath happened to them which is wont to happen to mē: these good naturall children forsothe, accordyng to the rightenesse that they haue bothe of witt, iudgement and mynde, doo worship onely their faultes and errors: and those thynges which are well spoken, they eyther marke not, or fayne as if they knew them not, or do corrupt them: so as a man may say that their care was altogether to gather dong in of the golde of the Fathers. Then they oppresse vs with importunate cryeng out agaynst vs, as despisers and ennemies of the Fathers. But wee doo so not despise them, that if it were the mater of my present purpose, I could very easily proue by their consentyng voices the greater part of these thynges that we say at this daye. But we so reade their writynges, that we alway remembre, that all thynges are ours, to serue vs, not to haue dominion ouer vs: and that we are Christes alone, whome we muste obeye in all thynges withoute exception. Who so keepeth not this choise, shall haue nothyng certaine in religion:<note place="margin">Pro. xxli.xxviii.

Not without cause (say they) we are warned of Salomō, that we passe not the old boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des whiche our Fathers haue sett. But there is all not all one rule in the boundyng of fieldes, and the obedience of Faith, which ought to be so framed that it forget her people and the house of her Father.

But if they will haue the boundes of the same Fathers, whome they meane, to be stedfastly kept: why doo they, so oft as they list, so licentiously passe them? Of the number of the Fathers were they, of whome the one sayd, that our God eateth not, nor drinketh, and that therfore he nedeth neither cuppes nor dyshes: the other sayd, that the holy thynges require not golde, and that those thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges please not with golde whiche are not bought with golde.

This bounde also they haue passed, when they placed the ydoll and harrell bealies of monkes in stewes and brothelhowses to be fatted with other meanes substance.

These boundes also they haue taken away, when they haue by an inuiolable law commaūded the selfe same thyng which the one of these Fathers punished with excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and the other reproued with a strong reason. A Father was he, whiche af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it to be rashenesse to determine any thyng of a doutefull mater on the one side or the other without cleere and euident witnessyngs of the Scripture. This bound they forgot, when they stablished so many constitutions, so many canons, so many maisterly determinations without any woord of God. A Father was he, which among other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies reproched Montanus with this that he was the firste that had charged men with lawes of Fastynges. This bounde also they haue farre passed, when they commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fastyng with moste streyght lawes. A Father was he whyche denied that mariage ought to be forbidden to ministers of the Chirch, and pronounced a mans lyeng with his owne wyfe to be chastitie: and Fathers were they, whiche agreed to his authoritie. Beyonde these boundes haue they gone: when they seuerely enioyned vnmaried life to theyr sacrificers. A Father was he which iudged that onelye Christe oughte to be heard, of whō it is sayd. Heare him: &amp; y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we ought not to haue regard, what other mē which wer before us haue sayd or done, but what Christ (which y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first of all) hath cōmaunded. This bounde neither doo they appoynt to themselues, nor doo suffer other to haue it appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, when they set bothe ouer themselues and other any maisters whatsoeuer they be rather than Christe. A Father was he, whiche affirmed that the Chirche ought not to sett it self before Christe: because he alway iudgeth truely: but the iudges of the chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, as men, are commonly deceaued. They breakyng through this bounde also, sticke not to affirme that the whole authoritie of the Scripture hangeth vppon the awarde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Chirch. All the Fathers haue with one harte accursed, and with one mouth pronounced it abhominable, that the holy woorde of God should be entangled with the suttleties of Sophisters, and brawlynges of Logitians. Doo they holde themselues within these boundes, when they goe about nothyng ells in their whole lyfe, but with endlesse striues and more then Sophisticall brablynges to wrappe and encombre the simplicitie of the Scripture: so that if the Fathers were nowe raysed to lyfe agayn, and shoulde heare suche an arte of brawlyng whiche these men call Speculatiue Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, they woulde beleue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> nothyng lesse is doone than any disputation had of God.

But the state of men hath scarcely at any time ben in so good case, that the better thynges pleased the greater numbre. Therefore for the most parte of the priuate vices of many hath been made a publike error, or rather a cōmon cōsent of vices, which now these good men would haue to stand for a law.

   <p>As for their dooble horned argumente, they doo not driue vs to so harde a streighte with it to compell vs to confesse, that either the Chirch hath lyen dead a certaine tyme, or that we haue controuersie against the Chirche.

But they themselues not a little way erre from the truthe, when they acknowlege no Chirche, but which they see with present eie, and go about to compasse it about with those boundes in whiche it is not enclosed. Uppon these poyntes hangeth our controuersie: Firste that they affirme that the forme of the Chirche is alway appearyng and to be seen: then, that they set the same forme in the see of the Chirch of Rome, and in the order of their prelates. We on the contrary side affirme, bothe that the Chirche may consiste of no appearyng forme, and that the forme it selfe is not conteined in that outwarde shynyng shewe, whiche they foolishely haue in admiration, but hath a farre other marke, namely the pure preachyng of the worde of God, and the righte ministration of Sacramentes. They are in a rage, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the Chirche may be alwayes pointed out with a finger.

         </gap>.</note> And verily Hylarie accompted it euen alredy in his tyme for a most great fault, that beyng occupied with the foolishe admiration of the dignitie of Bishops, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not a deadly pestilence lurkyng vnder that visor. For thus he saythe: One thyng I warne you, beware of Antichrist: for you are yll taken with the loue of walles: ye do yll worship the Chirch of God in houses and buyldynges: vnder them ye doo yll thrust in the name of Peace. It is doutefull that in those Antichrist shall sitte? Mountayns and woods, and lakes, and prisons, and caues are safer for me. For in these the Prophetes when they were either abydyng or throwen into them, did prophecie. But what doothe y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> world at this day honor in his horned Bishops, but that it thinketh them to be holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of religion, whom it seeth to be heads ouer great cities? Away therfore with such foolishe estemyng.<note place="margin">ii. Tim. ii xix.</note> But rather let vs leaue this to the Lorde, forasmuch as he alone kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth who be his, and sometyme also taketh away from the syght of men the outwarde knowlege of his Chirch. That is (I graūt) a horrible vengeance of God vpon the earth. But if the wickednesse of men so deserue, why doo we seke to withstande the iust ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God? In suche wise the Lorde hath in times past taken vengeance of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse of men. For because they wold not receiue his truthe, and had quenched his light, he suffred them beyng blynded in sense, bothe to be mocked with lies full of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie, &amp; to be drowned in depe darknesse, so that there was no face of the true Chirch to be seen. Yet in the meane tyme he saued his bothe beyng scattered abroade and lyeng hydden, in the myddest of errors and darknesse, from destruction. And no maruell. For he can skill to saue bothe in the very confusion of Babylon, and in the flame of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng ouen. But wheras they would haue the forme of the Chirche to be iudged by I wote not what vaine pompous shewe: howe perillous that is, I wyll rather poynt vnto than declare, least I should draw out my tale into infinite length. The Pope (say they) whiche holdeth the Apostolike see, and the Bishops that are annoynted and consecrate by hym, so that they be trimmed with fillets and miters, doo represent the Chirche, and ought to be taken for the Chirche: and therfore they can not erre. How so? because they are pastors of the Chirche, and consecrate to the Lorde. And were not Aaron and the other rulers of Israel also Pastors?<note place="margin">Exod. xxxii.iiii.</note> But Aaron &amp; his sonnes after that they were made prestes, dyd yet erre when they made the calfe. After this reason, why shoulde not the fower hundred Prophetes whiche lyed to Achab, haue represented the Chirche. But the Chirche was on Micheas syde,<note place="margin">i. Kin. xxii xi. Ier. xviii xviii.</note> beyng in dede but one man alone, and vnregarded, but out of whoes mouthe came truthe. Did not the false prophetes in resemblance beare bothe the name and face of the Chirch, when they did with one violent assaulte rise vp agaynst Ieremie, and with threatnyng boasted that it was not possible that the lawe should perishe from the priest, counsell from the wiseman, the woord from the Prophet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Ieremie alone was sente agaynste the whole companie of the Prophetes, to declare from the Lord, that it shoulde come to passe, that the lawe should perishe from the priest, counsell from the wiseman, and the worde from the Prophet. Did not suche a glistering shewe shyne in that Councell which the Bishops, Scribes, and Pharisees assembled, to take aduises together for the killyng of Christ. Nowe let them go and sticke faste in the outwarde visor, that they may make Christ and al the Prophetes of God, schismatikes: and on the other syde make the ministers of Satan, the instrumentes of the holy ghost. If they speake as they thynke, let them faithfully answere me, in what nation &amp; place they thinke that the Chirch remained sins the tyme that by the decree of the Councell at Basile Eugenius was thruste downe and depriued from the estate of Pope, and Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee set in his place. They can not, though they would burst for it, denye that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, for so much as concerneth outwarde solemnities, was lawfull, and summoned not onely of one Pope, but of two. Eugenius was there condemned of schisme, rebellion, and obstinatie, with the whole flocke of Cardinals and bishops, whiche had with hym practised the dissolution of the Councell. Yet afterward beyng borne vp by the fauor of princes, he recouered his papacie safe againe. That election of Aymee, which had been
<pb facs="7"/>
orderly made by the authoritie of a generall &amp; holy Synode, vanished away in a smoke: sauyng that he hymselfe was appeased with a cardinalls hatte, as it were a barking dog with a pece of bread cast vnto hym. Out of the bosome of these herelikes, rebelles, and obstinates, are proceded all the Popes, Cardinalls, Bishops, abbotts, and Prestes that haue ben sins. Here they are taken and can goe no further. For, to whether side will they geue the name of the Chirche? Wyll they denye that the Councell was generall, whiche wanted nothyng to the outwarde maiestie: namely, whiche beyng solemnely summoned by two bulles, and well framed in the order of all thynges, continued in the same dignitie to the laste ende? Will they confesse Eugenius with all his companie a schismatike, by whome they are all sanctifeid? Therfore eyther let them otherwyse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the forme of the Chirche, or they all as many as are of them shalbe of vs accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted schismatikes whiche wittyngly and willyngly haue ben ordered of heretikes. If it had neuer before ben knowen, that the Chirch is not bound to outwarde pompes, they themselues may be to vs a large profe, which vnder that glorious title of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Chirch haue so long so proudly bosted themselues, wheras yet they were the deadly pestilences of the Chirche. I speake not of their maners, and those tragicall dooynges wherewith theyr whole life swarmeth full: because they say that they be the Pharisees whiche are to bee heard, not to be folowed. But if ye will spare some of your leysure to reade our writin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, you shall playnly know that the very doctrine, the doctrine it selfe, for the whiche they say that they be the Chirche, is a deadly butcherie of soules, the firebrande, ruine, and destruction of the Chirche.</p>
   <p>Finally they doo not vprightly enough, when they doo spitefully rehearse how great troubles, vprores, and contentions the preachyng of our doctrine hath drawen with it, &amp; what fruites it now beareth in many. For the blame of these euells is vnworthily layde vpon it, which ought rather to haue ben imputed to the malice of Satan. This is as it were a certayne naturall propretie of the worde of God, that whensoeuer it ryseth vp, Satan is neuer quiet or sleapyng. This is the moste sure and moste trusty marke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is discerned from lyeng doctrines, which doo easyly shew foorthe themselues when they are receiued with fauorable eares of all men, and are heard of the world reioysyng at them. So in certayn ages past, when all thynges were drowned in depe darkenesse, the Lorde of this worlde made a sport and a play in manner of all men, and lay ydle and toke his pleasure like a certayne Sardanapalus in sounde peace. For, what should he ells doo but laugh and playe beyng in quiet and peasible possession of his kyngdome? But when the lyght shinyng from aboue somwhat scattered abrode his darknesse, when that strōg man troubled &amp; assailed his kyngdome, then he began to shake of his wonted drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, &amp; hastily to arme himself. And first he stirred vp the force of mē, wherby he might violently oppresse the truthe beginnyng to shine. By whiche when he nothyng preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he turned to suttle entrappynges. He stirred vp dissentions and disagreementes of doctrines by his Catabaptistes, and other monstruous lewde men, wherby he might darken it and at lengthe vtterly quenche it. And nowe he continueth to assayle it with bothe engines. For he trauaileth bothe by the force and power of men to plucke vp that sede, and with his darnell (as much as in him lieth) to choke it, that it may not grow and beare frute. But all this he dothe in vayne, if we heare the warnyng of God, which both hath long before opened his craftes vnto vs, that he shold not take vs vnware, and hath armed vs with sufficient defences agaynst al his engins. But how great malicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is it to lay vpon the worde of God the hatred either of the seditions, which nough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and rebellious men do stirre vp, or of the sectes which deceiuers do raise agaynst it? Yet it is no new example. Elias was asked whether it were not he that troubled Israel. Christe was esteemed of the Iewes a seditious man. The Apostles were accused of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng a commotion among the people. What other thyng doo they which at this day do father vpon vs all the troubles, vprores and contentions that boyle vp agaynst vs? But what is to be answered to suche,<note place="margin">i. Kings. xviii.</note> Elias hath taughte vs: namely that it is not wee that scatter errors or stirre vp vprores: but it is they themselues that wrastle against the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God. But as that one thyng alone is sufficient to beate backe their rashenesse, so agayne we ought to mete with the weakenesse of other, who oftentymes happen to bee moued with suche offences, and in their dismayeng to wauer. But let them, to the ende that they may not faynt with this dismayeng and be discoraged, know that the Apostles in their tyme felte by experience the same thynges that nowe happen vnto vs. There
<pb facs="8"/>
were vnlerned &amp; vnstedfast men, which wrested to their owne destruction, those things y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Paul had writtē by the inspiration of God,<note place="margin">ii.

There entred priuily many false Apostles to destroy the Chirches which he had builded. Some by enuie &amp; contention, &amp; not purely, yea &amp; maliciously preached y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gospel thinking to adde more affliction to his bandes. Somewhere the Gospell not muche profited. Al sought their owne, and not the thynges of Iesus Christe. Some wente backwarde, dogges to their vomite, and swyne to their wallowyng in the myre. The moste parte did draw the libertie of the Spirit to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> licentiousnesse of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> flesh. Many brethrē crept in, by whome there came afterwarde great dangers to the godly. Among the brethren them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues were many striues raised vp.

No. But for helpe in suche distresses this came in their mynde that Christ is the stone of stomblyng and rocke of offence, set vnto the ruine and risyng agayne of many, and for a signe that should be spoken against. With whiche affiance they beyng armed went forward boldly through all dangers of vprores and offences. With the same thought we also ought to be vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, forasmuch as Paule testifieth that this is the perpetuall propretie of the Gospel, to be the fauor of death vnto death to them that perishe, althoughe it were ordeyned to this vse that it should be the fauor of life vnto lyfe, and the power of God vnto the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faithfull: whiche verily we should also feele, if we did not with our vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse corrupt this so singular a benefit of God, and turne that to our owne destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ought to haue ben to vs the onely defence of our safetie.</p>
   <p>But nowe I returne to you, my soueraigne Lord. Let those false reportes nothing moue you, by which our aduersaries trauail to cast you in feare of vs, with sayeng that by thys new Gospell (for so they call it) nothing is hunted for and sought but fitt occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of seditions, and vnpunished libertie of vices. For our God is not the author of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but of peace: &amp; the sonne of God is not the minister of synne, which came to destroy all the workes of the Deuill. And we are vnworthily accused of such desires, wherof we neuer gaue any suspition were it neuer so small. It is likely that we forsothe do practise the ouerthrowyng of kyngdomes, of whō there hath neuer ben heard any one seditious worde, whoes lyfe hath euer ben knowen quiet and simple, when we lyued vnder you, &amp; which now being chaced from home yet resse not to pray for all thinges prosperous to you &amp; your kingdom. It is likely forsothe y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we hunt for licētiousnesse of vices, in whoes behauors although many thynges may be founde faulty, yet there is nothing worthy of so great reprochyng: neither haue we with so yl successe (by the grace of God) profited in the Gospell, but that our lyfe may be to these backbyters an examplar of chastitie, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, mercy, temperance, patience, modestie, and what soeuer other vertue. Verily it is by the proofe it selfe euident that we doo vnfaynedly feare and worshyppe God, for asmuche as we desire that his name be halowed bothe by our life and oure deathe, and enuy it selfe is compelled to beare of some of vs a witnesse of innocence &amp; ciuile vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in whō thys only thyng was punished with death which ought to haue ben accōp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a singular praise. But if any vnder pretence of the Gospell do stirre vp tumultes (as hetherto it hath not ben founde that there haue ben any such in your Realme) if any pretende the libertie of the grace of God to defende the licentiousnesse of their vices (of which sort I haue knowen many) there be lawes and penalties of lawes, by which they may accordyng to their deseruynges be sharpely punished: yet so that in the meane time the Gospel of God be not euel spoken of for the wickednesse of naughty mē. Thus haue you (O Kyng) the venimous vniustice of the sclaunderors largely enough declared, that you may not w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> an eare of to easy belefe binde to their reportes. I feare me also least it be to largely set out, forasmuch as thys preface is in a maner come to the quantitie of a whole boke of defense, wherby I entended not to make a defense in dede, but only to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify your mind aforehand to geue audiēce to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> disclosing of our cause: which your mind, though it be nowe turned away and estranged from vs, yea and enflamed agaynst vs,
<pb facs="8"/>
yet we trust that we shall be able to recouer the fauor therof, if you shall ones haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out displeasure and troublous affection red ouer this our confession, which we will to be in stede of a defence for vs to pour maiestie. But if the whisperynges of the malicious do so possesse your eares, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> there is no place for accused men to speake for themselues: and if those outragious furies doo still with your winkyng at them, exercise crueltie with prisonning, tormenting, cutting, and burning: we shal in dede, as shepe appoynted to the slaughter, be brought to all extremities, yet so that in our patience we shall possesse our soules, and wayte for the strong hande of the Lord: which shal without dout be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in tyme, and stretche foorth it selfe armed, bothe to deliuer the poore oute of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; to take vengeance on the despisers, which now triūph with so great assurednesse.</p>
