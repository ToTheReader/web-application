   <head>The Preface to the <hi>READER.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OT long agoe (Christian Reader) there was published a little Book in Latin verse, called <hi>Bibliorum Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula,</hi> set forth by Master <hi>Iohn Shaw</hi> (a man whom both for his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and grauity, as also for our old and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient acquaintance (being Schoole-fellowes in Westmerland <hi>50</hi> yeeres agoe, and both of <hi>Queenes</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi>) I did, and doe much esteeme and respect.) This Booke I perceiued to bee much applauded of the godly learned Ministers, and of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Schollers that had seene and read the same. And therefore after hee had sent me one, (as a token of his loue) I began to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy how I might teach it to speake English, being as desirous to benefit the vnlearned,
<pb facs="5"/> as he was the learned; and hauing transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Bookes of Moses, and offered them to his and to other learned and graue Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters view and censures, they did by their perswasions so pricke &amp; spurre me forward, that I could not giue ouer, vntill (through Gods assistance) I had gone through both the old and new Testaments. I confesse I haue not precisely tyed my selfe to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod &amp; manner, because the English tongue is farre more copious then the Latine; but haue taken liberty (according as the contents of each Chapter were longer or briefer) to conclude them sometimes in two, sometimes in foure, sometimes in more Disticks, with as much breuity (obseruing perspicuity) as I could. I haue purposely laboured to speake plainly, to the capacity and vnderstanding of the simple and ignorant, rather then by poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall straines to please the eare, and the eye of the curious learned Readers. Thou hast also not onely the contents of euery Chapter set downe in order Alphabetically, with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures to direct thee vnto them, but also fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in euery line to direct thee to the verse
<pb facs="5"/> where thou shalt find that presently which thou desirest to know, without reading ouer the whole Chapter. Thou hast also a Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologicall obseruation of times from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> and from <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Thou hast also the names of all the Bookes of the Bible, as they follow in order.</p>
   <p>Lastly, thou hast comforts and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against the feare of death, called, the old mans <hi>A. B. C.</hi> If it shall please thee (gentle Reader) when thou hast read or heard a Chapter, to read ouer the Contents in meeter once, or twice, thou maiest be able to rehearse and say the said Contents by heart, and so in short time bee acquainted with the History of the whole Bible. If any be so zealously affected with the knowledge of the Scriptures, as the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> was, who (as Master <hi>Fox</hi> recordeth in the Booke of Martyrs, of the fift Edition, page <hi>1075.</hi>) got by heart all the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Erasmus</hi> his translation in his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Rome,</hi> hee might in shorter time get by heart these briefe contents of the whole Bible. If therefore the <hi>Law of God be
<pb facs="6"/> thy delight,</hi> (as it was <hi>Dauids</hi>) this little Book will be a comfortable companion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou walkest abroad, or stayest at home. And finally, if thou reapest any increase of sauing knowledge, iustifying faith, or holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life, by these my poore labours, to the edification and saluation of thy soule, I haue all that I desire, sauing that I would entreat thee to ascribe the praise and glory of all to God, and to afford mee thy charitable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, well-wishings, and prayers.</p>
