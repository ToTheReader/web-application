where with God hath blessed his

that he hath giuen vnto vs plaine aduertisment,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 3</note>

was appointed by his heauenlie Father ād fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spokē
by the Prophetes,<note place="margin">Esaie 8. 14</note> to be the Stone of offē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
the stombling block, and a snare to the two
houses of Israel, and yet that he shoulde be
to others the Sanctuarie of honor, the Rocke of
refuge, &amp; author of libertie: so should his word
(I say) truely preached be to some foolishnes
and the sauor of death,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 16</note> and yet vnto others, that
it shoulde be the swete odore of life,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 28</note> the wisedo
me and power of God (and that to saluation) to
all those that beleue. I purpose not at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to intreat nor to reason, how and why it is
that gods eternall worde, which in it self is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
one, worketh so diuersly in the heartes
of those to whō it is offered, but my onelie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is in few wordes to admonish vs (to whom
it hath pleased God of his owne fre mercy more
playnely to reuele the mysteries of our redēptiō
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
thē he hath done to many ages be fore vs) not to
esteme this a small and common blessing of God
that we haue not onely his trueth, but also the
effect and operation of the same cōfirmed to vs
by experience of all ages. Great &amp; infinite is that
benefit of God, and rightly can it neuer be wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghed,
when so euer he doth offer his trueth vnto
the world. But such is either the dulnes of man
orels his extreme ingratitude, that he will not
acknowledge the face of theveritie,<note place="margin">Iohn 1. 5</note> shyne it ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
so bryght. The ingratitude of the Iewes, is
hereof vnto vs a sufficiēt witnes. For albeit that
lōg they did looke for the Messias and Sauior
promised, yet neuertheles, when he came with
wonderous signes &amp; workes super naturall,<note place="margin">Matt. 27. 38.</note> they
did not onely not know him,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 23</note> but also refusing
and vtterly denying him, they did hang him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wext
two theues vpō a crosse. The cause hereof
in some parte we know to be the carnal libertie
which cōtinually they did thirst after, and their
preconceaued opiniō of worldlie glorie: which
because Christe Iesus appeared not to satisfie ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cording
to their fantasie and expectation, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did they contēpteously refuse him, ād with
him all gods mercies offered vnto them. Which
fearfull example (deare bretherē) is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of vs. For by nature it is euident, that we be
no better, then they were. And as touching the
league &amp; societie with God, which prerogatiue
long made thē blessed, we be farre inferior vnto
thē. For in cōparisō of that league made with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahā
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
the tyme is shorte, that the Gētiles haue
bene auowed for gods people &amp; beloued spouse
of Christe Iesus▪ yea Paule feareth not to call thē
the very natural brāches and vs the brāches of a
wilde oliue. And therfore if their cōtēpt was so
punished, that blindnes yet remaineth vpō thē,
what oght we to feare? They not considering
the office of Christe, &amp; the cause of his cōming,
were offended with his presence and doctrine.<note place="margin">Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the trueth</note>
And doeth any mā thīck that we be free frō the

      </gap>
the one and the other, in this life, so that both
are despised and called in doubt, whē they be of
fered moste plainly to the world. To speake this
mater somewhat more planely, it is a thīg (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose)
by many cōfessed that after darknes light
hath appeared: but alas, the vices that haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
in all estates and conditiōs of persons,
the terrible crueltie which hath bene vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the saintes of God, and the horrible blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
which haue bene &amp; daily are vomited
furth against Christe Iesus and his eternall veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
hath giuen (and iustly may giue) occasion to
the imprudent beholder of such confusion, to
preferre the darcknes of superstition, which be
fore did reigne, to the light of saluation, which
God of his greate mercie hath now of late
yeres offered againe to the vnthankfull world.
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
For what naturall man can think that the iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of faith, planelye and truely preached should
be the occasion of sinne? That grace and mercie
offered shoulde inflābe the heartes of mē with
rage and crueltie? And that gods glorie declared
shoulde cause mē impudētly to spew furth their
vennom and blasphemies against him, who hath
created thē? The naturall man (I say) can not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
how these incōueniences shoulde follow
gods worde, &amp; therfor do many disdein it, a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e
nōber deny it, and few as it becōmeth with
reuerēce do imbrace it. But such as with graue
iudgemēt shal consider what was the common
trade of liuing, when Christe Iesus, him self did
by preaching and working, call men to repentā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce,
what was the intreatement of his dearest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uāts,
whō he sent furth to preach the glad tydin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of his death and resurrectiō, and what horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sectes followed, and daily did sprīg after the
publication of that ioyfull attonement made
betwene God and man by Christe Iesu, by his
death, resurrectiō, and ascēsiō, such (I say) as dili<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gētly
do obserue these former pointes, shall not
onely haue mater sufficient to glorifie God, for
his graces offered (be the liues of mē neuer so cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupted,
and the confusion that thereof insueth
neuer so fearful) but also they shall haue iust oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
more steadfastly to cleaue and stick to the
trueth, whose force &amp; effect they se alwaies to
haue bene one frome the begīning. The giuers of
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>
these offēses shall no doubt sustein the wo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
against them by Christe Iesus.<note place="margin">Matt 1. 7</note> But yet
must the childrē of God vnderstand, that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
it is, that such offēses come: that the elect
may first be tryed,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11 19</note> and after be partakers of that
blessing pronoūced by our master in those wor
des:<note place="margin">Luke 7. 13</note> Blessed is he that is not offended in me. The
cause of these my former wordes is, that as Satā
euer frome the beginnīg hath declared him self
ennemie to the fre grace and vndeserued loue
of God,<note place="margin">Sathan hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerraged against the fre mercies of God.</note> so hath he now in these last and moste
corrupted daies most furiously raged agaīst that
doctrine, which attributeth all praise and glorie
of oure redemption to the eternall loue and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deserued
grace of God alone. By what meanes
sathā first drew mākynd frome the obediēce of
God,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 8</note> the scripture doeth witnesse. To wit, by
powring into their hartes that poison,<note place="margin">How Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan drew māfirst from God.</note> that God
did not loue thē: and by affirming that by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressiō
of gods cōmandemēt they might attein
to felicitie and ioy: so that he caused them to
seke life where God had prounced death to
be. This same practise hath sathan euer frome
the beginning vsed to infect the Church with al
kynd of heresie, as the writings of Moises, of the
Prophetes, of the Apostles, &amp; of the godlie in the
primatiue Church do playnelie witnes. But alas
to such blasphemie did neuer the deuil draw mā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kynd
as now of late daies, in the which no small
nōbre are become so bolde, so impudent, and so
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>
irreuerent, that opēly they feare not to affirme,
God to be vniust, if that he in his eternal coūsel
hath elected more one sort of mē thē an other to
life euerlasting in Christe Iesus our Lord: which
thing of late daies, is more planely come to oure
knowledge thē before we could haue suspected,
and that by the sight of a book moste detestable
&amp; blasphemous, cōteinyng (as it is intiteled, The
cōfutation of the errors of the careles by neces<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sitie)
with that odious name do they burden all
those that either do teach, ether yet beleue the
doctrine of gods eternall predestination▪ which
booke writtē in the english tōgue doeth cōtein
as well the lies and the blasphemies imagined by
Sebastian Castalio, and laid to the charge of that
moste faithfull seruāt of God, Iohn Caluine as al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so

of w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> booke, &amp; the manifest blasphemies in the

of som godlie brethren, moued me, to prepare
an answere to the same: others I dowbt not
might haue done it with greater dexteritie, but
with reuerēce &amp; feare do I lay the talēt cōmitted
to my charge, vpō y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> table of the Lord to brīg to
his church such aduātage as his godli wisdō hath
appointed. But lest that some shoulde thīk, that
my labors might better haue bene bestowed in
some other exercise, I thoght expediēt to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>
all brethrē, &amp; charitably to requyre of thē,
not to esteme the mater to be of small weight &amp;
importāce▪ for seing that gods fre grace is opēly
impugned &amp; disdainfully refused, I iudge it the
duetie of euerie man that loketh for life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
to giue his confession to Christe Iesus,
whose glorie is by these blasphemers to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moste
of their power suppressed. Some do thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
that because the reason of man can not attei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
to the vnderstanding, how God shall be iust
making in his counsel this diuersitie of mankīd,
that therefore better it were, to kepe silēce in al
such mysteries, then to trouble the braynes and
myndes of men with curious disputatiōs. I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
confesse, that al curiositie oght to be auoi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded,
and that with great sobrietie we oght to
contemplate &amp; beholde that incomprehensible
mysterie of our redēption. But yet I say, that the
doctrine of gods eternal predestinatiō is so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
to the Church of God, that without the
same,<note place="margin">The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of gods eternall predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> can faith neither be truely taught, nether
surely established: mā cā neuer be broght to true
humilitie, &amp; knowledge of him self nether yet
cā he be rauished in admiration of gods eternal
goodnes, and so moued to praise him as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth.
And therefor we feare not to affirme
that so necessarie as it is that true faith be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in o<seg rend="sup">r</seg> har tes: y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we be broght to vnfined
humilitie, &amp; y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we be moued to praise hī for his
fre graces receaued, so necessary also is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> doctrin
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>
of gods eternall predestination. For first there
is no way more proper to buyld and establish
faith, thē whē we heare and vndoubtedly do be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leue,<note place="margin">The sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of faith.</note> that our election (which the Spirit of God
doth seale in our hartes) cōsisteth not in our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
but in the eternal and immutable good plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure
of God. And that in such firmitie that it cā
not be ouerthrowen nether by the raging stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of the world, nor by the assaultes of sathan,
nether yet by the wauering and weaknes of our
own fleshe. Then onely is our saluation in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
whē we fynd the cause of the same in the
bosom and counsell of God. For so do we by
faith apprehend life and peace manifested in
Christe Iesus,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> that by the directiō and guyding
of the same faith we looke farther: to wit, out
of what fountaine, life doth procede. In Christe
Iesus now presētly do we fynd libertie ād life,<note place="margin">Iohn 14. 6 1. Cor. 1. 30</note>
he is made vnto vs of God, wisdome, &amp; righteou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>snes and sanctification and redēption: and in the
promes of his Gospel is foūded the stabilitie of
our saluation. But yet we haue a ioy which, far
surmounteth this.<note place="margin">Ro 1. 26</note> For albeit that we should
heare that the mercies &amp; the graces of God we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
offered vnto all men, and albeit also that we
should fele that our heartes were somwhat mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued
to beleue, yet onles the very cause of our
faith be knowen, oure ioye and comfort cā not
be full. For if we shall think, that we beleue ād
haue embrased Christe Iesus preached because
<pb n="11" facs="6"/>
our wittes be better then the wittes of others,
and because that we haue a better inclination
and are of nature more tractable then be the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sorte of men, sathan (I say) can easely ouer
throw all comfort buylded vpon so weak a
ground. for as the heart of man is vain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrutable,
so may it be, that those that this day
be tractable and obedient, hauing also som zeale
toward godlines, yea and also bothe sense and
feling of gods mercie, such (I say) may shortly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
after become stubborn in some cases, disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
in maters of greate importance, tempted
with lustes, and finally they may be left so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
that rather they shal tremble at the sight of
gods iudgemētes, thē that they can reioyse in the
free adoptiō of his children. And therefor (I say)
that except our comfort be grounded vpon that
foundation which neuer can be moued, it is not
perfect.<note place="margin">The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouable ground of faith.</note> And that ground is this: That when we
vnderstand that presently we beleue in Christe
Iesus, because we were ordeined before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of all tymes to beleue in him:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29</note> as in him
we were elected to the societie of eternall life,
then is oure faith assuredly grounded,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 14</note> and that
because the giftes and vocatiō of God are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance.<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 13</note> and he is faith ful that hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vs.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 2. &amp; 20</note> his infinite goodnes which moued him
to loue vs in an other thē in our selues, that is in
Christe Iesus,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 29</note> according to his free beneuolēce,
whiche he had purposed in him, is to vs a tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb n="12" facs="7"/>
of refuge, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> satan is neuer able to ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
nor y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gates of hell shall neuer preuail against
it. For how so euer we be changeable, yet is God
in his counsel stable and immutable, yea how
weak, how feble, how dull that euer we be, yet
is there nothing in vs (euen when we be in our
owne iudgement most destitute of the Spirit of
God) which he did not se to be in vs before we
were formed in the wombe, yea and before the
beginning of all tymes, because all is present
with him. Which imperfections, infirmities and
dulnes, as they did not stoppe his mercie to elect
vs in Christe Iesus, so can they not compel him
now to refuse vs. And frome this foūtaine doth
flow this our ioye, that with the Apostle we are
bolde to crye: who is able to seperate vs from y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
loue of God which is in Christe Iesus?<note place="margin">Rome. 8</note> for seing
that the father, who hath giuen vs for a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
inheritance to his onelie Sonne, is so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that owte of his hand is none able to take vs
away, what danger can be so great? what sinne
is so greuous, or what desperation so depe, that
is able to deuoure vs? for seing it is God him
self who will absolue vs from all iniquitie: and
seing that Christe Iesus his Sōne wil aduowe vs
to appertein to his bodie, what is he that dare
ryse against vs to condemne vs? The comfort
hereof doeth none fele except the chosē childrē
of God, and that in the daye when mans iustice
faileth, and the batt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lle of their conscience is
<pb n="13" facs="7"/>
most greuous and fearefull. Therefore as faith
springeth frome election, so is it established by
the true knowledge of that doctrine onely
which this day is moste furiously oppugned, by
those who do not vnderstand the same.</p>
   <p>And frome that same doctrine floweth
the verie mater of trew humilitie. For while
we beholde the condition of those whom natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
hath made equall to be so farre diuers the one
from the other, it is vnpossible but that the
children of God in their own heartes vnfeined<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
shalbe humbled. For whither so euer they
shall directe their eyes, they shall behold feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
examples of blyndnes and of such iniquitie
as all men iustly oght to abhorre: but when
they cōsider them selues to haue receaued light
in the midst of such dareknes, and them selues
to be sanctified in the midst of so wicked a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
from what fountaine can they say that
this procedeth? who hath illuminated their
eyes, while that others abyde in blyndnes? who
doth brydle their affections, while that others
do follow the same to perdition? yf they say
nature, their own conscience shall conuict
them: for nature hath made vs all equall:
by nature are we the childrē of wrathe as wel as
other: Ephes. 2. If they say education, reason, or
their own studie, common experience shall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their vanitie. For how many haue bene no
<pb n="14" facs="8"/>
rished in vertue,<note place="margin">Ham. Ish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mael. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalom. Achitoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</note> and yet become moste filthie
in life? And by the cōtrarie how many haue lōg
remained without all vertuous education, and
yet in the end haue atteined to gods fauor? And
therfore we say that such as attribute any thing
to them selues in the grace of their election haue
not learned to giue to God the honor which to

what maketh thē to differre frō others. It
is vniuersally receaued for a sentēce moste true,
that as humilitie is the mother of all vertue: so
it is also the roote of all godlynes. But how is it
possible,<note place="margin">What hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie is</note> that that man shalbe humbled, that can
not abyde to heare the former miserie in the
which he was borne? neither yet the means by
the which frome the same he was delyuered? If
a begger being promoted to greate honours by
the liberalitie of a king, should be remēbred of
his former condition: and for declaration of
his gratitude he should be commanded to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rēce
the embassador, or herauld that thus should
say vnto him: Remēber and call to mynde how
wretched, poore, ād miserable somtymes thow
wast, and praise the goodnes of the king, by
whose mercie and gentlenes thow liuest now in
this honorable estate: If this begger (I say) should
stomake that his pouertie should be so often ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iected
vnto him, who wold saye, that either he
were humble, either yet thankfull to the king?
No more can it be said that such as can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde
<pb n="15" facs="8"/>
the mētion of gods eternall electiō (by the
which onely the elect be extolled to dignitie in
Christe Iesus) be either humble in gods presēce,
either yet thankfull, for that infinite benefite,
which excedeth all measure. To wit, that we be
elected in Christe Iesus to life euerlasting, and
that God according to the good pleasure of his
eternall counsel, hath made separation betwext
those who did fall into equall perdition, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the offence and sinne committed. Such as
desire this article to be buried in silence, and
wold that men should teach and beleue, that the
grace of gods election is common vnto all, but
that one receaueth it, and an other receaueth
it not, procedeth either from the obedience or
disobedience of man, such disceaue them selues,
and are vnthākfull and iniurious vnto God. For
so long as they se not, that true faith and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō
(as in the discourse shalbe more plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared)
springe from election and are the gifte
of God, and come not of our selues, so long are
they disceaued and remayn in error. And what
can be more iniurious vnto gods free grace,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 8</note> then
to affirme, that he giueth no more to one, thē to
an other? seing that the hole scriptures do play<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nely
teach, that we haue nothing which we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
not receaued of fre grace &amp; mere mercie, ād
not of our workes, nor of anythīg in vs, lest any

let wicked men rage as they list we will

not be ashamed to confesse always, that onelie
grace maketh difference betwext vs and the rest

that suche as fele not that cōfort inwardly

neither yet willing to be subiect to his eternall

wicked men moste vnreuerently do storme &amp;
rage against that doctrine which they do not
