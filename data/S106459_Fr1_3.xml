   <head>¶ A true Report of three strange accidents which lately happened at Pernaw, a Cittie in Lifflandé &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E finde (gentle reader) in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Histories, and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the workes of that famous and learned writer <hi>Flauius Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. that before the lamentable and woful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Hierusalem, there appeared many strange signes both in the aire, and among the people, namely there was séene right aboue the said Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a dreadfull Starre, in forme and fashion of a Sword: as also that in the darke night cleare day appeared and was seene in the Temple: that a Cow brought forth a Lambe, and which was most strange, a certaine man went vp and downe among the people, continually for the space of seauen yeares before, not ceasing with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cries, to forwarne and admonish the people to forsake their wickednes: fore shewing the destruction of the place.</p>
   <p>The very like, yea and almost the verie same acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents signes and wonders, haue lately happened within this whilome most pleasante Countrie of <hi>Livonia,</hi> in
<pb facs="3"/> the Cittie of <hi>Pernaw:</hi> for in the yeare 1599. vppon Saint Lukes day, a certaine Merchant of the said Cittie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing (according to the custome of the Countrie) enuited many of his freinds and Neighbours to a feast at his house, among the rest also, enuited thither a certaine old man of the same Cittie whose name was <hi>Stile,</hi> a man of the age of foure score yeares or thereabout, knowne to all the inhabitants there to be borne deafe and dumbe, and had soe continued all his life tyme to that day.</p>
   <p>This olde man being placed at the table among the company, and seing the great and horrible abuse of the good guiftes and creatures of God which were there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, by those abhominable vices of gluttony and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, and not being able to endure the sight therof, by the iust iudgment of God presently leapt ouer the Table, and with a fierce and sterne countenance, turning his eyes toward the people, and wringing his hands as a signe of the great sorrow which he conceiued at his hart, burst forth in these speaches to the Companie which were present.</p>
   <p>Alas quoth he (my deare freinds) how can you be thus merrie, when a man seeing this abhominable abuse, to the high displeasure of almightie God, might well loathe to liue any longer in so wicked a time. Therfore (deare brethren and sisters) repent, repent I say, for the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the Lord God is neare at hand: with greate stormes and ouerflowing waters, wil he destroy the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and nothing but affliction and punnishment shalbe their portion.</p>
   <p>Such dearth that yeare shalbe that the people shall not finde any foode for nourishment, nor any way to escape by reason of the troublesome warre to come: great plague pestilence and murren shall destroy both younge and old, therfore liue ye as if presently ye should die, for surely it is at hand: great and horrible wonders shall ye heare,
<pb facs="3"/> and sée many strange and monstrous Children borne, as a looking-glasse both for rich and poore.</p>
   <p>The people with great admiration and astonishment came running together to see this miracle which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penned, and the Company which were enuited being dasht with this suddaine accident, haueing now giuen ouer their pastime and being sore amased were with one accord attentiue to the speaches of the olde man, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aswell by his strange gestures as by the suddainnes of his speach that this was Gods onely doings: and being moued with great feare and horror, asked him at what time all those things should happen: wheruppon the said dumbe man thus presentlie replied.</p>
   <p>Ere the yeare 99 be come and past, the Lord God in his iust anger and wrath will draw his sword, therfore repent you of your sinnes, for the day of iudgment is at hand.</p>
   <p>These words spoken, the man was againe bereft of his speach, and became dumbe as before, féeling him selfe presently sicke, and the next day after he died: and was honorably buried, being accompanied to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church, by an infinite number of the inhabitantes there, whoe greatly lamented for his death.</p>
   <p>The next day after his buriall, there was a certaine woman brought forth a man childe, with a naturall face before, and behind like the scull of a dead man, his right arme also was like a Sword, and the other like a Rodde: which child liued two dayes and no longer.</p>
   <p>After this the Lord shewed an other, no lesse fearefull signe of his indignation and wrath, for iust ouer the said Cittie of <hi>Pernaw,</hi> was perfectly seene in the cleare Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament or Skie, a Beere and Coffin, couered all with blacke: which sight endured from foure of the clocke in the afternoone, till eleuen in the same Night.</p>
   <p>Therefore good christians, consider first the suddaine
<pb facs="4"/> and fearefull spéech of the Dumbe, secondly, looke vppon the monstrous birth and shape of this Childe, and lastly, meditate vppon the fearfull signe séene in the Ayre, and therevpon with an humble and penitent hart, imagine the Tragicall end of all, pittying the afflicted Countrye and people of <hi>Lyffeland,</hi> and let their hard fortune be a warning to thee, that thou sinne no more presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</p>
   <p>And as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> heathen <hi>Poet</hi> sayeth. <hi>Foelix quē faciunt aliena pericula cautum,</hi> that is to saye, happy is he which can beware by other mens perilles: make thy selfe happie with this warning, and doe not with the wicked and stubborne Iewes, contemne and scorne, this gentle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, and fore-warning of the Dumbe, least God in his Iustice bring a worse Plague vpon vs, then he did eyther vpon those Iewes or vppon this Countrey of <hi>Lyffeland.</hi>
