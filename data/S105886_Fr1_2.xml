                 <title>Alcida : Greenes metamorphosis, vvherein is discouered, a pleasant transformation of bodies into sundrie shapes, shewing that as vertues beautifie the mind, so vanities giue greater staines, than the perfection of any quality can rase out: the discourse confirmed with diuers merry and delightfull histories; full of graue principles to content age, and sawsed with pleasant parlees, and witty answeres, to satisfie youth: profitable for both, and not offensiue to any.

      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Alling (Gentlemen) by chance amongst a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of no meane Gentlewomen: after supposes and such ordinary sports past, they fell to prattle of the qualities incident to their owne Sexe: one amongst the rest, very indifferent, more addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to tell the truth, then to selfe conceit, said, That women that had fauours, had most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly contrary faults: for (quoth shee) beauty is seldome without pride, and wit without inconstancie. The Gentlewomen began to blush, because shee spake so broad, be sure, and blamed her that shee would so fondly foyle her owne nest. Shee still maintained it, that what she had spoken was true: and more, that she had forgotten their little secrecie. Whereupon there grew arguments: and a Sophisticall disputation fell out among the Gentlewomen, about their owne qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. I sate still as a cypher in Algorisme, and noted what was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: which after I had perused in my chamber, and seeing it would be profitable for yong Gentlemen, to know and foresee as well their faults as their fauours, I drew into a fiction the forme and method, in manner of a Metamorphosis: which (Gentlemen) I present vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your wonted curtesies, desiring you not to looke for any of</hi> Ouids <hi>wittie inuentions, but for bare and rude discourses: hoping to finde you, as hitherto I haue done, whatsoeuer in opinion, yet fauourable and silent in speech. In which hope setting downe my rest, I bid you farewell.</hi>
