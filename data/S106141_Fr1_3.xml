   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T pleaseth the Printer,</hi>
(Gentle Reader, as thou sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist)
after twelue yéeres sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
to hale againe into the
lighte, this my litle booke of
englishe Satyrs, which else mighte haue
soonge vnto it selfe, <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>cce nunc in puluere
dormio:</hi> what his gaine shalbe, I knowe
not: and I am perswaded, that gaine is not
the onely, no nor the chiefest ende hée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth.
But on the other part what I shal
gaine that am the Author of the book, none
can be so ignoraunt, but hée maye easilye
ghesse. Once, money I gaine none at this
time, either for writing altering or correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the same: &amp; hereof I stand so cléere,
that bothe I and my booke may be bould to
exempt our selues from the reache of mine
owne Argument which consisteth in the
reproouing of those who (by <hi>male engine</hi>) lie
in wait for sir <hi>Nummus.</hi> And thus much be
spoken to preuent the obprobry &amp; reproche
that this way might be raysed against me.</p>
   <p>As for prayse and commendation, if the
sharpnes of my <hi>Satyrs</hi> were not matter
sufficient to settle me against the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof: yet I am not so farre from
Judgement I thanke God, but that I
<pb facs="4"/>
know (in part) what is lackinge (aswell in
the inuention as in the verse of the booke,)
that shoulde carye away commendation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the better sort of english Poetes of
our tyme: And indéede, it is a matter that
I stryue nothing at all to attaine vnto:</p>
   <p>For if I did, I woulde frequent the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
which are reading and practise, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whereof, I haue bene acquainted with
to any purpose since the first thrée yéeres
which I spent in the Innes of Chauncery:
being now aboue a dosen of yéeres passed.
And so longe is it sithens these Satyres
were first made and set foorth, euen (as I
maye saye) in my childishe yéeres, whereof
notwithstanding verye lyttle or nothing
I repent mée. Only I wishe that all that I
haue written &amp; published heretofore were
by me reuised, and that I might haue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
and laysure to runne them ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
hereby to make them a little more
substanciall if my habilitye serued thereto:
which being once done and performed, how
forwarde I woulde bée from thensfoorth in
setting forth of bookes, shoulde appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the worlde by the continuance of my si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
For (to speake a truthe) it is not
méete we shoulde cloye the worlde with
<pb facs="4"/>
to many bookes of weake handling: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
whiles the learned trauailes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
labours of worthye wryters are
fayne to kéepe the doore (as I maye terme
it) or, which is more, to lie buried in silēce.</p>
   <p>But touching this my booke: I haue not
abridged it of any one Satyre that was in
the first edytion thereof, neyther haue I
added vnto it any other whole Satyr: But
I haue enlarged here and there one, and
haue corrected y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> whole booke in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
I confesse I coulde haue béene wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to haue increased the number by ij. or
iij. Satyrs at the least: Namely of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shreeues
and Baylliffs one: And of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
and Sompners or Apparitours
other twoo. Which offycers (if they all so
be) how they abuse the Subiects and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this Realme at this daye, by intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Extortions bryberies trecheries and
deceyts, what whole Shier, and in euerye
Shier, what Cytie Towne or Uillage, is
not hable haboundauntly to declare? But
these, togither with the exquisite handling
of mine allowable Argument, I muste be
contented to omitte, as neyther hauynge
laysure, nor (through want of laysure) skill
sufficient to accomplishe the same: For I
<pb facs="5"/>
tell you, it is no matter of meane ympor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,
firste to searche and syfte owte the
wrenches and wyles, shyfts, practises and
deceytes that the lewde sorte of this people
(which I feare me are the greater number
of them) doe vse to gette money with. And
then hauing so searched and syfted them
owte from nooke to crooke, to sette foorthe
the same in apt and conuenient discourse:</p>
   <p>For which causes (gentle Reader) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
and affoord me thine indyfferent
Judgement in this that I haue alreadye
done: And if thou finde therein any matter
or reprehension more fytte to haue bene
handled by men of grauer Censure and
more agréeable callinge: Forasmuche as it
reacheth no farther then to the reprouing
of vice, and the same also wrytten in that
age of mine, when as vice (withoute the
grace of God) mighte rather haue drawen
me to her league, then haue had me for hir
enemye: I thinke thou mayest well
enoughe (without endaungeringe
of Justice) assent to my request,
and so I hope thou wylt
do. <hi>Fare well.</hi>
