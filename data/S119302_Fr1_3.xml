   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloved in our Lord Iesus Christ, so many of you, as of whom we may hope that you belong to the election of grace, for whom my hearts desire and continuall prayer to our God is, that you may be saved; give me leave to shew my unfained affection towards
<pb facs="16"/>
you, in performing that service for you all, which hath beene requested at my hands, by such as wish much better to you, than you doe unto your selves. And that but only in these two things: First, in manifesting in what an estate and condition you presently stand, and so your danger eternally; and after, in helping to procure, that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord may cry instantly and joyntly for you, that he may shew you mercie, in opening your eyes, to see how palpably you have suffered your selves to be deluded, and in plucking you out of the verie jawes of that old Serpent. Howsoever, for the present, you take it at my hands, yet y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> time will come, as I certainly assure my soule, that you will either blesse y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> God of Heaven for the endevour of my ardent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards you, if it shall be available for you, or cry out against your selves, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> wringing of your hands, and tearing of your haire, when it will be too late, and no more place found for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Vouchsafe me this favour, that being amongst the weakest of all my brethren, I may leave all matters of higher dispute, in maintaining the truth of Christ against the Iesuites and other Seminarie Priests, by whom you have beene so inchanted and abused, unto my more learned and reverend
<pb facs="16"/>
brethren, who have alreadie entred the lists with them, and to others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in that kinde, whose bookes I acknowledge my selfe unworthie to beare; and that (sith what spare thoughts God hath vouchsafed mee from my necessarie calling, I have spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially employed in this kinde, to helpe his people in holy meditations, and other like devotions) I may thus farre onely presume without offence: First, to put you in minde of your Baptisme vow, and Covenant made with our blessed God, from which you have so farre departed. And in the second place, to advertise you, that you may consider well upon what grounds you have departed. And finally, whither you are come. Whether by their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sleights you be not gotten under the verie banner of Satan, to fight even against our Lord and Saviour Iesus▪ Christ, though you doe not imagine so much, but the cleane contrarie.</p>
   <p>In everie one of these therefore, I desire to deale lovingly, plainly, and ingenuously, as in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ, before whom I stand: as he shall be pleased to assist mee with his grace, and according also to the weight of the businesse which wee have in hand, which concernes the saving of everie soule of you.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="17"/>For our Baptisme vow &amp; Covenant, (which wee are all bound to performe all our dayes, as wee looke to have the Lord our God, or any benefit by our blessed Saviour, or ever to appeare with boldnesse before his Tribunall) I referre you first unto it, as the summe of it is set downe expresly in our publike forme of Baptisme; and if you please, as it is (amongst other of our bookes) more particularly and largely explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but even in the first part of this Watch, <hi>The Rule of Life:</hi> In which little booke, I have laboured, so farre as the Lord hath enabled mee, to shadow out the same vow, and so to trace out the narrow path of life, as to direct everie soule from step to step, and as it were, to guide them by the hand, untill wee have finished our whole course, and shall have entred within the gates of the Celestiall Ierusalem: which, though it be but amongst the least and weakest of our helpes for our de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>otions, yet I would wish everie one of you so drawne away from us, to reade, that therein you may first see and know our way of life, before you so condemne it; to try what iniquitie you finde in it,<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 5.</note> before you so utterly depart from it, and herewithall from Christs true Church and Spouse, your mother, which hath bred and borne you, and
<pb facs="17"/>
consequently, even from Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, so farre as I am any way able to conceive, judging as before his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Majestie. And having so read and thorowly weighed and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it with your way of life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any of your bookes of the like kinde, then to give sentence (as before him to whom you must surely give an answer, even for this) whether is the better and more holy, your way or ours, whether more agreeable to his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly patterne.) And thus much for the first point, and your Baptisme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ow, which you seeme to have so far abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in so departing from the bosome of your mother, and utterly casting her oft: and to leave it to your more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditation and more mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration.</p>
   <p>For the second: <hi>viz.</hi> Vpon what grounds you have departed; I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my selfe to have instanced but onely in this one; which, as is said, hath beene of late such a principall cause of your departure, and as I my selfe heard one poore soule, who had beene seduced, specially alleaging it (before sundrie witnesses, and some of them most learned) as a maine cause of her joyning to that religion, viz. <hi>That they have in their Church and Religion moe holy devotions than wee in ours, and spend</hi>
      <pb facs="18"/>
      <hi>more time therein.</hi> That by the palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of this delusion fully discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you and everie one of you may judge of all the rest of their delusions, which have nothing the like power so to bewitch you, and to steale away your hearts.</p>
   <p>And that I may proceed in order, to make all the mysteries of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion as cleare as the Sunne at the noone-day, even to the understanding and full capacitie of the simplest in the land, I will divide it into three parts, which are the three heads of this fell destroying <hi>Hydra,</hi> so maine a cause of your present departure from our Church and Religion, and of your turning to Poperie: To wit, <hi>Because</hi>
      <note place="margin">The delusion what, and the parts of it.</note>
      <hi>they have in their Religion moe holy and and better devotions, and doe also spend more time therein, than we in ours.</hi> The first head then of this poysoning Serpent is this; <hi>That they have moe helps for devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their religion, than we in ours.</hi> The second, <hi>That their many devotions are more holy and better than ours.</hi> And the<note place="margin">The first part of the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> third is, <hi>That they spend more time in these their holy devotions, than we doe in ours.</hi>
      <note place="margin">That in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie they have moe devotions than wee in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
   </p>
   <p>For the first of these: <hi>That they have moe helps for devotions,</hi> that is, moe such as which those of our common sort may have, understand and use, it is as true as that which he, who lately writ
<pb facs="18"/>
the <hi>Gag for the new Gospeller,</hi> hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished<note place="margin">Like that in the Gag for the new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speller.</note> in print to the view of the world, and which he hath not beene ashamed to set in the verie fore-front of his booke, in the Preface to the Reader, within twelve lines of the beginning to the verie same end, which this delusion tends: <hi>viz.</hi> to help more easily to deceive all the simple, &amp; to make them more to abhorre all our Bibles, and thereby our Religion, whereof the sacred Bible is the ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>: and so to take away the verie life of their lives, and indeed to prepare the way the better for the full effecting of their bloudie designes and desires against us all. Which I would therefore desire all (who would not willingly be so palpably abused by these murdering Iesuites, or who would but know these deluders and their Religion aright, and also the danger that wee stand in perpetually by it) to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. His words are these, that hee would advise all of, <hi>That England hath brought forth within these few yeeres▪ past, to the number of▪</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">This twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is but one this two and fiftie yeeres, By this shamelesse lie judge all the rest.</note>
      <hi>twentie severall sorts of Bibles sarr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap> different one from another.</hi> These are his owne verie words: for the truth hereof, let everie one enquire diligently, whether England ever brought forth any moe Bibles, since that translated by the Bishops, printed 1572. save that one appointed by our
<pb facs="19"/>
Soveraigne Lord and King to be most carefully translated, and that to satisfie the Papists, and to take away all their calumniations against our Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and the same verie little differing from the former, but as may fall out with the best Translations. For mine owne selfe, I have enquired of the most learned, and can heare of none other.</p>
   <p>But to passe over this most intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; shamelesse untruth, together with that which they had devised in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for the present hiding their owne wickednes in the Powder-Treason, for the dispatching us all, as it were, at one blow, like as it hath beene generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and received from thence till this day: to wit, <hi>That the Puritanes had blowne up the Parliament house;</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby, that they therefore were well worthie to be destroyed out of the earth: and so under the name of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titanes, to have taken occasion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, to have murdered all who truely professed Christs. Gospell in all the Churches. And also together with that like faire pretense of a mariage, under which they effected that most bloudie, detestable, and mercilesse massacre at Paris, in butchering of a sudden so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Flower of the Nobilitie, Gentrie, and principall professours in France. And likewise to omit that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
<pb facs="19"/>
88. in a like treaty, and all other their stratagems of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which they have so much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the Catholike cause, as they call it, and still doe to this very day, and so farre surprized the Church of Christ, and prevailed against us all, all of them being of the same nature, and from the same Author.</p>
   <p>To passe over all these, and to leave them all, as rightly due to Popery; for<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> that lying and murder, the two chiefe workes of the Deuill, are now well knowne to all the world (even to all, that will not wittingly put out their owne eyes) to be the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>o principall pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which have alwaies supported and promoted Popery and the kingdome of Antichrist, and must now specially, if ever heretofore, stand him in stead. And to come briefly to shew the palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of this first delusion, and that it is of the very same nature with all the former mentioned; namely when they say, <hi>That they have moe holy devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
      <note place="margin">What is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.</note> that is, moe bookes and helps for devotions, viz. moe holy directions for a true Christian life, for the right pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of Christianitie and piety, moe helps for holy meditations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, for examining our hearts and lives soundly according to the word of the Lord; so for true humiliation

&amp; repentance, for holy praiers, thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, and the like, than we have, I refer all who are willing to know the truth, to that catalogue of our devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even of those which are extant in Print, and may be had by all, who will use or see them, as it is set downe in the end of this booke, as it is gathered out of Master <hi>Maunsels</hi> catalogue, dedicated to Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> printed <hi>anno</hi> 1595. and of those which have beene since. Which Catalogue alone (to compare it with all the English devotions of the like kindes, that <note n="*" place="margin">For their devotions wherewith they cozen the world and extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppresse the poore su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious soules which will have them, see them in their Catalogue of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish bookes dispersed within these two yeeres last past with their prices, as they are in M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> GEES late discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, viz.

And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the works of some one of our men there mentioned, alone, being well applied and practised, may afford sufficient matter in that kinde to any poore Christian, for his whole life, to make him a blessed man; yea much more blessed than all the devotions of Popery can, as will appeare after: and what may we thinke then of all the rest of them together?</p>
   <p>And thus much briefly may suffice for the cutting off this first head of this Hydra.</p>
   <p>But the second head of this subtle<note place="margin">The second part of the delusion.</note> serpent may seeme more dangerous, as
<pb facs="20"/>
it is indeed, and more full of deadly<note place="margin">That the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ours.</note> poyson, to wit, that their devotions, viz. those commended most unto you by your Church and Iesuites, are more holy and better than ours. To cut off this therefore likewise, as it is a thing more necessarie, so it may seeme more<note place="margin">The holinesse of devotions wherein.</note> difficult. But that this may be as easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and surely effected, we are wisely to consider, wherein the holinesse and goodnesse of all true devotions doe consist. This we may doe specially, by considering the matter, ends, and fruits of true devotions.</p>
   <p>For the generall matter, those must<note place="margin">Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions are best in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the matter and forme in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. Ephes. 2. 20. 2 Pet. 1. 19. 1 Ioh. 5. 47. Mat. 16. 18. Mat. 24. 35.</note> needs be the holiest and best, which are most directly grounded upon the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, that sure foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, whereof Iesus Christ is the chiefe corner stone; upon which as all the true Church is built, so all her devotions; against which foundation the gates of hell shall never prevaile more than against Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; they being holy as his owne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie; and heaven and earth may passe, but not one jot or tittle in them, till all things in them be fulfilled; for that such devotions in regard of their matter are the Lords, so far forth as they are si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>mely grounded upon that sacred word.<note place="margin">In regard of the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note>
   </p>
   <p>For the more particular matter like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb facs="21"/>
those must needs be the best, which tend most to advance the glory of our God, and the scepter and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our Lord Iesus Christ; which most magnifie him, giving all our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the rich mercy of our heavenly Father, in and through our Lord Iesus Christ alone; and so which are most powerfull and effectuall to pull downe all the pride of sinfull man, and to make us to renounce all, but Christ Iesus<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8, 9. Rom. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap>7. 4. 2.</note> alone; to account all but losse and dung, in regard of any reioycing in our selves, of any iustification or merit, but onely in Iesus Christ, and to be found in him alone, not having our owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but the righteousnesse of God in him. So those which most serve to cause us wholly to deny our selves, &amp; thereby to be made fit to come unto and follow him, as his true subiects and disciples, and which make most to the saving of all his Church and chosen flocke, by him alone, and to leave all, who will not so receive and follow him, and heare his voice onely (as his enemies) more without excuse.</p>
   <p>And as these, so those in like manner which give most full assurance of Gods favour and love, and of true pardon of sinne and eternall life by Iesus Christ alone, and which thus give most strong and most abundant consolation onely in him.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="21"/>Those likewise which are most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and effectuall to increase our faith in him, and therewithall our love, and all the rest of the graces of God, even all parts of true sanctification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which are nothing else but the fruits of our holy faith in him, wrought in us by his blessed Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> when that we truly beleeve in Christ.</p>
   <p>Or to speake all more shortly, those devotions must needs be best, which most frame all to the lively image of our Lord and Saviour, and so doe most forme Christ in us, to wit, which most fashion us to that absolute patterne of true holinesse, which is commanded in his blessed word, and not to superstition contrary to it and condemned in it.</p>
   <p>And also those, whereby we may be best assured to receive most power to prevaile with the Lord, and to obtaine all good things from him alone.</p>
   <p>Or yet more for the understanding of all: Those must needs be best, which doe best direct and help us to performe all our vowes &amp; promises made to him, and so to walke with him all our daies, doing onely that which he requires in all things, that so we may be assured of all his promises, both for this and the better life, to be fully performed to us, for the saving our selves and all the people of the Lord.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="22"/>Or most briefly, according to our<note place="margin">A most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent triall according to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> Saviours direction, which stands sure for ever, in the three first petitions. Those which most tend to advance his glory and kingdome, with the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of all his heavenly will alone, and not the will of sinfull man, must needs be the best of all. The reason is, for that these three first being obeyed and sought first aright, will certainly bring the three latter petitions and blessings for our selves, both all things needfull for this and the better life, with forgiuenenesse of sins, deliverance from Satan, and from all the evils that he intends against us. That we shall see our Lord Iesus manifesting his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power and glory for us, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us partakers of the same for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
   <p>For the ends and fruits, those must<note place="margin">Triall by the ends &amp; fruits of devotions.</note> of necessitie be the best, which as they doe most directly aime at all these things mentioned, so doe likewise serve as Gods instruments to helpe us to worke these things most powerfully and effectually.</p>
   <p>Finally (for the forme and manner<note place="margin">Triall by the manner.</note> of sending them forth unto the Lord, or performing them any other way) those must needs be best and holiest, which are done with most understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 9, 11, 14, 15.</note> and so with the holiest and most
<pb facs="22"/>

   <p>And contrarily those must needs be the worst which are contrary to these, in regard of their matter generall or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and which conduce to contrary ends, and have most contrary effects and operations, and are done in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner farthest differing from these.</p>
   <p>Now having set downe these gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rules and directions, which may serve for our discerning of the true and sincere holinesse and goodnesse of all devotions, and which are the best; we are in the next place to consider briefly, and in a generall manner, what is the most speciall and principall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our devotions; and then what is the chiefest matter of theirs; and after in the third place, to compare them more particularly together, and so leave the discerning and iudgement of them, to every conscience, as in the presence of the Lord.</p>
   <p>For our devotions they are such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally<note place="margin">Our devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons what in generall.</note> as agree to the former rules.

   <p>But for those devotions of theirs<note place="margin">Their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of what sort.</note> (whereof they glory so much, and wherewith they seeke to inchant not you alone, but if it were possible, all the people of the Lord, and even to pull all from Christ to Antichrist) <note n="a" place="margin">See their bookes of their chiefe devotions as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

And not onely to take away the Lords anointed, with all his royall seed, and all not joyning to them, but even those of the same profession with them, and of the neerest of their kin, (so that they can doe it warily enough) if they be like to be any impediment to the accomplishment of their desires, as the powder furnace gave sufficient evidence. Yea the very best of their devotions (more than where they agree
<pb facs="24"/>
with the word of the Lord, and so with ours) are such as concerning which, the Lord himselfe doth in his word, and will one day demand of them before<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 13.</note> the whole world; <hi>Who hath required these things at your hands?</hi> For, for those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of <hi>Lewes de Granado</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so far as they agree with the word of the Lord and with ours▪ they are not properly Popish, but Christian devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; so in deed ours, reserved amongst them, as the Scriptures and other parts of Gods truth, for the cause of the true Church, the little remainder of Gods people hid amongst them, even in the midst of Rome.</p>
   <p>Now to take any of these devotions<note place="margin">Comparing of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> of theirs, as they are theirs properly, and the very meanest of ours, but even these whereunto this is the entrance, (prepared of purpose to helpe the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and weakest Christians in our Church, and euen all those who have not yet entred into this way of pietie, but are only desirous to offer their best service to our Lord Iesus and his poore Church, if they may be fitted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted hereunto) and to compare them to those of theirs in all or any of the former respects, I doubt not to refer them to any conscience, in all the world, if it be not altogether seared and starke dead: whether are more

   <p>1. Ours directly grounded upon the word of the Lord, theirs more than for a shew grounded onely and professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the doctrines and traditions of men, yea in deed on the doctrines of that man of sinne.</p>

Ours tending wholly to advance the glory of our God, and giving all glory to him alone, excluding all rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in our selves, that he that rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth may rejoyce onely in the Lord; theirs robbing him of his honour, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to creatures.</p>
   <p>3. Ours tending onely to magnifie our Lord Iesus Christ and his merit alone, with the all-sufficiency of it, for our salvation, and for whatsoever else wee stand in need of, wee comming onely to our heavenly Father, as it were with his beloved sonne Christ Iesus in our armes, presenting him for us, as all-sufficient, that we may be accepted in and for him, so making him our

   <p>5. Ours teaching and helping us in all things fully to vnderstand, yea to observe and keepe our Baptisme vow and Covenant made with our blessed God, according to his heavenly word; theirs to keepe all in blindnesse and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb facs="26"/>
of that their Baptisme vow in regard of any true vnderstanding or holy performance of it.</p>
   <p>6. Ours teaching and assisting us to fight manfully under the banner of our Lord Iesus Christ, against sinne, the world and the devill, and so to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue Christs faithfull souldiers and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to our lives end, according as we have vowed and bound our selves; theirs to fight Giant-like, or as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of the Dragon, under the banner of Satan and Antichrist, against our Lord and Saviour Christ Iesus, and against all his true Church; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all their abominable Idolatry and superstition, and all the bloudy and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy sinnes of Sodome; To fight for all the worldly pompe and tyranny of their Popes and Cardinals, and of all the rest that persecute Christs Church. Thus to continue Sathan and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs faithfull souldiers and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to their lives end; to fight ever against us, untill they have utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroied us or themselves; and all indeed because wee will not falsifie our vowes and sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall oathes made to our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, like as they themselves doe.</p>
   <p>7. Our devotions teaching and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us up all our daies, to observe
<pb facs="26"/>
every particular part of our Covenant both for Law and Gospell; theirs not onely to hold all in ignorance of their Covenant, and so altogether in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilitie to keepe it, when they know it not, and every one of them necessarily liable to the wrath of God; but also in effect teaching the violating of all, both Law and Gospell, thrusting ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> some parts wholly, as the second Commandement in many of their bookes; adding and detracting at the Popes pleasure, and that nothing is to bee taken for Scripture and for Gods Word, but onely as it hath warrant and authority from him; in so much as a Papist dare not beleeve the Trinity from the infallible Testimonie of the written Word of God, without the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Pope.</p>
   <p>8. Ours teaching &amp; helping to walke in the narrow path that onely leadeth to life, prescribed by our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; theirs drawing from this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row path into by-paths devised by man▪ and so into the broad way leading to destruction; seeking to kill all, who resolve to obey our Saviour, in labou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring to keepe the narrow way, and who will not runne those by-paths, and the broad way with them.</p>
   <p>9. Ours directing &amp; helping us to live the life of faith, living onely by the
<pb facs="27"/>
word of God, which together with the Spirit can alone give faith; theirs the life of unbeleefe, grounded meerely upon the word of sinfull man, for that they beleeve the word, not for it selfe, but onely so farre as it hath authoritie from the Pope, as was said, which in truth can never give any sound faith. Yea ours directing and assisting to live not onely the life of faith in generall; but of the true iustifying and saving faith, which is wrought onely by the particular applying of Christ and all his promises to our selves, from which particular applying of Christ procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all true confidence, and every part of sanctification; theirs directing to beleeve, but without any such particular application; and onely in generall, and as the wickedest and the very Devils beleeve; for they beleeve there is one God, and quake and tremble. Now that this generall beleefe of theirs, and this implicite faith can never breed the true justifying, sanctifying and saying faith, I appeale to the consciences of all, any more than the most soveraigne plaister can heale, if it be not particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied and kept to the sore, or more than meat can nourish and strengthen, if it be not eaten and digested, and even turned into our nature: or yet any more than a graft can grow by the
<pb facs="27"/>
stocke, if it▪ be not grafted into the stocke by speciall application, conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and union to take sap from it.</p>
   <p>10. Ours directing &amp; helping to live the life of true godlinesse, being guided onely by his word and Spirit, which life alone hath all the promises, both for<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4▪ 8.</note> this and the other life; theirs for most part, in stead of this true godlinesse so guided by Gods word, directing to live the life of bodily exercises, as <hi>Paul</hi> cals them; in superstitious penance, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings, whippings, with other will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worships, devotions and workes devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>eerely by man; which bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises<note place="margin">Col. 2. 23.</note> and devotions, have only a shew of wisdome from men vainely puffed up by their fleshly mindes, no promise at all; but contrarily all the threatnings in Gods booke for adding to his word, and detracting from it, in matter of<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 2. 22. 32. Prov. 30. 6. Apoc. 22. 18.</note> his worship and service, and for reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his Commandements, setting up mans in stead thereof; and so placing sinfull man in the roome of our most holy, blessed, and glorious God; the creature above the Creator, yea in truth, Satan above God, like as in all<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 1.</note> their devillish and lying doctrines.</p>
   <p>11. Ours teaching &amp; working by the practise of them full assurance of Gods favour and love in Iesus Christ, which onely brings with it joy unspeakable
<pb facs="28"/>
and glorious; theirs teaching and bringing but onely hope, without any ground of true faith, and therefore teaching doubting continually, which when the conscience is awaked, brings the very flashing of hell fire with it.</p>
   <p>So that ours, in the right use of them, are heaven upon earth; theirs, when their consciences shall be awaked, or when they but see what they have done in them all, a very hell upon earth.</p>
   <p>12. Our devotions are in the end the sweetest in the remembrance of them, and of all the time before that ever we have spent in them, since we beleeved in Christ; so as every one of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions made in faith, as our Religion directeth, and every moment of time so spent in them, hath a certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; theirs being done without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the word, yea contrary to the word, and therefore superstitiously and sinfully, not onely wanting all such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of reward (for who required the best of those things at their hands) but also having an expectation of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, when the conscience begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be a little awaked. So that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth, that then they are faine to renounce all but Iesus Christ, and so all confidence in these things, and to wish then with <hi>Balaam,</hi> to die the death of the righteous; toward
<pb facs="28"/>
which death of the righteous, we are alway going forward; and which life we striving to live, shall be sure to die the death thereof, and our last end to be like to our life.</p>
   <p>13. Our devotions in so many of us as practise them aright, are as our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, viz. that pure Religion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled before God even the Father, which <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of, directing and<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> helping to visit the fatherlesse and the widow in their adversitie, and namely those of them who are of the houshold of faith, and the members of our Lord Iesus Christ, and to keepe our selves unspotted of the world. So as we pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising rightly out devotions, there cannot be a lying tongue found in our mouthes, nor a hand or heart defiled with bloud, but we shall seeke by all meanes to save both soules and bodies of all sorts, even of our wickedest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the most bloudily-minded against us. Their Devotions contrarily are in truth, as their Religion, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure widowes houses, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of long prayer, and to destroy all the innocent, the fatherlesse &amp; widow, even al who are of the houshold of faith, &amp; the members of Christ, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Innocents that save all the rest.<note place="margin">Iob 22.</note>
   </p>
   <p>And by these, they make themselves notorious and infamous to all the
<pb facs="29"/>
world, to be the most polluted with execrable lying and the murder of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, of all other religions, that ever were in the world before, as will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeare after, whereby all their chiefe professours, and namely their bloudy Iesuits have made themselves odious even to all Nations.</p>
   <p>14. Yea and to passe by many other; our Devotions are as our Religion, to make us faithfull and loyall subjects, and not to be so bold, as to have an evill thought in our hearts against him, whom the Lord sets over us, but to be as <hi>David,</hi> whose heart smit him, for touching but the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, and so with that holy servant of God, and with the children of the Captivity, and with <hi>Daniel,</hi> yea with all the holy Martyrs to be content to endure what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever from them, and from all in holy and lawfull authoritie under them, that in our patient sufferings, Kings, Princes and Rulers may see the truth, and what is pleasing to the Lord, and also what they ought to maintaine and doe for their owne salvation, and of their Royall Progenie and Dominions; theirs in all these things, to make all to be contrarily affected, viz. to arme and flesh all to rebellion, and the murdering of Kings and Princes when they can do it cōveniently. After that those their
<pb facs="29"/>
ghostly fathers have made them to drinke deepe enough of this cup, and to be truly devout in the manner of their devotions: though I hope better things of you, to whom I write, yet it cannot hurt you to be warned.</p>
   <p>15. Moreover for the māner &amp; forme of our devotions; All our devotions which are agreeable to our doctrine, are sent forth from understanding hearts, and so with a holy zeale, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the spirit of judgement, and the<note place="margin">Esa. 4. 4.</note> spirit of burning, mixt with the sweet perfume of Christs merit, and so offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to our heavenly Father, as they may be most pleasing, comming to him,<note place="margin">Apoc. 8. 3.</note> as out of the hand of our Saviour, yea offered also in order without any vaine<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> babling or idle repetition: Theirs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily are for most part and usually without any understanding at all; like as all the devotions of their ignorant sort are, especially those which are in an unknowne tongue; and so without all holy affection. For all holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons must of necessitie be grounded upon knowledge, without which the heart cannot be good; neither can<note place="margin">Prov. 19. 2.</note> there be any faith in such, nor any<note place="margin">Rom. 4. end.</note> thing but sinne, <hi>for whatsoever is not of faith is sinne.</hi> And not onely so, but also theirs are full of vaine and idle repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in that blinde manner, a matter
<pb facs="30"/>
directly condemned by our Saviour as<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 7.</note> hypocriticall and heathenish, when men <hi>thinke to be heard for their much bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> Finally, for that theirs are usually sent forth in a proud opinion of their owne merit and worthinesse to be heard, or as they come out of the hand of some Saint or Angell; to whom therein they give this honour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, which solely belongs to our Lord and Saviour, viz. of presenting<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34. 1 Tim. 2. 5. Apoc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>. 3.</note> our praiers and supplications unto his Father alone.</p>
   <p>I might prosecute these comparisons in many other instances, as namely, that our devotions make us still better, the more they are practised by us, and more like to Christ Iesus; theirs as they are theirs properly, as those which I named, make them still and ever worse and worse, and more like to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, as he is transformed into an Angell of light; as namely in all their Iesuits, their chiefe professed holy men, being indeed deuils in carnate, and so accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all States, and specially for those chiefe works of their lying and murder, which are manifest to all, to be their principall studie: Ours (to repeat it againe, that it may leave the deeper impression in every soule) tending to save all both soules and bodies; theirs to destroy all, not onely us whom they
<pb facs="30"/>
terme Heretiques, but themselves eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and all other whom they seduce by their delusions.</p>
   <p>But to omit all further comparisons, for that it would bee too long, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to content our selves with these, and to come to a conclusion of this second point, <hi>viz.</hi> That these things being so, as every one who professeth Christs Gospell, and holdeth the Religion of our Church, must needs acknowledge, and even the very consciences of our Adversaries will surely doe, when they shall be awaked to answer as before the Lords Tribunall; I now here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to every soule, whether are more holy and so better, their devotions or ours.</p>
   <p>And thus I hope this second head<note place="margin">Conclusion of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point.</note> of this monstrous destroying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring serpent, is utterly smitten off for ever hereafter hurting any of Gods people, who uprightly weigh these things, and to whom it is given to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Gospell of Christ, and withall to lay to heart that forewarning of <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the strong delusions<note place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 11, 12.</note> of Antichrist, amongst which these are not of the least. And for them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>rag of the number of them being such, is to boast of their store of poyson and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent infection enough to destroy not only themselves, but even all the world
<pb facs="31"/>
And thus much for the second head.<note place="margin">The third part of the delusion: that they spend more time in their devotions than we in ours.</note>
   </p>
   <p>To come therefore to the last head of this deadly Serpent, which is yet more perillous and full of mortall poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son than the former: <hi>viz.</hi> That they spend more time in their devotions than wee doe in ours, and therefore their religion is better. To cut off this likewise,</p>
   <p>1. I answer, that their devotions being such as those which wee have heard, <hi>viz.</hi> Idolatrous, superstitious, and against the direction of the Lord, yea against his expresse charge, (like as all theirs are, so farre as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly theirs) the more time they spend in them, the more they increase their sinne, and so the wrath of God against themselves, with their owne everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting miserie, so that to glorie of their many devotions spent in that kinde, is but to glorie in their shame and in their sinne, even in the launcing of their owne soules, in a devotion like to the devotion of <hi>Baals</hi> Priests.</p>
   <p>2. Thus I answer, that a Papist, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a right Papist, holding their usuall tenets, and following their practice, can never make one prayer which can be acceptable unto God, nor doe any worke which can be pleasing, for that<note place="margin">Rh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>m. on Rom. 3. vers. 22. sect. 7.</note> they doe not onely condemne, but also scorne, yea persecute that true justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

faith, which consists in a particular applying of Christ, and in a peculiar and full assurance of Gods favour and love through Iesus Christ alone; without which faith there can bee no sanctification, for that all our sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation flowes from our justification, and our justification from this particular saving faith, thus applying Christ to us, and making him ours, and so making us flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones; whereby all our good works flow from him by his Spirit, when wee are so united and incorporated into him thereby.</p>
   <p>Now they denying and scorning that whereby they should bee made good trees, can never bring forth any good<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 33.</note> fruit pleasing and acceptable unto the Lord: For first, the tree must be good, and then will the fruit be good, &amp; never before, but scorning that whereby they should be made good trees and living members of Christ, &amp; have his Spirit, they can never do the works of Christ, or bring forth the fruits of the Spirit.</p>
   <p>3. Though they could make never so many prayers, and those good prayers in regard of the matter, yet none of those prayers can ever be accepted; but God threats to hide his face from<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 15.</note> them, because their hearts and hands are full of bloud, all of them, at least
<pb facs="32"/>
the most devout of them, wishing and seeking the bloud of all heretiques, and so of us whom they principally account to be such amongst all other.</p>
   <p>For their verie hating of us so mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally they are murtherers, and much<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 15.</note> more, hating and seeling to root us all out, onely for our love to our God, even for his names sake, and for our cleaving fast to him alone; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot have eternall life abiding in them, much lesse can any of their prayers be heard so long as they so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.</p>
   <p>4 Moreover, for all their canonicall and set houres, if they be either in such kinde of prayers as theirs are properly; or else if they bee with the neglect of that particular calling wherein everie one of them should walke, to eat their owne bread, and not to bee as Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers and idle bellies, to live of the spoyle of the Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; &amp; much more, if they be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and to delude poore soules in an opinion of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap> it thereby; and most of all in putting their works so done in place of the merit of Christ, as in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to the treasure of the Church; though by them they afflict and humble their bodies never so much; yet all these the moe they are, the greater is their sinne and miserie, as
<pb facs="32"/>
was said before: for who required any<note place="margin">Esa. 1. 12. Psal. 50. 16.</note> of the best of them done in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at their hands? And much more any of those which are in themselves idolatrous or superstitious.</p>
   <p>5. For true and holy devotions, and which are pleasing and acceptable unto God, I doubt not constantly to affirme, but that the poorest and weakest true Christian in our Church (which rightly holding the doctrine of our Church, and justified by the bloud of Christ through a lively faith in him, makes conscience of all his wayes, and so useth to pray according to his will, in the name of Christ onely, both spends more time in true holy Devotions, and shall be more accepted with the Lord, yea shall have more power to prevaile with his Majestie for whatsoever hee seekes, and shall also bring more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to his owne soule, and finde a farre greater reward from the Lord, than the proudest Pharisaicall Papist in all the world.</p>
   <p>For that the prayers of such an one so made, are the prayers of faith, unto which all the promises are made; and contrarily all the prayers of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, so farre as they are Papists, and so made, can be no other but prayers of unbeleefe, and so can looke to receive nothing, because indeed they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="33"/>
but sinne, and displeasing to his<note place="margin">Iam. 16. 7.</note> Majestie.</p>
   <p>And if the poorest Christian, and hee that spends least time doe this, what shall wee thinke of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands others, who have set themselves unfainedly to seeke and walke with God? Yea, what shall we thinke of all those, who knowing their owne sinnes and weaknesses, and the continuall endevours of Satan against them, with their owne necessities, and the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Churches, are driven to bee instant with the Lord day and night? And chiefly what shall wee judge of all those, who doe at this day truely take to heart the dishonours done unto his glorious Majestie, the oppositions against Christs Gospell, his crowne and dignitie, with the state of his poore Churches and people therein; the rage and furie of Satan and Antichrist? who have therefore set themselves tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to helpe our Lord Iesus in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to pacifie his wrath, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of his captives with the glorie of his Sion.</p>
   <p>Yet have we too just cause to accuse<note place="margin">Iust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the greatest part of those who prosesse the Gospell.</note> and condemne our selves herein, not onely all our Atheists and prophane sort, but also the multitude generally, that wee suffer our adversaries so farre to condemne the greatest part of us,
<pb facs="33"/>
who professe the Gospell, that they should labour farre more in their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious devotions, to increase their sinne and judgement upon them all (though this have beene alwayes the nature of superstition) than we in our holy and true devotions to increase our owne happinesse, and for the saving of us all. Notwithstanding that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deadnesse and want is amongst us in this behalfe, it is not through the fault of our Religion, which teacheth and enableth us otherwise when it is rightly knowne and practised, but it is the want of true knowledge, and of a sound and conscionable practice of our Religion.</p>
   <p>Hence it hath beene, and is one principall end whereunto I have bent my studies in these poore labours, the better to awaken us, and to put more life into us, to begin more universally and joyntly, and also more incessantly to importune the Lord herein, being provoked by their ensample.</p>
   <p>That thus we may labour as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and as earnestly with the Lord hereby, for the saving of our selves ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and of so many of them with us as belong unto his eternall election, as they doe by theirs, to destroy both us and themselves together.</p>

For that this doth in like manner, and as neerely concerne every Papist in the world, as it doth him. That they must needs every one either professe with him, that if it can be proued, they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise will utterly renounce Popery, and embrace the Gospell, or that they are of that Religion which is of Sathan, and will so remaine, whatsoever the Lord shall manifest to the contrary. Which point, as all may see, doth fitly come in to be yet more plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated in this place, and upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion.</p>
   <p>The Syllogisme whereby I endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">The Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon our Saviours owne words.</note> to let him see the danger wherein himselfe and all the rest of them who are of that popish Religion doe stand
<pb facs="34"/>
(because that Religion so farre as it is differing from ours, and properly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, holding their chiefe grounds, must needs bee of the devill.) was grounded upon the expresse words of our Saviour to the unbeleeving Iewes, who therefore sought by lies and all devices to kill him, even for the truth, which he declared unto them, as now they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap> us all. The words are, Iohn 8. 44. <hi>Ye are of your father the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and the lusts of your father will you doe; He hath beene a murderer from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and abode not in the truth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This I framed in the plainest manner that I could, for the easier understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and triall of it, as now I do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>; that every one may be better able to discerne of the truth and weight of it, thus:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>That Religion which teacheth lying and murder for the supporting and advancing of it, is of the Devill; But the Religion of the Iesuited Papist it a Religion which teacheth lying and murder for the supporting and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of it.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ergo the Religion of the Iesuited Papists is of the Devill.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>First the proposition I shewed to be strong from the expresse words of our Saviour, and not possibly to be gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saied; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>hat if liers and murderers are of the devill, then that Religion
<pb facs="35"/>
which teacheth lying and murdering to support and advance it selfe, must needs be so likewise.</p>
   <p>He therefore being pressed with the Assumption, denied it, onely by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing, that howsoever some of them had practised so, yet it was not their doctrine, and that if it could be proved to be their doctrine, he would utterly renounce his Religion, and ioyne himselfe againe to us.</p>
   <p>This I undertooke to prove unto him: but living some miles dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>nt from him, and having my calling to follow, which I was necessarily to attend; the Lord our faithfull and most gratious Father, seeing my unfained desire for his reclaiming and salvation, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke for me the proving of it, in such a manner, as whereby to give satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the truth of it to all the world, and for ever to stop his mouth, and the mouthes of all our adversaries, even of every one affected to that Popish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that two waies.</p>
   <p>First, this conference of ours, and<note place="margin">How the Lord mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested the truth of this Assumption, that this is their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> so my promise being but a little before the powder Treason, it proved it selfe, or rather, his heavenly Majestie mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested it by themselves, leaving them up to themselves in that very powder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, wherein there was for the suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and advancing of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="35"/>
first such a murder intended as the world before that day never heard of.</p>
   <p>And secondly, a lie as great as it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised not only to cover that bloudy fact, for the present; but by it to have destroyed all the rest, who had escaped that blow, even all truly professing Christs Gospell; in all countreys of the earth, under the name of Puritans; for that they had commited such a fact, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Puritanes had blowen up the Parlament house: like as when it was discovered, they gave it forth, that the Puritans had intended it. That which should have beene their owne most detestable act, they father vpon the people of the Lord, whom they would have butchered by it, and blowne up for ever.</p>
   <p>Now this whole act of this devillish and deadly preparation, we know, was proved to be done by the advice of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Garn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

And therefore it being their doctrine, that they are to obey their Superiours and Ghostly Fathers, chiefly in all things which concerne the promoting of the Catholike cause▪ and therein to be ever ready to adventure their lives; I appeale to the conscience of this Gentleman, and the consciences of them and you all, whether it bee not

their doctrine by necessary conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>

And likewise the Lord hath caused it to be thus divulged by sundry other bookes and meanes. But this I have already set downe in the<note place="margin">Part 3. c. 11. p. 340, 341.</note> third part of this Watch, and namely in the Idolatry of Iudah hastning the Captivitie; which matter (if ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore) concernes our whole Nation, and even all the Churches seriously to lay to heart.</p>
   <p>Now this one very fact of their<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap> alone, might have beene fully sufficient to have caused all of them to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the truth of that Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and thereupon to have utterly renounced Popery, and embraced the Gospell againe; if God had beene so pleased to have opened their eyes, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

   <p>But sith that (notwithstanding all manner of convictions by such noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious practises formerly, such manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations by writings, and even from their owne bookes) most of them in stead of renouncing Popery, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

At least my certaine hope in the Lord is, that it may bee a meanes to helpe to keepe many others

from ever so comming under Satans banner:</p>

Which thing I cannot no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> dare otherwise expound, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee would have all sorts to take notice of his love and care for us, and for all that are his people, to warne and save us all; and also of his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, even to them, if any warning may yet serve to prevaile with them: or else of his most just vengeance, if they will suffer themselves still to be so wilfully blinded, and carried against him, his truth and servants in such a furious rage to their owne certaine perdition, and will not yet turne and betake themselves unto the colours of our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p>First, hee hath manifested it anew, in discovering againe, (even as it were to all the world) the wickednesse of
<pb facs="38"/>
that Religion in this behalfe, in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our whole nation, not onely to take more full and certaine notice of their dealing, and to bee enforced to seeke by all meanes to prevent the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe and danger by it; but also all the Churches, even all the earth, to see how by delayes and faire pretences <hi>(which have indeed beene nothing, but meere untruths and guls, to speake plainly of them)</hi> they have devoured so great a part, and are readie presently to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up all, under pretences of maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of more strong leagues, and more firme peace, according to their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent devices and practices, &amp; agreeably to their holy Councels at Trent, in the booke mentioned before: so as even all the world rings and cries out of it.</p>

<pb facs="38"/>
enough, though all their Iesuited sort are made drunke alreadie, with the bloud of the Saints, and Martyrs of Iesus.</p>
   <p>3. By causing at this time their Art of equivocating and lying to come to light, and to bee published to the view of all sorts amongst us. How these Iesuites have beaten their braines, and even gone beyond Satan himselfe, in devising, maintaining, and practising this devillish Art, which wee may well call their new Blacke Art, for which I referre all to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Masons</hi> booke of <hi>The new Art of lying, covered by Iesuites under the vaile of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</hi> That all may see and bee for ever fully satisfied, that these are their doctrines, &amp; the verie chiefest of them, in the refining and perfecting whereof, they bestow most paines.</p>
   <p>4. By that late and notable Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie<note place="margin">See Foot out of the Snare, pag. 25.</note> out of their owne bookes, by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Gee,</hi> who was one of them; wherein he hath set downe such impious tricks and devices of their Priests and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, that (as hee there saith) all may justly hoot at them, for most abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable impostors and liars. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but of some of which will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly cleere whatsoever I have spoken in this behalfe, and this Assumption.
<pb facs="39"/>
This likewise comming forth in Gods speciall providence at this verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, for the more full conviction of all, or leaving all more without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, and to stop everie mouth that shall plead for them.</p>
   <p>Yet to passe over all these, and this also; that all sorts doe know, that their Iesuites and Confessours are the chiefe contrivers and abettours of all their chiefe stratagems, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done without them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit wee are nothing to regard words, when their deeds, according to their Doctrines and Constitutions, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to all the world. And that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may delude little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by affirming that these are not their doctrines (if any dare still deny it against the witnesse of his owne heart) yet men, having their braines in their heads, can never bee so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted, unlesse they will wilfully joyne hands with them, or suffer their eyes utterly to be put out.</p>
   <p>For that which they say; That they are not their Doctrines, unlesse wee can shew them out of the Councell of Trent, or some of their chiefe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels; can any man imagine, that the Councels would openly professe them to proclaime to all the world, that they
<pb facs="39"/>
and their Religion is of Satan? or can wee thinke or imagine, that so many of their Iesuites should publish them unto the world, unlesse they were the advice of their Popes, and indeed their Doctrine.</p>
   <p>But to passe all these things over,<note place="margin">All their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines lies in hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic.</note> and to leave them to their further consideration, to worke better upon their consciences: what can they yet, or any other say to their Doctrines, which the Holy Ghost cals, <hi>Lies</hi>

      <hi>through hypocrisie,</hi> devised to devoure us all?</p>
   <p>Such as this here discovered, <hi>That they have moe holy devotions than we,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
   <p>And even for all their Doctrines joyntly to leave it to the consciences of all whether all of those wherein they differ from us, and for which they so contend, bee not Doctrines meerely devised to please the corrupt nature of man; to hold up that Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie of the Pope, and tyrannie of that Sea of Rome, <hi>viz.</hi> of their Pope, Cardinals, Abbots, and the rest: And also for their bellies; and that they may keepe all the world in slaverie, and to hide their wickednesse. And more specially what their Doctrines are concerning Purgatorie, Masses, Indulgences, Pardons, even for the

time to come; Miracles done by this Saint and that, and by this Relique and that: and concerning their holy Reliques themselves, and so all their doctrines of Equivocation, mentall Reservation, and the like, whether they be not all (to speake as the thing is) notorious lies to keepe the poore people in ignorance, &amp; in their blinde devotions and slavery to them; yea to muzzle them in their murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring zeale against the true Church. Which if it be so, then the Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is most manifest to all the world, even to children, and almost to suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing babes: <hi>That Popery teacheth lying and murder,</hi> or that which tends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, viz. <hi>to the destroying of all either soules, or bodies, or both.</hi>

   <p>Now for the truth of all these things,<note place="margin">Appeale for the truth of the Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> I appeale first to the Lord Iesus, the Iudge of all, to iudge betweene us; and that I have written according to the perswasion of my heart, grounded upon the word of the Lord, and upon their writings and dealings.</p>

   <p>For particular proofes of these and other disputes, I leave them to the Treatises mentioned before, and also to the more learned, and them who have better leysure. It may be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for me to have made them mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to all who professe Christs Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and who judge indifferently, and to leave them and their consciences thus convinced unto the Lords Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

   </p>
   <p>And now these things being so, I appeale againe to their consciences, and the consciences of all the world, concerning the evidence and necessitie of these Consectaries.</p>
   <p>1. Whether the Assumption being true, that Religion of theirs be not of the Devill, by our Saviours owne reason, and therefore that all of them must either renounce, and even abjure it, or else professe themselves to be of Satans Religion, to maintaine it, and
<pb facs="41"/>
to fight for him against our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and that they will still doe it.</p>
   <p>2. Whether all sorts are not bound to seeke to save themselves from that lying and murdering Religion, and to use all warrantable and holy means, both to reclaime all from it, to the end to save them, both soules and bodies, and also to deliver all the Churches and people of the Lord, from the danger of being suddenly surprized, and murdered thereby; and so far as God inables them any way, to take away all the dishonour and provocations of his sacred Majestie, which may come thereby, as by all other such hainous sinnes. This I humbly submit to the judgement of all; seeing whosoever is not with our<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 23.</note> Saviour is against him, and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever saves not, destroyes. That the Magistrates and all in authoritie are the keepers of both the Tables, each according to his place: and for that the bloud of all must be required at the Pastors and Watchmens ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>ds,<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 7, 8.</note> according to the charge committed to every one of them, if they be not faithfull in their severall places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to them by the Lord.</p>
   <p>
      <note n="*" place="margin">I could wish them &amp; all other of the simpler sort to read such little treatises as shew how Popery is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the main groūds of Religion, and first principles of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme; as namely a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle booke called a pill to purge out Popery, with the shifts of the Iesuits by Master MVLL<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>N and the like. Request to all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents.</note> Wherefore I intreat them and all
<pb facs="41"/>
others seriously to thinke hereof, as in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ, before whom I have written, in duty to his heavenly maiesty, for maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his glory, and holding up the scepter of our Lord Iesus, and in love and duty to all sorts, chiefly to all in high place, for the saving of all, or to leave the obstinate utterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuse.</p>
   <p>And thus much also for the proofe of the Assumption, and the shutting up of this inclosed Epistle.</p>
   <p>Unto which, if this Gentleman, or any one for that Honourable Ladie, will offer to reply, let me but crave this of him, whosoever he be, which equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and wisdome will require.</p>
   <p>1. First, to doe it in love and with good advice, as in the presence of our Lord Iesus Christ, without all shifts or devices against the light of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, even as I have endevoured, and onely for the finding out and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the truth, whereunto (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) I shall ever yeeld, if any one in any thing shall rightly shew mee my error, and I shall moreover acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my oversight.</p>
   <p>2. And secondly, let me request of him, that hee will bethinke himselfe wisely, for what he pleades, and also
<pb facs="42"/>
for whom, whether he doe it not even for Satan, and for the upholding of his kingdome by his chiefe workes of lying and murder; and also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider against whom he doth it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not against our Lord Iesus Christ, and against all his Saints and people: and withall to thinke, how hard it is for him to kicke against the prickes, and that against the light shining clearely in his heart. And yet<note place="margin">Acts 9, 5.</note> more also, to ponder wisely what it is to give Satan advantage, but by one lie only wilfully maintained, and especially such a lie, as tends but to the murdering of one soule. And how much more then, when it is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Art of lying devised by and for the devill himselfe; to hold up his kingdome, and to overthrow the kingdome of Christ, and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and destroying of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soules, even of all bewitched by them; and tending to the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the people of the Lord, and the rooting them out of the earth. How dreadfull it will be to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ, to give answer but for the bloud of one soule alone; when <hi>Abels</hi> bloud, the bloud but even of his body alone, cries so loud from the earth, and makes <hi>Cain</hi> such a runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb facs="42"/>
all his daies, to be in hell whilst he was yet here in the earth; yea before hee came into that place of torment designed for him and for all other wicked men, and chiefly for all liers and murderers, to bee tormented there for ever.</p>
   <p>4. And finally, let mee wish him for his credit (if he respect nothing else) to answer all these books which I have mentioned, as well for the cause of the learned as the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, because they are (as it were sent of God) to manifest the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and then I have no doubt, but he our most blessed and onely wise God, will both reply and answer for us still, and so maintaine his owne cause, as to put them all to silence, at least in the pit which they are digging for us, and that for evermore.</p>
   <p>Thus have I through the good hand of my God, made way to the satisfying of the holy desires of those worthy Personages, which wish so Honourably and Christianly unto you, &amp; that we may match our chiefe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries in our devotions; although we doe already (as all may plainly see) goe so far beyond them in this kinde; and also to the end that you who meane plainly, and have not
<pb facs="43"/>
your hearts yet tainted with their bloud-thirstie desires, &amp; all others, may perceive, how you have been and are deluded, and even inchanted in every one of these respects: by which scale, all may measure the rest of their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrines and devices. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all I hope that I have made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the consciences of all, that all sorts must renounce Popery, and embrace the Gospell; or else professe themselves to be of their father the Devill, and that they will fight against Christ. To try if the Lord may be pleased yet to shew them mercy, to come out of the snares of Satan, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the cleere manifestation of these delusions of his, or by the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and teares of many of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, crying jointly for all, to hale and<note place="margin">See Peters enlargement, concerning the power of faithfull praier.</note> pull them out of Egypt and Sodome, for what are not the joint praiers of Gods people able to doe?</p>
   <p>Now these things being so, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion so laid open, and the Assumption so plainly proved and demonstrated to the convincing of everie of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, as I am fully perswaded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, give me leave in tender commiseration to turne my speech un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you all, who dare still stand out against his Majestie.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="43"/>Oh bethinke your selves in time, what it is to fight against the light of your owne hearts! what will follow the wounded conscience, when the Lord shall wake it and call it to an account, which hee will certainly doe, either in this life, or so soone as ever you shall depart hence. Remember the cases of <hi>Cain, Saul, Iudas,</hi> for fighting so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately against the light, and so standing forth against the Lord and his most gracious offer of mercie.</p>
   <p>Oh bethinke your selves in time of his terrible and most glorious Majestie, against whom you have so fearefully sinned, as to provoke him not onely against your selves, but against this whole Nation, even against us all, for your causes, in departing from him and his holy Religion, to a Religion of such abominations, and so manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed and declared to be of Satan his sworne enemie!</p>
   <p>Remember the dreadfulnesse of his wrath, so declared in the irrevocable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the Angels that so fell from him, of Adam, the old world, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and that which shall be so feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully<note place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> revealed when Christ shall come with thousand thousands of glorious Angels, in flaming fire, to render ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to all who know him not, and
<pb facs="44"/>
who will not yeeld obedience to his heavenly Gospell, and much more to all his obstinate enemies.</p>
   <p>Consider well how your sinne is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased not onely being committed so contrarily to your Baptisme vow, but also by all the evictions of the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of that idolatrous, lying, and murdering Religion, especially in this Nation, since the time of the first ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting it forth so publikely by Parlament, and even untill this verie day, and now last of all by this Discoverie of this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged delusion, wherein so many others of yours like unto it are included.</p>
   <p>Thinke what it is, not onely to bee barred out of Heaven, deprived utterly of all the joyes thereof, but moreover to be thrust into hell, to abide the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof with Satan and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for ever and ever: which must needs come upon you, if that Religion of Rome bee such, and have such sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, as you have or may see set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your faces.</p>
   <p>If you will not reade this, but bee as the deafe adder stopping your eares, and in stead of Satan hiding away and blinding your owne eyes, yet I hope you have each of you some faithfull friends, who (beleeving the Gospell▪ and perswaded of your delusions as I am)
<pb facs="44"/>
will play the parts of faithfull Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp; true loving friends towards such as are indangered by extreme distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in burning fevers or the like, or in extreme perill of perishing by water or fire, or any way else; <hi>viz.</hi> which will make these things knowne unto you, &amp; urge them upon you for your preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and recoverie, so to declare their uttermost love unto you, to the end to convert you, and bring you to us againe, and to our Lord Iesus Christ, and so save you from hell: though for the present they adventure your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, as I also must.</p>
   <p>Howsoever, this shall bee my rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and my witnesse for me before the Lord, for my dutie towards his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Majestie, and towards his Vice-Gerent our royall Soveraigne, &amp; of my love and dutie towards this Church and Nation, and even you all in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. For which, entreating him in his rich mercie to make it effectuall, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it and you to his Grace, which works above all that wee can conceive, and shall rest ever striving with you,</p>
