                 <title>The apologie for the conformable ministers of England, for their subscription to the present church gouernement : wherein is handled two things, the first is, that the setting vp of the primitiue church gouernement, vnder a Christian king is not a matter of necessitie, and this is prooued by twentie substantiall reasons : the second is, that the gouernement of the church as now it standeth, differeth not from the primitiue gouernement, but onely in one materiall and necessarie circumstance written by Iohn Freeman, minister of the Gospel</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubted with my selfe, Right Reuerend Fathers, very often, and long, whether I should euer publish, or bring into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen light, this long since written Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and defence of mine. I saw that our brethren differing from vs in the opinion of Church-gouernment, were, with the Religious, and the worshippers of our time, the men of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test esteeme. I saw that they were men of sincere liues, and of singular labour, and blessing in the Church of God. I feared, yea in a true cause, to open my mouth against them: least I should bee counted a temporizer, and an enemie to all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and to the Church of God. I feared mine owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, for feare of their offence. I feared least mine opinion, how s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>und soeuer, would bee so ouerswayed by their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that it would be cleane condemned; or ouerwaighed by their estimation, that it would be vtterly contemned. If the light of the trueth by my poore labours preuailed, and that I were made an instrument to discouer their errour, I feared (though without reason) least I should adde affliction to their bonds: a thing which my soule neuer tooke pleasure in: or else, that whiles I ouerthrow their error, I should ouerthrow Religion it selfe, which was close couched, and as it seemed

      <pb facs="5"/> inextricably combined, and conioyned therewith. For Sathan had so sowed this error, (a subtill tricke of that olde Nouatian, and Angel like Deuill,) in almost all the religious and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the lande, that religion it selfe seemed to liue, and to die therewith. Yea my selfe, before authority inforced mee with <hi>Lynceus</hi> eyes to looke into this opinion of theirs, was so farre carried with the regard thereof, that I rather chose to erre with such men, then to thinke the trueth with the present estate: the very reuerence of the men, made me to reuerence the verie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the men, and then no meruaile if I did easily consent to ouerthrow that, which my selfe had once holpen to build vp: But when I saw that howsoeuer I ought to reuerence such men: yet that I ought to reuerence, incomparably more the trueth, and glory of God: When I saw that my long silence, did not redeeme their silence, that the holding of my peace, did not giue them peace: that to be silent did do them no good: but to speake might do them some good, for it might resolue them. When I saw that they were condemned for their error: and my selfe, and my brethren were condemned for the trueth, so that their sincerity could not vphold religion, because of their silenced error: nor our truth, because of mens blind and wilfull, and too too vncharitable erring. When I saw that their false opinion ouerthrew their ministery with the state: &amp; mens false opinions concerning vs ouerthrew our ministerie with the contrary: so that in all places, and euery where, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was like to fall to the ground: I thought it high time now, if euer (not weighing what once I thought, but what now, I plainely see, and knowe) religion it selfe, and the trueth of God so requiring to cleere our selues in the open hearing, and sight of the world, and to let all men know, that we that haue subscribed to the present Church gouerment, haue not done it of humane infirmitie, as they would seeme to thinke, that are the most charitable among them: much lesse haue we done it as temporizers, to raise our selues to worldly honor: or as Apostataes, and turne coates,
<pb facs="5"/> to enioy the riches, and the fat of the land: but from a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of knowledge, and from tried, and approoued grounds of the worde, which what they are, we offer by this Apology to the view of the world, and to be looked into both by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, and by our friends: not now any longer standing in feare of the enuious man, if as <hi>Vlisses</hi> vnder <hi>Aiax</hi> shield: so I, religion, and the truth of God, (as in most humble wise I craue and most confidently hope,) may be hidden and safe kept, vnder your Lordships most able, and honorable protection. And since I haue ventured so far vpon your Lordships desired, but not deserued fauour, as to become troublesome to you, with the defence, of this my defence: Let it not I beseech you seem vnpleasing or vnseemely in your Lordships eies, if I intreate in the behalfe of our enemy-brethren, that they may haue free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to vse the presse, if they meane to make answere to this Apology and answere of ours. I feare not least these reasons of mine should proue like small wines, that please better in the tasting, then in the drinking. No my very hope is, that if they doe but reade them, they will relish them. But if they shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to dissolue them: they will resolue them, and that they will not finde them to be hay, or straw, or stubble, builded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation Christ, but pearle &amp; pretious stone, &amp; pure gold, which the more it is tried, the purer it wil be. And thus my hope is, that by me the weakest &amp; vnablest man of the Church: the Church, and we the condemned men of the Church, may keep our innocency: and our brethren, if they be not obstinate may be resolued, and we with them inioy in the Church, our mutuall, and long wished: but too too long broken, and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued peace: which God, who onely is able, and is the Author of peace, by this of mine, or some other more effectuall work, effect and work, in his good, and speedy time, for Iesus Christ his sake, to whome be all honour giuen and euerlasting praise, both now and for euer, Amen.</p>
