All other defeactes of the minde haue their cause of nature, or colour frō reason. PRIDE proceedeth from mans ouerweening, of his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie: the Sourse of AMBITION, is the glory and reuerence giuen vnto Aucthoritie. ANGER, and reuenge, groweth from the iniurie of others. But these two yokefellowes INGRATITVDE and ENVIE, doe degenerate from kinde, and maske without visard of excuse. The other pursue their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and seeke to breake but the barres of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncemēt: but the one of these woundeth his friend, whom he ought to honour, and the other reprocheth

vertue, whō the wicked reuerence: And least, Time, the true exposer of Secrets, reproche me, as a Fosterer of both these dampnable vices. Of Ingratitude, in not acknowledging, many receiued fauours, of a Right noble Italian Gentleman. Of Enuie, in smouldring his most cleare vertues: who with a zealous affection, oftentimes in my hearing, made his tongue, an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Trumpet to sounde the bright renowne of her Maiesties excellencie (as he sayd, and I beleeue vppon earth) the fountaine of grace and goodnes: who vsed her sacred name, with such a reuerent regard, as in his behauiour, I noted the full consideration of a dutifull subiect, denized by the eternall fame, of her Highnes deuine Grace.</p>
   <p>So that desirous to erect some Memorial Monumēt of his worthines, I haue takē vpō me to be the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie of a few, of many his precious vertues: Which I humbly present vnto your honor, with a hand redy to doe you effectuall seruice: and a tongue confessing, that you shall herein beholde, the least part of those glorious giftes, which eternize your name, and binde the generall multitude, to honour your Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet, for whose benefite, I haue likewise committed to memorie, the ciuill disputations, and speaches of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry well Courted Gentlemen, and Gentlewomen, his Guestes, during the time of my intertainment, with Segnior Phyloxenus (for so couertly I name him, least in giuing him his true honorable Tytles in England, I should make a passage for Enuie, to iniurie him in Italy) whose exercises, if my penne hath not maimed them in the reporting, may be a president of behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to the indifferent well qualited Gentleman and
<pb facs="3"/>
Gentlewoman: Besides, a true Anatomie of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, which eclypse, &amp; of the vertues which expresse the glory of Marriage: an estate both hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and diuine: honorable, in that, she is imbraced of all men: diuine, because in the last yeare of their life she (in dispite of death) maketh men to liue a new terme, in their children and posteritie: not vnlike to a leafe fallen Rose, which in his stalke hath many ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der buddes: Which bare report of mine: I reuerently protect vnder the Garde, of your honors regarded vertues: A bare report, I Christen it: for, whatsoeuer is praise worthy in this Booke, belongeth to Segnior Phyloxenus and his Courtly fauourers: and what is worthlesse, is the blame of my imperfect iudgement: So that, besides the protection, I am humbly to craue, that your Honor will receiue whatsome-euer is due to them, with a fauorable countenance, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the vnsufficiencie of their Trowchman: with an imagination, that his Present, is the testimonie of a duetiful affection: Who zealously prayeth, that your vertues maye haue as full power ouer Enuie, as they haue Aucthoritie to command the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mindes of the best inclined dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Of which number, it may please you of fauour, though not of merit, to account me.</p>
