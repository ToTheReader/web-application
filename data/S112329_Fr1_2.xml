Great is the Honor and Eminence, to which God hath exalted you; and will be yet much greater, if you honor him (againe) in his Prophets and Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors; who are (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth)
<pb facs="3"/>worthy of double honor;

<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>although the Calling of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, were neuer so glorious within, yet outward pouertie would bring contempt vpon them; especially among those who measure men by the acre, and weigh them by the pound (as most doe.) Which (he said) he found by experience in</hi> Germany, <hi>where hee saw the stipendarie Ministers of the Reformed Churches despised &amp; neglected by reason of their pouertie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (otherwise) very graue and learned men.</hi> And there is no doubt <hi>(MADAM)</hi> but it is the maine drift and masterpeece of Satan, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall Engines, and Emissaries (at this day) to reduce the Preachers of Gods sacred Word here in <hi>England,</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>to the like penurious and despicable Estate, thereby to euacuate the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of their Calling, and vtterly to annihilate their persons &amp; Doctrine, (For <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe, a man of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red graces, a diuine Prophet, and mightie Warrior, yet (in King <hi>Saul</hi>'s time) profest, that being a poore man, hee was but lightly esteemed, <hi>1 Sam. 18.23.</hi>) To preuent therefore this dangerous stratagem, and cunning sleight of the old Serpent; it is the duty of all good Christians respectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, especially of those whom God hath blessed with Honor, Wealth, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, to giue all due Honor, Ayd, and Support to the chosen Messengers and Embassadours of the King of Heauen; whose sacred and honorable Function was once in better esteeme
<pb facs="5"/>with the World, when a Priest mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed a Kings Daughter (For so it is recorded, <hi>2 Chronic. 22.11.</hi> viz. <hi>Iehoshabeth the Daughter of King Iehoram, the Wife of Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iada the Priest.)</hi> As for those proud Pharisaicall Peacockes,
<note place="margin">Tit.</note> which <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse</hi> that they know God, but in workes deny him, and in a pretended zeale to the Gospel, make Stales and Pack-horses of their Preachers, and yet rob them of their Maintenance; (scarse affording them, the crummes that fall from their Worships Tables) they shall (without due Repentance, and Restitution) one day know and feele, that the prophane contempt, and base entertainment of them, rebounds vpon Christ which sent them: for so himselfe proclaimes, <hi>Luke 10.16.
<pb facs="6"/>Hee that despiseth you, despiseth me.</hi> Vndoubtedly, these self-conceited Humorists, and Solifidian-Nullifidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of our Time, haue by their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious dealing, and irreligious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour towards their spirituall Guides, made themselues worse then Heathens and Barbarians: For how carefull was <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (a Heathen King) in the extremitie of Famine, to prouide for his Priests, and preserue their Lands from Sale or Alienation? <hi>Gen. 47.22.</hi> And what wonderfull kind, yea <hi>Honorable</hi> Entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did the Barbarians shew to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and his distressed Companie? (See <hi>Acts 28. vers. 2, 7, 10.</hi>) Which memorable Examples, the Spirit of God hath not registred in vaine; but for our Instruction, and the Conuiction
<pb facs="6"/>of their execrable Impietie, which in their hungry zeale, gape after the spoyle and ruine of the Church. Yet (to giue these Hypocrites their due) they are content that <hi>the Kings Daughter</hi> (the Church Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue) be <hi>all glorious within;</hi> but,
<note place="margin">Ps. 45.14</note> that <hi>her Cloathing</hi> should bee <hi>of wrought Gold;</hi> fie, they hold it very vnfitting: Jt were <hi>(say they)</hi> farre more decent and commendable for the <hi>Ecclesiasticall State</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and sute it selfe to the Apostles Pouertie, and to that pure and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Time. This, <hi>they thinke,</hi> is a Seraphicall Speculation, and worthy our best Attention: And J doubt not, but the Church will be content to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this <hi>Conformitie,</hi> vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that (according to <hi>the same
<pb facs="7"/>Rule, and Example</hi> of the deuout Christians of that Age) these <hi>Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Religion,</hi> and all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christianitie will instantly sell all they haue, and lay downe the price at the Churches feet, <hi>Act. 4.34.</hi> Surely <hi>(MADAM)</hi> were these People <hi>in truth</hi> the Children of God (as they strongly fancie themselues; <hi>Narcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus-like,</hi> being in loue with their owne supposed Beauty) they would be better affected to the Church (the Mistresse of heauenly <hi>Truth</hi>) and not goe about (like pernicious Furies) to cloathe Her in Raggs; that so feruently and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently endeuors (by the dispensation of Gods holy Word and Sacraments) to adorne their Soules with the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pearles, and inestimable Jewels of all Christian Vertues; and to inuest
<pb facs="7"/>them (<note place="margin">Luke</note>
      <hi>primâ stolâ</hi>) with the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embrodered Robes, and Royall Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a true, iustifying, and sauing Faith. But they well shew of what <hi>Spirit</hi> they are: euen of <hi>such a one,</hi> as would fright the whole <hi>Packe</hi> of them, if he should appeare and bristle among them at their Conuenticles, or Night-Assemblies.</p>
   <p>The GOD of Heauen assist and comfort your <hi>GRACE</hi> with his <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> make you a happy Jnstrument of much Good to his Church; and crowne you (in the end) with a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem of eternall <hi>GLORIE.</hi>
