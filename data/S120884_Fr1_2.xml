   <head>TO MY VERY GOOD
friende, Master Edward Conquest,
as much happinesse from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
as his worthy heart can wish.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, to forget your vndeserued kindnesse, were
a note out of my nature: &amp; yet how kindely to
requite it, is many notes aboue my ability. But
as a lame man, that striues to goe, shewes hee
would runne, if hee had legges: so, in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of my <hi>good will,</hi> imagin a <hi>Desire</hi> of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
matter. But leauing these complements, and to come to
my purpose; as I haue found you a kinde <hi>Spectator</hi> of my <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi>
so let mee entreat you, at my hands to accept this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
with a foolish <hi>title.</hi> Where, if <hi>VVit</hi> haue plaid the <hi>Wagge,</hi>
let him not haue his name for nothing: and where you finde a
head fit for this <hi>Cappe,</hi> either bestowe it vpon him in charity,
or send him where he may haue them for his money. I know
you are acquainted with many that well deserue it: whome,
least they should be mistaken for better men, I pray you giue
them the <hi>Cappe</hi> for their <hi>Cognisaunce.</hi> And so, hoping that
your <hi>discretion</hi> will beare with my <hi>imperfection,</hi> to finde no
better worke, to giue notice of my good will; I rest, with much
thankfulnesse, in more <hi>Affection</hi> than <hi>Protestation.</hi>

      <signed>Yours assured, to commaund,
