   <head>To the Favourable and Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Readers.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat my <hi>Dedication</hi> inscribes it selfe <hi>to the Favourable Readers,</hi> before <hi>to the Iudicious;</hi> is not so much out of <hi>Complement,</hi> as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:</hi> he that is guilty to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of being lesse <hi>Iudicious,</hi> hath the more need his <hi>Readers</hi> should be <hi>Favourable.</hi> And yet (thankes to your faire acceptance for it) I have hitherto received no such discouragement from the <hi>most Iudicious,</hi> that I need complaine they were <hi>lesse Favourable.</hi> For your honest pleasures (Gentlemen) and in thankfulnesse to your courtesies; have I vndertaken this my last la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
   <p>I have done all, with as much diligence, as a Scholler <hi>(morally)</hi> might doe: yea with importuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of diligence, have I sollicited such Gentlemen; as I knew to have beene in action, and that could teach me any thing. And something more then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="3"/> diligence, have I used in it. The <hi>Italian Painter</hi> hath 3. <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Comparison,</hi> in the preferring of his <hi>Peeces.</hi> If he saies tis but done <hi>con diligenza,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; tis no great commendation of his paines, for he meanes no more then an ordinary diligence. His second degree of praysing it, is <hi>con studio,</hi> with stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: and by that would he tell you, that his braine and hand; have a little more laboured, both upon the <hi>designing</hi> and the <hi>colouring.</hi> But if he addes <hi>con amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> that he did it with a <hi>love</hi> and an <hi>affection;</hi> to the <hi>Piece</hi> or <hi>Party;</hi> oh! tis <hi>di Madonna,</hi> then: and the <hi>Italian</hi> himselfe is at the highest of his expression.</p>
   <p>I have (as little as might be, and especially in the Kings <hi>Story</hi>) trusted to no <hi>written Relations;</hi> unlesse received from a <hi>knowne hand,</hi> or confirmed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall <hi>eye,</hi> or <hi>eare-witnesses.</hi> No, I have not singly relyed, so much as upon that diligent amasser of the <hi>Dutch Currantoes,</hi> the <hi>Gallobelgicus,</hi> and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Suecica; le Soldat Suedois,</hi> I meane by it: upon whose single credit, I have no where written any thing; excepting in those slighter encounters about <hi>Norimberg.</hi> And yet even there, had I beene in the same boxe, with him, and before him; the <hi>High Dutch Relations.</hi> I commend, (as much as any man) the queyntnesse of his language; and the neatnesse of his conceits, many times: which are the relishes of a <hi>French</hi> wittynesse in him. His best pieces, are the <hi>Abridgements of the lives of the two Kings.</hi> Divers of the conceits, therefore, of the first of these; have I made some use of, in my <hi>Character of the King of Sweden.</hi> The <hi>Second,</hi> have I wholly taken into my
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Character of the King of Bohemia:</hi> and I had divers reasons for it. Tis finely done; I was glad to see a <hi>Frenchman</hi> give that good King, his due; and twas safer for me to <hi>Translate</hi> that, then to <hi>invent</hi> a new one. Beyond this, would I by this <hi>Essay</hi> of <hi>Translating;</hi> try Masteries with the <hi>French Language:</hi> I confesse my selfe to be but a bungling smatterer, at it; and yet thus farre dare I be deposed, That had a queynt penne the doing of it, the <hi>French</hi> it selfe should not be able to transcend our <hi>English,</hi> in the happinesse of expressions.</p>
   <p>For the truth of those <hi>Relations,</hi> wherein I differ from that <hi>French Author;</hi> I report me to those that have reade both, and have beene personally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the <hi>Actions.</hi> And thus much (because we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer) had I reason to say in mine owne defence; and to prevent, withall, the abusing of my Countrymen, should he happen to be translated into <hi>English.</hi> Mine owne ambition is not, that this Piece of mine should be exempt frō censuring, or to be taken for above the true value of it: nor doe I professe my selfe to be other thē (like an <hi>Architect</hi>) the <hi>disposer of other mens Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, at my best value.</hi> I am <hi>Author</hi> of nothing, here, but of the mistakings; &amp; even of those, though I strongly be <hi>suspitious:</hi> yet am I, (no way) <hi>conscious.</hi> Knowingly, I have committed nothing against <hi>Truth;</hi> nor tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced peevishly, the honour of any person. I could tell no more then I knew, nor would not: sure, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have written all; but what I have, is neere about the matter.</p>
   <p>In writing of this <hi>Story,</hi> those two objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> against the likelyhood of all
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Histories;</hi> may appeare to be well satisfied. A <hi>Story-Writer</hi> (say those <hi>Barbarians) In the time, dares not; and After the time, cannot,</hi> write truely. For the first of these: the <hi>distance of the place</hi> secures me, against the feare of writing <hi>too truely</hi> of the <hi>present.</hi> My selfe, (not since these warres) was never neere enough to the <hi>persons</hi> or <hi>places</hi> of <hi>action;</hi> to be either <hi>bribed</hi> or <hi>skared</hi> by them. And as for the Authors, whom chiefly I have consulted; though they were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Gentlemen of the Army; yet have they now put themselues beyond the <hi>feare</hi> or <hi>hope,</hi> of <hi>pleasing</hi> or <hi>displeasing:</hi> because out of the service and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy. And as for the <hi>second obiection,</hi> thats well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, too; for though my <hi>Story</hi> be written <hi>after the time</hi> of doing, yet not <hi>beyond the memory</hi> of it.</p>
   <p>And thus, in this Iland, have I done with this <hi>forraine Story;</hi> as in some <hi>Houses of pleasure,</hi> I have seene done with the <hi>Landtskip</hi> of a Countrey: where the <hi>Hills</hi> and <hi>Woodes,</hi> and <hi>Houses,</hi> have by <hi>Perspective</hi> and <hi>Art Optick,</hi> beene so brought thorow a small hole; that they have <hi>in little</hi> beene reflected upon a <hi>Paper,</hi> or <hi>polisht Stone,</hi> in a <hi>Study</hi> or a <hi>Dyning-roome.</hi> And I have used the same <hi>Art Perspective:</hi> the <hi>Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip</hi> of these <hi>Swedish Warres,</hi> have beene out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> brought home into my <hi>Study,</hi> which my <hi>Paper</hi> here reflects off againe. <hi>In little,</hi> I meane, and as I could; and though not in their iust <hi>magnitude;</hi> yet something towards their proportions.</p>
   <p>If I have made my <hi>Readers</hi> waite, a while, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectancy of my <hi>Relations:</hi> I hope they will please to allow of this answer, for a satisfaction. That I
<pb facs="4"/> onely said, till false rumours might be contradicted; true reports, brought home to me, by men present; and the passions of people a little over, which might either make them harder of beleefe, or over-credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. My office (so hath God disposed of it) hath beene, not that of an <hi>Historiographer</hi> alone, but of a <hi>Herald</hi> also: one, that having served a Prince, first in denouncing of his <hi>Warres,</hi> and then in celebrating of his <hi>Triumphs;</hi> performes his last duties to him, at his <hi>Funeralls.</hi> So have my <hi>Three Bookes</hi> beene. My <hi>First Part</hi> proclaimed, the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> comming into the Field, and the <hi>Causes</hi> for it. My <hi>Second Part</hi> marshalled him along, all in <hi>Victories</hi> and in <hi>Glories:</hi> and my vnlucky <hi>Third,</hi> here waites upon him, in his <hi>Obsequies.</hi> The end of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> hath si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced his <hi>Intelligencer:</hi> it cannot be expected, that a <hi>Logician</hi> should proceed in his <hi>Argument;</hi> after that the <hi>Adversary</hi> hath taken away the <hi>Subiect of his Question.</hi> I have done with <hi>Novelties,</hi> now; and I henceforth desire my <hi>Readers</hi> to discharge me.</p>
