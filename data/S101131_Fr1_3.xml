      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, if thy tongue hath not tyed thee to a curst wife, I doubt not, but the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall view of my Subiect, wil winne at the least thy ordinarie acceptation. But when by perusing, thou wouldst espy how it is treated of, if thou beest illeterate, and the Curtaine of Ignorance be drawne before the eyes of thy Iudgement, I doe not much wey how thou art opinionated of me: if thou commend me,

I had rather with <hi>Lysimachus</hi> the Poet haue the approbation of one iudicious <hi>Cato,</hi> then the applause of a multitude: the iudgements of the iudicious, and the vulgar,

No intentions

But many may say with <hi>Philippus</hi> the Iester, that they haue got such an habit in speaking ill of them in iest, that they know not how to speake well of them in earnest. And it is a shrewd signe he neuer meanes well, that speakes alwayes ill. But lest thou turne from them, to test on mee, for my prolixitie, in bidding mee (as <hi>Diogenes</hi> did the Citizens, that had excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ample gates, to a little Citie) shut the gates of my Preface, lest the City of my Book runne forth, I will leaue thee.</p>
