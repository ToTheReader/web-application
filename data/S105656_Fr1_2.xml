I feare me some mayntaine blyndnes more

I spoken good reader besydes my purpose
which was non other then to admonysh the
that althought Rochester / More / &amp; Rastell
haue all thre (as thou {per}ceyuest by readinge
this former treatise) stiffely defended one he
resye / yet shuldest thou not haue of all thre
one iudgement or opinion / More and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chestre

one a byshope / the other chaunceler
of this noble realme of Englond / both aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyent

eruditiō in all kynde of lerninge estemed
aswell of them selfes as of many other that
no .ii. lyke myght in all this londe be founde:
it was thought that for there dignite nomā
durste for there yeres wytte &amp; lernyng nomā
was able to agayne say thē / wherfore they
were {per}swaded to be the mooste meate of all
other to take in hande the defence of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
paynes of purgatorye eyther the verye
foundacion or els the cheffe buyldynge sette
<pb facs="4"/>
vppō the foundacion of the church of Rome
Rastell had nothynge cōmen with thē. But
only many yeres &amp; awyt sophisticall whych
he called naturall reason / as a {per}taininge to
goddes worde he aknowleged hymselfe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt
therof notwithstondinge had such
opiniō of his wyt that he thought he coulde
as well proue purgatory by it as the other
.ii. hadde done by the scryptures wherin I
thynke he was not deceaued and as this iii
{per}sōs were not like so toke they the answere
made to them not a lyke / More &amp; Rochestre
thought foule scorne (see what the glorye of
this worlde &amp; hygh estimacion of our selfes
doth) that a ionge man of smale reputaciō
shulde take vppon him so cleane contrarye
to their opinion to wrytte agaynst thē. And
to be shorte toke the matter so greuouslye / that
they could neuer after be quyet in their
stomakes vntyll they had drōken his bloud
Rastell though he {per}ceyued his natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to be sore sayd to / yet was he not mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
as the other were And therfore wrote
he agayne / which worke of Rastell came to
his handes when he was presonner in the
Tower of London / where he made the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
folowyng to the same which answere
after Rastell had reade / he was well contēt
to counte his natural reason folyshnes and
with harty thankes geuen to god becam a
chylde agayne and sucked of the wysdome
which cometh from aboue &amp; saueth all that
<pb facs="5"/>
be noryshed therwith in the which he conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to his lyfes ende with the honour and
glorye of God to whome be prase for euer.
