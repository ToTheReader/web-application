THE PREFACE OF the <hi>Authour</hi> upon his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Curiosity, super-tituled, THE RESOLVER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ristippus</hi> being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wherefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed his Son in good <hi>Disciplines</hi> with so great care, made this crude or raw Answer, to the end said he, <hi>That one stone should not bee set in the Theater upon another</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>stone:</hi> It seemes by this answer, hee esteemed ignorant men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low beasts, and things though animated, he esteemed rather a stone, above them, which hath neither sence nor life: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse I would not so vili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>te the dignity of Man, although he were ignorant, because of the divine Character of the <hi>Soule:</hi> but I dare hold and maintaine, that of base things, he is of worse condition then the beasts, although that they for the conservation of their kinds, have beene indowed with many rich naturall faculties, the effects of which seeme to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach even to reason: But man
<pb facs="3"/>
having no neede of such facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, being he hath beene created of <hi>Reason it selfe,</hi> if he would vouchsafe to use it; by the meanes of which hee may bee a neighbour even to <hi>Divinity,</hi> which is farre from <hi>brutality.</hi> Now the use of <hi>Reason</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares principally in the search and knowledge of causes, the which makes us to equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish of those which are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and of the beasts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For the ignorant and the beasts know well the being of things, but not the causes of them; they see well that it is Day, that it is Night, they heare well enough the murmure
<pb facs="4"/>
and grumbling of the <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> they marke the progresse, the perfection, the decline, and the alteration of things which are in Nature, but the causes of all these things are onely in the learned, which know, and that with singular contentment of spirit the causes. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse as those which are shut up within a darke dull prison, cannot extend their aspects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all sides, but onely a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse by the grates, and little openings of the same: so our <hi>Soule,</hi> a prisoner within the grosse carkasse of this materiall body, having no other way of knowledge (for the most part)
<pb facs="4"/>
of those things, then by the meanes of the Sences, which are as the windows of his prison, cannot commodiously speculate and consider, nor by consequent know; but as the Hydropickes augment their thirst in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so the desire that they have to learne, increaseth in them even in their learning: And yet further in admiring the divers obiects that present themselves ordinarily as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veils to his ignorance, so that hee may have a solace in his knowing, without being satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet may draw some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>section, not perfection; the which hath therefore beene so
<pb facs="5"/>
wisely ordayned by the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar providence of the soveraigne authour of Nature, to the end that being stayed in the search of the Causes in these low things, and being not able, but to admire the effects in many subiects, our <hi>Soule</hi> lifts it selfe up to the knowledge of the first cause, which is <hi>God,</hi> wholly wise, wholly good, and Almighty: This is therefore that I ought not to be blamed of curious spirits, if in this curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous search of causes in naturall things, I have not digg'd so profoundly into all the secrets of Nature as they would desire: for it is a thing above more then
<pb facs="5"/>
humane power; and although I have not fed them with vaine imaginations, or imagined va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities as some, who with an ambitious arrogancy have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished resolutions of the most abstruce things, which the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,</hi> more able then they, have held either for inexcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or for uncertaine: Also it is easie to iudge, that they did but trifle themselves herein, and that silence would have better becommed them then their too much pratling, for in the end they could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves from those barres where their subtill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were so inwrapped, that
<pb facs="6"/>
they were constrained to have often recourse to the first causes, or to the universall. For if one asked them the reason, why the <hi>Adamant</hi> drawes the <hi>Iron,</hi> or the <hi>Ieate</hi> or <hi>Amber</hi> the <hi>straw,</hi> they answere, that it is by <hi>Sympathy, Analogy,</hi> and resemblance of qualities that there are in these two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but aske them what are those qualities, they are stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped there, so as they are lesse resolved after such their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, then they were before; for if I should grant them, that if the resemblances of some qualities are the cause of such attractions, then wherfore is
<pb facs="6"/>
it, <hi>That wood doth not draw or attract wood, stones stones, and so of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which not onely sympathize in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but are also of the same essence:</hi> Who is he that can yeeld a certaine reason, why the little <hi>Chickens</hi> feare the <hi>Kite,</hi> although they have never seene him, and that hee is so farre from them, as almost in the clouds; and yet they feare not the <hi>Dogge,</hi> the <hi>Cat,</hi> the <hi>Horse,</hi> nor any other Animals which passe hard by them: The same one may say of the feare which naturally the <hi>Hare</hi> hath of the <hi>Dogge,</hi> the <hi>Rat</hi> of the
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>Cat,</hi> and other the like; but these subtill spirits will answer, that it is a certaine <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:</hi> In truth, on the contrary, it is uncertaine, since wee can neither designe it, nor particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize it; for what other thing can we say, but to runne to the generall cause, and say, <hi>that nature hath given them as by instinct this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their enemy, for the safegard and conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their kinde.</hi> Who can resolve me of the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loas invention of our <hi>Fathers,</hi> touching the needle in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners Compasse, which turnes alwayes towards the <hi>Pole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
or <hi>North-starre,</hi> so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Navigation, the point of the same being onely touched by the <hi>Adamant:</hi> There are say they, Mountaines of <hi>Iron</hi> under this <hi>Pole,</hi> or neare it; the which for the sympathy that is betwixt the <hi>Iron</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant,</hi> wherewith this Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is touched, and is the cause that this point is alwayes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towards that coast there: neither will I deny, that these Mountaines are so, because I have never beene vpon them; but yet I am not bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it so, although I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this to the authority of those which have written here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<pb facs="8"/>
Therefore I will not very willingly perswade my selfe, that the attractive faculty of these Mountaines of <hi>Iron</hi> are so powerfull, that they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend so long a distance, as they ordinarily prove it in the vasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Seas.</p>
   <p>Who is he amongst the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians,</hi> that can give mee a cleare and true Reason of the comming and going of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> be it <hi>quartan, quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> or <hi>tertian,</hi> and why at his comming it first shakes him with a cold fit, and after sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth him with a hot, and how successively the sick have their <hi>houres</hi> certaine and infallible:
<pb facs="8"/>
nor otherwise can they resolve me, <hi>wherefore children of the seventh moneth live, and those of the eight, not; if it be not as they say in</hi> Egypt, <hi>because of the serenity of the Ayre which is in that Region:</hi> Briefly, there is an infinite number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effects, of whom the <hi>neighbour cause</hi> is hidden from us, to the end, that wee shall acknowledge our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and that wee should not grow proud upon our sufficiency, so short in many things, but that we should praise <hi>God,</hi> and that otherwise marking the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite desire to learne, which is
<pb facs="9"/>
innated in our Soules, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of Divinity,</hi> and which cannot be satisfied in this life, drawing from us a certaine proofe of its <hi>Immortality,</hi> and that it is in another place where shee ought to be made all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing and all accomplished, by the enioying of the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good in the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Creatour, the most cleare Mirrour, representing and teaching all things which shall bee to her eternally in view.</p>
   <p>For the questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in this Treatise, I perswade my selfe, that they shall here finde solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="9"/>
pleasant, and not vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; being for the most part drawne from the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes</hi> of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Aphrodisea,</hi> and from the workes of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Physitians, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists, and other grave <hi>Authours</hi> which I have glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and beene choise in them; having also contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much of my owne as well in the invention, disposition, and facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the reasons of others; so that those, which though they have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle iudgement, may resolve an infinite of other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,
<pb facs="10"/>
by the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of these here: Also it is my principall ayme and marke, to profit by my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours all sorts of studious persons, and that the glory may be to <hi>God,</hi> by whose grace and bounty we hold all sorts of <hi>goodnesse,</hi> which appeare by so much the more great, as we commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his gifts to others: for unhappy are those, who hide or bury their treasures, be it riches of spirit, or other communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable blessings.</p>
