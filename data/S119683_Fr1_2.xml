   <head>TO THE MOST VVOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Knight Sir <hi>John Hollise,</hi> Comptroller <hi>to the Prince his highnesse house-hold,</hi> prosperitie with aeternitie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, it is long since you did first looke on mee with your helpfull fauour. I haue for twentie yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter those times stood below in the common place of the Church: yet sometimes I haue beene drawne vp aboue the obscure shades of the Countrie, and by forceable intreaty, risen higher then is ordinary for such an heauy lumpe of refuse mettall.<note place="margin">Pistillo retu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</note> And being in London at a festiuall triumph, I was a partner of the common ioy for the ioyfull prosperity of our most hopefull Prince of Walles. Then and there I was pressed forth <hi>(aere amicabili)</hi> with a friendly motion, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an actor in that great assembly. I must confesse. I was willing on my way, which made my labour more light, so that I hallowed that holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath with two Sermons, as a paire of Pigeons, or two yong Turtles.<note place="margin">Luk. 2.24.</note> I did wish richer offerings to bestow in such a solemne sacrifice of Vowes, but I brought my best, to testifie for my heart. What though I am vnworthy of respect, as the least Bell in the Temple <hi>(imo ne tintinnabuli in fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
         <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria vestimenti Araonici)</hi> not worth a little Bell vpon the skirt of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> Ephod.<note place="margin">Exo. 28.33.34</note> Yet I thought it my duty without any intreaty to ring my Bells that day in the holy place. When I had comfortably ended my daies worke, it came to passe beyond my thoughts, that one of my auditors and I exchanged thoughts. He as it seemed a francke Popeling, of his chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty offered me his thought, that I was too officious. I for a present reward bestowed my thought on him, that I was excusable, as the man which being requested to goe a mile with his friend would goe twaine.<note place="margin">Matth. 5.41</note> I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be warned and to take better heede to double diligence, <hi>abundans
<pb facs="3"/>cautela non notet.</hi> Heere I resolued neuer to perach vp to the presse, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the learned sages and holy writers:<note place="margin">Vitiligatores tantum exti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mescens.</note> therefore did I seriously resist all louing importunities intising mee to venture loose coppies of this and other my weake labours into the hands of my chiefe friends.</p>
   <p>My reason for my deniall was, <hi>quia nescit vox missa reuerti:</hi> a man may shoot foorth two arrowes with more ease and speede, then fetch one backe againe. Yet now at the length I haue yeelded my selfe, and presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to send my first fruit to my first friend liuing, in your acceptance to liue or dy. I must confesse my desire is that you would accept it as a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come present of my humble thanks (<gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>) and thinke my thanks as hearty as I meant them. You haue heard the cause wherefore I stayed these twins at home so long after their birth, with a centurie of their naked brothers.<note place="margin">Agrippo steri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

         </gap>or.</note> I doe willingly acknowledge mine owne pouerty, by which I thought my selfe vnable to cloth them with decent apparel. And I was ielous of their rude education, least I should heare worse of them abroad then at home. If I haue beene too slow, I craue pardon with my feare to be too hastie.<note place="margin">Ne incalciatus in montes.</note> Let it be said of me, that I am too like to many of <hi>Adams</hi> kindred and mine owne: that I haue learned more good rules then I can obserue, as that of <hi>Columella: Matura satio saepe decipit, sera semper mala est.</hi> Yet I rest in hope of your loue which I haue chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie loued. I might adde some expert extenuation of this seruice which spark of Art may better become my betters. <hi>Namque si Scotista Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricetur,</hi> he is easily espied, <hi>vt Graculus inter musas.</hi> It is inough for me in this illustrous age of high Science, and rich Art, <hi>Craesi pecuniae te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcium addere.</hi> Therefore to preuent many needlesse words, in these few I yeeld my selfe to owe so much vnto you, that I must remaine your debtor for euer, and</p>
