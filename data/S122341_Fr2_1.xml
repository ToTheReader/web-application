   <head>Of Water-works.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been an old saying amongst
Philosophers, and experience doth
prove it to be true, <hi>Non datur vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
that is to say, Nature will not
admit of any vacuity, or emptinesse. For some
one or other of the Elements, but especially
Ayre, and Water doe insert themselves into all
manner of concavities, or hollownesses, in, or
upon the earth, whether they are such as are
formed either by Art or Nature. For the one it
is so obvious, and manifest, as that it needs not
any proofe at all. As for the other, I shall make
it manifest unto you by easie demonstration.
Let there be gotten a large vessell of glasse, or
other, having besides the mouth another
hole (though but a little one) at the top: poure
water into the vessell by a tunnell thrust into
the mouth of it, and you shall finde that as the
water runneth into the vessell, a winde will
<pb facs="5"/>
come forth of the little hole, sufficient to blow
out a candle being held over it. This proveth,
that before the water was poured into the vessell
(though to our sight it appeared to bee empty)
it was full of ayre, which forced out of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
as the water ran in; and the reason hereof
is, because the water is by nature of a massie, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till,
substance; and the ayre of a windy, light, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporative
nature: The knowledge of this, with
the rarifaction of inclosed ayre, is the ground
and foundation of divers excellent experiments
not unworthy the knowledge of any ingenious
Artist whatsoever.</p>
