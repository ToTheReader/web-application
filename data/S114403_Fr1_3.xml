                 <title>Christs victorie ouer Sathans tyrannie : Wherin is contained a catalogue of all Christs faithfull souldiers that the Diuell either by his grand captaines the emperours, or by his most deerly beloued sonnes and heyres the popes, haue most cruelly martyred for the truth. With all the poysoned doctrins wherewith that great redde dragon hath made drunken the kings and inhabitants of the earth; with the confutations of them together with all his trayterous practises and designes, against all Christian princes to this day, especially against our late Queen Elizabeth of famous memorie, and our most religious Soueraigne Lord King Iames. Faithfully abstracted out of the Book of martyrs, and diuers other books. By Thomas Mason preacher of Gods Word</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Ven as the Reuelation and other places of
Scriptures (good Reader) do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> foretell Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
to come, so this Historie declareth the
fulfilling of those prophecies in all points:
all the Martyrs died in this faith, that the
Pope is Antichrist. I could bethink my selfe
of no instruction so profitable for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of this Booke, as to giue thee a few rules to manifest vnto
thee that the Popedome is that Antichrist; which I will endeuor
to declare vnto thee by these rules following: first, by his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
place of abode; secondly, by his inward and spirituall
throne; thirdly, by his doctrine; fourthly, by his conditions;
fiftly, by the height, breadth, length and ruine of his Kingdome.
I will but open the way vnto thee, this Booke shall proue by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
my sayings to be true.</p>
   <p>Touching his outward seate, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 17. 18. it is the Citie that
then did raigne ouer the Kings of the earth, which was Rome:
the place is also described in the ninth verse, to be compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with seuen mountaines. This Booke shall proue that Rome
hath seuen mountaines about it. In the same verse, this Citie
hath had fiue kings that were then falne, another King did raign,
which was the Emperour, when the Reuelation was made, and
another was to come afterward. This book shall teach thee, that
the seuen Kings signifie seuen maner of Gouernments in Rome,
of which fiue was falne, the Emperour then raigned, and after
the Pope should raigne there: so the Holy Ghost hath pointed
out Rome, as plainly as can be, the place of Antichrists King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
Touching his inward or spirituall seat, S. <hi>Paule 2. Thess.</hi> 2. 24.
saith, <hi>He sitteth as God in the Temple of God:</hi> Antichrist signifieth
an aduersary of Christ; and if it had bin meant of the Turke, or
any other aduersary that did not professe Christianitie, he might
easily be seene without so many reuelations: but hee is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the description of a false Prophet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. a most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
Wolfe to Christs Lambs, and yet so couered with a sheeps
skin, that it is impossible to know him without the spirit of God.
Outwardly he seemeth to be a good tree, but his fruit is nothing
but thornes and thistles to destroy Gods children. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24.
Christ calleth them false Christs and false Prophets, prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they shall do such wonders, that if it were possible they
should deceiue the elect; so thou seest the Antichrist which is
prophecied of must be a professor of Christ, as the Pope is, which
calleth himselfe the Catholique Church, but he is the onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary
thereof, as this book will teach thee by experience.</p>
   <p>Touching the third point, to know him by his doctrines, 1.
<hi>Tim. 4. 1: They shall depart from the faith, and follow doctrines of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels,
and speake lies through hypocrisie: they shall haue their consciences
seared with an hote iron forbidding to marrie and commaunding to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from meats:</hi> and they teach the same superstitious doctrins
that <hi>S. Paule</hi> warneth vs from <hi>Coloss. 2. 16. Let no man condemne
you in meat and drinke, or in respect of an holy-day, or a new Moone, nor
Sabboths, nor make you forsake Christ the head in worshipping Angels,
neither let them burden you with traditions, as touch not, tast not, handle
not,</hi> which things haue a shew of wisedome, in that the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
be voluntary religious, and humble their mindes, and spare
not their bodies, nor haue their bodies in any estimation, but all
is nothing but to fulfill a fleshly religion: and <hi>Iude</hi> in his twelfth
verse compareth them to clouds which in a drieth seem to bring
raine but doe not: for, though they make great promises of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of soules, yet there is no true hope of remission of sins, nor
assurance of eternall happinesse in their doctrines. And in 2. <hi>Pet.</hi>
2. 17. he calleth them Wells, not with a little water, but quite
without water: for although by name they professe the Trinity,
yet their doctrins of euery person of the Trinitie, and of al other
points of religion, are contrary to wholsome doctrine, they
maintaine their doctrines, though falsely, vnder the names of
<pb facs="4"/>
the Scriptures, the Catholique Church, and the auncient fathers▪
this is the golden cup that the Church of Antichrist holdeth in her
hand, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 17. 4. but it is full of abominations and filthines of her
fornications: so if thou marke this booke, it is easie to know Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
by the falsenesse and wickednesse of all his doctrines, yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
ouer with glorious shewes of truth and wholsomnesse, yea,
although thou haddest no other meanes to discerne him by.</p>
   <p>Touching the fourth point of the conditions of Antichrist, <hi>Iude</hi>
in the eleuenth verse, saith, They follow the way of <hi>Caine:</hi> all the
persecutions of Gods children before times were but types and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
of the Papists in killing their brethren, as <hi>Caine</hi> did, because
they please God better then they. The abominable desolations of
<hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> and of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Vespasian</hi> of the materiall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
were but prophecies of the Papists abominable desolations of
Gods Saints. For this cause Antichrist is called in the Reuelation
a great redde Dragon, a Serpent, and a cruell Beast. S. <hi>Iohn Reuel.</hi> 17.
6. foresaw the Church of Antichrist, drunken with the bloud of the
Saints and Martyrs of Iesus Christ. And although he had seen all
the persecutions that were before or in his time, yet he wondred at
the bloud that he foresaw that the Papists should shed with a great
maruaile.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Iude</hi> in his 12. verse saith, <hi>They are cast away in the deceit of Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams
wages:</hi> for as <hi>Baalam,</hi> though he knew the Israelites to bee the
blessed of God, yet he would haue cursed them for lucre sake if God
would haue suffered him, so the Papists maintaine doctrines which
they know to be false, and commit all their murders of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
only to maintaine their Kitchin pleasures, honour, glorie, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and other worldly respects, as it shall plainly appear vnto thee
in this Booke.</p>
   <p>In 2. <hi>Pet. 2. 14. Their eyes are full of adultery, and they cannot cease to
sinne, beguiling vnstable soules.</hi> This Booke will shew thee how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeably
wicked they are, according to this prophecie: they are
spiritually called Sodom, because in that case they exceede in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
the Sodomites. These and many other wicked conditions
of theirs, are plentifully prophecied of in the Scriptures; and thou
shalt see the true performances of the prophecies in this book, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg>
wicked conditions shall plainly shew the Pope to be Antichrist.</p>
   <p>Touching the height of Antichrists Kingdome, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 17. 3. the
Church of Antichrist is said to sit vpon a skarlet coloured beast, ful
<pb facs="5"/>
of names of blasphemy, which is the Pope, who is a bloudy beast to
Gods children, &amp; takes all Gods names blasphemously to himself:
and <hi>vers.</hi> 4. he &amp; his Church are arrayed with purple &amp; skarlet, and
deckt with gold, precious stones &amp; pearls; and how gloriously the
Pope and his Church hath bin set forth, &amp; how rich they haue bin,
according to this prophecy, this book wil shew thee. In 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 14
<hi>He sitteth as God in the Temple of God, and exalteth himself aboue all that
is called God. C. Caesar Caligula</hi> the Emperor, which vsed to sit in the
Temples of the Idols, to be honored as God, &amp; caused his picture to
be set vp to be worshipt in all Temples, and in the Temple of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
yet was he not such an abominable Idol as the Pope maketh
himselfe to be: he is the Gaoler of Purgatory, and thither comes (as
he saith) all the soules of Christians, except som few, to whom for
building some religious houses, and for being otherwise a speciall
maintainer of his kingdome: hee giueth a speciall prerogatiue, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
to go to heauen: these soules his prisoners hee punisheth
how, and as long as he list, and at his pleasure he throweth any of
them into hell, or sendeth any of them into heauen. Of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of this Gaole hath all the Popes riches, honour, &amp; superioritie
aboue Emperors, and Kings proceeded: he hath taken from Christ
the honor of pardoning sins to himselfe: God made man of clay,
but the Pope and all his shauelings can daily make God of a piece
of bread. In these, and many other respects (as this booke will teach
thee) doth the Pope exalt himself as God, according to this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie;
and he exalts himselfe aboue all kings, which are called Gods,
and at his pleasure with excommunications can cast them out of
heauen and out of their kingdoms, as himselfe saith: he hath trode
vpon Emperours, &amp; made them kisse his feet, hold his stirrups, and
leade his horse. He made the Emperor <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. his wife and his child
to wait three daies and three nights bare-foot in winter at his gates,
to sue to him for his fauor, and gaue away his Empire in the meane
time. This prophecie of Antichrists exaltation aboue Princes, is
verified in none but the Pope.</p>
   <p>Touching the breadth of his kingdom, it is not said he shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
himselfe aboue one or two, but aboue all that are called God, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg>
are all Christian rulers, spiritual &amp; temporal, to whom God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth
this name, because hee ruleth and instructeth by them, and
dwelleth in them, if they be good: this declareth the large limits of
his kingdome. And as he is said heere to exalt himselfe aboue all
<pb facs="5"/>
Kings, so <hi>Reu.</hi> 17. 3. he is said to haue ten horns; and in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. they
are interpreted to be ten Kings, which shal giue their power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
vnto the beast, that is to say, the beastly Pope, and fight with
the Lambe, that is, they shal be the Popes Butchers to destroy Gods
children; and as the prophecies foretell such an Antichrist as shall
raigne ouer all Christian Princes, so this storie shall shew thee the
true fulfilling of this prophesie in the Pope.</p>
   <p>Touching the length of his Kingdome, it is prophecied Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
shall raigne three yeares and a halfe; and in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12. three
times and a halfe: these times and these yeares are all one; so is the
fortie two moneths, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 13. 5. for there be so many moneths in
three years and a halfe: the same likewise is the 1260. dayes in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.</hi>
12. 6. for there be iust so many daies in three yeares &amp; a halfe, at
360. daies to the yeare, which was the number of the dayes of the
Iewes yeare. And it is common with the prophets to set downe a
day for a year; so by these prophecies Antichrist must raign 1260.
yeares, which is iust so many yeares as Christ preached daies: and
<hi>Gregory</hi> the first sheweth that Antichrist began when one Bishop
exalted himselfe aboue all others. And though there were manie
Popes before him which did exalt themselues aboue all other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
yet he would not but haue himself called, <hi>Seruus seruorū Dei.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Wherefore <hi>Sabinianus</hi> which succeeded him in the popedom,
was a malitious detractor of his works, as thou maist see in this
book. Antichrist was not at his height vntill <hi>Hildebrand</hi> had gotten
aboue the Emperor, for then he was aboue all that was called God;
yet Antichrist began when the Bishop of Rome, being the least of
all the foure Patriarchs, exalted himselfe aboue all other Bishops,
which was about the yeare of Christ 400. for then began pride and
superstition to creep into the Church, and <hi>Anno</hi> 666. according to
the number of the name of the beast in <hi>Reu.</hi> 13. 18. Latin seruice was
set vp in England and all other places, and mass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s, ceremonies, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies,
and other Romish ware, which was long before <hi>Hildebrands</hi>
time. And if we account the aforesaid 1260. yeares of Antichrists
raigne from thence, there remaineth but about 46. yeares to come,
vntil God shal call together the kings of the earth to destroy Rome.</p>
   <p>Touching the fall of his kingdom, <hi>Mat. 24. 22. If God should not
shorten his kingdom, none of Gods children could be saued from his cruelty:</hi>
but for the elects sake, <hi>Reu.</hi> 11. 13. God first destroyed the tenth part
of his Kingdom: thou mayest note in this book when this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb facs="6"/>
was fulfilled; and <hi>Reu.</hi> 8. at the blowing of the foure first Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
the third part of all his kingdom is destroyed: which prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
we see fulfilled at this day, for the third part of his kingdom are
wholly become Protestants, yet <hi>Reuel.</hi> 11. 22. the Church of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
is not heerewith moued to repent of her murders, sorceries,
fornications, and thefts, but <hi>Reu.</hi> 18. 7. glorieth her selfe that she is a
Queene, and shall be no widdow, that is, shee shall neuer lose her
Spouse the Pope, therfore shall her plagues come at one day, death,
sorrow, and famine, and shee shall be burned with fire, for strong is
the Lord God which will condemne her. The meanes of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
is set forth, <hi>Reu.</hi> 17. 16▪ the ten kingdomes that first tooke
her part against Gods children shall hate the whore, and make her
desolate and naked, and eate her flesh and burne her with fire, for
God doth put into their hearts to fulfill his will. The manner of
the destruction of Rome and the Popedome, is declared <hi>Reu.</hi> 19. 17.
as fowles gather together to a dead carkasse, so God shall gather all
Nations together to warre against Rome, and shall take her and the
Pope, the false Prophet that worketh miracles, wherby he deceiued
all that receiued his marke, and worshipped his Image: and they
shall not only be destroyed in this world, but they shall bee cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue
into a lake burning with fire and brimstone, to wit, into eternall
damnation: and <hi>Reu.</hi> 18. 20. the Angells and all Gods children are
exhorted to reioyce at her destruction, and <hi>vers.</hi> 21. Rome shall be
destroyed with such violence as a Mill-stone falleth into the Sea,
and there shall neuer any more Mill grinde any light corne, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
be married in Rome, but it shall euer after be a desolate wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as Babylon was. They that cannot behold Antichrist in
this Glasse, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. it is a signe the Diuell, the God of this world,
hath blinded their eyes: but as <hi>Salomon</hi> when hee dedicated the
Temple, prayed God to heare euery one that prayed therein, so I
beseech God with his holy spirit to illuminate all that shall reade
this book, that they may plainly see the pope to be Antichrist,
and to flie from him lest they be partakers of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
in this world, and in the
world to come.</p>
