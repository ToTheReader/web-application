   <head>TO THE GODLY READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG</hi> all the wonders which haue happened on earth since the mysteries of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, what more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous, more wonderfull, &amp; profitable to man, than to haue an infallible refuge and harbour of security, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the fury and storme of the diuine wrath, where he may be deliuered from the imminent blow of that dreadfull sword, which perceth with so great woe, as the extreme and insufferable paine which it causeth, can neuer be mitigated, nor in any sorte abated, but rather more and more increased: as by meditating, considering, and reading the holy Scriptures, it is playne to all, that can conceiue the misfortunate state of sinners. VVhich is the chance of all that dy the children of wrath, and are plunged into the fiery pittes of damnation, bycause they did not succour themselues in their life on earth, in the harbour of Gods vnspeakable mercies: which very specially do appeare at his beloued <hi>Loreto,</hi> the precinct, the walls, and the circuite of that Paradise, where Christ our Lord was not only made man, and
<pb facs="10"/>the Sauiour of our soules: but also the sentence of malediction was taken from the damned posterity of Adam, and happily changed into the former benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If that the place where our first Father was created, was the delight and ioy of man; yf the place where the sentence of death was pronounced against vs, were holden of such wonder, estimation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, that no wordes can declare it: what I pray thee ought that to be, where Christ himself was framed of our nature; where in steed of damnation, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was brought from heauen and giuen to all well deseruing people? VVhich was not made the barre, the tribunall, and the throne of the rigorous and seuere iudgment of our death, but the Paradise, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, and the sacred Fountaine, where that heauenly salue was made, that cureth the grieued woundes of our manifold sinnes. If Allmighty God destroied the former Paradise, as the place of our damnation, and by a miracle vnheard of from the beginning of the world, hath preserued this in the very same state, wherin it was, when he himself was there made man: can any imagine, dare any say, will any iudge that it is for no end? This speciall wonder was for some greate purpose, as indeed the meruailous, the dayly, and the manifold benefits bestowed there on mankinde, by the praier of the immaculate Mother of our God, do vndoubtedly declare; yea and do si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify to all, that God, Allmighty hath made this a very speciall harbour of refuge and succour vnto vs,
<pb facs="11"/>in the manifold dangers of our earthly peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which not only many thousands of supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wonders, wholy surpassing the power of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall meanes, but also the incredible deuotion of all Christians, doth acknowledge, testify, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue the same, with more effectuall zeale, than any words can deliuer to the godliest Reader: in so much indeed, that they who haue not seene &amp; tasted this wherof I speake, at first will not so easily belieue to be true. For the like concourse, the like feruour, and such continuall deuotion, was neuer heard of from the beginning of the world. And what is the cause of all this so great feruour and reuerence? The reuiuing of dead men? the curiug of diseases, that by naturall meanes were vtterly despaired of, and past all hope of cure? the heauenly visions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations, which haue beene shewed to deuout people in this most Maiesticall Seate of the whole world? No, no, not only these, but chiefly the aboundance of Gods grace, the Fountaine of heauenly ioy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, which seemeth still to flow, and to be powred into mens harts beyond all measure in this celestiall place: which is so euident and so manifest, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> one nor two hundred thousands of people, which dwell neere at hand, but euen very many of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest parts of the world, yearly pilgrimage thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to drinke of this fountaine and sacred Riuer o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> heauen. Seing therfore that these things are so eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the very enemies of the Christian name
<pb facs="11"/>neither do, nor can deny them: what will they say, who deny that Saintes can heare our prayers? That their sacred Reliques can worke any effect aboue nature? VVhat answere will they frame and shape to this? VVell may they blush and be much ashamed, to haue denied, hated, contemned, and reiected Christ himself, by reiecting these things with such malicious contempt and hatred? But what? can any answere be made to the inscrutable iudgments of Allmighty God, who doth worke thus meruailously by the things, which he and his B. Mother touched and sanctified by their owne habitation, whiles they liued on earth? If in the old Law, allmighty God did worke these and such like wonders, in the Pond vpon Probatica (Ioan. <hi>5.</hi>) which he neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be made, either for the cure of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or for people to resorte vnto it, for that, or any other end, but approoued their deuotion and godly reuerence by miracles from heauen: will he then be lesse beneficiall to Christians in the new law, than to the Iewes in the old? Or will he do lesse ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Reliques of his deere Saintes, than to the waters which only washt the sacrifices of the old Law? Or haue people lesse need of these things now, than at those times they had? Or be there not now as many diseases in the new, as before in the old Law? VVhy therfore should not Christ bestow benefits on his beloued in this and in other places, by the merits of his B. Mother? VVhy should not diseases be cured in this
<pb facs="12"/>deuout House before the Image of our B. Lady now a dayes, aswell as in the waters of that Pond, in the tyme of the former people? Is Christ power lesse now in his owne House, than in tyme past in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that place? But why by more wordes should I seeke to prooue and declare the possibility of Gods grace &amp; power, which so admirably, so comfortably, and most merueilously doth not only shew it self; but also doth flow into mens soules in the sacred House of <hi>Loreto:</hi> that by his holy Conception and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there, Christ our Lord doth seeme to haue made it the gate of heauen, for our comfort and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting ioy. Haue not all nations Christian by their vowes, votaries, gifts and donaries approoued and most religiously desired to tast (as indeed they haue) of the sweetnes of <hi>Loreto?</hi> And which is more, do not heathenish nations admire and confesse the diuine power, which allwaies is so present there, that to them it seemeth as it were to dwell in the most sacred House of <hi>Loreto?</hi> All <hi>Barbary</hi> is full of the reuerēce of <hi>Loreto,</hi> and doth tremble to heare the name of Mary of <hi>Loreto</hi> mentioned, whome many times that country-people thinking to haue robbed &amp; spoiled of her wealth, were taught by many great miracles, and infinite losse of men, not to touch, nor approach vnto her, but to reuerence and honour her with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious respect and deuout wordes. Only England of all nations vnder the sunne doth not know, doth not honour and reuerence this glorious Paradise of the
<pb facs="12"/>earth. VVhat, is she worse than Turkes and heathen people, who dare not attempt any hostility, nor vtter any irreuerent thing of <hi>Loreto,</hi> being taught this fruitfull lesson by their great harme? Truly for that presumptuousnes, which maketh thee O En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to say that Saints cannot heare our praiers, that Mary the Mother of Christ is no better than other women, that she can not heare, nor help her Suppliants. But if the Catholicke Church can not teach thee, if Turkes, if heathenish people cannot informe thee; let wonderfull workes of God, this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the world, the meruailous benefits bestowed on mankinde in this most sacred place by the praiers of the Mother of God, make it manifest vnto thee, that Christ doth heare his Mothers praiers, and that the contrary, irreuerent, impious, and blasphemous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion doth bring dānation of body &amp; soule to all those that belieue such fancies &amp; diuellish inuentions, as to contemne, to deride, &amp; to detract the Saintes of All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: wheras the contrary, that is, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to reuerence, and by humble praier to intreate the help, the assistance, and the aid of his Saintes, is so pleasing, acceptable, and deere in the sight of his diuine Maiesty, that he doth confirme this beliefe of his Catholike seruants with dayly &amp; innumerable miracles from heauen: wherby the contrary is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foūded, detested &amp; hated by Allm. God himself, that he can do no more to make thē to know &amp; see their dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable &amp; dānable errour, &amp; indeed their heresy, as pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb facs="13"/>Christs Conception? who would not see the ouersha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing of the holy Ghost, and the vertue of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghest descēd on the B. Virgin in her litle house of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto?</hi> who would not be present at all the wōders that Christ wrought in that litle place of his aboad? who would not allwaies most effectually desire to pray with his body in <hi>Loreto,</hi> before the glorious Images of <hi>IESVS</hi> &amp; <hi>MARY,</hi> that his mind may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to greater ioy than wordes can expresse? O what increase of vertue will come to your soules, to thinke that B. Mary the Mother of God doth worke in your hartes all those miraculous cures which she hath donne in the bodies of her suppliants! what ioy will it be to your harts to see your sinnes taken away, to feele the working of the holy ghost in your breasts, to see dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation turned into saluation, &amp; deepe auersion into sweet imbracing loue! These things are so wonderfull and admirable, that nothing can be more desired of your soules. Therfore giue your selues to Mary, offer your selues to Mary, consecrate your harts and wills wholy to <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> will allwaies be with you in <hi>Loreto;</hi> she will teach you to pray, she will be an exāple still before your eyes, &amp; in your behalf before the Altar of his diuine presence, she will also offer vp euery <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> &amp; euery deuout naming of Iesus, to the increase of your holines on earth, to your great cōfort in all your tribulations, &amp; to the full accomplishment of your heauenly Crowne in the Paradise of eternity.</p>
