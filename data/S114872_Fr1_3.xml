   <head>TO
THE READER</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more sleight
in venting bad
commodities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
false glosses, nor never
more falsehood in counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
of coine, to make it
goe currant, then in these
our daies, so never more
cheating tricks in the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of shews and shapes of
holy performances, under
the colour of true and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall
duties, in this selfe-cosening
age of ours: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in this duty of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
under the shadowes and
<pb facs="6"/>
shew whereof, the Divell
masketh himself even as an
Angell of light: All that
are of any religion wil seem
to pray, but a few pray in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
It is an easie thing
under the meanes (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of quick wits,) to drawe
a faire picture or dumbe
shew of prayer; but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
only can make a living
prayer. As nothing is liker
true friendship then flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
so nothing liker Piety
then Hypocrisie: nothing
liker Prayer then painted
words; but words without
quickning power of the
Spirit are no prayer at all.
All that are of any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
within the pale of the
Church, will acknowledge
the indigested prayer of the
<pb facs="7"/>
brutish ignorant, to be but
babling, and also the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of such as worship a
strange God, or the true God
after a false manner, to bee
but sin but that a man may
have fit wordes, a fluent
phrase, patheticall expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
yet no prayer, that
seemeth a Paradox: but that
so it may be I have shewed
at large in this Treatise,
wherein I have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to cleare by proper and
distinct notes the true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Prayer from all Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
of prayer. And
where the comfort in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ariseth from the sense of
the spirit in prayer, I have
delivered (as I may) the
meanes of attaining the
sense of the Spirit, together
<pb facs="7"/>
with incouragements and
motives to goe on in prayer
though sense be not present.
And lastly I give directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
how they that want the
Spirit of supplication, shall
labour for it. Though my
insufficiency in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
may appeare to an
Artist in the faculty, yet, to
Gods glory bee it spoken, I
have gone along by the
light and feeling of some
sparkles of the Spirit, but
with matter of much sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
for my shallownesse in
the duty. Take heed then,
Christian Reader, how thou
prayest, for it is Sathans
main imposture to get thy
heart to deceiue thee in this
duty, which is the lock and
key of all other duties; read
<pb facs="8"/>
and consider, impute the
failings to me, and give
God the Glory if any thing
pleaseth.</p>
