coyne, or the like; wheresoeuer such a one is deprehended, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to some body to attach the criminous and bring him before the higher Powers, there to receiue censure and sentence according to his crime. As it is thus in causes secular, so mee thinkes it seemeth but reason in causes diuine. Hauing therefore in the forraigne parts of the <hi>East Indies</hi> (whither it pleased God to dispose mee in a Ministeriall charge vnder the imployment of the <hi>East Indian</hi> Company) espyed two Sects rebelliously and schismatically violating the diuine law of the dread Maiesty of Heauen, and with notable forgery coyning Religion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to the Minte of their owne Tradition, abusing that stampe which God would haue to passe currant in the true Church: I thought it my bounden duty (through default of one more sufficient) to apprehend them and bring them before your Grace, to receiue both censure and Iudgement: Whose Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in our Church of <hi>England</hi> doth best intitle your Lordship to be a Iudge of their causes and crimes. I haue therefore in this first Booke made Inditement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Banian,</hi> whose cause hath formerly had some refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to your Grace, by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Mr. <hi>Purchas,</hi> whose eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences being <hi>nihil praeter auditum,</hi>

and those not vnbaring the roote of their guilt and criminaltie, I haue brought them to a second examination accused vpon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Euidence. May it please your Grace then to giue them a second suruey, pardoning my weakenesse, if in any place the poorenesse of their superstitions goe cloathed in a stile vnworthy of your Graces more sublime Iudgement. Thus hoping the forward tender of this Nouelty, will ouer ballance the disabilities of the Presenter, my prayers to God are, that your Grace may liue long a Patron to the causes of our Church, and like a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend <hi>Moyses</hi> descending from Gods Mount, bray the
