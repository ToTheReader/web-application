   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Long Preface would not become a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of so small a bulk. Onely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in a word or two, thou art desired to take notice, that this Discourse was a <hi>private Exercise,</hi> delivered in a Colledge Chappel, above two full years since, and so before the present contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie about that subject, whereof it treats, was commenced by any publick writing: and therefore not to be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to ayme at, or to have relation to
<pb facs="3"/>
any mans opinion or person since inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essed therein.</p>
   <p>That it was never intended for the <hi>publick view,</hi> but, as thou mayst easily perceive by the forme it still carries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altered, fitted properly to that private Auditory and time, wherein it was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. But when, by occasion of the late <hi>polemicks,</hi> it was copied out, to cōmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to some friends, for their better resolution in the controverted point: it chanced to fall into the hands of some, who so wel liked it, as that they thought, the time of its composure especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, (which by way of caution was then prefixed in the front) it would, being made publick, conduce to peace, and setling of mens minds and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this question.</p>
   <p>The hope of so desireable a good
<pb facs="3"/>
prevailed with the Author (otherwise the most unwilling of any man to come abroad) to permit it to the Presse. For whom would it not grieve to see, that the very <hi>NAME</hi> of That, the approach whereunto, was wont, and still should, dissolve all differences,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Matth. 5.</hi>
      </note> should now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the occasion of so much quarrell?</p>
   <p>Thus much I thought good to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish thee: and so hoping thou wilt make a favourable and candide construction of what is presented unto thee, with no ill meaning (I dare assure thee) I bid thee Farewell.</p>
