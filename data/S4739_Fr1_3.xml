      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Rt hath her first originall out of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which therefore is called the Schoole-mistresse of fooles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she teacheth infallibly, and plainely<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> as drawing her knowledge out of the course of Nature, (which neuer failes in the generall) by the senses, feelingly apprehending, and comparing (with the helpe of the minde) the workes of nature; and as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things naturall, so especially in Trees: for what is Art more then a prouident and skilfull Collectrix of the faults of Nature in particular workes, apprehended by the senses? As when good ground naturally brings forth th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e and therefore must we count that Art the surest, that stands vpon experimentall rules, gathered by the rule of reason (not conceit) of all other rules the surest.</p>
   <p>Whereupon haue I of my meere and sole experience, without respect to any former written Treat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se gathered these rules, and set them downe in writing, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to hide the least talent giuen me of my Lord and Master in Heauen: neither is this in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>urious to any, though it differ from the common opinion
<pb facs="4"/>
in diuers points, to make it knowne to others, what good I haue found out in this facultie by long triall and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. I confesse freely my want of curious skill in the Art of planting. And I admire and praise <hi>Plinie, Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Virgil, Cicero,</hi> and many others for wit and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this kind, and leaue them to their times, manner, and seuerall Countries.</p>
   <p>I am not determined (neither can I worthily) to set forth the praises of this Art: how some, and not a few, euen of the best, haue accounted it a chiefe part of earthly happinesse, to haue faire and pleasant Orchards, as in <hi>Hesperia</hi> and <hi>Thessaly,</hi> how all with one consent agree, that it is a chiefe part of Husbandry (as <hi>Tully de senectute</hi>) and Husbandry maintaines the world; how ancient, how, profitable, how pleasant it is, how many secrets of nature it doth containe, how loued, how much practised in the best places, and of the best: This hath already beene done by many. I only aime at the common good. <hi>I</hi> delight not in curious conceits, as planting and graffing with the root vpwards, inoculating Roses on Thornes. and such like, although I haue heard of diuers prooued some, and read of moe.</p>
   <p>The Stationer hath (as being most desirous with me, to further the common good) bestowed much cost and care in hauing the Knots and Models by the best Artizan cut in great varietie, that nothing might be any way wanting to satisfie the curious desire of those that would make vse of this Booke.</p>
   <p>And I shew a plaine and sure way of planting, which I haue found good by <hi>48.</hi> yeeres (and moe) experience in the North part of <hi>England</hi>: I preiudicate and enuie none, wishing yet all to abstaine from maligning that good (to them vnknowne) which is well intended. Farewell.</p>
