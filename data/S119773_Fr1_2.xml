   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>I Haue obserued (gentle Reader) from the words and writings of the learned, that it is a Maxime or Rule in Philosophie; <hi>Finis est primus in intentione,</hi> The end aymed at is first setled in the intention of man: And finding this Romanist to boast and brag much of his learning, it is not vnlike, that like a cunning Clerke (whatsoeuer his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be) the ende of this his worke was the first ground of his writing.</p>
   <p>He proclaimeth Temperance in his title, he pursueth the Art of Rayling in the whole processe following, and in the end of all, he perswadeth ruine both to Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: In the first dissimulation, in the second scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and the third trecherie is contained; for he shakes handes with Temperance at the verie first, and leaueth her to rest and remaine with his title, and the leafe being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he plungeth presently into his vaine of rayling, which (if he had affected Temperance) he would neuer haue done, and the end sheweth his intention to be to bring in either a tolleration or flat alteration of Religion.</p>
   <p>But wilt thou know (Christian Reader) what forced this fellow to become so suddenly distempred? My <hi>Watch-word</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
presented vnto thee to prepare thee with a couragious heart, and readie hand, to resist forraine malice, and home treason, plotted and purposed by <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spayne,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Soueraigne and Countrie, hath wakened him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time, and out of the lightnesse of his braine (through ouer-watching of himselfe to deuise and worke mischiefe) he tearmeth this my booke (in the beginning of his Preface) an iniurious Pamphlet and a <hi>biting Libell</hi>: my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours therein he calleth a base exercise of calumniation and rayling, and in the matter thereof it pleaseth him to say; I spare neither God nor man, <hi>So farre forth as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Catholike cause, or the cause of them,</hi> and for this I must receiue my checke and refutation at his pleasure.</p>
   <p>The iniurie he chargeth me to haue done is to his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, of whose doctrine and dealing I confesse (in my former booke) I warne thee to beware: as for the tearme of a byting Libell, thou wilt say (gentle Reader) when thou hast peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him and me both ouer, that it is a more fit addition to the title of his temperate <hi>Ward-word</hi> which is byting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is full of rayling, and is a Libell, because it is slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous against her Maiestie, and the seat of her Iustice, and is thrust out without name: as for the basenes of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise imputed to me for writing and publishing that booke, and the cause thereof, indeed it is a verie base thing to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate, and rayle as he doth; but to lay before Subiects the doctrine and deeds of disloyaltie, and to warne them to take heed thereof, as I haue endeuoured therein to doe, will proue neither calumniation nor rayling.</p>
   <p>If any simple seduced Catholike stand free from subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to the disloyal doctrine of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; from doing that it directeth and teacheth, he is not touched by me; therefore
<pb facs="3"/>
this Champion that draweth all Catholikes within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of my words wrongeth them more then I doe: but he might haue spared to name the God of heauen, as a partie in his Catholike cause, till he can proue the cause warranted from God, and his truth, which he shall neuer do; yet I must receiue this worthie Gentlemans checke for my labour, but he shall find it is farre from a mate, and that his Bishops are too weake to bring it to that.</p>
   <p>The Gentleman saith he is verie loath to be ouer eager and sharpe with me in his Encounters, not onely in his owne worshipfull disposition, but also for the reuerent respect he carrieth to the house and family I come of, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler affection he feeleth towards some of my name and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage; but this is no sooner vttered then that he breaketh out presently into these words: <hi>Who will not confesse but that lying, forging, and falsifying, ignorant vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, odious scoffing, malicious calumniations, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious interpretations, bloudie exaggerations, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous insultations, ouer them that alreadie are in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and calamitie, ought to be farre from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, pen and tongue of a Knight or Gentleman?</hi> And who would haue thought that so temperate a title could haue afforded so vntemperate a stile? Againe, who would haue expected such raging and rayling Rhetoricke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me from one of so milde a disposition, as he professeth to be of, and that caried so reuerend a respect to the family whereof I am a braunch, and such a feeling affection to some of my name as he would perswade? But he hath cut the throate of his temperate title, and procl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

hanging-ward, which proueth alwaies a dangerous ward if it be sharpely followed by the assaylant, but for his reuerent respect to my family and his affection to some of them (which surely I thinke it verie slender and scunt sounde to any of them) I would aduise him not to lie so open, but to betake him to a stronger and sounder ward least be catch a double venue for his labour.</p>
   <p>But he is prouoked by me to breake out into choler for that I not onely (saith he) <hi>Touch the honours, states, and liuings of home-borne subiects, and bring them into question, vniustly being no waie tollerable, but rush further to the open assault of forraine Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, also their honours, fame and reputations which is lesse tollerable, and consequently hath neede of some more sharpe and forcible reiection.</hi> The former persons meant by him are made apparant before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of them I onely say this in this place, I wish them all from my heart, that as they are home-borne, so they may be home-hearted Subiects, that their Soueraigne and countrie may enioye them sound English Subiects indeed: as for his Monarches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spayne</hi> hee hath no cause to carpe at me, but to blame themselues, for it is they, and not I that haue teinted their honours, fame, and reputations, the first of them hauing long sought to depose her Maiestie from her regall and supreame right within her owne Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the other hauing made attempts to inuade and make a conquest of her land, and both of them hauing conspired the death of her Maiestie by setting on both bastard borne, English and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">

   <p>The violence of the <hi>Puritane</hi> spirit is added by him for a reason why he is prouoked by me, by which words (for all his difference made betweene <hi>Protestant</hi> and <hi>Puritane</hi>) both of them are apparantly knowne to professe Christ Iesus crucified in religion, and in true Christian pollicie to condemne Subiects that shall denie or breake their oath of fealtie; and alleageance to their Soueraigne, for the pleasing of any earthly power or Potentate whatsoeuer, and not to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour eyther Prince or Pope that shall vsurpingly challenge our Soueraignes princely titles from her, or ambitiously seeke by inuasion to dispossesse her of her kingdome, or trecherously practise by violence or any waies else to depriue her of life; so that though he disioyne vs in tearmes and names, yet he shall assuredlie finde wee all ioyne in condemning disloyaltie in subiects, ambition in forraine Princes and Potentates, and trecherie, and treason in any of them all against the State and person of the Lords annoynted: and of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that carrie this minde, I professe my selfe most willingly and gladly to be one.</p>
   <p>This Encounterer seemeth to glorie that the yeares of her Maiestie growe on fast, but the God of mercie I trust will prolong her daies to the holding out stil of the Popes vsurped authoritie, and superstitious doctrine, to the suppressing of traitours, and treasons, and to the daunting and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of any, that shall attempt by fraud or force to bring in or maintaine either; for from these onely come the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyles by which our State hath beene disquieted, and our Soueraigne endangered, and from these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

Reader) you may see that neither Sir <hi>Francis</hi> nor any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> nor <hi>Puritane</hi> are fit subiects for this seditious fellow to worke vpon, to set on foote his desired garboyles, as this <hi>Machiuilian witted Romanist</hi> seemeth propound (but most iniuriously) to put his owne, and his adherents traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practises out of memory, which are so plentifull in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and so manifest in fact as they can neuer be forgotten.</p>
   <p>After all this he layeth extreame flatterie to my charge, both of the State, and her Maiesties person in particular, which extreame charge of his (for he is all in his extreames) because it is redoubled vpon me, giue me leaue to referre thee (gentle Reader) to my answere thereunto, in my resistance to his first Encounter, only where he termeth this flattery by him supposed against me) <hi>to be a fit bait for such hooks as angle after popular fauour for a further fetch</hi>: my popularity onely consisteth in this, to haue loyalty, stand sound and vpright, and all trechery and treason suppressed. But if it please thee (Christian Reader) to obserue well this Gentlemans smooth Remitter to the Lords after his thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Encounters against me, with his fawning perswasion of peace, and crouching sute for tolleration or alteration of Religion (which before I affirme to be the first matter in his intention, and iustly call the ruine of our Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth) thou wilt easely perceiue what baytes he hookes withall, and what good he angles after vnder the sugred and sweet names of peace, &amp; vnity, wheras the good of our peace standeth vpon a good peace, &amp; vnlesse our peace may be free from present and plaine danger, it can promise little present or future good: and for his vnitie if it be vnity in veritie (as his is not) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

vs not of it) we enioy that already by and vnder her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie with great comfort, and both of her and it would this masked Romanist most gladly see vs depriued: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all his fawning and crouching to the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lords in his Remitter, their wisedomes (I doubt not) will easely finde out this subtile <hi>Synons</hi> intention, who shameth not with a brasen face to seeke to bring in his brasen horse, loaden with armed calamities for Englands ruine. I haue vndertaken this Popish Champion not with any purpose to follow him in his vaine of rayling, for therein I finde him not matchable, nor hauing a disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or desire to be stirring in matter of this nature, being more fit to be dealt in by men qualified with farre greater giftes of learning and art then I am, but being called as it were into the field by him, I haue aduentured vpon the height of his swelling pride, and haue shaped him a plaine and sound answere to all the materiall points culled out of my former booke &amp; excepted against by him, in which (how vainegloriously soeuer this proud Encounterer promiseth to himselfe victorie) I hope (Christian Reader) thou shalt find me fully cleared and freed from the force and fury of his false imputations, and byting blowes, and him directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a blind superstitious Papist in Religion, a false hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted subiect to his Soueraigne, and a man wholy degenerate from the honest affection of a true Englishman. And this being performed and finished, (which I held my selfe bound in duty to doe, for thy satisfying and mine owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit) my full resolution is not to toyle any more by contending with such rayling and wrangling spirits. And so (retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all his vniust imputations against me, with his tearmes of fictions and calumniations set downe in the end of his

Epistle to himselfe, from whom they came) I leaue the scope and ende of vs both to be found out by thy Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an wisedome, and the carriage of vs both to be censured as in the vprightnesse of thy iudgemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
