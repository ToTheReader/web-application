      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OT by my suite, though by my consent, this Historie is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come publike. The translation thereof was diuerse yeares past desired by an honorable personage, not now liuing; yet for loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to his Prince, loue to his Countrey, and vertuous deseruing of all men, worthie a longer life: had not God in his diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence otherwise ordeyned. Loth I was to medle with matter of so much waight, in regard of mine owne insufficiencie, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learned, nor making profession of learning: and lother it should be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, for that the Author (in some other his works) hath not (as is thought) written with due respect to pietie. Howsoeuer that be, in this Booke (being a meere relation of the <hi>Florentines</hi> fortune, when they were gouerned Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticallie) appeareth not any thing vnfit to be knowne, or that may receiue euill construction.</p>
   <p>The first part, sheweth the occasions of ruyne in the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire;<note place="margin">The subiect of this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> and how the Prouinces of <hi>Italy</hi> became diuided into diuerse gouernments: with their often variations. Secondly, by what meanes the Pope, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> possessed the greatest parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> Lastly, how that the <hi>Florentines,</hi> abandoning obedience to the Emperour, liued (almost continually) in faction and ciuill partialitie, vntill the house of <hi>Medici,</hi> by the great vertue of <hi>Giouanni, Cosimo, Piero,</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> atteyned to a singuler reputation in that State; where now (and some yeares past) they gouerne as Princes, with great honor, iustice, and integritie: which happinesse they could not finde in their Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall pollicie. Yet diuerse notable Polititians and wise law-makers, haue not onely allowed, but also highlie commended it aboue others: Affirming,<note place="margin">Mediocritie the scope of Aristocracie.</note> that as medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie is in all things most praiseable, and extremities reproueable, so the Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie (being the meane betweene the multitude and one Prince) is speciallie to be preferred. Also for that the authoritie to commaund, is due to the most worthie, and worthinesse consisteth either in honor, in vertue, in riches, or in them altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the state Aristocraticall must needs be most allowed, bicause the noble, the riche, and vertuous men are in all places the fewest number, and they onely in that kinde of gouernment haue authoritie. They alleage also how the rich men onely, as they that haue most interest in the State, do bestowe most in publike seruices, and therefore to them the Gouernment ought be allotted: so was it in <hi>Rome</hi> after the Kings were deposed, likewise in <hi>Athens,</hi> in <hi>Carthage,</hi> and at this day in <hi>Venice, Genoua,</hi> and <hi>Lucca.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For answere of these reasons in fauour of Aristocracie,<note place="margin">Gouernment Aristocracie imperfit.</note> wherein mediocritie see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be speciallie sought for, who so shall duely examine thereof, may finde,
<pb facs="5"/>
that to diuide things in the midst, and thereby to marke out the vertue (which consisteth in reason) were impossible, as all Philosophers haue determined. True it is, that the meane betweene all, and one is perfit, yet no where to be found: sith in some Cities there are not one thousand Citizens, and in some other more then an hundreth thousand: which maketh the Aristocracie alwayes incertaine by the incertaintie of the numbers. And where the Gouernors be many, there are also factions many, the resolutions slowe, and the secrets of State often discouered. For by experience is seene, how those Aristocracies which haue in them fewest Gouernors, are most durable: As that of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> gouerned by thirtie persons, and that of the <hi>Pharsalians</hi> by twentie. It is not therefore the meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one and all, which causeth mediocritie.</p>
   <p>Now for bestowing Soueraigntie vpon the most worthie, true it is, so it ought be, yet that argument maketh more for the Monarchie. For among the noble, rich, and wise, some one doth euer excell the rest, and to him (by that reason) the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ought be giuen, seeing it is not possible to find all those things equally in all men. If it be alleaged, that among the greatest number are found most vertuous and good men, that reason serueth not, either in that state or the Democracie: seeing in them both (as in all Corporations) the most voices are preferred before the wise and better. To conclude, I say that in all States, wherein are most Gouernors, there are fewest resolutions, and most disputations. The <hi>Venetians</hi> therefore (to meete with those inconuenients) do commit the mannaging of their ordinarie affaires to the <hi>Senate,</hi> which consisteth of seuen persons onely, as knowing that the fewer be made priuie, the more secretly they shall be handled: and no Aristocracie haue had so long continuance. Thus much touching Aristocraticall gouernment, of which kinde, was that whereof this Historie largely discourseth.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Equalitie the scope of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracie.</note>The State Populer, do likewise boast of the excellencie thereof, as that which obserueth equalitie without exception of persons, and reduceth the constitutions ciuill vnto the lawe of nature: For as nature hath not giuen riches, offices, or honor to one man more then to another, so the Gouernment Populer, tendeth to haue all men equall, without priuiledge or prerogatiue whatsoeuer. For by such meane (they say) that auarice in those that be riche, and insolencie in them that be great, shall be taken away, which are the most perilous inconuenients that can happen to any Common-weale; and consequently all thefts, oppressions, partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and factions, are remoued: adding, that humaine societie cannot be nourished without amitie, and the nourisher of amitie is equalitie, and no equalitie can be found but onely in States Populer: it followeth therefore, that is the best and most commendable gouernment, bicause each man enioyeth libertie, naturall and equall iustice, without feare of tyrannie or oppression. These, and some other reasons are framed in commendation of Gouernment Populer.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Democracie imperfit.</note>Whereunto I say, that this order of commanding, which chiefly respecteth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie, is not, nor hath bene in any Common-weale, bicause no such equalitie of goods and honors could be obserued. And he who taketh vpon him to bestow them equally, shall proceed contrarie to nature. For as she hath made some men more wise and aduised then others, so hath she framed them to commaund, and others to obey. Some haue wisedome and aptnesse to direct, others haue strength of bodie, and fitnesse to execute what is commaunded. And touching libertie natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall (whereof Populer States do glory much) were that such as is supposed, how could there be either Magistrate, lawe, or forme of gouernment: for where Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracie is, there can be no generall equalitie. Besides that, all wise and learned
<pb facs="5"/>
writers haue misliked that kinde of gouernment. <hi>Plato</hi> calleth it a market, where all things are to be sould. <hi>Aristotle</hi> alloweth not thereof, nor of the Aristocracie. <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, it is impossible for any man to please the people, that taketh pleasure in vertue. And how can a multitude (as a monster of many heads) void of reason and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, determine any thing good or profitable? Also to aske counsell of the people, as was anciently vsed in States Populer, is (as it were) that wise men should seeke to be informed by mad folks. Which moued <hi>Anacarsis</hi> to say (seeing the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates to propound matters, and the people to resolue) that in <hi>Athens</hi> wise men moued questions, and fooles determined what should be done. If any man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Populer Gouernment of the <hi>Suisses,</hi> continued more then three hundreth yeares: Thereunto may be answered, that the nature of that people is apt to be so gouerned. Besides that, the most mutenous sort of them are commonly from home in seruice of the warre vnder forraine Princes, and the rest more tractable, do not care much how the State is handled. And among themselues there is no diffidence, by reason the Nobilitie of those Countreys were slaine, first at the battell of <hi>Sampac,</hi> and after at <hi>Basil,</hi> the rest willinglie banished themselues.</p>
   <p>By this which hath bene briefly said,<note place="margin">Monarchie, the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</note> appeareth how both the optimacie and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puler gouernments are subiect to mutation, disorder and vtter ruine, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently how fortunate those people are, whom God hath destined to liue in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of a successiue royall Monarchie: where the Prince submitteth himselfe no lesse to the lawes of nature, then he desireth the subiects should be obediēt vnto him, leauing to euery one libertie of life, and propertie in that he possesseth. Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion argueth Gods prouidence, and gouernment naturall, planteth a certaine reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proke loue betweene the Prince and the people. One other reason of nature appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, in that the Monarke is alone in soueraigntie: for as God onely ruleth the whole world, and as the sunne alone giueth light to all creatures, so the people of one land do most naturally yeeld obedience to one head and commander. Yea, all nations were first so gouerned, as the <hi>Assirians, Persians, Egiptians, Iewes, Grecians, Scithians, Turks, Tartars, Englishmen, Frenchmen, Spanyards, Polonians, Danes, &amp;c.</hi> and in the <hi>Indias</hi> were found no other gouernment. Neither do the sacred Histories make mention of other Rulers then Kings onely. And to confirme what hath bene said of royall gouernment, reade the opinions of <hi>Plato, Homer, Herodotus, Xenophon, S. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, S. Ierome,</hi> with other as well diuine, as philosophicall writers. Finally, it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that Soueraigntie in one onely person is more honorable and magnificent, then if the same were diuided among a fewe Lords (as is vsed in the Aristocracie) or among the whole multitude, as in Populer Gouernments. And experience hath proued, that for direction and commandment in the warre, pluralitie of Gouernors haue almost euer receiued preiudice and dishonor. Which moued the <hi>Romanes</hi> (at such occations) to make a <hi>Dictator.</hi> The like was done by the <hi>Lacedemoniās,</hi> and is (at this time) vsed of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whome they call <hi>gran Proueditore.</hi> By these reasons and examples (omitting many other) appeareth, that the Monarchie royall, is a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment most reasonable, most naturall, most honorable, and most necessary. And such is the happinesse of our fortune, that by diuine prouidence, there liueth not in any land a more perfit paterne of an excellēt Prince, then is our present Soueraigne, who feareth God rightlie, and gouerneth her subiects iustlie: prudent in counsell, and valorous in execution. In prosperitie modest, in aduersitie constant; faithfull to friends, and feared of enemies; affable to the good, and effroyable to the euill: vnder whose sacred protection, our peace, our plentie, and our securitie, hath many yeares prospered.</p>
