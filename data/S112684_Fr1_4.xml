   <p>AMong many other laudable
customes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> noble Vniuersitie
of Louaine, this one is yearely
obserued there, that in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> moneth of
December al ordinarie lessons cease
for the space of one whole weeke, and
in place thereof some Learned man
is chosen by common assent to be the
President of certaine Disputations:
wherein he proponeth, to such as are
thereto appointed, diuerse frutefull
questions in Diuinitie, Law, Physik
Phylosophie, Humanitie, and in all
probable matters, making argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
breefly for both partes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and then leauing to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> iudgemēt
<pb facs="4"/>
of the Respondent to chuse whiche
parte he liketh beste (whereof those
exercises haue theyr name) and the
next daye folowing in that place to
handle the same Rhetoricallie the
space of two houres together w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>out
interruption,<note place="margin">Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones Quodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beticae.</note> in presence and hering
of the whole Vniuersitie there then
assembled. And in this maner twise
a day fower houres are spente that
weeke, with greate profite and vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of many good and profitable
maters of learning worth the hering
and bering away, though litle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
commonly afterward come forth
in printe, to the sight and vewe of
the world.</p>
   <p>Amonge diuerse other, this laste
December there, a learned man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Law called M. Peter Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin
<pb facs="4"/>
borne in Andwerp made an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against the Insurrections of the
Protestantes and Sectes of our time,
not without greate commendation,
which, at the earnest requeste of his
frindes, he suffered to be afterwarde
printed. Anh because I thought it no
lesse profitable and fruteful, that, as
that Oration is in Latine, and like to
be shortly in Doutch and Frenche,
so it should be in Englishe also to
warne my deere Contremen of those
mens malice and cruelty: I conferred
with him, and by his aduise traslated
it into our Mother tong, with suche
notes and farther additiōs as for lack
of tyme, whē he pronounced it, were
omitted and leafte out in the Latine.
VVherein I toke such leaue and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
as the Author, with whome I
<pb facs="5"/>
conferred, might be bolde to vse him
selfe in his owne doinges, or geue an
other man, and as the Vayne of our
Englisshe tong seemed beste to beare
in such kind of talke, leauing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
the precise wordes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Latin,
but neuer swaruing any whit from
the truthe. And for the assurance
and proufe of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> matter of this whole
Treatise, the Author protesteth that
he vttered nothing in all this oration
againste any man, but that either he
sawe with his owne eyes, or harde of
credible persons that were present
at those maters, or read in approued
Writers, or in theyr owne bookes
whom he chargeth, or finally that is
notoriously knowen to whole Cities
and Countries.</p>
   <p>Take therefore, I beseeche thee
<pb facs="5"/>
Gentill Reader, in good parte this
faire warning thou haste here to
take heede of these perilouse preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Refourmers▪ and weighe rather
the mater, then my rude vtterance
in Englisshe. And if thou be a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telman,
learne here what these mens
intent and practise is againste all
noble Stockes. They meane vtterlie
to roote out y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Nobilitie and al noble
Bloud, as they haue done alreadie at
Geneua, and in those Cātons of Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland,
where this fifte Gospell
reigneth.<note place="margin">Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances au Roy des depu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes des trois e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stats de Burgoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne sur l'edict de la pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation▪ part. 2.</note> The deputies that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the three estates of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
in their Discourse vppon the
Frenche Kings Edicte of pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are my Authors of this reporte.
If thou be a Ruler and in authority,
<pb facs="6"/>
consyder their conspiracies and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
against all Magistrates. If thou
be a mā of the Churche, marke here
their malice and extreme crueltie
against all Gods true Ministers and
Vertuous Priests. If thou be a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
subiecte amonge the Commons,
see theyr robberies, theyr pouling
and rifling, theyr vnmercifull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torsions,
theyr vnsatiable greadines
in gatheringe to them other mens
goodes. Finallie, if thou be a true
Christian man, Abhorre and deteste
theyr VVickednesse, Sacrilege,
horrible blasphemies, and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
against God and all his holy Mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.
To be short, I truste no man
wilbe offended with the reading of
this Oration, but only such as in their
<pb facs="6"/>
owne consciences feele them selues
guyltie of these cōspiracies and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
herein mentioned, and therfore
seeme to be touched nere the quicke.
And yet perhappes, by Gods grace,
this soure medicine, though it smart,
may worke in some of them also, first
shame, then repentance, and last a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement
of suche vngodly pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
and enterprises, and call them
backe againe thither, wherehence
they fell, to doe their former workes,
as the Spirit of trueth sayeth,<note place="margin">Apoca. 2.</note> in the
fear of God, the vnity of his Church,
obedience of theyr Princes, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
with theyr neighbours. But
sure I am, it will litle please M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
and his Companiōs, who by wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
preaching and printing, First
prouoked with great confidence and
<pb facs="7"/>
brags the Catholikes to wryte their
mindes in matters of controuersie
and questions about Religion, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
that the Queenes grace, (for
whome we daily pray) woulde not
onlye license them, but commaunde
them to wryte: And now that diuers
haue wrytten full learnedly to their
confusion and shame (meddling no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with the affaires and politike
Gouernment of the Realme, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with poyntes of Doctrine) they
haue none other way to answere and
make their party good, but to turne
their tale, chainge their tune, and
report that the wrytinges of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
are seditious, and tende to
the disquieting and disturbaunce of
the Common weale, that the authors
thereof are vnnaturall and disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="7"/>
subiectes: and so by suche false
informations labour to procure the
meanes to stay and let to come into
the Realme suche Bookes as detecte
their Vntruthe, Falshode, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,
and are most profitable for all
good Christians and true Subiectes
to reade, in these daungerous daies.</p>
   <p>If they practise the like againste
this little discourse made againste
Commotions for Religion, they shall
declare plainly and make the worlde
vnderstande, that they are not true
Subiects to the Queenes Maiestie,
nor yet faithfull to the Nobilitie,
nor frindefull to the Cōmons of their
owne natiue Countrie. For here is
nothing but a Detection of false and
wicked Treasons againste Princes
and Rulers, and, as it were, a hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb facs="8"/>
Triacle for Magistrates and
faithfull Subiectes, against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
infection and daūgerous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence
of rebellion. Fare well Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
reader, and with the manners
and behauioure thou seest in our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
at home compare and laye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
these Straunge doinges of
their Fellowes and Companions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode
in other Countries. So shalt thou
perceiue, they are of one sprite
and stampe,<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> and (according to the
Counsell of Christ the sonne of God)
know them by their workes, as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> tree
is knowen by his frute, and by that
meanes learne to auoid them, and
beware of them.</p>
