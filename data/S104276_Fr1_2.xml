   <head>TO THE RIGHT
Honourable, and Right Reuerend
Father in God, IOHN, Lord Bishop of
LINCOLNE, Lord Keeper of the Great
Seale, and one of his Maiesties most Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
priuie Councell; Grace and
peace in this life, and glorie in the
life to come.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Reaching, and Printing (Right
Honourable) are excellent
meanes to beget Faith, and to
encrease Knowledge. The one
(like a shower of raine) waters
for the present; the other (like
Snow) lyes longer on the
ground, and may speake when
the Authour cannot: Hauing therefore preached
diuers Sermons, I haue presumed to print this one,
and to present the same vnto your Honour, as a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of my seruice and dutie. My labour in this
kinde, if it may doe good to any, and be accepted of
your Lordship, it is the height of my desire. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath beene handled by many: And, many more
zealous and learned men I pray God to raise vp dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to preach, &amp; to write more of the same argument:
for, beside the methode and manner of handling
(which I also attribute to the grace of God, exciting


<pb facs="3"/>
and assisting nie) I challenge nothing to my selfe but
the faults,
<q>
         <l>Mala mea sunt purè mala,<note place="margin">August.</note> &amp; mea;</l>
         <l>Bona mea nec purè bona, nec mea.</l>
      </q>
Your Lordship may claime a speciall interest in these
lines, not onely in regard of the Authour, obliged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your Honour in many respects; but also of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which is meere <hi>Chancery,</hi> and hath need of your
patronage. For it is a common complaint that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
(for the most part of these latter yeares) hath
lyne bed-rid &amp; speechlesse: But blessed be God, that
hath raised vp your Honour to be a Patrone to his
Church, a Paterne of equity and Iustice in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
and a principall agent in these vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
dayes, to restore and recouer conscience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
where it was much decayed.</p>
   <p>The same God that was the Authour of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
continue his mercies, and multiply his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
vpon your Lordship, that as the hearts of all
good men (specially of vs Church-men) doe reioyce
in your aduancement; So I pray God wee may long
enioy your Honour, to the comfort both of Church
and Common-wealth. Thus, crauing pardon for my
boldnesse, and fauourable acceptance of these my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours,
in most humble manner I recommend
your Honour to the protection of the Almighty,
euer resting.</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your Honours most bounden
and dutifull Chaplaine,
IO: HVGHES.</signed>
