      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE benefits no doubt are great and manifold which almightie God of his large bountie &amp; exceeding goodnes of late yeeres hath plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully bestowed vppon this little soile of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, since the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reigne of our most gratious Souereigne, wherein the Gospell hath sincerely and freely beene preached▪ in whose time many &amp; strange euents haue happened, to the great benefit of this countrie. For who haue not in admiration our long continuance of peace and tranquillitie, our neighbours all round about vs being in continual wars? Who doth not maruell at our plentie and
<pb facs="3"/>
abundance of all things? It is miraculous in the indgement of the world, that so manie strange stratagems practised by euill disposed persons, as well to subuert our quiet estate, as to take from vs our most Souereigne Ladie and Queene, far beyond the capacitie of man, as it were with Gods finger and power onely, haue beene from time to time ouerthrowen &amp; brought to nought. Infinite more tokens may particularly be recited, by the which men may iustly gather arguments of Gods well pleased mind with the gouernment of our most gratious Queene; amongst the which the bathes and medicinall waters of late yeeres discouered in sundrie parts of England, are not of least moment: for most men yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing can witnes of many rare and strange cures done by sundrie wels heeretofore vnknowen: which may make manifest to the world that God is well pleased, and in that respect hath blessed this our countrie far more than other nations: and are as it were plaine arguments, to bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther princes to imbrace the Gospell, to roote out all superstition and idolatrie, to plant in their countries true religion out of Gods booke, and aboue all things, to seeke Gods glorie and his kingdome. And it is not altogither a vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, to thinke that God in these daies mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously reuealed wels and springs of medicinall waers neuer knowen before, to worke effects
<pb facs="3"/>
strange and maruellous in our sights, thereby to induce all men to for sake such puddle pits which mans deuise hath digged, and drinke onely of the cleere fountaines of his word, thence onely to fetch remedy for our diseased soules. The bathes of Bathe and Buckstan for their antiquitie and long proofe in times past, are of great fame, and no doubt as of more efficacie than others, may iustly most be accounted of: neuertheles manie other waters in England of late yeeres discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, haue the testimonie of experience by sundry effects, and rare cures done by them, to haue no small medicinall power, as by the euents in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie diseased people receiuing remedie by them, hath beene made manifest. Amongst the which the wels in Warwickeshire nigh a village called Newnam Regis, haue had most credite, by the vse of which great numbers of people haue found helpe beyond their expectation, which yet liuing, do and will beare testimonie thereof: and no doubt many and rare vertues and qualities are in them far beyond common waters, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere by diligent search of their minerals. If any shall obiect or seeke cause, why so many and so strange euents supposed to be done at the first by these waters, the like are not now, nor haue not of late yeeres beene performed. Surely this came not by meanes of defects in the nature of the waters, but rather by the great abuse of them,
<pb facs="4"/>
For at my being there, I found great concurse of alsorts of people affected with sundry and dissidēt diseases, which all in one maner vsed these wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, both inwardly and outwardly, without coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell or any iust consideration, carried away with opinion, as it seemed, that the faculties and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of them, were supernaturally giuen from God without any ordinarie meanes, and so the vse of the same not to depend of any order or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of Physicke, but that it was sufficient by any means to vse them. Much like vnto the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition of our forefathers, which in old time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted their pilgrimages, and the vowing of a penie to some one saint or other, or the dipping of a cloth in bathe waters, to be sufficient for the curing of any of their maladies. And by these means the natures and qualities of these bath waters not considered, nor the constitutions and temperaments of the parties weighed, many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued more hurt than good. For in truth euerie medicinall water doth not cure euery infirmitie, nor euerie man is to vse euerie bathe: but these things are to be distinguished, and so considered of by the learned, that the bathe may be apted to the disease, and be agreeable to the partie disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And amongst our countrimen, this is in truth a great fault: that when a thing is knowen to do good to many, we straightwaies generally proceede in the vse of it, without respect of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb facs="4"/>
of parties or of affects, as if one shoe might serue for euery mans foote, that we cease not from abusing of the same, vntill many bad succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses haue bred discredit to the thing: as of late hath appeered by the abuse of Mechoacan and diuers other Indian and forren medicines. The consideration heerof occasioned me to thinke it not altogither a vaine labor, to write somewhat of the most famous bathes and medicinal waters in England, wherein I trauelled as well in those of Bathe &amp; Buckstan, as in others. And haue an intent to publish the same, But vpon occasion of the maruellous effects a few yeeres past done by those wels in Warwickeshire, not only heard but also seene by my selfe, through persuasion of some of my friends, I spent more time in triall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of them, than in the others, and so did wholy put mine endeuors for the discouerie of their minerals, natures, and properties, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to set foorth in what diseases and bodies the same are most conuenient, not omitting the true vse of them, when they are either inwardly to be droonken, or outwardly to be applied. Which in very deed I did accomplish, euen when these wels were first reuealed, but I did forbeare to impart that I had done to any my friends, for that I was certainly informed, that an ancient learned man of my familiar acquaintance, intended to write and publish the same argument: who for his deep
<pb facs="5"/>
learning graue iudgement, and long experience, would no doubt haue performed it in a far better sort, had not those his endeuors been preuented with vntimely death it herefore the expectation of that promised intent now void and made fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, I hauing of late occasion to peruse againe those my trauels, and notes of my meditation of the asore said wels in Warwickeshire, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same to some of my friends learned in the art of physicke, was by them persuaded to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest in order these my conceits, and greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to communicate the same to many, whereby they which heerafter meane to vse these bathes, may the better be informed how with iudgement and discretion to proceed in the true vse of them, and the learned may be occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned further to examine the minerals and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of their effects, whereby I doubt not but that the fame of them may be restored to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer credit. In regard and consideration heerof, and the rather that I may by this my enterprise be an occasion and means to stir vp the deuotion and liberalitie of such well disposed persons as are forward and zealous in furthering all such good intents and purposes, I thought it not amisse by publishing this briefe discourse, to signifie how good a deede it may be that some cost were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed about these welles, that the same may be more commodious to such as haue occasion to
<pb facs="5"/>
vse them. For at the first, all medicinall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines are as naked springs, vnhandsome to vse, vntill some such personages haue by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence been stirred vp charitably to adorne the same with all conueniencie. And as in other countreys, men are greatly to be commended for their diligent cares in making all things about the bathes conuenient for the bathers, so truely some defect heereof is and may iustly be found in this our realme of England. For they which haue trauelled, do find the bathes in Italy and in diuers parts of Germany farre better ordered, than any heere in England, and do find fault that euen these our auncient bathes of Bathe and Buckstan are so slenderly left without any great addressing of things necessary. Much more ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these new discouered springs which are yet vtterly vnfurnished, do require the helpe of some able and well disposed, for their ornament and good deuises meete for them which shall vse them. And for as much as the purpose of mine attempt in this little pamphlet, tendeth onely to the publike benefite of my countrey, I most humbly request, that as that mighty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian disdained not a cup of common water offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him by a meane person, so your L. will vouchsafe to accept as a testimonie of dutiful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection this little treatise of medicinall waters, which I present to your L. at this time, inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="6"/>
by the common vsage of all men, in token of a good and prosperous new yeere, resting a continuall begger to the almightie, to send you long and prosperous life, with increase of all honorable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</p>
