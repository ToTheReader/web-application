   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which doth more beautifie and adorne this great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable frame of Heauen and Earth, then the wonderfull variety of those rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, created in and about the same,
<pb facs="3"/>
in so many subiiects of diuers kinds of things, whereof they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. So amongst those varieties, nothing is so wonderfull as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall gifts proceeding from that. All-quickening Spirit of God: which as at first, <hi>It moued vpon the waters,</hi> cherishing, vpholding, and quickning <hi>that rude, vndige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted great formelesse lumpe,</hi> vntill by Diuine power, it had anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that, and all things therein contained, setting them in their most beautifull formes; breathing, as naturall life in man, so, at length a more abounding spirituall life, which should vent and diffuse it selfe in so many thousand seuerall gifts and excellencies, as (in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) there are seuerall Christians: especially in the Ministers of the
<pb facs="3"/>
Word: whose <hi>lippes, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue knowledge,</hi> so haue they their seuerall abilities, some to <hi>cast downe, raise vp, intreat, perswade, conuince, instruct, threaten, insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, reforme, illustrate, explaine, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, divide,</hi> and <hi>conueigh truthes</hi> to the seuerall capacities of their hearers. In which the Author of this Booke (a man well known to your Honours) being so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently sometime adorned with a compound of these and many moe gifts, (in most whereof hee excelled) that the memory of so <hi>pious, painfull,</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> a man of God might not be forgotten, I aduentured to shrowd this booke vnder your Honours wings of protection, to receiue some lustre and countenance by your fauour,
<pb facs="4"/>
clearing the obscurity thereof, in place of the curious hand of the most worthy Author now dead: who as he <hi>was,</hi> and his Name and Fame (I hope) yet <hi>is</hi> and <hi>euer will be</hi> precious in your sight; So I hope the Relation hee sometime had with some of yours, and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from you, would purchase me easily a pardon for this <hi>intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding boldnesse,</hi> whereby I haue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed to declare my selfe euer,</p>
