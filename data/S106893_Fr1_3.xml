   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RABLE, THE EARLE OF <hi>Newport,</hi> Master of his Majesties Ordnance, my singular good Lord.</head>

      <salute>Right Honourable:</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not induced to present this Treatise to your Lordship for any worth that is either in it, or in my selfe, the Author of it; the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of small moment, and my selfe of as little account: but your Lordships singular clemency to all, and your Honourable favour vouchsafed to me in particular, hath made me thus bold, and hath caused me thus farre to presume. I have beene for certaine yeeres past, and so at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent am, one of the inferiour Gunners of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie; and ever since I held that place, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to gaine such skill and experience, as I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed most requisite for that service. And to that end I have bestowed some time and expence, as my occasions and ability would permit, in the practise of <hi>Artillery</hi> and <hi>Fire-workes,</hi> wherein though I have chiefly aymed at such conclusions as might be usefull against an enemy in the <hi>field,</hi> yet these <hi>halcyon</hi> dayes of peace and tranquility, which
<pb facs="6"/> through the goodnesse of God we have so long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, have given mee occasion to invent and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise such also as these following; which howsoever they may seeme to serve onely for delight and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, yet as by the handling of these there may bee gained knowledge in the natures and operations of the severall ingredients and their compositions; so the due consideration of the ordering of them may excite and stirre up in an ingenious minde, sundry inventions more serviceable in times of warre. Now because your Lordship hath of late, by the gratious providence of the Almighty, for your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary wisedome and worth, beene advanced to that eminent place, upon which I have some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, and to which I stand obliged by my spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall service (to which also all workes of <hi>Pyrotech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> may seeme to have relation) I hold it my boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den duty to present these first fruits of my labours to your Honour, as an unfayned testimony, and an undoubted evidence of my faithfull observance, and singular respect to your Lordship: which if you shall be pleased to take into your special Patronage and protection, I shall be in good hope to be freed both from the venomous tooth of <hi>Momus,</hi> and from the malevolent aspect of <hi>Zoilus,</hi> and from the poysoned breath and stinging of the rest of that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous brood, and shall alwaies remaine</p>

      <signed>Your Honours in all dutifull observance, <hi>IOHN BABINGTON.</hi>
