   <head>Martin Iuniors Epilogue. To the worshipfull his very good neame, Maister Iohn Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turburie.</head>
   <p>AFter my harty commendations vnto your VVorshippe, (good nunckle Canturbury) trusting, that you, vvith the rest of the Cater-caps are as neere your ouerthrovve, as Jyour poore nephevv am from vvishing the prosperitie of your Antichristian callings. The cause of my vvriting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you at this instant, is, to let you vnderstand, first, that I vvas somevvhat merry at the making heereof, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed sory, together vvith others of my brethren, that vvee cannot heare from our good father, Maister Martin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prelate, that good &amp; learned discoursing brother of yours, but especially grieued, that vve see not the vtter subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that vnhappy and pestilent gouernement of L. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, at the helme vvhereof ye sitte like a Pilate, or a Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas rather. Moreouer, I do you to vveete, that you shal receiue by this bearer, certaine vnperfect vvritings of my fathers, praying your prelacie, if you can send mee, or any of my brethren any vvord of him, that you vvould returne vs an ansvvere vvith speede.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="11"/>MAny flim flam tales goe abroad of him, but of certaintie nothing can be heard, in as much as he keepeth him selfe secrete from all his sonnes. Some thinke, that hee is euen nowe employed in your businesse; and I thinke so too, my reason is, quoth Robert Some, because it was for your sakes and good, that hee first fell a studying the Arte of Pistle making: Others giue out, that in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his countrey, and her Maiesties, he died, or was in great danger at the Groine. And the others (ka mine vncka Bridges) haue seene motiues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them to be of this minde: Some there are also, who feare that you haue him in your handes. Howsoeuer it be somewhat is not well, that hee is silent all this while. We his sonnes must needes be disquieted, seeing wee can neither knowe where our father is, nor yet heare from him. If we could but heere by some Pistle, though it were but of 20. sheetes of paper, that he is well, we would not then be so inquisitiue of him. But now that he hath bin so long time tongue-tied these foure or fiue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, wee must needes enquire of the matter. Speake then, good nuncles, haue you closly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the gentlman in some of your prisons? haue you strangled him? haue you giuen him an Italian figge? or, what haue you done vnto him? haue you choaked him with a fat prebend or two? What? I trowe my father wil swallow downe no such pilles. And he doe, I can tell he will soone purge away al the conscience hee hath, and prooue a mad hinde ere he die. But tell me, I pray you, what you meane to doe vnto him if you haue him in holde? Do you meane to haue the keeping of him, least he should not be otherwise well looked vnto? whie what need<pb facs="12"/>tat? I am sure he hath 500. sonnes in the lande, of good credit and abilitie, with whome hee might haue other gates welcome, then with any Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap o them all. And I pray you, nunckles, neuer trouble your selues with the keeping of him, I trust he shal do well, though he neuer come neere any of you all. And I thinke in reason it were more meete his sonnes, then his brethren shoulde bee charged with him; if it so came to passe, that hee were forced to leane vnto others. This I knowe full well, that my father woulde bee sory from his heart, to put you to any such cost, as you intend to bee at with him. A meaner house, and of lesse strength then the Tower, the Fleete, Newgate, or the Gate-house is, woulde serue him well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: he is not of that ambitious vaine, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his brethren the bishops are, in seeking for more costly houses then euer his father built for him. And therefore, good sweete neames nowe, if you haue him, let him bee dispatched out of your hands, with honesty and credit. My father is of a kingly nature I perceiue by him, hee woulde doe good vnto you, but he would not be recompenced for it againe. He will none of your courtesies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be for your owne sakes, that you will giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your bishopdomes, that is the greatest bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite he accounts of from you, other recompence he seekes none.</p>
   <p>If you demaund of mee, where I founde this, the trueth is, it was taken vp (together with certaine other papers) besides a bush, where it had drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from some body passing by that way. I hope my fathers worship will not bee oftended with me, for publishing of it, being not so perfit as question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse<pb facs="12"/>he would haue had it. Hee, and you, can not but commend my good dealing, in setting it out; for I chose rather to leaue the sentences vnperfite then to adde any thing more then I found legible. The Arithmeticall nombers in the end of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble shew, that when he had written so farre, he had something more in his head then all men doe conceiue, which made him leaue in the middest of a period. I my selfe doe perceiue some tanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies in the cōclusions as being the first draught, but I would not presume to mend them, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to himselfe, if he be yet liuing, if dead, yet po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities may haue his after-birth to be altogether his owne. And let them take this as his <hi>cygncam cantionem,</hi> viz. his farewell to booke-making. But that would I be sorie of. For who can bee able to prooue the poynts which he hath set downe here, concerning the doctrine of our church, mainter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by statur, &amp; her Maiesties priuiledge, so sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and so worthily, as he himselfe would performe it. A thirtie or fortie of the first Conclusions are alreadie shewed in, Hai any work for the Cooper, and therefore they neede no further proofe then the reading ouer that woorthie Treatise, whence they seeme to haue beene collected. The rest I hope shall be shewed in More worke for the Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
   <p>And vather, if you can proue these thinges out of the doctrine of our church, then certainelie you deserue to be chronicled for euer. Then Iohn Canturbury, come downe with thy poperie, ka M. Martin Iunior: for now art thou set out in thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, to be an aduersary, not onely of Christ and his Apostles, which all men might know, but euen<pb facs="13"/>also an vtter enemie vnto the doctrine of the church of England sowed heere by the holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, and sealed with their blood, yea, allowed by statute, and published with her Maiesties royall priuiledge, which is a point that the most haue not considered of. And who is hee now that dares perswade Martin to giue ouer his course, vnlesse the same also will shewe himselfe an enemie to the doctrine of the church of England. For Martin in his writings, is not so much an ennemie vnto the bishoppes, as a defender of the doctrine of our Churche. And therefore you Puritanes, that mislike of him, take heede that you bee not founde amongest posterities, to bee the betrayers of this doctrine (for your ease and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse sake) which you are bound to deliuer vnto your children, without corruption or mangling, though it cost you your liues a thousande times▪ For to tell you the trueth, if you do but read ouer the writings of M. Tindall, M. Frith, M. Barnes, M. Hooper, M. Knox, M. Lambert, &amp;c. which were the first planters of the Gospell amongest vs, you shall find your selues in faithfulnes, courage and zeale, yea, euen the best of you farre behind them; which I speake not but to your great shame, with a desire of your amendement. And therefore I tell you true, I thinke it a great blessing of God that hath raised vppe this Martin, whome you can hardelie brooke, to holde tackling with the bishops, that you may haue some time of breathing, or rather a time to gather courage and zeale, ioyned with knowledge, to set vpon these enemies of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our church, euen the doctrine of God, I meane maintained in our church. For that as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto<pb facs="13"/>ye haue done, you be so loth (for the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of our state forsooth, and the offending of hir Maiestie) not onely to speake against, but euen vtterlie to reiect this hierarchie of our bishops, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to haue no more to doe with it, then with the seate of the beast, you shall declare vnto our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that God raised vppe but a companie of whiteliuered souldiours, to teach the Gospell in sinceritie vnder her Maiestie, and take heede lest our forenamed fathers rise vppe in iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you. As for her Maiestie, or the state, I think shee hath little cause to thanke you for your wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in seeking the quietnesse of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, by-winking at the sinne of the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous ministerie. And me thinkes you are bounde vnto her, and her people, to make so much at the least knowen, as shee mainteineth publikelie in bookes, by her statutes and priuiledges, to be the doctrine of this our church vnder her gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore, looke vnto these thinges, for certainelie, if euer the Lorde shall make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of our wicked bishoppes knowen vnto her Maiestie, to bee so contrarie to worde of God, the profession of holie Martyres, and the doctrine of our church mainteined, both by our statutes, and priuiledges, as in these Theses they are sette downe, assure your selfe, that she will then enquire, whether she had not any faithfull preachers in her kingdome, that would stand to the defence of the trueth, vntill shee sawe further into it.</p>
   <p>As for the bishops, they may herein see, to their woe, what wicked caytiffes they are, in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues &amp; their thrice curssed popedome,<pb facs="14"/>against such cleare light. But the beastes, I feare, were borne to no other end, then to be the Lords scourge, to chastice his church, and then to bee burnt in hell. And out vppon them, they are as vnlike Christ, his Apostles, and holy Martyres, which were the planters of our Churche, as the wretches are like vnto themselues. A man would haue thought, if they had not beene desperate in their wickednesse, that by the warning which Martin gaue them, they woulde haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from their villanie in some sort. But, as though their very reason had bene cleane gone, the more they are threatned to haue their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings displayed, the more wicked doe they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest themselues. As if they woulde declare vnto the worlde, that they will not bee made knowen vnto posteritie, but vppon the condition, that they may bee the most wicked, that euer were in the church of God. They will be so many Iudases, so many Diotrepheses, so many Simon Maguses, as nowe they are wicked bishoppes of Englande, or else they thinke not themselues well dealte with. Wherefore, reuerend father, if you bee as yet on your feete, and haue escaped out of the danger of gunne shotte, beginne againe to play the man. Feare none of these beastes, these pursuvants, these Mar-Martins, these stage-players, these prelates, these popes, these diuels, and al they can do. Quit your selfe but as like a man as you haue doone in Hai any worke, and I doubt not but you will make these rogish priests lie in the kenell. The reporte abroad goeth, that you are drawen drie, and can say no more. They are fooles that so thinke, I say,<pb facs="14"/>Let these Conclusions bee iudge, whereby I tell you true, I hope you shall be able to emprie eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie bishopricke in Englande, if waight of tructh can doe it. There bee that affirme, the rimers and stage-players, to haue cleane putte you out of countenaunce, that you dare not againe shew your face. Alas poore haglers, their fathers are too yoong to outface the least of your sonnes. And I doe thinke, that, lay aside their tyrannie, all the bishops of Englande are too weake to deale with a scarre-crowe, that hath but the name of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Martin written vppon it. And therefore, I perswade my selfe, that they their selues are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowlie so perswaded, ka my nuncka Bridges, that you contemne such kenell rakers, and scullions, as to their shame, in the time of your silence haue solde them selues for pence a peece, to be derided of come who so will, to see a companie of disguised asses.</p>
   <p>Concerning Mar-martin, if he be a Londoner, or an vniuersitie man, tenne to one but you shall see him, one of these odde dayes, carted out of the towne for his honestie of life. Why that time of his sheweth, that hee had no other bringing vppe, then in a brothel-house. And heerein I woulde craue pardon of the vniuersities, and the famous citie of London, if I shoulde bee thought to giue out, that such a ribaulder as this is, were there maintained. To speake what I doe thinke of the youth, I can not bee induced to thinke, that hee hath had his bringing vp at any other trade, then in carryeng long Meg of Westminsters hand-bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and in attending vppon some other of his auntes, at her appointment while shee liued. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="15"/>her death, it may be he hath beene promoted vnto the seruice of some laundresse in a bishoppes house, where, in hope to bee preferred by his good lordes, he hath vndertaken to mar-rimes, in publishing bawdery, and filthinesse, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of these honest bishops.</p>
   <p>The stage-players, poore seelie hunger-starued wretches, they haue not so much as an honest calling to liue in the common-wealth: And they, poore varlets, are so base minded, as at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the veryest rogue in England, for one poore pennie, they will be glad on open stage to play the ignominious fooles, for an houre or two together. And therfore, poore rogues, they are not so much to be blamed, if being stage-players, that is, plaine rogues (saue onely for their liueries) they in the action of dealing against Maister Martin, haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them many thousande eie-witnesses, of their wittelesse and pittifull conceites. And in deede they are marueilous fitte vpholders of Lambehith palace, and the crowne of Canturburie. And therefore, menne shoulde not thinke of all other things, that they should any wayes make Maister Martin, or his sonnes to alter their course. And heereof, good Maister Canturburie, assure your selfe. Well, to growe to a point with you, if you haue any of your side, eyther in the Vniuersities, or in your cathedrall Churches, or any where within the compasse of all the bishopdomes you haue, that dare write, or dispute against anie of these pointes sette downe by my father, heere I do by these my writinges, cast you downe the Gloue, in my fathers name, and the names of the rest<pb facs="15"/>of his sonnes. If my father be gone, and none else of my brethren will vpholde the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie against you, I my selfe will doe it. And take my challenge if you dare. By writing you may do it, qand be sure to be answered. By disputations, if you will appoint the place, with promise, that you will not deale <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> you shall be taken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by me, if I thinke I may trust you. Otherwise, the Puritanes will, I doubt not, maintaine the chalenge against you.</p>
   <p>But heere by the way, Iohn Canturbury, take an odde aduice of your poore nephew, and that is this. First, in regard of your selfe, play not the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as you doe, in Gods Church; if you goe on forward in this course, the ende will bee a wofull reckoning. Thou hast beene raised vp out of the dust, and euen from the very dounghill, to bee president of her Maiesties counsell, being of thy selfe, a man altogether vnmeet for any such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, as neyther endued with any excellent naturall witte, nor yet with any great portion of learning. The Lorde hath passed by many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands in this land farre meeter for the place then is poore Iohn Whitgift. Well then, what if thou, hauing receiued so great blessings at the Lordes hand (beeing of all others in no comparison anye thing neere the fittest for it, or the likeliest to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine it) shalt now shew thy selfe vngratefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy mercifull Lorde God, or become a cruell persecutour, and a tyrant in his church, a cruell oppressour of his children, shall not all that thou hast receiued, be tourned vnto a cursse vnto thee, euen into thine owne bosome? Yea verely. For
<pb facs="16"/>the Lorde in one day is able to bring more shame vpon thee, and that in this life, then he hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped blessings vpon thee now for the space of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeeres and vpward. But when I doe consider thy preheminence and promotion, I do sensiblie acknowledge it to be ioyned with a rare cursse of God, euen such a cursse as very fewe (I will not say none) in Gods Church doe sustaine. And that is thy wicked and Antichristian Prelacie. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of which popedome of thine maketh me thinke, that thy other place in the ciuill magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, being in it selfe a godly and a lawfull calling, is so become infectious, that it will be thy bane, both in this life, and in the life to come. And I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most fully perswaded, that, that archbishopricke of thine, together with thy practises therein, shew verely, that the Lorde hath no part nor portion in that miserabble, and desperat caytiffe wicked Iohn Whitgift, the Pope of Lambehith. Leaue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both thy popedome, and thy vngodly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, or looke for a fearefull ende.</p>
   <p>My second and last aduise is this in a word. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no more of these haggling and profane pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets to be published against Martin, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thy hierarchie. Otherwise thou shalt but commend thy follie and ignorance vnto the world to be notorious. Mar-martin, Leonard Wright, Fregneuile, Dick Bancroft, Tom Blan. o Bedford, Kemp, Vnderhil, serue thee for no other vse, but to worke thy ruine, and to bewray their owne shame, &amp; miserable ignorance. Thus far of these matters.</p>
   <p>And mee thinkes you see, nunckle Canturbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that though I bee but young, yet I beginne<pb facs="16"/>prettily well to followe my fathers steppes; for I promise you, I am deceiued, vnlesse I haue a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty smattering gift in this Pistle-making, and I feare in a while I shall take a pride in it. I pray you, if you can, now I haue shewed you my minde, that you woulde be a meanes, that my vather, or my brethren be not offended with me for my presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this of mine owne head. I did all of a good meaning, to saue my fathers papers: and it would haue pitied your heart to see, how the poore pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were raine and weather-beaten, euen truely in such a sort, as they coulde scant bee read to bee printed. There was neuer a drie threede in them. These sea-iourneys are pittifull I perceiue. One thing me thinkes my father should like in me, and that is, my modestie, for I haue not presumed, to publishe mine in as large a print or volume as my father doth his. Nay, I thinke it well, if I can drible out a Pistle in octauo nowe and then. Farewell, good nuncle, and pay this bearer for the cariage. Iuly 22. 1589. With as great speede as I might.</p>
