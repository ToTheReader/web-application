      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which drew these
Sermons from mee,
next to thy good, was
to right my selfe.
They were first prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
eight yeares since; and some notes
thereof were, (to say no more,) disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into the hands of many, to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.
They are here presented as
they were preached, with little altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or addition, in method, style, or
matter: Onely to make up the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
more compleat, I entirely added,
against the publishing thereof, that
<pb facs="4"/>
whole discourse about <hi>Satans</hi> part,
and hand in these desertions, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at Chap. 6. In handling which,
I trust I have not at all incurred that
severe increpation of the Apostle, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
curious speculations about <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Col. 2. 18.</note>
      <hi>of intruding into those things
which I have not seen</hi> ground, and
warrant for in the word. Sure I am
I have endeavoured to follow the
<hi>Schoole,</hi> in their Labyrinths herein,
no further then I found a Clue of
Scripture, and right reason, clearely
guiding and warranting my way:
Without which, I account the wayes
of this <hi>old</hi> and <hi>winding Serpent,</hi> in
his communications to us, to be as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
speakes,<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 18, 19.</note>
      <hi>Like the way of a
Serpent upon a stone, hidden,</hi> and
past tracing, or finding out. And
lest any of the <hi>weaker</hi> readers, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="4"/>
those in distresse; to whom more
speculative, and doctrinall discourses,
though about things practicall, prove
usually tedious and unpleasing, should
in reading that peece, be discouraged
at the first: My advertisement is,
that (if they finde that part of the way
craggy, or tyresome, which I hope they
will not) they would divert out of it,
and come in againe at Chap. 11. from
whence to the end, they shall finde
what is more accommodate to their
understandings, and conditions, and
more practically speaking to your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse.
The blessing of heaven goe
with it.</p>
