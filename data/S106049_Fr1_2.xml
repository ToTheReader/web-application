   <head>TO THE GODLY REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I.R. wisheth health &amp; holinesse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, when this matter was brought vnto me, to consider of, that it might be drawne into forme for the Printers presse, I was partly vnwilling to meddle with it: for as much as I know, that the sinnes of Incest, Onanisme, Whoredome, Adulterie &amp; Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, with other Sodomiticall sinnes of vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse &amp; pollutions, do so outragiously raign, and are in these dayes so much vsed in many places, with ouer-much bouldnesse and presumption, for lack of sharpe &amp; due punishment for the same: and that such haynous and great crimes &amp; abuses had neede to be throughly handled, &amp; spoken of, by some most worthy man, of farre greater giftes and learning, thē my selfe am; the better to pearce the obdurate &amp; sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heartes of great numbers, that are therewith gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously infected; and to disswade others from falling thereinto.</p>
   <p>Yet being willing to do my countrie good, and to make some vse of my poore talent in this behalfe, &amp; being importuned by often entreaties of some my friends, vnto whom I could not well denie any reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable request, who assured me that the report there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was deliuered them in writing, by a gentleman of good credite &amp; worship, in the countie of <hi>Hereford,</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>&amp; neare to the place wher this hapned: I thought it my part, for the benefit of others, to do what I might herein; &amp;, as I trust, for the good of many, &amp; hurte of none, as breefely &amp; cōueniētly as mought be, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it in so smal a treatise, as this is. Wherfore (good Reader) accept thereof, as of a simple admonitiō: that this noble Realme, wherein we liue, may not be so polluted and defiled, as it is: but that more prayer, fasting, and restraint of fleshly lustes and desires, with more diligent reading and hearing of the scriptures, may be vsed: whereby those haynous sinnes, may the better be bridled and auoided in euerie one of vs. And especially, that the same breake not out, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so great outrage, as it doeth, and hath done of late yeares: whereby god is so highly dishonoured, that by the grosse iniquitie of the people, he is prouoked to send such monsters, for part of punishment vpon vs, into the world, that may make vs ashamed of our selues, and the readyer to hate &amp; detest sinne, and by all due meanes, to seeke seuere punishment for the same (without partiality) on such persōs, as therin frō time to time shal offend. For which purpose, all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, who haue authoritie to punish the same, ought to be carefull, that too many offences of that kind be not redeemed by commutations: least it come to passe that there should be much more money payd to buy out sinne, then persons punished for sinne: whereby it might be doubted, whither we may say, as master <hi>Latymer</hi> said once in a sermon, that sin is good marchādise, in many Courts &amp; Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistories. Which, if it should be so, the Lord in his
<pb facs="3"/>good time redresse it, in them that vse it. For by this meanes, as god is dishonoured, so, the Queenes maiestie and her gouernement, the preachers of the Gospell and their teaching, are slaundered and euill spoken of, by Papists, Brownists, and others, both abroade and at home. Who, not rightly considering that the multitude of the people breedeth sinne, and that towards the latter dayes, iniquitie shall increase, do slaunderously speake of vs, contrarie to the truth. Now, here followeth a description of all things, whereby thou mayst be fully satisfied, how, when, and where, this strange thing was done: with euery other circumstance thereto belonging. Lastly, here is an earnest admonition to withdrawe people from the sinnes of Whoredome &amp; vncleānesse: such as I hope shall doe much good, &amp; preuaile with some, amōgst many, that liue wickedly in these dayes. Such as it is, I do now at this time conueigh into thy hands, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thee, &amp; all that looke for saluation in Christ Iesus, to the blessed tuition of the most mightie: who sayth, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holie.</hi> From my house, this 30. of Aprill. 1600.</p>
