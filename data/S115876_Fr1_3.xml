   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He importunitie of many, who heard this Sermon deliuered, and sollicited me to haue it published, were preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling motiues with me to take this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie in offering it to the world, thinking of Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> speech, <hi>Qui rectum facere cùm possit,</hi>
      <note place="margin">August. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de libero arbitr.</note>
      <hi>non vult, amittat posse, cum velit,</hi> Hee that will not doe good, when hee may, let him want power when he would. So I hope, this shall doe good to them that are good. Wherein I hunt not after vulgar commendation, which is like childrens loue, gotten, and forgotten in an howre: neither did I euer affect, that my selfe, or my labours should bee pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a Cognisance to the Towne-coat, or to depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the common sleeue of popular iudgement. And indeed I am somwhat of <hi>Socrates</hi> mind in <hi>Plato,</hi> who euermore suspected that for bad, which the common people extolled for good: and as <hi>Plinie</hi> gaue it a rule in Schoole, that hee declaymed worst,<note place="margin">Prou 25.11.</note> who was applauded most. Yet <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> thus farre will giue this a commendation, that they were <hi>words vttered in due season.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I offer this to temperate men, studious, ingenuous, and zealous men: for, as for Criticall, or hypocriticall, I
<pb facs="5"/> neuer loued to prayse them, or please them. I say here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with <hi>Cicero,</hi> Perseum <hi>non curo legere,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cice. lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Orat.</note> Laelium <hi>volo: Perseus</hi> is too learned, I wish honest, and not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned <hi>Laelius</hi> to bee my Reader: for I contemne the iniudicious censure of meere Ignorants.<note place="margin">Sen prou.</note>
      <hi>Graue iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um est eius, qui iudicare non potest:</hi> the ignoranter man, the seuerer Iudge: to stand to such Iudges, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand to condemne my selfe.<note place="margin">Iaert. in vita Anachars.</note>
      <hi>Anacharsis</hi> misliked it in Greece, and so doe I here with vs, <hi>Artifices cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, iudicant qui non sunt artifices:</hi> Diuines preach in the pulpit, Artizans prate, and iudge of it in the Ale-house: But for the honest and well minded Reader, who is neither captious, or curious,<note place="margin">Psal. 1.2.</note>
      <hi>But delights in the Law of the Lord, and meditates therein day and night:</hi> who labours to purchase knowledge by diligence, and by his deuotion to redeeme time, and not misspend it in idle pleasure, which one compares to Hawking, much cost,<note place="margin">D. Boys.</note> and little sport, To him I say, as the Angell said to <hi>Iohn,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Reue. 10.9.</note>
      <hi>Take this little Booke, and eate it:</hi> Let thy Sauiors Diuine incarnation be thy deuout meditation: and be not afraid, or offended with the Latine quotations, for I haue made them for thy sake, like Country-stiles, steppe ouer them, thou losest not thy way by them, for their expositions follow them: and <hi>(si fortè mihi vitio detur)</hi> if I bee blamed for inserting many marginall allegations, know that I did it for the more learneds sake, that they might <hi>gustare post fella fauos,</hi> the better rellish their palates with tasting the hony of others Hiues.<note place="margin">Pro M. Caelio.</note>
      <hi>Dandum est ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid aetati,</hi> saith <hi>Tullie</hi> of youth, so something must be giuen to this learned age, something to the solemnitie of the place, and something to the expectation of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. And indeed of this matter, all good pennes haue
<pb facs="6"/> written, and tongues spoken, so that I haue gleaned but an handfull out of a plentifull haruest: Yet though this subiect hath passed many worthy workemens hands, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> (to my knowledge) I haue followed the methode of no particular authour. Thus hast thou (ingenious Reader) the purpose of my publishing, and proceeding, and now ventrously I trafficke with this poore talent in this banke-route world, and intrust thee with the benefite of my paines: let me not finde thee a bad debter, to repay me with enuie, instead of vsurie. <hi>Non quid ipsi possunt, sed quid nos non possumus, dijudicant:</hi> An vsuall practise for loyterers to detract from others labours: for it is an easier taske to correct, then to compose to censure, then to write: <hi>But wisedome is iustified of her Children,</hi> Matth. <hi>11.19.</hi>
