   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, I doe the rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this following Sermon vnto thee: First, because I doe obserue, that all the other workes of this holy man of GOD, vvhich haue beene committed to the Presse, since his death, are generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, and embraced of all the Godly; And secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I hauing had other copies of his works in my hands, (as his first largest Letter of all, exciting to Repentance, and New obedience; and another Sermon of his, vvhich intreateth soundly, and in briefe manner, concerning the Apostasie from true grace, which may be in Gods children, and from those seeming temporary graces vvhich may be in the wicked) both vvhich are now printed; I thought good not to bury this other Sermon of his, which followeth, in darknesse and obliuion. Thirdly and lastly, I was the rather willing to commit the same to the publike view of all, in regard of the Author thereof, who was, and is still reuerenced, and beloued of all the children of God, which euer knew him: especially of all those, which had any fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acquaintance &amp; communion with him; who while he liued, was a bright Starre in the right hand of Christ;<note place="margin">Reu. 1.20.</note> who, as a cleere candle, shined so long vnto others, vpon the candlesticke where Christ had placed him, vntill by giuing light vnto others, hee had almost consumed and
<pb facs="3"/>spent himselfe;<note place="margin">1. Thes. 2.11.</note> who liued as a gentle Father, and a tender Nurse among those of the children of God vvhich hee had committed vnto his teaching; who was of the same minde with that holy Apostle, that hee would very gladly haue spent,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.15.</note> and been spent himselfe for their soules, ouer which hee was appointed to watch; though the more abundantly he had loued them, the lesse he should haue been beloued of them: so affectionately desirous was he of them, that hee was willing to haue imparted vnto them, not the Gospell of God onely, but also his owne soule, because they were deare vnto him,<note place="margin">1. Thes. 2.8. Act. 20.24.</note> who counted not his owne life deare vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, so that he might haue finished his course with ioy, &amp; the ministerie which he had receiued of the Lord Iesus, to testifie the Gospell of the grace of God: which hee laboured to performe in a good and acceptable manner vnto him: For as hee was allowed of God to be put in trust with the Gospell, euen so he spake, not as pleasing men, but GOD, which tryed his heart;<note place="margin">1. Thes. 2.4. &amp; 6.</note> neither at any time sought hee the praise and glory of men, but of God alone. He was like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, for hee was both a burning and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning light,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.35.</note> burning in himselfe, with the fire both of an holy and ardent zeale for Gods glory, and of a pure and feruent loue of the saluation of his brethren; and shining forth vnto others, by the light, both of his vncorrupt and sound doctrine, and also of his vnblameable, and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation. But behold, this bright Starre, this burning Lampe, this shining Light, was at length eclipsed, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and by death quite extinguished; but his memoriall shall continue still amongst vs, and shall be blessed; his good name,<note place="margin">Prou. 22 1.</note> which is to be chosen aboue great riches, and to be valued aboue all precious treasures, shall neuer die, but shall freshly shine forth for euermore. Seeing hee
<pb facs="3"/>was so good a man, his losse is the more to be lamented of Gods Church, and children: being taken away, as for the vnthankefulnesse of this wretched and wicked world,<note place="margin">Esay 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.1.</note> which was not worthy of him; so also from the euill to come.</p>
   <p>Reade this, and all other of his workes with reuerence; remember the things contained in them with diligence; and practise all the good duties therein vrged vpon thy soule with constancy: and if thou receiue any benefite, and comfort thereby, forget not to giue God the praise and glory which is due vnto him for the same.</p>
