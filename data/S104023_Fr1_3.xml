   <head>A PREFACE</head>
   <head type="sub">To them, who being themselves
mistaken, have misguided others, in these
new Doctrines of the Sabbath.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot out of any humour or desire of
being in action, or that I love to
have my hands in any of those
publike quarrels, wherewith our
peace hath beene disturbed: but
that posteritie might not say, we
have beene wanting, for our parts, to your infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and the direction of <hi>Gods people</hi> in the
wayes of <hi>truth;</hi> have I adventured on this <hi>Story.</hi>
A <hi>Story</hi> which shall represent unto you the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practise</hi> of <hi>Gods Church</hi> in the present busines,
from the <hi>Creation</hi> to these daies: that so you may
the better see, how you are gone astray from the
paths of <hi>truth,</hi> and tendries of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and from
the present judgement of all <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Churches.</hi>
The <hi>Arguments</hi> whereto you trust, and upon see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
strength whereof you have beene embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to presse these <hi>Sabbatarian Doctrines</hi> upon the
consciences of poore people, I purpose not to
meddle with in this <hi>Discourse.</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>.
They have beene elsewhere throughly
canvassed, and all those seeming strengths beate
<pb facs="6"/>downe, by which you were your selves misgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and by the which you have since wrought
on the affections of unlearned men, or such at
least, that judged not of them by their weight,
but by their numbers. But where you give it
out, as in <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>fact,</hi> how that the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was
ordained by <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and kept according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by all the <hi>Patriarkes,</hi> before <hi>Moses</hi> time; or
otherwise ingraft by <hi>nature</hi> in the soule of man,
and so in use also amongst the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> in that,
I have adventured to let men see, that you are
very much mistaken, and tell us things directly
contrary unto <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Story.</hi> Next, where it is the
ground-worke of all your building, that the
<hi>Commandement</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> is <hi>morall, naturall,</hi>
and <hi>perpetuall;</hi> as punctually to be observed, as
any other of the first or second Table: I doubt
not but it will appeare by this following <hi>History,</hi>
that it was never so esteemed of by the <hi>Iewes</hi>
themselves; no not when as the observation of
the same, was most severely pressed upon them
by the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> nor when the day was
made most burdensome unto them, by the <hi>Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Pharisees.</hi> Lastly, whereas you make the
<hi>Lords day</hi> to be an institution of our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi>
confirmed by the continuall usage of the holy
<hi>Apostles,</hi> and both by him and them imposed, as
a perpetuall ordinance, on the <hi>Christian Church;</hi>
making your selves beleeve, that so it was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the times before, as you have taught us to
observe it in these latter dayes: I have made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to the world, that there is no such matter
<pb facs="6"/>to be found at all, either in any writings of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi>
or monument of true <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or in the
practise of the middle or the present <hi>Churches:</hi>
What said I, of the present <hi>Churches?</hi> so I said
indeed; and doubt not but it will appeare so in
this following <hi>Storie:</hi> the present <hi>Churches,</hi> all
of them, both <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> together with the
<hi>Protestants</hi> of what name soever, being farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
both in their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and their <hi>practice,</hi> from
these new conceptions. And here I cannot chuse
but note, that whereas those who first did set on
foot these Doctrines, in all their other practises
to subvert this <hi>Church,</hi> did beare themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
on the authority of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of those <hi>Churches,</hi> which came most neere
unto the Plat-forme of <hi>Geneva:</hi> in these their
<hi>Sabbath-speculations,</hi> they had not onely none to
follow; but they found <hi>Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> and
those other <hi>Churches,</hi> directly contrary unto them.
However in all other matters, they cryed up <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
and his writings, <hi>making his Bookes the very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
to which both Discipline and Doctrine</hi> was to be
confirmed:<note place="margin">Hooker in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

leave they would forsake him, and leave him faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the glory of a <hi>new invention.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For you my Brethren, and beloved in our <hi>Lord</hi>
and <hi>Saviour,</hi> as I doe willingly beleeve, that you
have entertain'd these <hi>tenets</hi> upon <hi>misperswasion,</hi>
not out of any ill intentions to the <hi>Church,</hi> your
Mother; and that it is an errour in your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
onely, not of your affections: so upon
<pb facs="7"/>
that beliefe, have I spared no paines, as much as
in me is, to remove that errour, and rectifie what
is amisse in your opinion. I hope you are not of
those men, <hi>Quos non persuadebis, etiamsi persuaseris,</hi>
who either hate to be reformed; or have so farre
espoused a quarrell, that neither truth nor reason,
can divorce them from it. Nor would I gladly
you should be of their resolutions, <hi>Qui volunt id
verum esse quod credunt, nolunt id credere quod verum
est;</hi> who are more apt to thinke all true which
themselves beleeve, than be perswaded to beleeve
such things as are true indeed. In confidence
whereof, as I was first induced to compose this
<hi>Historie;</hi> so in continuance of those hopes, I
have presumed to addresse it to you, to tender it
to your perusall, and to submit it to your censure:
that if you are not better furnished, you may
learne from hence, that you have trusted more
unto other men, than you had just reason. It is
my chiefe endeavour, as it is my prayer, that
possibly I may <hi>behold Ierusalem in prosperity, all my
life long▪</hi> Nor doubt I by the <hi>grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
some of you at the least, to such conformity
with the <hi>practise</hi> of the <hi>Catholicke Church;</hi> that
even your hands may also labour in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and promotion of that full <hi>prosp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>rity,</hi> which
I so desire. This that I may the better doe, I
shall present you, as I said, with the true <hi>Story</hi> of
the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> and therin lay before your eyes, both
what the <hi>Doctrine</hi> was, and what the <hi>practise,</hi> of all
former times; and how it stands in both respects,
with all <hi>Gods Churches,</hi> at this present. First, for
<pb facs="7"/>the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> I shall shew you, that it was not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted</hi>
by the <hi>Lord</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi> nor <hi>naturally</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
in the <hi>soule</hi> of man, nor ever kept by any
of the <hi>antient Fathers,</hi> before <hi>Moses</hi> time: and
this, not generally said, and no more but so; but
proved particularly and successively, in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
descent of times and men. Next, that being
given unto the <hi>Iewes</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> it was not so <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>
or reckned of, as any of the <hi>morall precepts;</hi>
but sometimes kept, and sometimes not; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as mens private businesses, or the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the state, might give way unto it: and
finally was for ever abrogated, with the other
<hi>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>emonies,</hi> at the destruction of the <hi>Temple.</hi> As
for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> all this while, it shall hereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
that they tooke no more notice of it, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a little, at the latter end of the <hi>Iewish State</hi>)
than to deride both it, and all them that kept it.
Then for the <hi>Lords day,</hi> that it was not instituted
by our Saviour <hi>Christ,</hi> commanded by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
or ordained first by any other <hi>authority,</hi> than
the <hi>voluntary consecration</hi> of it, by the <hi>Church,</hi> to
<hi>religious uses:</hi> and being consecrated to those u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
was not <hi>advanced</hi> to that <hi>esteeme,</hi> which it now
enjoyes, but <hi>leisurely</hi> and by <hi>degrees,</hi> partly by the
<hi>Edicts</hi> of sec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lar <hi>Princes,</hi> partly by <hi>Canons</hi> of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Councels,</hi> and finally by the <hi>Decretals</hi> of
severall <hi>Popes,</hi> and <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>rders</hi> of inferiour <hi>Prelates:</hi>
and being so advanced, is <hi>subject</hi> still, as many
Protestant <hi>Doctors</hi> say, to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> to be <hi>retained,</hi> or <hi>changed,</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi>
thinkes fit. Finally, that in all <hi>Ages</hi> heretofore,
<pb facs="8"/>
      <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
         <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
         <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="9"/>
and in all <hi>Churches</hi> at this present, it neither was
nor is esteemed of as a <hi>Sabbath day:</hi> nor reckned
of so neere a kin to the former <hi>Sabbath,</hi> but that
at all such leisure times, as were not destinate by
the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>Gods</hi> publike <hi>service;</hi> men might
apply their mindes and bestow their thoughts,
either about their <hi>businesses,</hi> or upon their <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi>
such as are <hi>lawfull</hi> in themselves, and not
prohibited by those powers, under which they
lived. Which shewed and manifestly proved
unto you, I doubt not but those <hi>paper-walls,</hi> which
have beene raised heretofore to defend these <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi>
how faire soever they may seeme to the
outward eye, and whatsoever colours have beene
laid upon them; will in the end appeare unto you
to be but <hi>paper-walls</hi> indeed: some beaten downe
by the <hi>report</hi> onely of those many <hi>Canons,</hi> which
have successively beene <hi>mounted</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>God;</hi> either to fortifie the <hi>Lords day,</hi> which it
selfe did institute, or cast downe those <hi>Iewish</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
which some had laboured to restore. Such
passages as occurred concerning <hi>England,</hi> I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely

So in the businesse▪ now in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

by me lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> to be discussed and weighed by them,
who either by their place are called, or by their
<hi>learning</hi> are inabled to so great a businesse. But
for the <hi>point</hi> of <hi>practice,</hi> which is <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>fact,</hi> how
long it was, before the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was commanded,
and how it was observed, being once comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
how the <hi>Lords day</hi> hath stood in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church,</hi> by what <hi>authority</hi> first instituted, in
what kinde regarded: these things are offered to
the judgement and consideration of the meanest
Reader. No man that is to be returned on the
present <hi>Iury,</hi> but may be able to give up his <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,</hi>
touching the title now in question▪ unlesse
hee come with <hi>passion,</hi> and so will not heare, or
else with <hi>prejudice</hi> and so will not value, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which is produced for his information.
For my part, I shall deale ingenuously, as the
cause requires, as of sworne counsell to the truth;
not using any of the mysteries or Arts of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
but as the holy <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the
learned <hi>Writers</hi> of all Ages, themost renowned
<hi>Divines</hi> of these latter times, and finally as the
publicke Monuments and Records of most <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
christned</hi> have furnished me in this enquirie.
What these, or any of them have herein either
said, or done, or otherwise left upon the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb facs="11"/>
for our direction, I shall lay downe in order,
in their severall times; either the times in which
they lived, or whereof they writ: that so we may
the better see the whole succession both of the
doctrine, and the practise of <hi>Gods Church,</hi> in the
present businesse▪ And this with all integritie
and sincere proceeding, not making use of any <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi>
who hath been probably suspected of <hi>fraud</hi> or
<hi>forgery;</hi> nor dealing otherwise in this search, than
as becomes a man who aimes at nothing more
than <hi>Gods</hi> publike service, and the conducting
of <hi>Gods</hi> people in the wayes of truth. This is
the summe of what I had to say in this present
<hi>Preface;</hi> beseeching <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of truth, yea the
truth it selfe, to give us a right understanding,
