   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et it not seeme straunge to thee (deare Reader) that the liues of these three blessed religious men should be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in our tongue: wheras we are soe well stored with such admirable examples of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient glorious saincts, martyrs, and confessours of our nation, whoe as beyond all exception haue bene esteemed for such by the generall voice of Gods Church, and haue shined in miracles for the more euident proofe of their sanctitie and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But as it is noe empeachement to the glory, and beautie of those starres, which in greatnes, and light farre exceed others, to haue round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them on euery side other lesser starres, whose light, vertue, and influence is not comparable to theirs, yea rather they are made more glorious, and the heauens are more beautified by this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cefull variety of greater, and lesser lights: soe is it not inconuenient to produce fresh shining lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and to sett them vpon candelsticks to giue light in the house of God (which is his holy church) especially if they be of the same cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall substance, lustre, and vertue; yea I wish that as such starres are discouered dayly in our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, there were some or other spirituall starre-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, that would point them out to the view of the world: by which meanes their brightnes might not only giue comfort to those whoe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, but their sweet influence, and vertue
<pb facs="8"/> might be deriued to others.</p>
   <p>And sithence there be presented to vs remouing only the vayle of a straunge tongue, which coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them and kept them from our fight. I thought it not amisse to drawe this curtaine, and become the authours translatour, which I haue endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to doe plainly, and truely, thoughe not soe elegantly, and plentifully as the authour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth himselfe in his owne conception.</p>
   <p>And I thought fitt to publish this the rather for the comfort of Catholiques, who maie reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and blesse God, that it pleased him still to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume his holy church with the sweet odour of such examples, and to continue that precious ointment of his holy spirit, which fell vpon the head and shoulders of our first forefathers of the primitiue ages, and deriue it to the skirts and hems of the garments, running downe soe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and plentifully vpon many of this barren, and vnfruitfull age, and principally vpon those whoe can say with the prophet. <hi>Iuraui &amp; status custodire iudicia iustitiae tuae. Psalm.</hi> 118. <hi>v.</hi> 106. I sware and haue determined to keepe the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy iustice: and for more speedy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of holie vowes, and godly resolution, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise all things created and followe their creatour with such feruour.</p>
   <p>I doe also request our aduersaries in religion to consider well, <hi>if the tree be knowen by the fruit, Math.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 33. as our Sauiour teacheth vs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ought not, mauger their malice to our
<pb facs="9"/> religion, to commend that tree which bringeth forth such fruit. This is a marke plaine, and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the sense, where it is alsoe said. <hi>Ex fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus eorum cognoscetis eos. Math.</hi> 7.20. By their fruits yee shall knowe them. Soe that we may safely holde it for an irrefragable truth, that true faith, and religion worketh in them that frame their liues according to the rule of their beleife, true puritie and piety, expressed and testified out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by good workes, that others seeing them may glorifie their Father, which is in heauen. This matter is soe worthy due consideration, that I doe earnestly beseech, those whoe are morall men among our countrimen, and loue vertue, and goodnes out of the inclination of good nature, and perswade themselues that they haue a perfect hate, and detestation of vice, to examine this point betwene God, and their owne soule, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently as they can, by commending themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to God in simplicitie of hart for this end, to knowe the truth, to examine, I saie whether Catholique religion hath not better precepts and rules wherby to order our life in the feare of God, and loue of our neighbour, then theirs hath.</p>
   <p>And secondly I beseech them to consider, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> they haue any amōg them comparable to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques in all Christian vertue charitie, humilitie, patience, obedience, modestie, chastitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world and mortification of the flesh and the concupiscence therof, all which are to be seene in an eminent degree in these blessed men.</p>
   <pb facs="9"/>
   <p>For the first I knowe some Protestants will make noe question but boldly affirme it, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie those whoe doe not well reflect vpon the rule of their owne faith, and will not take time to examine the precepts of Catholike religion, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a passionate preiudice against it, which is alsoe strengthened by their nurture and long custome. And to doe them noe wrong in speaking this in generall termes, where there may be fraude and calumniation sequested without more expresse specifying, I will descend to a more particular paralleling, and comparing of the one with the other, and touch it breifly in 2. or 3. points. First the Protestāts teach <hi>(a)</hi> that faith only doth iustifie, and that good workes haue noe part in iustification. A principle most pernicious, and not only opposite to the expresse words of holy scripture which saith. <hi>Doe you see that by workes a man is iustified and not by faith only?</hi> But in his owne nature ouerthrowing good workes, and breeding a dul drowsines in those that haue this disease in their braine, that they need not waken and rouze themselues vp to doe any such workes which are not better prized, and valued in the presence of God, to whose honour &amp; glory they be principally directed. Neither is it any meruaile if their faith which is a <hi>sick mans dreame,</hi> doth va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish awaie into nothing, it being but a conceited application of the iustice of Christ grounded vpon their mere frothy imaginatiō: soe that when they come to wake out of this dreame either by Gods
<pb facs="10"/> mercy in awayting them in this world, or ouer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them by his iudgement in the next, they be like to the rich men of whom the Prophet Dauid speaketh. <hi>Dormierunt somnum suum &amp; nihil inu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
         <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerunt in manibus suis.</hi> They slept their sleepe, and found nothing in their hands. <hi>(a) Luth. in Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>tom.</hi> 5. <hi>fol.</hi> 305. <hi>Apologia Confes. August. cap. de iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificat. Caluin. in Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>&amp; alij omnes. S. Ioan.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 75. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
   <p>The secōd principle is, (b) that euery one which hath this beleife, and apprehendeth the iustice of Christ as his owne, is certainly saued, and he is bound to beleiue it as vndoubtedly that he is one of Gods elect, as he doth beleiue Christ to be God, and to raigne in glory with his Father. Can this wonderfull presumption, and straunge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence stand with that awefull honour and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to Gods diuine maiestie, whoe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs by the mouth of his holy Apostle Saint Paul, <hi>to worke our saluation with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling?</hi> Will a sonne which can not be disinherited by his Father, be soe carefull not to offend his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as when he knoweth by offending him grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously he incureth hazard of loosing his enheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce. I should neuer make an end, if I should recite the many dangerous gaps, which are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to all vice and sinne by their doctrine; As that which they hold also for a fundamentall point, to wit, that it is (c) impossible to keepe Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and consequently noe obligation is imposed vpon them for that end: that (d) al good
<pb facs="10"/> workes are in thēselues sinnes, though they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed frō Gods grace as the fountaine, &amp; soe must be odious in themselues, &amp; abominable to God. <hi>(b) Bucerus in Colloq.

   <p>The Catholique doctrine teacheth vs an other path, which though it be more narrowe, and straight as the way to heauen is, yet is it a direct and certaine truth: for it instructeth vs that good workes must necessarily accompanie faith, that doing good workes in purity of a good conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, we maie haue a great and comfortable hope of attayning heauen, that being strengthened with Gods grace, we are able to keepe Gods holy commandements, and that by the vnction of his holy spirit this burden is made light, &amp; this yoke sweete: that good workes are soe farre from being odious in his sight, that they are meritorious and shall be rewarded which that, <hi>euge serue bone quia in pauca fuisti <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>delis supra multa te constituam,</hi> well fare thee good, and faithfull seruant, because thou hast bene faithfull ouer a few things, I will place thee ouer many things, enter into the ioye of thy Lord. There are many Catholique bookes which doe treat most amply these destructiue points of
<pb facs="11"/> our Aduersaries doctrine, not only repugnant to supernaturall light of truth reuealed to vs, but alsoe to the light of naturall reason, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be dimme and weake in comparison of the supernatural, yet hath it nothing directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contrarie or opposite to it. For what is more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, then that God which is the fountaine of all goodnes, &amp; illuminateth euery one which cometh into the world, and hath made man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this owne image and likenes in his soule, and free will, and endowed him with his grace purchased by his sons merits after, he had deliuered him out of the hands of his enemy, to whom he had made himselfe captiue by sinne, should notwithstanding leaue him so woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and infested, that he should sinne mortally in all his best workes, and that all his pious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours, and trauailes, all mortifications of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, acts of charitie, chastitie, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and other Christian vertues, should haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in themselues, but the corruption of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie poison.</p>
   <p>I doubt not but these things sound soe harsh in the eares of any indifferent man, that he will hardly beleiue them at the first, till he reade, and see the bookes of his owne Rabbins, which stoutely defend these horrible paradoxes.</p>
   <p>And nowe will I descend to the liues of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men, by which the former point is alsoe prooued, that Catholique religion is the true naturall, and noursing mother of good life.
<pb facs="11"/> These are they whoe haue entered into a more straight waye of perfection, and therfore, when their liues are aunsuerable to their profession (as God be thanked there is a great multitude of such) are much honoured and respected by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, whoe by vertue of this approbation are alsoe made fellowe members with them, and participant of their prayers, and merits. But to proceed with our aduersaries, and to manifest yet more their hate to pietie and vertue, Doe they not I pray you, scornefully reiect, and condemne this maner of life as superstitious? Doe they not labour to make it odious, and abominable? Therfore that it may not seeme so hydeous in these blessed men, that I my make their accesse more easie euen among these which would crye them downe with loude hooting, giue me leaue to present to thy eyes (deare Reader) their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed predecessours, whom the holy booke of God hath marked out, and left vs their memorie as worthy to be enrolled and registred to all ages. <hi>Num.</hi> 6. <hi>n.</hi> 2. 3. To beginne with the Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, whose vowes in obseruing certain thinges not commaunded were esteemed most holy, and acceptable in Gods sight, of whom some segre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated themselues from the ordinarie state of people for a tyme, and to be limited by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themselues, some were perpetual as Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. What doe Nazarites signifie as S. Gregory, well noteth in his 33. booke of his morals, and the 23. chapter? <hi>But those that voluntarily absteyne
<pb facs="12"/> from things otherwise lawefull,</hi> as from eating flesh eather for certaine daye and times, or altogether, from marriage, from propriety in worldly goods, and the like.</p>
   <p>Are not these alsoe directly intimated in the 33. of Deuteronomie, where the perfection and doctrine of the holy man of Leui is described. <hi>He that sayd to his father and mother, I know you not,</hi> and to his brethren I knowe you not, and they knowe not their children, these kept thy word, obserued thy couenant, thy iudgements o Jacob, and thy lawe o Israel, they shall putt <hi>incense in thy furie, and Holocaust vpon thine altar.</hi> And the Prophet Dauid. <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. <hi>v.</hi> 11. alludeth heerunto by waye of exhortation to this perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Audi filia &amp;c.</hi> Heare o daughter, and encline thyne eare, and forget thy fathers house.</p>
   <p>May we not say truly that Helias, Helisaeus, and S. Iohn Baptist ledd this kind of life, and were for it reputed of eminent sanctitie, and pietie? The children of the prophets are styled by S. Hierome, the monkes of the old testament. <hi>Filij prophetarum quos monachos in veteri testamento legimus &amp;c. S. Hier. in epist. ad Rusticum.</hi> The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children of the prophets, whom we reade to be the monkes in the old testament, liued neare the brookes of Iordan, vpon barly floure and wild herbes.</p>
   <p>The strict liues of these holy men haue caused such an hartburning in the first newe Gospellers that they sought all wayes possible, and vsed all
<pb facs="12"/> the shifts they could inuent to disguise this truth. It would be too long to insist much heerin, I will only point at their expositions vpon the first chapter of S. Marke, and the third of S. Mathew where S. Iohns holines of life is cōmēded by the Euangelists and for proofe of it, his hard, and roughe garments of camels haire, and his poore foode of locusts, and wild hony is represented by them. Some of their newe glossers will needes haue men beleiue, that this sort of garment, was but such as poore countrie men wore, and some others that it was a fine kind of garment which we call chamblett, which may become a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister more then of an ordinary ranke to weare. <hi>Naratus in sua catena. Dauid Chytreus in</hi> 3. <hi>cap. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaei.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And Caluin in his harmonie saith of Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques. <hi>Quod perfectam ferè iustitiam in externis laruis constituunt &amp; quod finxerunt Ioannem in vita soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria abhorruisse a communi viuendi more sicut eremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, &amp; monachi.</hi> That Catholiques do put in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perfect iustice in externall visards, and that they haue feyned, that Iohn in a solitary kind of life was farre from the common manner of liuing, as Eremits and Monkes. Will they beleiue our Sauiours testimony of him, whoe commended him for his strictnes in cloathing and nourishing himselfe? <hi>Quid existis, &amp;c. Math.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 13. What went ye out to see? A man cloathed with loft garments? Doth not he commend him for the contrary? And againe <hi>venit Ioannes Baptista &amp;c.</hi>
      <pb facs="13"/> Iohn Baptist came nether eating bread nor drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wine, and ye saie, He hath a Deuill: out of which place it is sufficiently prooued that he liued soe vpon locusts and wild honie, that he wholie abstained from bread and wine.</p>
   <p>Howe often doth the holy scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the putting on of sackcloth, as a worke of penaunce, wherby Gods wrath against sinne is appeased? And what is the religious habit of these men, but a garment of continuall penance, and humiliatiō of themselues, soe that it may be truly saide of them, <hi>semper mortificationem Iesu Christi in corpore circumferunt.</hi> They beare alwaies about with them the mortification of Iesus Christ. But with what disdaineful eyes doe Caluinists behold them? If your represent to them our Sauiours wordes, <hi>Olim in cilicio &amp; cinere poenitentiam egissent.</hi> They had heertofore done penance in sackcloth, and ashes. They wil aunswer you out of the glosse of Caluin vpon that place. <hi>Poenitentia hic ab exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis signis describitur, quorum tunc solennis vsus erat in ecclesia, non quod in hanc partem insistat Christus, sed quia ad vulgi captum se inflectit.</hi> That penaunce is here described by outward signe, because there was a solemne vse of them in the church of God, not that Christ doth insist in this part, but because he enclineth himselfe to the vulgar capacity. Doth he not blowe hote, and cold out of the same mouth? He is forced to saie that it was a solemne vse, and custome of Gods church, and yet that our Sauiour speaketh it rather to condescend vnto
<pb facs="13"/> the popular opinion, then that the thing of it selfe is of any great worth, or value. The recitall of these monstrous words soe opposit to the practise of Gods holy church, and soe shamefully glos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and shifting the wordes of him that is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> wisedome of his heauenly Father, and the truth it selfe, may serue, I hope, for a reproofe of such doctrine, and sufficient confutation of soe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest a falshood.</p>
   <p>I doe the more willingly enlarge my selfe som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what what in this matter, because it maie appeare that Caluinists doe not only in practise, but alsoe in precept oppose these mortifications. Soe that as we behold them swelleing in such carnall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, we may iustly applie to them that which the holy Apostle doth fortell of carnal seducers. <hi>Quorum Deus venter est. Philip.</hi> 3.19. And then why maie not these mockers of Catholiques for superstitiō in these austerities better deserue to be taxed as Tertullian wittily and sharpely inueieth against them? <hi>Quorum Deus venterest, pulmo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum est, aqualiculus altare, sacerdos coquus, cum tota charitas in cacabis feruet, tota fides in alienis calet, tota spes in ferculis iacet. Tertulian contra pysticon lib.</hi> 5. whose God is their belly, their lungs are their temple, their guts is their altar, their preist is their cooke, whose charitie boileth in ketrels, all their faith is heated in caldorns, all their hope is placed in their dishes. I write not this to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braide all our aduersaries with this manner of life, knowing well that there are many moderat
