                 <title>Aristotles politiques, or Discourses of gouernment. Translated out of Greeke into French, with expositions taken out of the best authours, specially out of Aristotle himselfe, and out of Plato, conferred together where occasion of matter treated of by them both doth offer it selfe: the obseruations and reasons whereof are illustrated and confirmed by innumerable examples, both old and new, gathered out of the most renowmed empires, kingdomes, seignories, and commonweals that euer haue bene, and wherof the knowledge could be had in writing, or by faythfull report, concerning the beginning, proceeding, and excellencie of ciuile gouernment. By Loys Le Roy, called Regius. Translated out of French into English</title>

   <head>¶ To the courteous Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>LVcilius</hi> (gentle Reader) was woont to wish that his Writings might escape the sight and censure both of the Learnedst, &amp; of the most vnlearned; least the one seeing too much should discouer some defects, &amp; the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding nothing, or very little, condemne all. But as in euery other thing wishes doe but argue want, and yeeld no warrant for the accomplishing of mens desires: so in this especially, because the fortune of Bookes publisht resembleth that of Ships at sea, the one subiect to all sorts of Readers as the other to all kinds of Weather. By the sorts of Readers I meane not only as <hi>Lucilius</hi> did, who distinguisht them by learning, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and meane knowledge; but there is yet a farther diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence no lesse to be respected: for oft where Learning discouers faults, Courtesie dooth shadow them: but far more oft where no faults are, discourtesie (I vse too gentle a tearme) doth impute them: so mightily are the most mens minds infected with the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter humour of <hi>Zoilisme,</hi> a thing not greatly to be merueild, sith that which is easiest is still most vsuall. It were folly in mee to wish with <hi>Lucilius</hi> for things impossible, and meere madnesse to hope for them. It shall suffise briefly to acquaint you with some thinges which being absolutely considered and the truth thereof vnknown, may seeme to yeeld large and iust occasion of reproofe: as first, the harshnesse of the phrase and rough conueiance of the stile, which if any doth dislike, as doubtlesse some will, I entreat them to remember (for I can hardly thinke they know not) that no translation is capable of Elegance as the originall, because the one hath full libertie of inuention, &amp; the other is by necessity
<pb facs="4"/>
tied to obseruation: next I desire them to consider Aristotles ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of writing, the obscuritie, compacting and vnusuall compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of his stile, which if they weigh vprightly, they needs must graunt that though <hi>Tullies</hi> honourable <hi>Encomium</hi> which he doth generally giue it, calling it <hi>Aureum flumen oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> be in respecte of the puritie thereof, and of the excellencie of the matter most true, yet that they cannot with any reason looke for a fluent and flourishing stile in the translation of such a subiect, either out of the originall or any other language where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into it hath ben since translated. I wish them farther to consider that manie places of the Comment (wherein are set downe whole discourses touching Astrologie, Cosmographie, and other deepe points of the mathematicall sciences, lightly touched by Aristotle) are more obscure than the text it selfe. Touching the diuersitie that may be found in the translation, it is not to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled at, sith some part of the booke was performed by another, before I vndertooke the rest. But I hope, that though wee differ in the manner, yet that we swarue not from the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, howsoeuer the Compositors mistaking hath therein somewhat wronged vs, and the oft &amp; thick enterlining of the copie, hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written, deceiued him; but the cheefest of those ouersights are noted in the end. As for the differēce of the English in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the French, I answere, that when vpon any obscuritie I resorted to the Greek, and found the rendring therof in French not so significant as might be, I haue been bold to follow the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, vnlesse it did so depend on the Comment, that I could not alter it. And touching the difference of it from the Latin, I hope none will accuse mee for not following that whereto I was not bound, and besides if they conferre the Latine with the French, and both with the Greeke, they shall (I doubt not) find that the French doth approch farre neerer to Aristotle. Lastly, touching the extraordinarie harshnesse that may in some places be found, I say thus much only, that the difficulty of the thing, wherin euen
<pb facs="4"/>
learned men themselues haue sometimes faild, with the small time and leisure which I had both to doe and reuiew it may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fise if not to excuse me, yet at least to purchase pardon. But sith my present hast allowes mee not sufficient time to touch euery particular, I will commit vnto your courtesies the further consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration both of this &amp; whatsoeuer els may be obiected, humbly entreating you to measure my labour not by it selfe, for it is worthlesse, but by my good will and earnest desire to please, which is therefore the greater, because I feare that my former toies haue displeasd, which were they againe to pen and publish, should rather sleepe in silence, than I through them be accused of time mispent.</p>
