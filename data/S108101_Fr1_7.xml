   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong many other good things of late published in the Art of Surgery, I cannot but prayse, and greatly commende this breefe and short treatise, set foorth by Maister <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Clowes,</hi> proceeding from good iudgement gotten by his industrie and much experience by his owne practise. I thinke verily that as no man of sounde iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can mislike the matter, so no man that is in credit for his honestie, will discommend the intent of the man, but rather attribute vnto him the title he deserueth (a wellwiller to his Countrey.) In the censures of the wise, a more necessary Worke could not come foorth in this Art, considering the time. Surely the want of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in many sory Surgeons which in this booke is manifested vnto vs, hath cost many a poore Souldyer full deere, and hath made that stick by many Mariners, which they shall neuer be able to clawe off whiles they liue. For when they haue been any way maymed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered with losse of life or limme, then commes the bare singlesoled Surgeon, as he rightly tearmeth them, and what to do by arte knowes not, yet something he must attempt, treading in his old cowpath, as though he were healing a broken head, or plastering of a kibed heele, hauing one or two boxes of greene Salues, with a plaster of Diachilon, and a greene grasse Melilot, with their motheaten Mussilage, and these are good for sooth for all sores, and so committeth the health of the patient to the mayne chance, a miserable thing, that warlike men should first fall into the hands of men, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be as it were massacred by such ignorant beasts.
<pb facs="14"/>
But that they may leaue their brutish ignorance, and theyr sauage cruelty, let them reade ouer if so be they can, this directiue agayne and agayne, and if they be not tootoo sottish, they shall fynde theyr iudgement amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, theyr wittes sharpened, theyr practise corrected, and theyr fingers directed, poynt by poynt, from the beginning of the cure, till the finishing thereof.</p>
   <p>Thou shalt fynde also heereunto annexed (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) a learned Worke for the cure of the french disease, written by a Spanish Physition. Also, certayne singular Aphorismes, collected out of most excellent Authors, a Worke worth the labour, and worth thanks to, for that a man may walke safely in this narrow compasse, who before might be indangered of losing himselfe or his sense, in the wilde forest of Aphorismes. And surely, we can not if we did as we should but greatly thanke God, for that as in most other, so in this arte, the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary knowledge, and sufficient practise is brought of late into shorter volumes then euer it was, so that though we may say, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>vita breuis,</hi> yet can we not of late yeeres so rightly say <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>ars longa,</hi> for now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the pathes so wel trode by our owne countreymen, they better knowe our nature then Strangers did, we may walke safer with small studie, then they could with tedious trauaile in tyme past. Heeretofore men might well saye, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>experimentum periculosum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause peraduenture it cost many a man a limme, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men might be spoyled▪ before experience were rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed. Now that which before was <hi>incultum nemus,</hi> being made <hi>parua siluula,</hi> a man may take a sure staffe to leane vnto, whereas before he might trust to a rotten sticke, and so be deceyued. Now because this notable worke is wrought at home, vp starteth <hi>Aesops</hi> mangy curre, and all <hi>Acteons</hi> Dogs in a great cry; ready to pull downe the authors heereof, but their maister must be their maister, barke and brawle they neuer so lowde. Why they be so fell, I knowe not, vnlesse it be that the bleareeyed man
<pb facs="14"/>
can not abyde the candle, nor he that hath been brought vp in a darke den, abyde the lyght of the Sunne: but to say the truth, <hi>Hinc illae lachrimae: ego excludor, ille recipitur.</hi> by this meanes they are knowne to be ignorant asses, and therefore by wise men worthely shut out of dores, which if <hi>Aesops</hi> asse had been, he had not so dangerously taken acquayntance of his mayster. Yet there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flye bytes theyr galled backe, as bad as this, for that euery day more then other, the dawes stollen fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are plucked from him, and he knowne to be but a dawe, what with the old, pulling the black haires from theyr crowne, and the yong, pulling the gray from theyr forheads, they must needes appeare to be but bald bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sards. and thys is the cause they crye out, fye vpon Bookes, for, <hi>Litera scripta manet,</hi> as they are knaues in grayne, so they are fooles in Print: but to speake much, were but a folly, for words with them are but wynde, it is <hi>Morbus inueteratus,</hi> an old vlcer of the stomacke, which if you touch, it fluxeth at the mouth, spewing out theyr poyson agaynst all learning and learned men, who would cure them of theyr foule euill. I haue oftentimes mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled how they that are artistes in deede, can suffer such brasenfaced beastes to liue among them, who if they be long tollerated, will cause Surgery to be of that credit, that a man had rather fall into the chaps of a mad Dog, then into the hands of a Surgeon. for as their words tend to the defaming of the most skilfull, so their works to the disgracing of the Arte. wheresoeuer they goe, they leaue such a stincke behynde them, that all men that hath had to deale with them, cry fye vpon them. To prooue this to be true without a sillogisme, looke vppon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercures that are among you. It is some mens worke to rectifie other mens errours. Heere I might speake to the worshipful company of Surgeons in <hi>London,</hi> amōg whom I know many haue good knowlege, and also great reason ioyned alwayes with their practise, <hi>Cicero contra Catali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> spake to Senators, <hi>Hoc quis ferre possit, inertes homines</hi>
      <pb facs="15"/>
      <hi>doctissimis viris insidiari, st ultissimos prudentissimis, ebriosos so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brijs, dormientes vigilantibus,</hi> and therefore if either arte or artistes be respected in this case, <hi>Non est lenitati locus: seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem res ipsa postulat,</hi> such matters are not to be iested withall, the Stocks were a fit place for such persons to publish theyr skyll. <hi>Hos igitur a vestris aris &amp; aulis, a tectis vrbis, a moenibus, a vita fortunis{que}, ciuium arcebitis, &amp; tanquam hostes patriae, latrones Angliae, rectâ pergant in exilium.</hi> Who could tollerate eyther <hi>Molem inuidiae, procacitatem linguae,</hi> or, <hi>Spolium populi,</hi> but euery man hath spoken so much, and so little preuayled, that I am out of hart to speake any more. But yet I must needes teare off one ragge more from their torne coate, before we part. These cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers, or peoplepollers, being thus paynted out in their seuerall colours, with theyr proper badge to knowe them by, well perceyuing, that among so many torches, theyr pictures must needs be perceyued, seeke to couer themselues vnder other mens hoodes, get other to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and they to subscribe, and then the worke is theirs, and so they become of blinde bussards, that can scarce write and reade, great learned men. If <hi>Tully</hi> were aliue, he would crye out, <hi>O honorem contumeliosum,</hi> such men in deed do rather <hi>aucupari gloriam,</hi> though <hi>ignominiosam,</hi> then <hi>publicae vtilitati inseruire.</hi> I vnderstand that <hi>Aesops</hi> Asse is alyue agayne, and would couer himselfe with a Lyons skinne, but if he do appeare, we shall perceyue his long eares well ynough, then were he best to keepe him selfe within his owne territory, least he become by word much famous through greater folly. But suppose he can escape cleanly a while, yet will <hi>Academicus</hi> lye whispring <hi>hos ego, &amp;c. tulit alter honorem,</hi> I could saye something which I leaue, expecting alteration of disposition, that would be like a water of great force, to trye whether there were any figges in theyr bellyes or no, but because the one may be wiser then the other, I keepe silence, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that <hi>Philoponos</hi> shall haue good words for his good will, and I would pray them all, that old <hi>Philadelphus</hi>
      <pb facs="15"/>
for his friendly dealing might be free from their furie, but no salue I thinke can cure that sore, for this will euer be true, <hi>Inuidia virtutis comes,</hi> Enuy followes vertue at the hard heeles, not to treade in her steps, but to trip vp her heeles if she could. But to conclude, I thinke all haue some kynde of conscience or other, and there is <hi>magna vis conscientiae, &amp; magna,</hi> sayth <hi>Tully, in vtramque partem, vt nihil timeant qui nihil commiserint, &amp; poenam semper ante oculos versariputent qui peccarint,</hi> A cleere conscience will acquite continually where good meaning is, but a canckred hart will alwayes accuse where froward dealing is, and so farewell good Reader, and iudge as thou seest cause, and apply that which is spoken in good will, to thine owne profite.</p>
