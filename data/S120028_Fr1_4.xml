   <head>Further aduertisments to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
containing a briefe answer to a certaine
Popish pamphlet, intituled, The first
part of Protestants proofes,
&amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that I had finished this answer,
which was readie for the Presse in
<hi>September</hi> last, but staied onely the
Printers leisure, till he had dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
an other worke vpon the first
of <hi>Samuel,</hi> which in all reason was to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
there came to mine hand a certaine Popish
pamphlet, intituled, <hi>The first part of Protestants
proofes for Catholike religion and Recusancie:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I found, that among other late writers of our
Church, the author of that pamphlet had abused
and traduced me, and some of my writings: and
had made speciall vse of this Aduersaries testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
against me: I will therefore briefly take a
suruey of his fraudulent and corrupt dealing
herein, that by the euill measure which he hath
<pb facs="18"/>
offered vnto mee, it may appeare how he hath
handled others.</p>
   <p>In this Romanists spitefull collections, three
things I obserue, <hi>absurditie, falsitie, impertinencie:</hi>
as the cheife pillers and proppes of his rude and
ragged building.</p>
   <p>First his <hi>absurditie</hi> herein appeareth, that he
alleadgeth this Cauillous Accusers testimonie,
more then twentie seuerall times against me: as
p. 5, 6. &amp; most of all, p. 35. <hi>that I condemne all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers for dreamers: that I condemne all learned
&amp; godly Divines: that I falsly corrupt, translate, iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
handle, abuse the Fathers: that I straungely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
belie, depraue, abuse the Scriptures:</hi> and all this
he taketh for truth vpon an aduersarie, and euill
willers report. All which slaunderous accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are, I trust, sufficiently answered in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense,
vnto the which, the Table annexed in the
ende of the booke, may direct the Reader, that
desireth further to be satisfied. He might haue
thought of the common saying, <hi>Euill will neuer
said true:</hi> and if that vsual by-word sound to harsh
in his eares, <hi>aske my fellow, if I be a theefe:</hi> yet I
may vse <hi>Hieromes</hi> words,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 span">
            <desc>〈…〉</desc>
         </gap>. 3.</note>
      <hi>possem credere, si vnus as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sereret,
nunc aut duo mentiuntur, aut omnes: if one</hi>
(honest man) <hi>said it, I could beleeue it, but now ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
both lie, or all:</hi> as wel he that receiueth a false
report and carieth it, as he that first coined it, is
counted a gloser.</p>
   <p>His <hi>falsitie</hi> he bewraieth, in misreporting, and
peruerting diuers places by him produced: as
<hi>that I call the rules and principles of Religion, which
<pb facs="18"/>
his Maiestie approoueth, a foolish conceit, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
p. 6. quoting <hi>Eccles. triumph. p.</hi> 40. and again
p. 31. he harpeth vpon the same harsh string, that
<hi>I call the Kings sentence, that (the Romane Church is
our mother Church) a foolish conceit, and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
whereas I affirme no such thing, see mine
answer, p. 17. of this booke. p. 10. he saith, I speak
of his Maiesties mother, applying that saying of
one to <hi>Augustines</hi> mother, <hi>the child of such prayers
and teares can not possibly fall away: pref. to Antilog.</hi>
whereas I speake onely of his Maiesties prayers
and teares, making no mention at all of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So, p. 21. he chargeth me to say, <hi>that all scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
haue beene doubted of by one Church or other, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nops.</hi>
p. 2. in which place, no such thing is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but onely diuers heretiks are rehearsed, by
whom one or other, most of the Scriptures haue
beene doubted of: p. 27. that I should say, <hi>that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius
was condemned of heresie, for denying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
to bee reuerenced: Antilog.</hi> p. 13. whereas my
words in that place, are these: <hi>Some of these, as they
are imputed to Protestants, wee denie to be heresies at
all; as that of Vigilantius, that Reliques are not to bee
adored.</hi> Here no such thing is affirmed, that <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius</hi>
was herein condemned of heresie.</p>
   <p>P. 30. that I account the Councel of <hi>Florence,
a generall Councell: Synops. cont. 1. qu.</hi> 7. whereas I
there vrge it onely against the Romanists, as in
their opinion generall: for otherwise else-where
I haue prooued, that indeed it could not be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councell, the great Synode at <hi>Basil</hi> beeing
at the same time assembled. <hi>Antilog.</hi> p. 61.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="19"/>
P. 31. that I call the primitiue Councel of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocaesarea,
Toletane, the first, and the sixt generall
Councels, the papal Church, poperie, &amp;c. <hi>Antil.</hi>
p. 88. 89. whereas I onely shew in that place, that
diuers errors decreed in all these Councels, (the
first onely excepted, whereof I make no mention
at all there) are allowed in the popish church: see
the place. Such deprauing and wresting of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
sheweth a badde cause, and a worse mind
in those that vse such beggerly shifts: the truth
neede not to be so defended; and such false and
deceitfull dealing, will fall of it selfe, without any
confutation: as <hi>Hierome</hi> saith; <hi>non necesse habet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinci,
quod sua statim professione</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">apud Hieron. blasphemum legitur.</note>
      <hi>falsum) est:</hi> That
need not to be conuinced, which at the first is
discouered of falshood.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, his impertinent allegations are these;
p. 10. to prooue by our owne testimonies, <hi>that
they which liue and die in the Romane Church may bee
saued:</hi> he vrgeth these words of mine, <hi>that many
renowned Kings and Queenes</hi> (which professed the
Romane faith) <hi>are Saints in heauen. Antilog.</hi> p. 144.
as if he should reason thus; many ignorantly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in those daies of darkenesse, yet holding the
foundation, might through Gods mercy be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
therefore they which now wilfully resist the
truth in the Romane Church, in these daies of
knowledge, and erring in some fundamentall
points, may be also saued.</p>
   <p>P. 24. to prooue by our confession, that there
is no true, lawfull, and iudiciall exposition of
Scripture among the Protestants, hee presseth
<pb facs="19"/>
these words; <hi>that the reformation of religion, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the iudgement and redresse of the Prince:</hi> and
yet he is not priuiledged from error. <hi>Antilog.</hi> p.
120. The argument followeth not; for we neither
referre the exposition of Scripture vnto the
Prince, nor hang religion absolutely vpon his
iudgement, but according to the word: and wee
interpret Scripture by Scripture, which is the
most lawfull, sure, and certaine way of expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
   <p>P. 30. propounding to himselfe to prooue by
Protestants writings, <hi>that the testimonie of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers, is for the doctrine of the Church of
Rome;</hi> he alleadgeth this sentenee of mine, quite
contrary: <hi>Antilog.</hi> p. 263. <hi>the same faith and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which I defend, is taught and confirmed in the more
substantiall points, by the Historians, Gouncels, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that liued within fiue or sixe hundred years after
Christ.</hi> Who but this lawlesse disputer would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
hereupon, that euen by the Protestants
own testimonie, the Fathers and Councels make
for the Romish religion?</p>
   <p>Thus absurdly, falsely, &amp; impertinently, this
Popes penne-man wresteth and depraueth my
writings; and the like measure he offereth to the
rest: whose chiefe strength lieth in the weapons
of a false brother at home. And such is the fruite
that commeth of these domesticall contentions,
that thereby we put a sword into the aduersaries
hand: whereas I could haue wished rather, that al
these vnnecessarie brabbles at home had beene
staied,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 1. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="20"/>
in Gath, nor publish it in the streets of Askelon, lest the
daughters of the Philistims reioyce:</hi> for by these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotherly
dissentions, we giue occasions to the
enemies of God to reioyce, &amp; mispend our time,
which might more profitably be imployed. And
as for mine owne part, I say with <hi>Hierome; Opto, sifieri

I wish, if it may bee, and if mine enemies
would <hi>permit,</hi> to write rather commentaries of
Scripture (which course I am now entred into)

as for any thing, which mine aduersaries at home
or abroad can obiect, I passe not much, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
