                 <title>Christian offices crystall glasse : In three bookes. First written in Latine, by that famous and renowned Father, Saint Ambrose Bishop of Millane. Whereunto is added his conuiction of Symmachus the Gentile. A worke tending to the advancement of vertue, and of holinesse: and to shew how much the morality of the Gentiles, is exceeded by the doctrine of Christianity.

And so I come to the differences themselves.

   <p>That which is inferred here of Vertue, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generally, or particularly of any of its parts, as of a good worke, is that it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be exercised, and that by the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of divine mandate for obedience sake to God, not as meritorious. Who knoweth not, that the obedience of a son to his parents is a
<pb facs="15"/> thing necessarie, for it is part of the honour he oweth to them, is it therefore a matter of desert and merit? Vertuous workes make a way<note n="b" place="margin">Bona opera sunt via regni, non causa regnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, Bern.</note> to our salvation, that is conditionally,<note n="c" place="margin">Vt conditio sine qua non est aeterna vita, non ut causa propter quam.</note> because without them there can be no true<note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note> faith, nor life<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> eternall: but not as the<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> cause for which wee obtaine the same, for that is a gratuitall, and<note n="g" place="margin">Deus initiorum fidei, &amp; incrementi largitor est, Amb. de vocat.

      </note> free gift in Iesus Christ our Lord; Which in the purpose of the Apostle implyeth by his sole grace, and his only efficacy of merit. <hi>Abrahams</hi> justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by workes was seene in the fruites, and effects of his faith, as in shewing his<note n="h" place="margin">Iam. 2.21.</note> obedience in offering up his sonne <hi>Isaac</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the altar. Thus proceeds S. <hi>Iames</hi> his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, that it admits not faith to bee soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary: but S. <hi>Paul</hi> strikes at the roote, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no other foundation of our justification, but<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 4.3.</note> faith only. Both agree in this, that where it is not a dead, but a lively faith, there it is evermore accompanied with no colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and counterfeit shewes and shadowes, but with most<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> savoury, and sweet<note n="l" place="margin">&amp; 5.1.</note> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences in substance and truth.

Ye are saved through Faith by grace, it is not of your selves: it is the gift of God, not of Workes, lest any man should boast. Hereunto accordeth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of two of the chiefe of the Fathers, <hi>fiat voluntas tua sicut in coelo, &amp; in terra, hoc est, sicut in eis qui jam crediderunt, &amp; tanquam coelum sunt, &amp; in eis, qui non credunt, &amp; ob hoc adhuc terra sunt, Cyprian.</hi> Wherein he sheweth that it proceedeth from the will of God, that any beleeve: <hi>Augustine</hi> accords with him, <hi>Trahi à patre ad Christum nihil aliud est, quàm donum accipere à patre, quo credat in Christum, August: l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Praedest.

<pb facs="18"/> this bee so effectually proved by any other motives and inducements neuer so strong, and consonant to reason, as by the testimony of the spirit.

Policie.</note> ours, that wee are not admonished to take heed of that philosophie, which is true and sound knowledge attained by naturall discourse of reason, but that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie which to bolster heresie, or errour casteth a fraudulent shew of reason upon things, which are indeed unreasonable, and by that meanes, as by a stratagem spoileth the simple, which are not able to withstand such cunning. He that exhorteth to beware of an enemies policie, doth not counsell to bee impolitique, but rather to use all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection. The way not to be inveigled is to be armed with that true philosophie teaching against deceitfull and vaine.
