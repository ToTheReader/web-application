      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE present carelesse security of all men in generall, is like unto our first Parents neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Gods sacred commandement in Paradice, when the seducing Serpent no sooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded evill, but it was instantly put in practise: You shall die (said God) was heard, but you shal not die (said the Divell) was beleeved. Our eares are daily acquainted with the threatnings of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb facs="4"/>
against sinners, and yet that sinne, that broad way path and high-way to hell, is attempted with a delectation and pleasure, so craftie and subtill are the baits and lures of the deceiver, and so void of spirituall wisedome is the soule-murdering sinner. But if due consideration were had of the wages of sinne, and the reward of unrighteousnesse, and to what bitternesse it will turne in the end, it would make us lesse bold to sinne, and more fearefull to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, if wee would take into our company for a daily consort, the pale memory of death, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he summeth us after this life. Death it selfe is very fearefull, but much more terrible, in regard of the judgement it warneth us
<pb facs="4"/>
unto. Imagine to see a sinner lie on his departing bed, burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and tyred with the grievous and heavie load of all his former trespasses, goared with the sting and pricke of a festered consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, feeling the crampe of death wresting at his heart strings, ready to make the ruthfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce betweene soule and body, panting for breath, and swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in a cold and fatall sweat, wearied with strugling against the deadly pangs: Oh how much would he give for an houre of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance! at what rate would he value a daies contrition! Then worlds would bee worthlesse, in respect of a little respite, a short truce would seeme more precious than the treasures of Empires,
<pb facs="5"/>
nothing would bee so much estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as a moment of time, which now by moneths and yeeres is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishly spent.</p>
   <p>How inconsolable were his case, his friends being fled, his sences frighted, his thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, his memorie decaied, his whole minde agast, and no part able to performe that it should, but onely his guiltie conscience pestered with sinne, continually upbraiding him with bitter accusations? what would hee thinke then (stripped out of this mortall weed, and turned both out of the service and house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roome of this world) hee must passe before a most severe Iudge, carrying in his owne conscience his enditement written, and a
<pb facs="5"/>
perfect register of all his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds: when he should see the Iudge prepared to passe the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against him, and the same to bee his Vmpire, whom by so many offences he hath made his enemie: VVhen not onely the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, but even the Angels, should plead against him, and himselfe maugre his will, bee his owne sharpest appeacher: VVhat were to be done in these dreadfull exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents?</p>
   <p>VVhen hee saw that gastly dungeon and huge gulfe of hell, breaking out with fearefull flames, the weeping, hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>â€¢</desc>
      </gap>ing, and gnashing of teeth, the rage of all those hellish monsters, the horrour of the place, the rigour of the paine, the terrour of the
<pb facs="6"/>
company, and the eternitie of all those punishments. Would you thinke them wise that would daily in so weighty matters, and idlely play away the time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to prevent these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable calamities? Would you then account it secure, to nurse in your bosome so many ougly Serpents as sinnes are, or to foster in your soule so many malicious accusers, as mortall faults are?</p>
   <p>Would you not then thinke one life too little to repent for so many iniquities, everie one whereof were enough to cast you into those everlasting and unspeakeable torments? Why then doe wee not (at the least) devote that small remnant of
<pb facs="6"/>
these our latter dayes, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an attonement with God, that our consciences may be free from this eternall danger? Who would relie the everlasting affaires of the life to come upon the gliding slipperinesse, and running streame of our uncertaine life?</p>
   <p>It is a preposterous pollicie (in any wise conceit) to fight against God till our weapons bee blunted, our forces consumed, our limmes impotent, and our breath spent; and then when wee fall for faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and have fought our selves almost dead, to presume on his mercy. It were a strange peece of Art, and a very exorbitant course, while the Ship is sound, the Pylot well, the Marriners strong, the gale favourable, and the Sea calme,
<pb facs="7"/>
to lie idle at rode: and when the Ship leakes, the Pylot were sicke, the Marriners faint, the stormes boysterous, and the Sea turmoyled with surges, to launch forth for a voyage into a farre Countrey: yet such is the skill of our evening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, who though in the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of health, and in the perfect use of reason, they cannot resolve to weigh the ankers that withhold them from God, neverthelesse, feed themselves with a strong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that when their sences are astonied, their wits distracted, their understanding dusked, and both body and minde racked and tormented with the throbs and gripes of a mortall sicknesse, then will they thinke of the weightiest matters, ad become Saints, when
<pb facs="7"/>
they are scarse able to behave themselves like reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? being then presumed to bee lesse then men: for how can he that is assaulted with an unsetled conscience, distrained with the wringing fits of his dying flesh, maimed in all his abilities, and circled in with so many encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, be thought of due discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to dispose of his chiefest jewell, which is his soule? No, no, they that will loyter in seed time, and begin then to sow when others begin to reape: they that will riot out their health, and cast their accounts when they can scarsely speake: they that will slumber out the day, and enter their journey when the light doth faile them, let them blame their owne folly, if they die
<pb facs="8"/>
in debt, and eternall beggerie, and fall headlong into the lapse of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse perdition.</p>
   <p>Great cause have wee then to have an hourely watchfull care over our soule, being so dangerous assaulted and environed: most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly entreating the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to be our assured defence, and let us passe the day in mourning, the night in watching and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and our whole time in plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lamenting, falling downe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground humbled in sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and ashes, having lost the garment of Christ, that hee may receive what the persecuting ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would have spoyled every short sigh will not bee sufficient satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor every knocke a warrant to getin. Many shall cry Lord,
<pb facs="8"/>
Lord, and shall not be accepted: the foolish Virgins did knocke, but were not admitted: <hi>Judas</hi> had some sorrow, and yet died despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Foreslow not (saith the Holy Ghost) to be converted unto God, and make not a daily lingering of thy repaire unto him: for thou shalt finde the suddennesse of his wrath and revenge not slacke to destroy sinners. For which cause, let no man sojourne long in sinfull security, or post over his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance untill feare enforce him to it, but let us frame our premises as we would finde our conclusion, endeavouring to live as we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to die: let us not offer the maine crop to the Divell, and set God to gleane the reproofe of his harvest: let us not gorge the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
<pb facs="9"/>
with our fairest fruits, and turne God to the filthy scraps of his leavings: but let us truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate both soule and body to his service, whose right they are, and whose service they owe; that so in the evening of our life we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to a Christian rest, closing up the day of our life with a cleare sunne-set, that leaving all dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse behind us, we may carry in our consciences the light of grace: and so escaping the horrour of an eternall night, passe from a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall day, to an everlasting morrow.</p>
