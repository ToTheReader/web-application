And for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ītroduction in maner, I set forth first these thinges to be redde whiche are wry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten in Deutronomy .xviij.

For all that do suche thynges, the lorde dothe abhorre. And by<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause of such mischeuous synnes, he shal dryue them out at thy cōmyng in. Be per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyte &amp; pure therfore w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the lorde thy god.

That {per}sone whiche turneth vnto wyt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches &amp; sothsayers / &amp; playe the hore with them, I shal put my face agaynst hym / &amp; destroye hym from amongest his people.

   <p>Of these saying{is} it appereth more clere than the lyght of the mydday, that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticacions &amp; foresayinges of all astrono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mers, are foūded but vpon flowing sande and vnstable, whiche the wordes of god beyng of so great efficacite, easely destroy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth &amp; bringeth them vnto nought.

<pb facs="13"/> wyll not admyt nor suffre, any of his crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures to reygne or rule with hym. For he accordyng to the perfection of his diuyne worde, is sole y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> noble ruler &amp; gouernour, not onely of this yere, but also of al times and of all thyng{is} that be in heuen, in erth and in hell. Wytnes not Ptolomey of Ale<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>xādry, Albumaser, Haly, Meszhulle, Her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes, &amp; suche other? but that noble kynge and prophete Dauid in the .xxiij. psalme, sayinge.

A lorde myghty, stronge, and of great power: he is the kynge of glory.</p>
   <p>Also Iosue .ij. The lorde is your god, he is the god in heuen aboue, &amp; in erth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethe. Ecclastici .j. There is one most hye maker of all, omnipotēt &amp; a myghty kyng and moche to be dredde, syttyng vpon his trone, a god hauyng dominion. .j. to the Corinth .viij. We knowe that an ydoll is nothynge in this worlde / &amp; that there is no god but one / to vs onely there is but one god, whiche is the father / of whome
<pb facs="13"/> cōme all thynges / &amp; we in hym / and one lorde Iesus Chryste / by whome are all thynges / and we by hym.</p>
   <p>To y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Ephe. iiij. There is but one lorde / one fayth / one baptysme / one god and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all / whiche is aboue all / thorowe all / &amp; in you all. The first of Timo. ij.

      <p>In the .xxij. chap. Hieremy saith vnto the euyll kynge Ioacim.

Therfore y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lorde sayd these thynges vnto Ioacim kynge of Iuda, sone of Iosyas. Neyther brother nor syster shall bewayle hym and say alas.

A iust &amp; a good man eateth and fulfylleth his appetyte as moche as he wyll: but the bely of an vngodly man shall neuer haue ynough. The prophete psal. liiij. Cast thy carefull mynde vpon the lorde / &amp; he shall nourysshe the / &amp; shall neuer suffre a rightwise man to wauer or fall. Psal. xxxvj.
