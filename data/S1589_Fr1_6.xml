   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an Argument of worthinesse, to love worth in others, and vertue you know consisteth in action; so that <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> should be alwayes doing some worthy deede, or patronizing that which is done. If you therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the worthinesse of the Author or Worke, you will joyne your helping hands to support <hi>Atlas</hi> groaning under the burthen of the world. <hi>Mercator</hi> drew these Descriptions of the Integrall parts of the <hi>World</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> but now they are drawne forth in <hi>English</hi> colours, which are but changeable accidents, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all substance of <hi>Mercators</hi> World remaineth the same in that manner as he fashioned it. But of late with great care, cost, and fidelitie, these Descriptions have beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into <hi>English</hi> with new additions and much enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that the benefit thereof might have a larger extent, for <hi>bonum quò communius eo melius,</hi> Good becomes better when it is communicable to all. And besides, seeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall travells in these tempestuous times, cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted with any safety, here you may in the quiet shade of your Studdies travell at home. If therefore a worke that is <hi>Bonum, utile &amp; jucundum,</hi> good, profitable, and pleasant, may deserve your favour, <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus est,</hi> this is it. So that as <hi>Alexander</hi> grieved that there was but one <hi>World</hi> for him to conquer, so you will be sorry that there was but one <hi>World</hi> for <hi>Mercator</hi> to describe. Enjoy therefore that which is both good in it selfe, and was undertaken for your good, and benefit. <hi>Valete.</hi>
