doctrine, bloodie stroake, and poysone breath, against the liues and soules of Princes haue made mee to reuise my papers, and with <hi>Iames,</hi> to looke backe vpon my former thoughts, how vpon the view they might frame in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against these more then heathenish, and no lesse then hellish designes, whose thirst is neuer quenched but with the blood of their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes, nor gorge euer filled, but with the grosse viandes of popish bull, and indulgence, pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from time to time their damnable agents to subuert states, by two of the last and most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous stratage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s that euer were deuised against the Church of Christ, <hi>Parricide,</hi> and <hi>Periurie,</hi> thereby taking away all faith from God, fealtie from Princes, and commerce with men. And whats that other, but the breeder of all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, the mother of mischiefe, and <hi>Babel</hi> of all confusion.</p>
   <p>Time was when an Angell durst not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue a diuell, but said, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee.</hi> Now Iesuited diuels dare reproue An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels sent from God to be our Soueraignes, and say, <hi>Rauelacke</hi> may kill thee.</p>
   <p>Time was when none might touch the Lords annoynted, or doe his prophets any harme. Now popish powder may blow vp, popish knife may kill,
<pb facs="4"/>
and popish brambles may teare the flesh of Kings.</p>
   <p>Time was when <hi>Rulers</hi> were regarded, and Kings had their Maiesties, quicke and dead, as the <hi>Royall Chappell</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> can witnes, euen frō their Diademes, downe to their dust. But now Iesuited crueltie may crush all rule, burst the bandes of all obedience, curse Kings, ouer-awe authoritie, &amp; are so farre from honouring the shrines and maiestie of Princes here on earth, as they haue not spared to maligne their soules in heauen. In a word trust them, who will, and they shall finde their doome is still for death, their drumme for destruction, and their march in the cry of <hi>Edome, Downe with it, downe with it, euen to the ground.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>A man would haue thought they might haue spared her soule, whose body they could neuer still, with more then thousand intended trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against her state, and person, by poyson, stabb, and shot: by forraine inuasions, home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebellions, and domesticall incumbrances, from all which the Lord still made her glorious by deliuerance. And now her soule being tied in the bundle of the liuing, and she gathered vnto her fathers in peace, they cannot spare to banne what God hath blessed.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>I shall not neede to stand in defence either of her sacred life, or death, whose saued soule the heauen of heauens doth now possesse. Neither shall I neede to beate backe his poysoned breath, who now is breathlesse, &amp; knoweth by this what it is to haue touched the Lords annoyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

For were their pennes as perillous as their powder, the shot were more dangerous, but (to God be the praise) truth hath discouered their penne of ignorance, and their powder of treason. My purpose is not to stirre <hi>Elizabeths</hi> sacred hearse, whose graue is full of Princely earth, and her obsequies are ended, my thoughts are higher euē to match her <hi>Manes</hi> in blisse, with greatest of Soueraignes there (Soueraigntie it selfe onely excepted) I meane with <hi>Dauid, Iosua,</hi> and <hi>Ezekia,</hi> guides, and Kings of <hi>Israels Iudah.</hi>

Shee a Kings daughter, so are you: shee a maiden <hi>Queene,</hi> you a Virgin <hi>Prince:</hi> her name is yours, her blood is yours, her carriage is yours, her countenance yours, like pietie towards God, like pittie towards men: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the difference stands in this; that the faire flower of her youth is fallen; yours flourisheth like a Rose of <hi>Saram,</hi> and a Lilly of the <hi>Valley.</hi> Her dayes are determined on earth, and begun in heauen; yours are a doing on earth: and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the current till they bee ended: euer may your happinesse growe together, and make you blessed with that immortall crowne, that withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Sermons</hi> I here present, were preached vnder the shadowe of her blessed gouernment▪ and in the three last yeares of her gracious raigne. When (if God of the surplusage of his loue towards this English nation had not ended one mercy with the beginning of another) I feare our mourning dayes had not beene yet ended. But God almightie without whose prouidence nothing proceeds, and without whose mercy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is saued, hath ended one b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

One is easily ouercome, and two will make resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but this threefold gable is not lightly broken, being beautifull as the bands of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> wherewith the Church is honoured, the State is strengthened, the subiect is comforted, and our soueraigne Lord the King your father, no lesse blessed in his three children, then in his three Kingdomes. The Lord God of heauen, maker of Kings, and directer of Crownes, giue vnto you all grace in this life, and glory in a better.</p>
