   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our long experience, both of the French estate, &amp; language (Right worshipfull:) the report of your wisdome blossomed in youth, and ripened in yeeres, increased by learning at home, and confirmed by trauaile abroad, haue drawne me, a poore nameles countriman of yours, to make choyce of your woorthie title to countenance the forefront of this frame: and your iudgement to censure the priuie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiances thereof. The peece of worke which I offer to your patronage and iudgement, was vndertaken in the nonage of my studies, before I was professed, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had beene smothered from the world as an abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, had not some my deere friends weaned it from my hands, and fostered it in their affectionate bosoms, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising it life and light, if not with me, without me: yet not in respect, either of the matter which is heauenly, nor the Author which is excellent, desired I to silence my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantlike pen from proceeding heerin: but bicause this most Christian Poet, and noble <hi>Frenchman Lord of Bartas,</hi> might haue been naturalized amongst vs, either by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall act of a Poeticall Parliament: or haue obtained a kingly translator for his weeke (as he did for his Furies:<note place="margin">The king of Scots translated his Furies.</note>) or rather a diuine <hi>Sidney,</hi> a stately <hi>Spencer,</hi> or a sweet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell</hi> for an interpreter thereof. For so was I put in a false hope by some, that the liuing Pen of that worthie decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed knight, had amongst other his charitable legacies bequeathed a rich suit, after our best English fashion, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="3"/>this honorable Poet: and therefore suppressed my ragged weeds, till I perceiued their promise shrunke, &amp; my expectation still naked. And yet if any of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Heroicall Spirits haue vndertaken the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that act, I would not haue my seelie daies worke to preiudice their Weeke, nor my moat to flutter in the presence of their bright beames: wherefore though my rash quill hath tooke a further flight into this translation: yet haue I pinioned vp the rest of hir fethers, and suffered onely the first daies worke to passe abroad: till I may vnderstand whether any of those sweete recording Swans haue waded in the deriuation of these streames or no: which if it be true (as I rather wish it, then enuie at it) I am content that my homely translation be cancelled: onely this forefront would I haue preserued, as an old ruinous wall, not for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, but for the monument of some famous inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein contained; so may it stand as an heape of stones, not onely rebounding a short eccho of <hi>Dubartas</hi> his stately voice; but also lifting vp the accent in the sounding praises of Master <hi>Anthonie Bacon:</hi> and subscribing to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold prayers for his health and happinesse, with Amen.</p>
