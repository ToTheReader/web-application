      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, I present you here</hi> with the fift book of <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> of whose delectable history you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perused the first and second books: wherefore it may bee, you rather expect the third and fourth bookes to come forth in due course, then that the fift should thus vntimely appeare before the rest. The cause of which vnorderly proceeding, grew from this occasion: J hauing only interest in this and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing bookes of Amadis, haue already set out this fift booke, being the first of those which are in my hands, and also doth begin with the hystory of Esplandian, being the sonne of Amadis: intending by Gods grace to proceed with the others in due order as time doth permit. But as concerning the other Bookes which rest in another mans right, as they are not in my power, so can J make no promise when they shall bee published: wherefore seeing that matter remaines wholly to his will, I being ignorant
<pb facs="3"/> of his intent, did according to my owne fancy go forward with my owne, which may the sooner produce him to set out his: but if he should not, yet will I by Gods helpe goe thorow with mine till I haue finished all the parts that are in my hands: which are Hystories so pleasant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, that it were great pitty they should lie hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from your gentle sight: especially, for that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine such high matters of knighthood and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chiualry: All which I humbly commend to your fauourable censure.</p>
