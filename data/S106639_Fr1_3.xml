   <head>The Authors Prologue, to the Lords, Ladies, and Gentlewomen.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a matter of humanity, to take compassion on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
and although it be fitting towards all in generall,
yet to such as are most tied by bond of duty, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
already stood in neede of comfort, do therfore most
needfully deserue to enioy it. Among whom, if euer any
were in necessity, found it most precious, and therby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
no small contentment, I am one of them; because from my verie
yongest yeeres, euen vntill this instant: mine affections becam extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
enflamed, in a place high and Noble, more (perhaps) then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemed
my humble condition, albeit no way distasted in the iudgement
of such as were discreete, when it came truly to their knowledge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
Yet (indeed) it was very painfull for me to endure, not in
regard of her cruelty, whom I so deerely loued; as for want of better go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
in mine owne carriage; being altogether swayed by rash and
peeuish passions, which made my afflictions more offensiue to mee, then
either wisedome allowed, or suited with my priuate particular.</p>
   <p>But, as counsell in misery is no meane comfort, so the good aduice of
a worthy friend, by many sound and singular perswasions, wrought such
a deliberate alteration; as not onely preserued my life (which was before
in extreame perill) but also gaue conclusion ro my inconsiderate loue,
which in my precedent refractarie carriage, no deliberation, counsell, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
shame, or whatsoeuer perill should ensue thereon, could in any
manner contradict; beganne to asswage of it selfe in time, bestowing not
onely on me my former freedome, but deliuering me likewise from infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
perplexities.</p>
   <p>And because the acknowledgement of good turnes or courtesies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
(in my poore opinion) is a vertue among all other highly to bee
commended, and the contrary also to be condemned: to shewe my selfe
not ingratefull, I determined (so soone as I saw my selfe in absolute liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
in exchange of so great a benefit bestowne on mee, to minister some
mitigation, I will not say to such as releeued me, because their owne bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vnderstanding, or blessednesse in Fortune, may defend them from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such necessity; but rather to them which truly stand in need. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that my comfort, may some way or other auaile the common
needie, yet (methinkes) where greefe is greatest, and calamity most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulteth;
there ought to be our paines soundly imployed, and our grauest
instructions and aduise wholly administred.</p>
   <p>And who can deny, but that it is much more conuenient, to commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serate
the distresse of Ladies and Gentlewomen, then the more able con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of men? They, as being naturally bashfull and timorous, haue their
soft and gentle soules, often enflamed with amorous afflictions, which
<pb facs="5"/>
lie there closely concealed, as they can best relate the power of them, that
haue bin subiect to the greatest proofe. Moreouer, they being restrained
from their wils and desires, by the seuerity of Fathers, Mothers, Brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
and Husbands, are shut vp (most part of their time) in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
where constrainedly sitting idle, diuersity of straunge cogitations
wheele vp and downe their braines, forging as many seuerall imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which cannot be alwayes pleasant and contenting. If melancholly,
incited by some amorous or louely apprehension, oppresse their weake
and vnresisting hearts: they must be glad to beare it patiently (til by bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Fortune) such occasions happen, as may ouercome so proud an vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, we cannot but confesse, that they are lesse able, then men,
to support such oppressions: for if men grow affectionate, wee plainely
perceiue, when any melancholly troublesome thoughts, or what greefes
else can any way concerne them, their soules are not subiect to the like
sufferings. But admit they should fall into such necessity, they can come
and go whither they will, heare and see many singular sights, hawk, hunt,
fish, fowle, ride, or saile on the Seas, all which exercises haue a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
power in themselues, to withdraw amorous passions, and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the will to the pleasing appetite, either by alteration of ayre, distance
of place, or protraction of time, to kill sorrow, and quicken delight.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, somewhat to amend this error in humane condition, and
where least strength is, as we see to bee in you most gracious Ladies and
Gentlewomen, further off (then men) from all fraile felicities: for such
as feele the weighty insultations of proud and imprious loue, and therby
are most in neede of comfort (and not they that can handle the Needle,
Wheele, and Distaffe) I haue prouided an hundred Nouelles, Tales, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
or Histories, with iudicious moralles belonging to them, for your
more delight, and queinter exercise. In a faire and worthy assembly, of
seuen Honourable Ladies, and three Noble Gentlemen, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
within the compasse of ten dayes, during the wofull time of our
so late dangerous sicknesse, with apt Sonnets or Canzons, for the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of each seuerall day.</p>
   <p>In which pleasing Nouels, may be obserued many strange accidents of
Loue, and other notable aduentures, happening as well in our times, as
those of grauer antiquity: by reading whereof, you may receyue both
pleasure and profitable counsell, because in them you shal perceiue, both
the sin to be shunned, and the vertue to be embraced; which as I
wholly hate the one, so I do (and euer will) ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
the others aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
