   <head>To the most Noble, High and Prudent Counsellors of State in Holland.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ncient writers to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble the force of <hi>Musick,</hi> have recorded, that it hath cured divers infirmities both of body and minde. How farre their relations may bee credited may not without cause be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned. But tis undoubtedly true, <hi>that the diseases of mens minds have been and are often cured by pious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, seasonable admonitions, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full counsels, and religious directions.</hi> For to this end God hath given us his sacred Scripture, that it might be a Closet and store-house full
<pb facs="5"/>fraught with medecines of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which the depravations of humane frailtie may be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and men bee perswaded (which God often inculcateth) <hi>to eschew evill, and doe good.</hi> Having well weighed this with my selfe: I resolved among other Ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall performances of my calling, to attempt the cure of a most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and pernitious sore among tradesmen: who by crafty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and ungodly courses become Banckrupts
<hi>to the disgrace of their calling, disturbance of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, impoverishing of their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and the discredit</hi> (a thing much to be lamented) of
<hi>Christianity.</hi> And surely much the worse are the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises of delinquents in this kinde,
<pb facs="5"/>because God of his especiall favour hath given us plentifull know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and divine directions most cleere, to keep us in the wayes of God, and in honest, faithfull, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and Christian dealing. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when I saw and considered the ill consequents of Banckrupts naughty practises; I judged them more hurtfull and mischievous, thā their diseases who are affected and afflicted with corporall mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of what kinde soever; for bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diseases especially grieve the outward man of the partie disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, &amp; often conduce to the safety of the soule▪ Whereas the evils ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying Banckrupts proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, cause much detriment and harme to all such as deale with
<pb facs="6"/>them, and cast the Banckrupts headlong into many sinnes preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to their soules. Thence it is that often yee shall find Banck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts deafe to good counsell, lame and not able to tread in the pathes of equity; blinde, and not willing to see what belongeth to faire dealing. Men distracted, and such as be infected with the plague, are shut up in close places from doing mischiefe: But banckrupts frequent Markets and places of Commerce, and by crafty &amp; cunning carriage wrong full many. Obstructions in the veines may breed some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases in mens bodies; but the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and dealings of these craftie deceivers cause obstructions and stoppage to all faithfull dealing &amp;
<pb facs="6"/>trading. Wherefore I have in brief, 1. <hi>Layd open the diseases of Banck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts.</hi> 2. <hi>Shewed the vices incident to them.</hi> 3. <hi>Declared what laws have bin enacted to prevent their evill dealings.</hi> 4. <hi>Vnfolded the remedies necessary for the cure thereof.</hi> And in each part of my discourse intermingled pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wholsome exhortations, reproofs, admonitions out of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry learned &amp; approved authors; and with that moderation dealt with them, that if they rightly consider of my Endeavours, they shall have more cause to embrace and like of this Treatise, than to maligne and reproach it. I am one among the rest of <hi>Gods watch-men,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Exek.</hi> 3.17.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
      </note> and seeing so manifest a mischiefe bred, growing up, and increasing,
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>might not in any wise hold my peace.</hi> May it please you to accept of, and take into your patronage a worke so necessarie for the Credit and quietnesse of a Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and the defence and protection of many Innocent and wronged Creditors. Thus pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to protect you under the shadow of his wings, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you in these troublsome times for the happy &amp; prosperous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of the charge committed to you, I rest</p>
