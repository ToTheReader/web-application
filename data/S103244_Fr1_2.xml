   <head>To the Honourable and
vertuous his very good
Lady, the Lady Elizabeth South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
one of the Ladies of the
Queenes Maiesties most
honourable priuy
Chamber.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ately entring
(Right ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Lady)
into some
more then ordinary
consideration of the
gracelesse attempts, and
desperate enterprises,
which many in these
dayes (&amp; the more the
more pittie) by a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
yeelding to euill
motions, commit euen
<pb facs="3"/>
against their owne sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
yea their owne safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
I thought to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
my duetie vnto
Almightie God, and
plaine meaning to men,
by setting downe onely
some shorte aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for discontented
and distressed mindes.
But after, waying with
my selfe, how much it
concerneth euery man
to be careful of his end,
whereupon dependes
so great a charge, as
his eternall welfare is
worth; I then began to
draw that particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement
appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="3"/>
vnto some, to a
more general discourse,
appliable vnto all, and
euerye one, in this
forme, DISCE MORI,
<hi>Learne to Die:</hi> For it
seemed to me a thinge
most necessarie, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
sober Christian to
be mooued to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a serious remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
of his ende, to
know the meane and
manner of disposinge
himselfe to GOD, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and at the time of
his departure: that so
by the assistance of
Gods good grace, hee
might liue and die the
<pb facs="4"/>
life and death of the
righteous, and that it
may bee saide of him,
which <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
spake of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Mortuus est in bona
senectute, eo quód in boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
propositi permansit;
Abraham</hi> dyed in a
good old age, for why?
<hi>Abraham</hi> perseuered
in his good resolutions,
in his old age, yea euen
vnto the ende. Madam,
I beseech the God of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> to graunt
you <hi>Abrahams</hi> good
successiue course, both
in the way, and at the
ende of the way. Your
<pb facs="4"/>
more then vsuall fauor,
and long continued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
hath bounde
me vnto you, whome
otherwise I truely reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
for that I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded, you true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reuerence God, and
serue him, whome to
serue, is blessed libertie,
yea, (as I shall in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
following shew)
is the most honourable
estate of all. To make
issue of my duetifull
regard, this small occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is offered. Were I
a meere straunger, I
could not for prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
sake, seeke any
<pb facs="5"/>
better patronesse of a
religious discourse, thē
from a religious dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:
but your parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
respect towardes
me many waies, is such,
as I shall liue and die
vngratefull. I could
haue wished to haue
made testimonie of my
willing intention by
some other meanes, thē
by publishinge vnder
your Ladyships name,
these small labours, to
the view of the world:
for I must needes con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse.
I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>s very loath;
(respectinge my owne
weakenesse) to make
<pb facs="5"/>
that knowne vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
which is best
knowne vnto my selfe;
vntill at last, being ouer
entreated by some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
friendes, from the
vniuersitie of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
whose sober, iudicious,
&amp; very learned aduise,
I knewe not howe to
gainesay: I was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to let this presente
