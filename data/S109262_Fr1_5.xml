      <l>For all the worlde t'enuie and vs t'atchieue,</l>
      <l>Filles me with furie, and giues armed handes</l>
      <l>To my heartes peace, that els would gladlie turne</l>
      <l>My limmes and euery sence into my thoughtes</l>
      <l>Rapt with the thirsted action of my mind?</l>
      <l>O <hi>Clio, Honors Muse,</hi> sing in my voyce,</l>
      <l>Tell the attempt, and prophecie th'exploit</l>
      <l>Of his <hi>Eliza</hi>-consecrated sworde,</l>
      <l>That in this peacefull charme of <hi>Englands</hi> sleepe,</l>
      <l>Opens most tenderlie her aged throte,</l>
      <l>Offring to poure fresh youth through all her vaines,</l>
      <l>That flesh of brasse, and ribs of steele retaines.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>Riches,</hi> and <hi>Conquest,</hi> and <hi>Renowme</hi> I sing,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Riches</hi> with honour, <hi>Conquest</hi> without bloud,</l>
      <l>Enough to seat the Monarchie of earth,</l>
      <l>Like to <hi>Ioues</hi> Eagle, on <hi>Elizas</hi> hand.</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Guiana,</hi> whose rich feet are mines of golde,</l>
      <l>Whose forehead knockes against the roofe of Starres,</l>
      <l>Stands on her tip-toes at faire <hi>England</hi> looking,</l>
      <l>Kissing her hand, bowing her mightie breast,</l>
      <l>And euery signe of all submission making,</l>
      <l>To be her sister, and the daughter both</l>
      <l>Of our most sacred Maide: whose barrennesse</l>
      <l>Is the true fruite of vertue, that may get,</l>
      <l>Beare and bring foorth anew in all perfection,</l>
      <l>What heretofore sauage corruption held</l>
      <l>In barbarous <hi>Chaos;</hi> and in this affaire</l>
      <l>Become her father, mother, and her heire.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Then most admired Soueraigne, let your breath</l>
      <l>Goe foorth vpon the waters, and create</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="6"/>A golden worlde in this our yron age,</l>
      <l>And be the prosperous forewind to a Fleet,</l>
      <l>That seconding your last, may goe before it</l>
      <l>In all successe of profite and renowme:</l>
      <l>Doubt not but your election was diuine,</l>
      <l>(Aswell by <hi>Fate</hi> as your high iudgement ordred)</l>
      <l>To raise him with choise Bounties, that could adde</l>
      <l>Height to his height; and like a liberall vine,</l>
      <l>Not onelie beare his vertuous fruit aloft,</l>
      <l>Free from the Presse of squint-eyd <hi>Enuies</hi> feet,</l>
      <l>But decke his gracious Proppe with golden bunches,</l>
      <l>And shroude it with broad leaues of <hi>Rule</hi> oregrowne</l>
      <l>From all blacke tempestes of inuasion.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Those Conquests that like generall earthquakes shooke</l>
      <l>The solid world, and made it fall before them,</l>
      <l>Built all their braue attemptes on weaker groundes,</l>
      <l>And lesse persuasiue likelihoods then this;</l>
      <l>Nor was there euer princelie Fount so long</l>
      <l>Powr'd foorth a sea of Rule with so free course,</l>
      <l>And such ascending Maiestie as you:</l>
      <l>Then be not like a rough and violent wind,</l>
      <l>That in the morning rends the Forrestes downe,</l>
      <l>Shoues vp the seas to heauen, makes earth to tremble,</l>
      <l>And toombes his wastfull brauerie in the Euen:</l>
      <l>But as a riuer from a mountaine running,</l>
      <l>The further he extends, the greater growes,</l>
      <l>And by his thriftie race strengthens his streame,</l>
      <l>Euen to ioyne battale with th'imperious sea</l>
      <l>Disdaining his repulse, and in despight</l>
      <l>Of his proud furie, mixeth with his maine,</l>
      <l>Taking on him his titles and commandes:</l>
      <l>So let thy soueraigne Empire be encreast,</l>
      <l>And with <hi>Iberian Neptune</hi> part the stake,</l>
      <l>Whose <hi>Trident</hi> he the triple worlde would make.</l>

         <pb facs="7"/>You then that would be wise in Wisdomes spight,</l>
      <l>Directing with discredite of direction,</l>
      <l>And hunt for honour, hunting him to death.</l>
      <l>With whome before you will inherite gold,</l>
      <l>You will loose golde, for which you loose your soules;</l>
      <l>You that choose nought for right, but certaintie,</l>
      <l>And feare that value will get onlie blowes,</l>
      <l>Placing your faith in <hi>Incredulitie.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Sit till you see a woonder, <hi>Vertue</hi> rich:</l>
      <l>Till <hi>Honour</hi> hauing golde, rob golde of honour,</l>
      <l>Till as men hate desert that getteth nought,</l>
      <l>They loath all getting that deserues not ought;</l>
      <l>And vse you gold-made men, as dregges of men;</l>
      <l>And till your poysoned soules, like Spiders lurking</l>
      <l>In sluttish chinckes, in mystes of Cobwebs hide</l>
      <l>Your foggie bodies, and your dunghill pride.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>O <hi>Incredulitie,</hi> the wit of Fooles,</l>
      <l>That slouenlie will spit on all thinges faire,</l>

      </l>
      <l>How easie t'is to be an Infidell?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But you <hi>Patrician</hi> Spirites that refine</l>
      <l>Your flesh to fire, and issue like a flame</l>
      <l>On braue indeuours, knowing that in them</l>

      <l>That are so farre from doubting likelie driftes,</l>

      <l>You that know death liues, where power liues vnusde,</l>

      <l>That she like <hi>Auarice</hi> might swallowe all,</l>
      <l>And let none find right passage through her rage:</l>

      <l>You that heerein renounce the course of earth,</l>
      <l>And lift your eies for guidance to the starres,</l>
      <l>That liue not for your selues, but to possesse</l>

      <l>How in excesse of Sence is Sence bereft her?</l>
      <l>That her most lightening-like effectes of lust</l>
      <l>Wound through her flesh, her soule, her flesh vnwounded;</l>
      <l>And she must neede incitements to her good,</l>
      <l>Euen from that part she hurtes. O how most like</l>
      <l>Art thou (heroike Author of this Act)</l>
      <l>To this wrong'd soule of <hi>Nature</hi> that sustainst</l>
      <l>Paine, charge, and perill for thy countreys good,</l>

      <l>Feeles not thy gentle applications</l>
      <l>For the health, vse, &amp; honor of her powers.</l>
      <l>Yet shall my verse through all her ease-lockt eares</l>
      <l>Trumpet the Noblesse of thy high intent,</l>
      <l>And if it cannot into act proceed,</l>

      <l>Apter to byte at such vnhooked baytes,</l>
      <l>Gaine by our losse; that must we needs confesse</l>
      <l>Thy princelie valure would haue purchast vs.</l>
      <l>Which shall be fame eternall to thy name,</l>
      <l>Though thy contentment in thy graue desires,</l>
      <l>Of our aduancement, faile deseru'd effect,</l>
      <l>O how I feare thy glorie which I loue,</l>
      <l>Least it should dearelie growe by our decrease.</l>
      <l>Natures that stick in golden-graueld springs,</l>

      <l>Then in the <hi>Thespiads</hi> bright Propheticke Fount,</l>
      <l>Me thinkes I see our Liege rise from her throne,</l>
      <l>Her eares and thoughtes in steepe amaze erected,</l>

      <l>And now she blesseth with her woonted Graces</l>
      <l>Th'industrious Knight, the soule of this exploit,</l>

      <l>And now for loue and honour of his woorth,</l>

      <l>And now a wind as forward as their spirits,</l>

      <l>Where (as if ech man were an <hi>Orpheus</hi>)</l>
