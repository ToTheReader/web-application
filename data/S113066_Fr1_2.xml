         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>udicially as a cause betwene party and party? Indeed it is to officiously proceeded in, but the truth is, The cause is betweene party and party: I say not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene a faithfull servant of Iesus and a periured Boy, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Michaell and the old Serpent, Christ Iesus and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious man. For Iesus pleadeth (by M. <hi>Dorrell</hi>) that his great name, which ought to bee glorious among all Christians is highly dishonored, by calling into question his mighty power in casting out Divells at the prayer and fasting of his holy people. On the contrary parte Satan, who long since moved the Pharisees (even against their own consciences) to charge Christ with casting out of Diuells by the power of Belzebub, doth eftsoons (by his instruments) traduce such dispossession pretending it to bee but very counterfaiting. If then a loyall Iudge will diligently heare whatsoeuer can be said in behalfe of her Maiestie in a cause wherein she is pretended to be a party, much more religiously will your Lo. (being a Christian Iudge) heare whatsoeuer can bee said in the behalfe of Iesus, in a cause wherin he is pretended to be a party. And whether the name of Iesus be more glorified (indeede) by vndoubted dispossession, or pretended counterfaiting, your faithfull hart cā quickly iudge. If by vndoubted dispossession, then as good policy as that, whereby M. <hi>Moore</hi> is not called into any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion about the dispossession of 7. in Lancashire, might direct Christian Magistrates to bend their authority rather to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the Glory of Christe, then (altogeather) to obscure the same by pretended counterfaiting.</p>

         </gap>. 24.</note> cause) from the 22. vers. to the 38. of the 12. chap. of Mathew where you may first generally obserue; that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan neuer set himself so earnestly against any miracle wrought by Iesus as against this of dispossession. For perceiving the people hereby occasioned to take Iesus for the Sonne of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, he moved the Pharisees to traduce the same as before is said▪ and contrariwise Iesus conceiving how highly this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle concerned the glorie of his Name, did never take his owne part more earnestly then in iustifying the same. From whence wee may learne▪ that Christ his people should shew forth the vertue of him, by whose name they are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in mainteyning his cause so much the more resolusly, as Satan by his instruments shall oppose himselfe malitiously. But so it is in this cause: For Satan perceiving thousands of the best professors (among whom not a few be honorable, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull, &amp; learned) occasioned by the dispossession of Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and 9. other to glorifie the name of Iesus, yea so, that <hi>Nottingham</hi> (heretofore not so forward) became (for a time) very zealous (as I heare) in hearing the worde: Satan (I say) perceiving such a consequent of dispossession, moved sundry adversaries to traduce the same as Papists who deny any such power to be in our Churrh, Atheists who scorne whatsoever tendeth to prove that there is a God or a Divel, But especially certeine Prelates, who (being grosser in their conceipt then the Pharisees) by discrediting 12. sufficient Commissioners, 6. worshipfull Gentlemen, and 6. learned Preachers, by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing 17. sufficient depositions, by withhoulding M. <hi>Dorr.</hi> from answering at large for himselfe, make it (forsooth) a matter of counterfaiting. And yet I must needes say that the L. B. of London (as I haue heard) was fumbling about some proofe▪ That M Dorrell did cast out Divells by witchraft or coniuration But (belike) he remembreth, that so he might overthrow his first pretended counterfaiting. These thinges well weighed, it followeth that all Christians ought to take this cause to heart: and to further the manifestation of truth, no lesse zealously thē the Prelats would obscure it indirectly. If all Christians, then especially it behoveth your L. so to do, having authority even in that case. But the rather because all the godly (whose desire to bee satisfied is not to be despised) attribute most to your L. faithfulnes, yea the Prelates seeme to lay the burthen on your H. For Mistris <hi>Dorrell</hi> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>str <hi>Moore</hi> suing to the L. Bishop of Cant. that their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes might haue (at least) the liberty of prison, were referred to your Lo. as to him, that gaue the sentence of close
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>
imprisonment, till further punishment were decreed: and it is likely if further punishment be determined, your Lo. shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be put to pronounce the same.</p>
   <p>Secondly in Christ his apologeticall discourse your Lo.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> may consider sundry forcible reasons to perswade due regard of the Lordes worke so wonderfull in our eyes, if we will not cast a vaile before them. Which be these: First Christ <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth</hi> dispossession with vnaunswerable argumentes in the <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> 25.26.27. verses, and then hee <hi>reproveth</hi> the traducing thereof. Concerning the former I refer your Lo. to these Collections. The <hi>reproofe</hi> Christ prosecuteth by <hi>noting the offendours,</hi> and by <hi>censuring the sinne. Hee noteth</hi> (as with a blacke cole) <hi>the offendours, in the 33.34 35. verses,</hi> where he thus argneth, <hi>An evill tree cannot bringe foorth good fruite.</hi> Therefore no merveill though envious Pharisees traduce the Spirit or Finger of God. To apply: Lordly Bishopes in the iudgment of most, if not of all learned Preachers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in England, France, Scotlande▪ and the low Countryes (except Soul-killing non-residents, and ambitious aspirers to to the Prelacy) are plants which (in respect of their ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall dignitie) the heavenly Father hath not planted in his Church by the hande of his Sonne:<note place="margin">Mat. 28.18 19.

      </note> who onely (having all power committed to him) appointeth what callinges ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall hee thinketh best for the building of his Church. If this iudgement be found, then better proceedings then these against M Dorrell cannot be ordinarily expected from them, especially against such as desire the Church to bee reformed of the Romish Hierarchy and Ceremonies enforced. As for your Lo. better fruits are expected from the same, as from a tree planted in the Courts of the Lord, and that by his owne right hand.</p>
   <p>The sinne is censured <hi>by discouering</hi> either the <hi>corruption, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> danger</hi> thereof. The former is performed by proving <hi>wherein,</hi> and shewing <hi>against whom</hi> the offence is committed. Christ proveth <hi>wherein,</hi> after this manner in the 28. and 29. verses.

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ō: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in traducing dispossession, ye traduce y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> kingdom of God. This argument applyeth it self. I therfore only admonish you to think of it seriously: &amp; the rather, Because Atheists abound in these dayes and witchcraft is called into question. Which error is confirmed by denying dispossession▪ &amp; both these er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors confirm Atheists mightily▪ For thus wil they gather if 11. possessed (at sundry times &amp; in sundry places) were all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits, why should we thinke there is any possess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>I know your thoughts</hi> and immaginations exalted against the acknowledging of me to bee Christ, and hatefull against reformation which cannot bee avoyded.

   <p>If 1. (as <hi>Festus,</hi> so) your Lo. should throughly informe your selfe more Certeinly to certifie our Caesar to whom M. <hi>Dorrell</hi> appealeth. 2. If your Lo. ought to be nolesse diligent and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in this case of dispossession wherein Christ is a party, then in a cause wherein her Maiestie is a party. 3 If all Christians (specially your Lo.) should endeavor the manifestatiō of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted dispossession no lesse zealously then many would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure it indirectly. 4 If it be the fruite of a good tree, planted in the Court of the Lorde to advance the glory of Christ in this Cause. 5. If traducing dispossession be an impeachement to the Kingdom of God, and confirmation of Papistes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistes. 6. If he that is not with Christ by iustifying dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session is pronounced to be openly against Christ. 7. If mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious traducing of dispossessiō be blasphemy against the holy Ghost, and we are to feare all steps leading in the same And 8. If every idle word spoken to the preiudice of dispossession shall be punished at the day of iudgment. Then I require you in the name of Iesus (our Kinge and Saviour) patiently and iudicially to reade these Collections, and (abhorring his example,<note place="margin">act. 24.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
