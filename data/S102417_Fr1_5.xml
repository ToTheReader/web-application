   <p>THis History of <hi>Samson</hi> declareth vnto vs the infirmitie and weaknesse of Gods chiefest Vessels,<note place="margin">The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of Gods Sancts.</note> whensoever they are left vnto themselues: for albeit <hi>Samson</hi> had both spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and naturall strength aboue others, yet when God lest him but a little hee lost them both, and became a pitifull prey &amp; spectacle to his enemies, whome before hee vanquishe. So this Historie is a faithfull Recorder, aswell of the Vices as Vertues of the Sancts, &amp; a perfect mirrour wherin euery one may behold both the deformity &amp; beauty of his own person.<note place="margin">Simil. Iudg. 4.8. and 8.27. &amp; 11.39.</note>
      <hi>Barac</hi> the Captain had his own faintheartednes, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi> his Ephod, <hi>Iephtah</hi> his vnnaturall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, &amp;c. These things are manifest by the
<pb n="13" facs="5"/>Scriptures, and like Bekons set vpon the shore,<note place="margin">Simil.</note> to warne vs who seeme to stand, to take heede lest wee fall. Yea, they are the Cicatrices, and marks of their woundes, to remember vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the like snares of Satan.</p>
   <p>But although our spirituall enemies beguile vs, and ensnare vs in the grossest sinnes, yet let vs not despare: for there is still mercy with God:<note place="margin">Prov. 24.16.</note> &amp; howbeit the Righteous may fall seven times aday, yet hee shall rise againe. For sure it is, that whom the Lord loveth, hee loveth to the ende: which we shall easily perceiue in this short Treatise hereafter, God willing. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Lord externally chastise vs for our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, yet he taketh not his holy Spirit frō vs. For when he thought good he renewed his graces in <hi>Samson,</hi> and as his haire grew, the Lord gaue him growth of strength also: so that in his death hee became more victorious ouer Gods enemies than in all his life.</p>
