         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus long a slaue to Silence hast thou seru'de,</l>
      <l>Breake out (O Muse) into thy first assayes.</l>
      <l>Was therefore this mine infant verse reseru'de,</l>
      <l>In fatall darknesse to record thy prayse,</l>
      <l>O Witte diuine, that hast so well deseru'de</l>
      <l>The fruitfull garland of eternal Bayes?</l>
      <l>Then let thy Fame erect my drooping eies,</l>
      <l>And by thy praise begin my selfe to rise.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Let me while Eagle-wise thou mountes on height,</l>
      <l>Be as thy shade with lowly cariage,</l>
      <l>And whiles aboue thou spread'st with piercing flight</l>
      <l>Prowde <hi>Wolseys</hi> life; let me in humble rage</l>
      <l>Condemne the world below, that wanting light,</l>
      <l>See'th brightsome candles burne vpon her stage,</l>
      <l>Till vitall humor faileth to sustaine them,</l>
      <l>Yet (Niggard!) giues no matter to maintaine them.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>There was a time, when Laureats in their cell,</l>
      <l>Diuinely rauisht, wrate those tragicke playes,</l>
      <l>That after should in loftie <hi>Buskin</hi> swell;</l>
      <l>Whiles they with huge applause, and frolike bayes,</l>
      <l>(Their learn'de ambitious browes beseeming well)</l>
      <l>Sate prowdly tickled with the peoples prayse:</l>
      <l>And from th'indulgent <hi>Consuls</hi> wondring hand,</l>
      <l>Extort a rich reward, and Laurell band.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>It was the worldes first youth that ware the <hi>Socke,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>And wanton <hi>Myrtill</hi> ensigne of her sport,</l>
      <l>That had the force to moue a sencelesse blocke</l>
      <l>To gentle laughter, and by force extort</l>
      <l>Sweete teares of myrth, euen from the stubborne looke,</l>
      <l>Of men obdurate and vnfeeling sort:</l>
      <l>So sharpe and piercing were those wittes of olde:</l>
      <l>"No whetstone giue's a better edge than Golde.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <l>
         <hi>Uirgil</hi> that with his two-fold oaten reede,</l>
      <l>Then with his thrise-admired Cornet sings,</l>
      <l>Had great <hi>Augustus</hi> patron of his deede,</l>
      <l>And sweete <hi>Mecoenas</hi> sprung from grandsire Kings,</l>
      <l>Whiles he their names from death, they him from neede,</l>
      <l>With mutuall freedome one another brings:</l>
      <l>"Where Vertue doth for Learning honor frame,</l>
      <l>"There thankful Learning addes to Vertue fame.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Our age, an aged world, euen doating olde,</l>
      <l>That like a miser with a curelesse gowte,</l>
      <l>Hugges on those heapes that neuer may be tolde:</l>
      <l>So mong that greedie and promiscuous rowte,</l>
      <l>Ere one <hi>Mecoenas</hi> spread the salue of golde,</l>
      <l>Our bleare-eyde <hi>Horace's</hi> may looke them out:</l>
      <l>A speech long saide, but not perform'd before,</l>
      <l>That <hi>Homer</hi> and the Muses stand at doore.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Great patrons giue vs leaue their brasse to guilde,</l>
      <l>And from deserued graue dead names to rayse,</l>
      <l>Crowning <hi>Minerua</hi> for her speare and shielde</l>
      <l>With golden wreathe, her booke with only bayes,</l>
      <l>Because they thinke that fitter for the fielde,</l>
      <l>And men of learning well repaide with praise:</l>
      <l>They giue the spurre of praise, but adde the raine</l>
      <l>And curbe of want, to checke them backe againe.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And so with spurre of praise are Poets paide,</l>
      <l>Their muse, their labour and industrious art,</l>
      <l>That rightly spur-galled they may be sayde.</l>
      <l>But if in equall ballance of desart,</l>
      <l>Gentle vngentle, men with men were wayde,</l>
      <l>Not poizing men by birth, but by their partes:</l>
      <l>Their vertues of their minde, their witte and wordes,</l>
      <l>Kings were but Poets, Poets more then Lordes.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <l>And thou sweete <hi>Storer</hi> that in golden twine,</l>
      <l>Hast liuely portraide out our <hi>Cardinal,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Shewing the course of prouidence diuine,</l>
      <l>That lets high mounters catch the greater fall;</l>
      <l>Worthie was he to change for that of thine,</l>
      <l>And thou for thy desert his priestly pal:</l>
      <l>Thou his, for well employing of thy Muse,</l>
      <l>He thine, for his great fortunes great abuse.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>As if a second <hi>Nemroth</hi> came to reare</l>
      <l>Prowde <hi>Babel</hi> towers, that in their ruines lie,</l>
      <l>His buildings taught (as his ambition) were,</l>
      <l>To haue none end nor measure till the skie:</l>
      <l>Had <hi>Wolsey</hi> layde his first foundation there,</l>
      <l>And made his turrets spire to God on high,</l>
      <l>His name, himselfe, his vertuous deedes and all,</l>
      <l>Had not beene subiect to their hideous fall.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>O see how widdow-like (poore soule!) she standes,</l>
      <l>That college he began with curious frame,</l>
      <l>So left, (though not without demaine and landes)</l>
      <l>As bush or ensigne of her builders shame;</l>
      <l>Which though he rearde, with his ambitious handes,</l>
      <l>I dare not call him Founder of the same:</l>
      <l>How can he be of <hi>Christchurch</hi> Founder deemde,</l>
      <l>That of <hi>Christs church</hi> no member is esteemde?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And yet as though to recompence the fall</l>
      <l>And want of walles, that neuer were erect,</l>
      <l>See how the greatest Architect of al</l>
      <l>Rebuildes the same, and in a deare respect,</l>
      <l>Hath plac't a reuerend steward, that doth call,</l>
      <l>The painfull builders, and their worke direct:</l>
      <l>By whom true labors haue their due regard,</l>
      <l>And well-deseruing letters findes reward.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <l>And so the ruines that our house before,</l>
      <l>So deeply blemisht with defect of stones,</l>
      <l>Now farre more glorious, farre triumphant more,</l>
      <l>Is made by sweete supply of learned ones,</l>
      <l>That daily takes increase by daily store</l>
      <l>And carefull noursing of her toward sonnes,</l>
      <l>So flourish still, and still encrease thy fame,</l>
      <l>And make thy selfe by deede, thy selfe by name.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Among the <hi>Series</hi> of this learned traine,</l>
      <l>O <hi>Storer</hi> liue, and grace them with thy witte:</l>
      <l>Redeeme thy name, nor enuiously containe</l>
      <l>Thy thoughts, that with applause thou maist committe</l>
      <l>Vnto the presse; so thine admired vaine,</l>
      <l>Shall keepe thee from thy graue and darksome pitte:</l>
      <l>When (as thy <hi>Wolsey</hi>) volumes thou shalt frame,</l>
      <l>That shall (thou dead) immortalize thy name.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>May therefore this be propagated well,</l>
      <l>Then blesse posterity, and sow the seede,</l>
      <l>And vse thy sweeter Muse, that then shall smel</l>
      <l>Ful like a Rose, in midst of many a weede,</l>
      <l>And sound abroad thy praises as a bell,</l>
      <l>Vnto those posterne ages, that shall neede</l>
      <l>Another <hi>Storer,</hi> in their wanting times,</l>
      <l>To tell the worth of these thy piercing rimes.</l>
