   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE GENTLE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Enter now vpon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to proue a matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a maine streame (as it were) of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, exorbitant, and selfe conceited humors; which many hauing trauersed before me, some perhaps may thinke that I come to late, and offer my selfe to fight, when the fray is ended, and when others before me, haue borne the brunt of so fierce a battaile. It is the controuersie of Pan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nce (the very eye-soar of this our wanton age) that is to say, first sorrow and Contrition for our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, committed: secondly entire Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of them to our ghostly father: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="4" facs="3"/> due Satisfaction ioyned with priestly Absolution.</p>
   <p n="2">
      <hi>2.</hi> Intending therfore to treate of this so vnplausible a point, I will not suppose, that I shall haue euery ones voice to auer, or verdict to approue, what my pen shall put downe; For where there be so many Achabs, who will be sick for their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Naboths vineard: so many that will take bribes, with Giezy: so many that will speake for lucre and gaine, with Dame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius: so many that will fare so daintilie, with Diues: so many that will be but halfe perswaded, with Agrippa: so many that turne with time, like Damas: but most of all, so many that will haue their owne wills, like wicked Iezabell, and enlarge their consciēces like vnbeleeuing Atheists, to perswade and tell such as these of Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fession, and that they must kneele them downe at the feete of the Priest for Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, I doe not thinke but that euen S. Paul him selfe, (as eloquent, as he was) to auer and perswade the same in this our age, should finde enough to doe to driue
<pb n="5" facs="3"/> this doctrin into their heades. With how much lesse reason then may I hoise vp my sailes, with hope that a fauorable blast may blow on my cause, or looke for other beneuolence, then that malignant influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, which such planets yelde that beare a contrary aspect, but that rather many will suppose and censure of me, as Festus did of blessed S. Paul, that he spake madlie, and he knew not what.</p>
   <p n="3">
      <hi>3.</hi> Notwithstanding, sith this sacred do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which we sustaine is such, that it needeth not to shunne any sort of triall, my whole endeuour shall therfore be, to set no fairer glosse vpon this cause, then the very nakednes of truth it selfe shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; so that following euen the text of Christ him selfe, the sincere sence of his wordes and speeches, and that by the light of most vpright iudgments, by the direct pathe and rule of reason, by the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all times and ages, by the opinions of the most learned and grauest diuines that euer were, who nether affected flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie to please, nor fawning to deceiue,
<pb n="6" facs="4"/> euen the most turbulent in this point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (vnles he be too too much ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clowded with the thick mist of his owne opnion) shall haue such certaintie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion to stay vpon, as shall be fully suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for his satisfaction.</p>
   <p n="4">
      <hi>4.</hi> But here such as of long custome haue harboured sinne within their soule, with the repining Iewes, will make this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, saying. How can man forgiue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or claime vnto him a prerogatiue which is due to God? wherto we answer, that all the holy Sacraments of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion (especcially those which were more requisit and necessary for mans saluation) were not only plainly manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in the holie scripture, but also were shadowed in the law of nature, figured and specified in the law of Moises, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted and fulfilled in the law of grace; wherupon the people of the Iewes did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly beleeue, that their sacrifices and oblations were litle auaileable, except therunto were adioyned, penance, satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and confession of their sinnes. If
<pb n="7" facs="4"/> then, Confession were so necessary, and so dulie exacted by God him selfe in those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, euen before the diuulging of the gospell, as that therby transgressors were attoned and reconciled to God, what shal we thinke thereof in the law of grace, where it was not only confirmed, but with far more ample power, instituted &amp; commanded?</p>
   <p n="5">
      <hi>5.</hi> Againe, if these persons would but consider the wordes of Christ (Iohn 5.22.) where he telleth the Iewes, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iudgeth not any man, but that all iudgment is giuen to the Sonne, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, regard the wordes of Christ (Iohn 20.) where he telleth his Apostles, that as his Father sent him, so he sendeth them, and so surrendring ouer (as it were) his authoritie, he breathed into them the holy Ghost, it may easily appeare, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer deny the Apostles, and their successors the priestes of Gods church, to haue right or power to remit sinnes, doe with all deny consequently, that Christ as man, hath authoritie to doe the same. To make this
<pb n="8" facs="5"/> point the more plaine, was not S. Paul when he was called by Christ, sent to Ananias a man, to receiue as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, as the Sacraments of Gods church, for his incorporatiō with the faith full, and remission of his sinnes? Was not Cornelius, bid to goe to Peter a man, for the ministry of his reconciliation, though his prayers had bene heard before, and an Angell also sent vnto him? Where we see euidently although God might haue cured him extraordinarily, yet he would pūctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obserue his prefixed, determined, and ordinarie course, of working, attoning, and reconcyling by man.</p>
   <p n="6">
      <hi>6.</hi> Now therfore, as we vnderstand by diuine reuelation, that God the Father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>th giuen all iudgment to his Sonne, and that by him we must haue remission of all our sinnes, so that now whosoeuer should presume to pray to God alone, ommitting his only Sonne our B. Sauiour, shall not obtaine pardon, but breake the holy prcept of his wil, and the order which he hath appointed in his church: euen so, since
<pb n="9" facs="5"/> the time that our Sauiour hath giuen to his Apostles and their successors, full po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to forgiue sinnes, whosoeuer now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth remission of sinnes by Christ only, and not by Christs ordonance and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is by Christs priests and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of his church, in whom as S. Paul saith (2. Cor. 5.) he hath put the word of reconliation, shall no more obtaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his sinnes, by contemptuously reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the priestly function, and appealing only to Iesus Christ, then with the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes or Iewes, to seeke only to God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mediation of Iesus Christ, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the incarnation of our Lord and Sauiour</p>
   <p n="7">
      <hi>7.</hi> But we shall yet much better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the great necessitie of this holie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, if we reuiew former factes, and the ancient ages of the Catholique church (which in respect of this new fangled age, subiect to all sort of disorder and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish sensuallitie, might well be called, a golden age) where we may clearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould, the vse &amp; practise of Confession,
<pb n="10" facs="6"/> yea the ineffable benefit thereof, which in sundrie kindes hath so accorded all sortes of discordes, that in what contrie soeuer it hath bene abandoned, they haue forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with fallen into most miserable estate in matter of religion, yea most men amongst them haue become lesse virtuous then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, women lesse chast, children lesse obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and seruants lesse trustie: so that by this meanes, wickednes hath seemed euen to be full ripe, yea and honestie cleane exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the world.</p>
   <p n="8">
      <hi>8.</hi> Hence it proceeded (and marke it well deare Christian I hartily pray thee) that vnder Charles the fift, the Lutherans hauing shaken off this yoke of holie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and by this meanes, made earth a hell, and men diuells, the legates of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberge, seeing how needfull this bit was to be put into their wanton and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly iawes, besought his imperiall Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie. <hi>Vt iterum Confessionem impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio iure restituret.</hi> To set vp againe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them Confession, by virtu of his imperiall power. A ridiculous iest, that
<pb n="11" facs="6"/> what before they could not brooke, being commanded by the word of God, they would now for sooth entertaine being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by man. Yea our owne contrie of England, vntill now of late, euer enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this holie Sacrament. For albeit that in king Henrie the eight his time, the coale of disunion from the sea Apostolique was enkindled, and the fire of the kinges choller eagrely flaming, yet neuer suffered he the Sacrament of Penāce &amp; Confession, to loose his former reputation, nor yet the contrary faith once to harbour in his breast, but obserued it inuiolablie euen to his dying day.</p>
   <p n="9">
      <hi>9.</hi> Now then (deare Christian) let not this true, ancient, and Catholique faith concerning Confession, be blotted or spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with partiallities, notwithstanding, that our aduersaries haue inuēted a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of deuises to fill mens eares with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like thereof, and most maliciously spread abroadidle tales, false rumors, many taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and merry iestes to please the humor of the common people, especially the nicer sort,
<pb n="12" facs="7"/> who will admit of no gospellll, but where pleasure is mentioned in euery page: for certaine it is, that these late reformers haue forged a million of slanders against this Sacrament, and fashioned the concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of mens mindes in such sort, as that they haue made euery thinge sound to the vtter disgrace therof as far as they could; as, that the papists are nothing but clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of ignorance, their doctrine nothing but dust and cobwebbes of a corrupted age, their deuotions but grosse idolatrie, men seared with the badge of Antechrist, the horned beast, Masse-mongers, the whore of Babilon, the scarlet strumpet, and finally, that confessions, are flat hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisies and dissimulations. But alas they haue spent a great deale of their lamp-oile and labour in vaine, especially seeing at this day many of the milder and more iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious sort of Protestants, (as in many other pointes controuersed betwixt vs and them, so in this also of auricular Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) seeme now to be more fauourable then formerly they haue been; drawen on
<pb n="13" facs="7"/> perhaps by the example of his most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Maiestie, who in his royall confession of faith, speaketh more indifferently of most points in controuersie, then euer any Protestant hath done before him, since the very first beginning of Protestancie: and concerning this particular point of auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confession, by his deepe silence, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth tacitlie, to commend, rather then to condemne it, in his meditation made vpon the Pater noster: which as I willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes, hath not a litle encouraged me in the publishing of this present Treatise</p>
   <p n="10">
      <hi>10.</hi> And so (curteous Reader) turning my speeche againe to thee, I would entreat thee to sift the corners of thine owne hart without partiallity, examining whether it be force of reason, or vehemencie of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which feedeth the current of thine opinions. And if as hitherto thou hast bene deceiued thorough ignorance, and that by the reading of this Treatise, truth doth any way manifest it selfe vnto thee, seeke not to smother it with glosses, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till euasions. And because as in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="14" facs="8"/> of opinions, perhaps in higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, there is not leasure; invulgar sort oftentimes not the wit: and in many not the will to tread out such endles mazes, as the turbulency of many shittle heades, the affectation of singularitie, and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious contradiction, hath in this case led many into; it shall be mine endeuour as nere as I may, to lay downe such reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enducements, and in so short and briefe a sort, as to make a full remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance of this truth, a truth which hath not at any time bene buried in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, truth not vpstart and newly er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, a truth which hath the witnes of the ancient fathers, a truth maintained by holy councells, a truth still frequented and practised in the church, a truth which euer preuailed against the malice of time, or any that gain-said it, euer since the Apostles daies. And so I leaue thee (gentle Reader) to the further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruiew and triall of this truth, as God shall giue thee grace to conceiue the same; beseeching with that blessed S. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom.
<pb n="15" facs="8"/>
      <hi>Vt memor tribunalis Domini, &amp; de iudicio tuo, te intelligens iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candum, nec mihi, nec aduersario fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueas, neque personas loquentium, sed causam consideres.</hi> That mindfull of our Lords tribunall, and of thy iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vnderstanding thou art to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that thou nether fauor me, nor yet mine aduersarie, nor consider the person of the speaker, but the cause it selfe which is in question.</p>
