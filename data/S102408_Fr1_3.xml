                 <title>A friendly advertisement to the pretended Catholickes of Ireland : declaring, for their satisfaction; that both the Kings supremacie, and the faith whereof his Majestie is the defender, are consonant to the doctrine delivered in the holy Scriptures, and writings of the ancient fathers. And consequently, that the lawes and statutes enacted in that behalfe, are dutifully to be observed by all his Majesties subjects within that kingdome. By Christopher Sibthorp, Knight, one of his Maiesties iustices of his court of chiefe place in Ireland. In the end whereof, is added an epistle written to the author, by the Reverend Father in God, Iames Vssher Bishop of Meath: wherein it is further manifested, that the religion anciently professed in Ireland is, for substance, the same with that, which at this day is by publick authoritie established therein</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is cleere, and out of all question (noble Lords, and worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen) that the one side, namely, either the <hi>Protestants,</hi> or, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi> be, and must needs be, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily mistaken, and strongly <hi>delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>; whilst they be both so <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> and yet so <hi>contradictorie</hi> and repugnant in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <hi>Religions</hi> &amp; opinions: but where, and on which side, this <hi>strong Delusion</hi> is,<note place="margin">2. Thess. 2.11. <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath foretold long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and it will hereafter be more fully declared. In the meane time, some peradventure will take exception to this Work, for that it is not done by a <hi>professed Divine,</hi> but by one of another profession: Indeed, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that in respect of learning, and all other abilities, and conveniences, it might, by manie degrees, have beene much better performed by such a one, then by
<pb facs="5"/>
mee, who am the meanest of manie thousands. For which cause it was, that I sollicited, and that verie ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, a <hi>learned professed Divine</hi> of my acquaintance, to have undertaken the Worke; but <hi>Hee</hi> whom I thus requested, finding himselfe to be otherwise much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied and employed, had no leisure to intend it: by reason whereof, the burthen of it then returned and rested up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my weake selfe. Howbeit, as I presume nothing of my selfe (for neither is there anie cause I should) so neither doe I distrust or despaire of the strength of the Almightie: whose direction and assistance I therefore most humbly implore to enable mee, in this so weighty a businesse, wherein I am, otherwise, of my selfe, utterly unable, and altogether defective.</p>
   <p>Now then, howsoever it is granted, that it might have beene much better done by a learned <hi>professed Divine:</hi> yet thereupon it followeth not, that therefore it is either unlawfull or unbeseeming Mee, or a man of another profession, to intermeddle in it. For, <hi>first,</hi> it is well knowne that manie (with whom neverthelesse I neither doe, nor is it meet I should, compare my selfe) have written, and that verie commendably, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Divinitie,</hi> who were themselves no professed <hi>Divines. Secondly,</hi> I must crave leave to say, that I find not <hi>Popery,</hi> how subtill or sophisticall soever it be, to be of anie such puissance, but that a man of meane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, armed with the strength of the <hi>divine Scriptures,</hi> may easily ruinate and overturne it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> those that oppugne the <hi>Religion,</hi> &amp; <hi>His Majesties Supremacie,</hi> what doe they else but oppugne therewithall (as they must needs, at least inclusively) the <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> whereby they are both established? And what reason then, can bee shewed, why hee that is a
<pb facs="5"/>
Lawyer by profession, may not defend and maintaine the Lawes and Statutes of the Realme, in those two great points especially, wherein they be so unjustly and causelessely oppugned? But when I consider my selfe further to be a <hi>servant</hi> (though unworthy) to his most excellent Majestie, and that in so high and eminent a Court as His Maiesties Bench is; beside my professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the duetie of my place also tyeth mee to defend his Maiesties Supremacie, as being a thing properly app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning to his verie <hi>Crowne</hi> and <hi>Regall dignitie.</hi> And doth not, moreover, the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, which I have taken, necessarily binde mee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? Yea even for this verie cause, that I am a subiect to his Maiestie, though there were no other reason, doe I hold my selfe in duetie, tyed, to my power, to uphold and maintain that his Regall Supremacie. For if everie good childe will maintaine the right and Authoritie of his Father, and everie good servant the right and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of his Lord and Master, ought not everie good subiect to maintaine the right and Authoritie of his Soveraigne Lord and King? And as touching the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> if there were no other reason but this, that I am a Christian by <hi>profession</hi> (though no <hi>professed Divine</hi>) doe I hold it for that verie cause, not onely well besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming mee, but my duetie likewise, according to such measure of knowledge and abilitie as God hath given mee, to defend and maintaine the true and Christian Religion I professe, against that which is untruly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Christian and Catholike, and is, indeed the false, erroneous, and Antichristian. For whereas some have a conceit, that not Lay men at all, but Clergie men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and such as be of the Ecclesiastical Ministerie, should meddle with the Scriptures, and matters of Religion, it
<pb facs="6"/>
appeareth to be a verie vaine conceit, and an untrue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion: because S. <hi>Paul</hi> directly requireth, even of Lay Christians (as well as of others) that the <hi>Word of Christ should Dwell in them,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Coloss. 3.16.</note> and that not poorely, or in a small or slender measure, but <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, that is, <hi>richly, plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Primas. in hunc locum. Heb. 5.12. Heb. 3.13. Rom. 15.14. 1. Thess. 5 11.</note> or <hi>abundantly.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Primasius</hi> saith, that, <hi>Hence wee learne, that the Lay people ought to have the knowledge of the Scriptures, and to teach one another, not onely sufficiently, but also abundantly.</hi> And therefore are they further expressely charged, to <hi>admonish, exhort, and edifie one another:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iude vers. 3.</note> yea, to <hi>contend,</hi> and not onely to <hi>contend,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>earnestly to contend for that faith which was once given unto the Saints.</hi> And doth not God himselfe also command thus? <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Levit. 19.17.</note> but <hi>Thou shalt in anie wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sinne to be upon him.</hi> Agreeably wherunto, would not S. <hi>Iames</hi> likewise have all Christians to labour the conversion of such as be in error, and goe astray? telling them for their better encouragement in this matter, that, <hi>if any doe erre from the truth,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iam. 5.19, 20.</note>
      <hi>and another convert him, let such a one know, that he which converteth a sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soule from death, and cover a multitude of sinnes.</hi> You see then what duties, in respect of the good of others, as well as of himselfe, be required even of a lay person, in matters concerning God and his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And indeede, verie strange it were, if lay Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should be tyed in charitie to take care of mens bodies, and yet should in no sort be permitted to have anie care, or to shew anie Christian charitie or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in respect of their soules, and the good and safetie of them. It is true, that no man may take upon him the office and function of Bishops, Pastors, or other
<pb facs="6"/>
Ministers of the Word, without a lawfull calling or ordination first had and obtayned: but although a lay man may not therfore preach, minister the sacraments, nor do anie such acts as be proper and peculiar to those that be Ecclesiasticall Ministers, yet in such things as be not proper and peculiar unto them, but be acts and duties common with them, to other Christians, a Lay man may lawfully intermeddle. It is likewise true, that the knowledge of Gods Word (and consequently of Divinitie) doth in a more exact, and more plentiful, and fuller maner and measure, and chiefly, belong to those that be professed Divines and of the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Ministery: but thereupon it followeth not, that therefore it belongeth <hi>onely</hi> to them. As also, although those of the Ecclesiasticall Ministery, are to teach and instruct the Lay people out of the Scriptures, and that the Lay people are to learne what they rightly teach from thence: yet neither doth it thereupon follow, nor is that anie argument, or impediment, but that the Lay people may neverthelesse reade, and get knowledge in the Scriptures, and thereout learne what good they can also, even by their owne <hi>industry, diligence,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour.</hi> We reade of <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> his wife, that they were by their Trade, <hi>Tentmakers:</hi> and that <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> was a man <hi>eloquent and mightie in the Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>
      </hi>▪ yet so skilfull, learned &amp; expert were those two,<note place="margin">Act. 18.2, 3.24, 25, 26.</note> name<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ly, not onely <hi>Aquila,</hi> but <hi>Priscilla</hi> also his wife, in the Word of God, as that they tooke unto them the same <hi>Apollos,</hi> and expounded unto him <hi>The Way of God more perfectly.</hi> All men know, that Kings, Princes, and such like civill Magistrates, be none of that Order of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Ministery, and yet of them it is specially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that they reade the Scriptures &amp; Book of God,
<pb facs="7"/>
and that they be verie diligent and conversant in it. For God expressely requireth of a King,<note place="margin">Deut. 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> that, <hi>When hee shall sit upon the Throne of his Kingdome, He get him the Book of his Law,</hi> and chargeth him to <hi>reade therein, all the Dayes of his Life, that he may learne to feare the Lord his God, and to Keepe All his Words and ordinances, not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from them, eyther to the right hand or to the left: That so he may prolong his Dayes in his Kingdome, Hee and his Sonnes after him.</hi> And to <hi>Iosuah,</hi> a civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

      <note place="margin">Iosh. 1.8.</note>
      <hi>for then shalt thou make thy Way prosperous, and then shalt thou have good successe.</hi> Was not the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer to <hi>Candace</hi> (Queene of the Ethiopians) also a Lay man,<note place="margin">Act. 8.27, 28, 29, 30. &amp;c.</note> and not of the Order of the Ecclesiasticall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie? and yet did he reade <hi>Esaias</hi> the Prophet, (which is a part of the holy Scriptures) as hee was returning homeward, and sitting in his Chariot, and was in no sort reproved for the same, but well allowed therein, and had a blessing therupon sent unto him from God. Is it not likewise recorded of those noble Christians at <hi>Berea,</hi> to their great honour, that they <hi>received the Word of God with all readinesse of minde,</hi>

Wherein there is no cause to feare those proverbes, of, <hi>Ne sutor ultra crepidam,</hi> and, <hi>Tractant fabrilia fabri,</hi> and
<pb facs="9"/>
such like, which cannot here be rightly used or appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: because the knowledge of God, and of his Word and Religion, is not like the case of other arts, sciences, trades, and occupations in the world, but is a thing to be learned and professed by all sorts of people, of what worldly calling or profession soever they be, as now I trust you sufficiently perceive.</p>
   <p>But consider yet further, by the controversies that are betweene the Protestants and the Papists, how much even the learned professed Divines themselves, be divided in opinions: In this case, what shall we doe that be Lay-men? shall wee bee of no religion, untill these be agreed? But when will that be? or, what if in the <hi>interim,</hi> anie of us in such a case should die? were it not extreamely perillous? or, shall a man at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, betake himselfe to one of the two Religions, not caring, or, not knowing whether it be right or wrong which he betaketh himselfe unto? were not that over-great levitie, a blinde resolution, and a strange inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate rashnesse? Yea, doe we not all say and hold, that <hi>extra veram Ecclesiam non est salus, out of the true Church there is no salvation?</hi> There is then (so farre as I perceive) a direct necessitie laid upon as manie of us as be able to make search, not onely to search, but to finde out also, whether of these be the true Teachers, and which is the right faith, and the true Church, and to ioyne our selves thereunto. For which purpose, ought wee not studiously and diligently to reade and revolve the Scriptures? For is there anie other sure rule of truth, beside them? or, anie other infallible or better Iudge, for the deciding of these controversies, then God himselfe, speaking unto us in those his sacred and divine Writings? But to take away all doubts, let it be
<pb facs="9"/>
examined; Would anie then have the Church to be the Iudge? Why the Church it selfe is the thing that is chiefly in question: the grand and principall Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion betweene the Protestants and the Papists, being, Whether of them is the true Church: and when the Church it selfe is in question, she is not to iudge, but to be iudged, as even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> also himselfe declareth.<note place="margin">Bellar. de no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>. Eccl. cap. 2.</note> Or, would anie have Councils to be this Iudge? God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Councils that be assembled in the name of Christ, and aime onely at truth, and that have the Word of God onely for their rule and direction, be, I confesse, much to be honoured and respected: but Councils, at all times follow not, nor doe according to that rule; whereupon it commeth to passe, that they sometimes erre and goe astray, and consequently cannot be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Iudges. For, first, it is granted aswell by Papists, as by Protestants, that Provinciall Councils may erre, even in matters of faith: and why then may not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councils also possibly erre in matters of faith sometimes? For is not the holy Ghost, the spirit of truth, (if he so please) as well able to keepe a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Councill at all times, from erring, as a generall? What then is the difference? or wherein doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist? Will anie say, it consisteth in this, that in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councill there is a greater number or multitude, then is in a Provinciall? But truth goeth not alwayes by multitudes, or the greatest number, but is somtimes found in the lesser number, and in few against manie, as in times past it was found in one <hi>Michaiah,</hi> against foure hundreth. For which cause it is also written:<note place="margin">1. King. 22.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, &amp;c</note>
      <hi>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to doe evill, nor agree in a controversie, to decline after manie,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Exod. 23.2.</note>
      <hi>to overthrow the truth.</hi> Neyther indeed do the Popish Teachers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb facs="10"/>
hold, the reason of their supposed <hi>non-errabilitie</hi> of general Councils, to be, because of the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or multitude, but because of the promise of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost made unto them: which holy Ghost they neverthelesse cannot denie to be promised aswell to a Provinciall as to a generall Councell: yea, <hi>Where</hi> but <hi>Two or Three be gathered together in my Name</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>there am I in the midst of them.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Matt. 18 20.</note> Seeing then it is granted that a Provinciall Councill may erre, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this promise of the holy Ghost, it must be granted, that a generall Councill may sometime also erre, by the same reason that a Provinciall may, notwithstanding that promise. For as touching the reason that some bring, that if a general Councill may erre then the whole Church may erre &amp; faile in faith; it is no consequent: inasmuch as all the Bishops and Pastors within Christendome (without exception) be not alwayes present at a generall Councill, much lesse be all the faithfull throughout the whole world there present: and therefore also doth even <hi>Panormitan</hi> himselfe reiect that reason and inference, as frivolous; <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>though a generall Councill represent the whole universall Church, yet, to speake truth, the universall Church is not there precisely,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Panor de elect. &amp; electi pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state ¶ signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casti.</note>
      <hi>but by representation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the universall Church consisteth of All the Faithful; and this</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the Church which cannot erre. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, it is not un-possible that the true faith of Christ may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in one person onely: therefore the Church is said, not to faile, or, not to erre, if the true faith remaine in anie one.</hi> And thus saith <hi>Pighius</hi> also,<note place="margin">Pigh hierar. Ecclesiast lib. 6. cap 5. &amp; 4.</note> though an Arch-Papist; <hi>Certum est, Concilia non esse universalem Ecclesiam: it is a thing certaine, that Councils be not the vvhole, or, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Church.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 7.</note> Where he further affirmeth those two
<pb facs="10"/>
Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> to have erred, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they were generall Councils. Yea this is so cleere a case with him, that Generall Councills may erre, even in matter of Faith, that hee saith againe most directly and expressely, thus:<note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 13.</note>
      <hi>In fidei definitioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, errasse etiam universalia sanctorum Patrum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia comperimus. Testimonio sunt de universalibus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilijs, imprimis Ariminense, Vniversale haud dubie, &amp;c. Insuper Ephesinum secundum, &amp; ipsum Vniversale, &amp;c. Testimonio, inquam, haec sunt, errare posse etiam univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salia Concilia, etiam legitimè congregata. We finde that even generall Councils, of holy Fathers, have erred in their decrees or determinations of matters of faith. Witnesse hereof concerning generall Councils, is especially the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of Arimine, a generall Councill without doubt, &amp;c. And moreover, the second Ephesine Councill, which was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a generall Councill, &amp;c. These, I say be Witnesses, that even generall Councils may erre, though they be never so lawfully assembled.</hi> For, although most true it is, that the holy Ghost cannot possibly erre, and that the same holy Ghost is promised and given to godly Councills, as likewise he is to everie godly man &amp; faithfull mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christ: yet it pleaseth the holy Ghost, not to extend and shew forth his vigor, force, and power at all times, but sometimes to withhold it, and so to leave men to themselves: in which case it is then, a verie ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie matter, for Councils either Generall or Provinciall, as also for anie other godly man, or particular member of Christ, to erre, sinne, or goe astray; neither is it Gods Spirit which doth disagree from his Word. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, whosoever teacheth anie thing concerning Faith and Religion, not according to Gods Word, but out of his owne braine and fancie, must be supposed,
<pb facs="11"/>
to speake, not by <hi>Gods spirit</hi> (whatsoever he pretendeth) <hi>but by his owne,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Chrysost de sancto &amp; ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando Spiritu.</note> as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> also informeth us. Wherefore, in vaine it is, for men, or, Councils, to say, they be undoubtedly guided by the holy Ghost, the spirit of truth, unlesse they have the Word of truth, for their rule and direction, and can so prove the spirit, whereby they speake and decree, to be Gods Spirit, and not their owne. But againe, yee know, that in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills (aswell Generall as Provinciall) things be caryed and over-ruled by the <hi>most Voyces:</hi> and where things be so caried and ruled by the greater number of voyces, there it is experimentally found to be a thing verie ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily possible, for the most voyces or greater number, sometimes to over-rule the better part, being the lesser. and consequently, Councils, whether generall or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, because they may sometime possibly erre, can not be held for anie absolute and infallible Iudge, or, infallible rule of truth, in these controversies.</p>
   <p>Or, would anie think the Bish. &amp; Pope of Rome to be an infallible Iudge? Why in the glosse upon the Popes owne Law, that opinion also is reiected, saying thus: <hi>Quaero de qua Ecclesia,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Caus 24. quest. 1. § à recta in gloss, ¶ Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus.</note>
      <hi>intelligas, quod hic dicitur, quod non possit errare? Si de ipso Papa, certum est quod Papa errare potest. Respondeo: Ipsa congregatio Fidelium, hic dicitur Ecclesia. I demand of what Church it is meant, when it is said, as here, That the Church cannot erre? If of the Pope himselfe, it is certaine he may erre. I therefore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that the whole company of the Faithful is here meant by the Church.</hi> Where, beside that you see what Church it is that cannot erre, you see it directly affirmed, that <hi>certum est quod Papa errare potest:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gers in tract. an liceat in causa fidei, a Pontifice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellare.</note>

      <hi>ut ei tribuere hoc velit, ut nec errare possit. I doe not beleeve that any man is such an impudent flatterer of the Pope, as to attribute this unto him, that he cannot erre.</hi> Which words were in his first edition, but are not now in the last: but yet even in his new copies, although he quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his termes, he holdeth the same opinion, verie direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, saying: <hi>Omnis homo errare potest in fide,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Alfons lib. 1. cap. 4.</note>
      <hi>etiamsi Papa sit: Every man may erre in faith, yea even the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</hi> And againe he saith: that, <hi>Papa in fide errare po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, ut melius sentientes tenent,</hi>

      <hi>etiam ex hijs qui Papatui plurimùm favent: inter quos est Innocentius ejus nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis quartus, in cap. 1. de Summa Trinitate: The Pope may erre in matter of faith, as the better opinion is, even of them that favour the Papacie most of all: amongst whom is Pope Innocentíus the fourth of that name, writing upon the first chapter De Summa Trinitate.</hi> Well therefore doth <hi>Erasmus</hi> also, confute this new conceit &amp; strange opinion. For, <hi>If it be true</hi> (saith he) <hi>which some say,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Erasm. annot. in 1. Cor. ex cap. 7.</note>
      <hi>that the Bishop of Rome can never erre, Iudicially: vvhat neede is there then of Generall Councils? Why are men skilfull in the Lawes, and learned in Divinitie; sent for to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, if he, in his speakings, cannot erre? To what purpose be so manie Vniversities troubled with handling Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of faith, when thc truth may be had from his mouth? Yea, how commeth it to passe, that the Decrees of one Pope be repugnant to the Decrees of another?</hi> What Wresters of Scripture then, do some Papists in these later times, here appeare to be, that abuse it to give an infallibilitie of judgement, and an immunitie or priviledge from
<pb facs="12"/>
error, to the Pope of Rome? <hi>Arboreus,</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Paris,</hi> and one not of the meanest <hi>Sorbonists,</hi> confesseth likewise and teacheth this truth, saying: <hi>Papa in fide er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare potest:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Arboreus, in Theosoph. li. 4. cap. 32.</note>
      <hi>Et tota mihi aberrare via videtur qui aliter sentit. Assentantur sanè Romano Pontifici, qui faciunt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um immunem à lapsu haereseos &amp; schismatis. The Pope may erre in faith: And he seemeth to mee to be in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame error that thinketh otherwise. Surely, they doe but flatter the Bishop of Rome, that make him free from falling into heresie and schisme.</hi> And how can it in reason be otherwise? For if Provinciall Councils (wherein be manie Bishops) may erre in matter of Faith (which is a thing that the Popish Writers themselves do grant): yea, if Generall Councils may possibly erre in matter of Faith (which is also a thing confessed by some of the Popish Divines, and cannot iustly be denied by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie) is there anie likelyhood that any one Bishop, singly considered by himselfe, should be so priviledged, as that he could not possibly erre? Yea, even a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, namely the Councill of <hi>Basil,</hi> saith: <hi>Saepe experti sumus &amp; legimus Papam errasse: Wee have often found it by experience,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Concil. Basil. epist. Synodal. 3. de authorit. Consil. supra Papam.</note>
      <hi>and know it also by reading, that the Pope hath erred.</hi> And againe they say: <hi>Cum certum sit Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam errare posse. Forasmuch as it is a thing certaine, that the Pope may erre.</hi> Whereupon it must be concluded, that therefore the Pope also cannot be held for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errable, or infallible Iudge.</p>
   <p>Shall then the ancient Fathers, be this Iudge? They are, I grant, in all respects, to have that due reverence that belongeth to them: but themselves will by no meanes assume that high honour to themselves, to be infallible Iudges, or such as cannot possibly erre. Yea, they acknowledge that they may erre, and therefore
<pb facs="12"/>
would have no man further to beleeve them, then there is warrant for what they write and speake, in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scriptures. <hi>I cannot denie</hi> (saith S. <hi>Augustine) but that there be many things in my Workes,</hi>

      <note place="margin">Aug cont. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scon. lib. 2. c 32.</note>
      <hi>but weigh them by the Canonicall Scriptures: and that, in them, which agreeth with the Canonicall Scriptures, I allow to his praise; but that which agreeth not, by his favour I refuse.</hi> Againe he saith:<note place="margin">Aug Epist. 112. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

And therefore <hi>Turrecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata</hi> also saith thus:<note place="margin">Turrcer. in C. Sanct Rom. d. 15. n 12.</note>
      <hi>The Writings of the Doctors are to be received vvith reverence; yet they binde us not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them in all their opinions, but wee may lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them, vvhere by good reason it appeareth that they speake against the Scripture, or the truth.</hi> And thus also speaketh <hi>Marsilius:</hi>

      <hi>by so much there should be the lesse perfect knowledge of the mysteries of faith therein: because after the Apostles time, there were not the most learned men in the Church, which had dexteritie in understanding and expounding the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith. We are not therefore involved in the more darkenesse, by how much the more, in respect of time, vve be distant from them: but rather the Doctors of these later times, being godly and insisting in the steps of the ancient Fathers, have attained more expresse understanding in some things then they had: for, these, be like children stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the shoulders of Giants, vvho being lifted up by the tallnesse of the Giants, no marvaile though they see fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they.</hi> Seeing then the ancient Fathers have erred, and may erre, even in the opinion of Papists as well as of Protestants, it must be concluded, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they also cannot be this infallible Iudge.</p>
   <p>What then? May-Traditions not written, or not specified in the sacred Scriptures, alledged to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall, be held to be anie infallible Iudge, or anie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rule of Faith? I answer, no. For, first, how can a man be assured that those Traditions be Apostolical, which be alledged and affirmed so to be, when he seeth no proofe or evidence for them, in anie of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb facs="15"/>
of the Apostles, or in anie of the sacred and cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Scriptures? If you say, that some of the ancient Fathers do testifie them to be Apostolicall: That is no sufficient proofe, that therefore they came originally, and assuredly from the Apostles: because even those ancient Fathers themselves, taking them upon report of others, might possibly be deceived: And so pretious is mens faith, and so deare unto them, is, and ought to be, the salvation of their soules, as that, in those regards, no Authoritie or testimonie of men, without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and testimonie of God therewith concurring, can give them an undoubted or assured satisfaction. For our Faith is not to be builded upon the credite, Authoritie, or testimonie of men, but upon the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and Authoritie of God himselfe. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> in <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Euseb lib. 5. cap. 20.</note> declareth what maner of Traditions, those were which <hi>Polycarpus</hi> delivered, and said, he had heard and received, from the Apostles, and testifieth of them, that they were <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>all conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Scriptures.</hi> Traditions of this sort, namely which be consonant and agreeable to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we refuse not, but willingly embrace: but such Traditions as be dissonant and repugnant to those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, there is ever iust reason to refuse: or, if they be not thereby warranted, none is necessarily tyed or bound to beleeve them to be undoubtedly divine and Apostolicall. It was not therefore without good cause,<note place="margin">Coloss. 2.8. 2.

      <hi>Eusebius</hi> sheweth in <hi>Papias,</hi> who was himselfe so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb facs="15"/>
under the name and supposition of Apostolicall Traditions, and thereby also occasioned others to be deceived. This <hi>Papias</hi> was schollar to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostle, &amp; schoole-fellow to <hi>Polycarpus</hi> before mentioned, and for the credit of his Traditions, said thus: <hi>I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with them that make mention of strange precepts and commandements, but in them that teach those things that be true, and bring such things as are delivered by the Lord to our fidelitie, and came from the truth it selfe. So vvhen anie came that was a Disciple of the Elders, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the vvords of the Elders; What, Andrew, What, Philip, What, Thomas, or anie other of the Disciples of the Lord</hi> said: and he saith moreover, that hee laid up all those things well in his remembrance. Howbeit (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this his care, diligence, and vigilancie about Apostolicall Traditions) he brought in (as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> saith) sundry <hi>paradoxes, and strange opinions, and such as vvere full of fables,</hi> amongst which was the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liastick</hi> opinion. Yea, this great liking and affection to unwritten Traditions, deceived not onely <hi>Papias,</hi> but (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> witnesseth) it gave occasion of the <hi>Chilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick</hi> error unto divers Ecclesiasticall persons also after him. And he addeth the reason: because, saith he, <hi>they pretended the antiquitie of that man. Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi> also was much addicted to unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therewith likewise much deceived: affirming and teaching, by reason therof, verie erroneous, strange, and untrue opinions: as namely,<note place="margin">Clem. Strom. lib. 1. &amp; 6.</note> that <hi>Philosophy</hi> did in times past, <hi>justifie</hi> or <hi>save the Greekes:</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> preached <hi>onely one yeare:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Clem Strom. lib. 2.</note> that the <hi>Apostles</hi> after <hi>their death preached unto the dead, which</hi> with the Apostles <hi>descended into the vvater, and being made alive,</hi>

neither before the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor yet before the <hi>Saints:</hi> and sundry other errors. Yea he there further mentioneth a certaine kinde of <hi>Gnostici,</hi> of whom hee delivereth this description,<note place="margin">Lib. 6.</note> saying: that <hi>the knowledge which maketh a true Gnostick, is that which commeth by succession unto few from the Apostles, and is delivered vvithout vvriting &amp;c.</hi> Where may appeare, whence the heresie of the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> (which was afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Church) did spring and had his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, namely out of unwritten Traditions supposed to be Apostolicall. Yea, sundry other Hereticks also, boasted of their doctrines and opinions,<note place="margin">Clem. Strom. lib. 7.</note> as if they had received them by tradition from the Apostles. For <hi>Valentinus</hi> alledged himselfe to be schollar to <hi>Theodatus,</hi> who was familiarly acquainted with S. <hi>Paul:</hi> The <hi>Marcionites</hi> boasted, that they had the Disciples of <hi>Matthias,</hi> to their Master,<note place="margin">Euseb. lib. 5. cap. 28.</note> and taught the doctrine by them delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Artemon</hi> likewise boasted of his doctrine, as if it had come unto him undoubtedly by tradition Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall: But <hi>Eusebius,</hi> for all that, sheweth that it was not so. Excellent therefore, and ever memorable, is that speech of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> touching this point, where hee granteth, that <hi>The Apostles did, indeed,</hi> at the first, <hi>preach the Gospel,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iren. lib. 3. ca. 1.</note>
      <hi>by vvord of mouth, but afterward</hi> (saith hee) <hi>by the vvill of God, they delivered it in vvriting, that</hi> so being committed to writing, it might be for ever after that, <hi>the foundation and pillar of our faith.</hi> So that now, and ever since that time,<note place="margin">Hieronym. in Matth. 23.</note> wee must hold as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> also teacheth and holdeth, saying thus: <hi>That which hath no Authoritie of the holy Scriptures, is as easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned as allowed.</hi> And againe hee saith directly, that <hi>such things as men invent and devise of themselves,</hi>

Yea as touching all points necessarie to salvation, the holy Scriptures themselves be abundantly sufficient: so that, for that purpose, there is no need of anie unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Traditions, as even the ancient Fathers themselves doe also testifie.<note place="margin">Athan. contra gentes.

      <hi>and more then sufficient for all matters.</hi> What need then is there of anie more speech in a matter so cleere and evident? Concerning this point therefore, Inasmuch as it is verie apparant, that some errors &amp; heresies have arisen out of Traditions, said and supposed to be Apostolical, and that under that pretence and name, sundry men in ancient and former times have beene deceived, and may now, much more, by that meanes, in these later times (so farre remote from the times of the Apostles) possibly be deceived: it must be concluded, that Traditions Apostolicall (as they be called) not warranted nor specified in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Scriptures, cannot be held for anie infallible Iudge, or, infallible rule of truth, in this case.</p>
   <p>Seeing then, the Church, who is her selfe in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may not be the Iudge, but must be iudged of, and that by the Scriptures: for in such a case where the Church it selfe is in question, even by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> own acknowledgement,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Or (which commeth all to one ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) if we will have visible and mortall men to be the
<pb facs="17"/>
Iudges, The infallible Rule, whereby they are to iudge, and to be directed, appeareth to be the verie same sacred and canonicall Scriptures, wherein God speaketh. And this also doe the ancient Fathers themselves, yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly teach and affirme: For S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith; <hi>The Scripture pitcheth downe the Rule of our Faith.</hi>

Neither is this anie disorderly, immodest, or unseemely course (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Rhemists or other Papists say to the contrarie) but verie requisite and necessarie, as you see, in this case especially, where the learned professed Divines them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be at such variance: Yea, it is a thing not onely permitted and allowed, but commended and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also in Gods owne Booke.

(and that daily) thereby to <hi>trie</hi> and <hi>judge, whether those things were so or no,</hi> which their Preachers &amp; Teachers had taught &amp; delivered unto them, &amp; be, for the same, so highly commended by the holy Ghost; Shall anie be so unadvised, rash, or presumptuous, as to say or thinke it to be, either unlawful or unlaudable for them that be learners and hearers, so to doe? Is not all the immodestie, pride, &amp; arrogancie in them rather, which will not suffer or allow their Doctrines to be thus try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and examined by the Scriptures, but (as if they were Lords over mens faith) will have men to beleeve them,<note place="margin">2.

For, the securitie of our faith ariseth from the demonstration of the holy Scripture.</hi> Here then you plentifully perceive, that even lay persons are to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>discerne</hi> of the Doctrines of men, although not by anie private spirit of their owne, yet by that divine Spirit that speaketh in the holy Scriptures, the onely infallible rule of true Religion: the voice and iudgement of which divine Spirit there speaking, we ought to obey and yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Let not therefore anie reason drawne from possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of errors or heresies, which men may fall into, by misunderstanding of the Scriptures, &amp; taking them in a wrong sense, alienate you from reading of them: for if this should passe currant, and be held for a good and sufficient reason, then neither should Clergie-men, or, Ecclesiasticall Ministers be permitted to reade the Scriptures, because there is a possibilitie for them also, in the reading of them, to misunderstand them, and to
<pb facs="19"/>
take them in a wrong sense, and so to fall into errors or heresies, as we see indeed, that some of them heretofore have done, and still doe. And as for the obiection of <hi>difficultie</hi> or <hi>obscuritie</hi> in the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Chrysost Hom. 3. in Laz.</note> S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath answered it long agone, saying: that <hi>therefore God penned the Scriptures, by the hands of Publicanes, Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Tentmakers, Sheepheards, Neatheards, and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, that none of the simple people might have anie excuse to keepe them from reading them: and that so they might be easie to be understood of all men; the Artificer, the housholder, the vviddow-woman, and him that is most unlearned.</hi> And further hee saith: that, <hi>the Scripture when it speaketh anie thing obscurely,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Chrysost Hom. 9. in 2. cor.</note>
      <hi>expoundeth it selfe in another place.</hi> And so also saith S. <hi>Augustine:</hi> that▪ <hi>there is almost nothing in these Obscurities,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Aug de doct. christ. lib. 2. cap. 6.</note>
      <hi>but in other places a man may finde it plainly delivered.</hi> In like sort speaketh S. <hi>Hierome,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Hieronym. com in Esai· c. 19.</note> saying: <hi>It is the maner of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, after things obscure, to set downe things manifest, and that which they have first spoken in parables, to deliver afterward in plainer termes.</hi> And so testifieth S. <hi>Basil</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so:<note place="margin">Basil.

As likewise the name of <hi>Papists</hi> is not verie ancient, as being also of later times given by their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries unto them (for that they depend so much upon the Pope▪ &amp; his doctrine, decrees, &amp; designes): yet do the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists neverthelesse hold, the faith and religion which they professe to be verie ancient, yea the most ancient, and the Apostolick, Catholick, and Christian. Howbeit, both these Religions (they being so repugnant &amp; contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one to the other) cannot be right, but one of them must needs be wrong, and that is Poperie, as this Booke declareth: That which wee meane and comprehend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Poperie, being nothing else but the errors, heresies, and corruptions which the Church of Rome holdeth, and be accrued and growen unto it, since the first institution and planting of it by the Apostles. For what the Church of Rome rightly holdeth or beleeveth, the Protestants impugne not, nor have cause to impugne,
<pb facs="20"/>
but they onely impugne her errors, heresies, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As for the terme of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> which Papists have put upon themselves, their calling themselves so, doth not therfore prove them to be so: for the <hi>Arrians</hi> in times past, likewise called themselves Catholicks, who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse not so, but Hereticks in verie deed. But as we dislike not, but well approve of that name of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> when it is rightly used and applyed, and given to those to whom it properly belongeth: so doe wee preferre the name of <hi>Christians,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 11.26.</note> before it, as being indeed the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and the more honourable name, it being derived from Christ himselfe, the Head of his Church, and the Author of the Christian religion. Who be the right Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, and the true-Christians, &amp; who not, yea, which be the Christian, and which be the un-Christian, and which be the Antichristian people, doth afterward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that so every man may know, what name doth rightly &amp; properly belong unto him, and may ranke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his due place. For whosoever knoweth Antichrist well, wil abhorre &amp; detest him, and will love, honour, and adhere unto Christ &amp; the puritie of his religion, so much the more. If then the Pope of Rome shall here appeare unto you to be (as hee is) the grand Antichrist foretold in the Scriptures, I doubt not but you wil speedily renounce him, &amp; his Antichristian Supremacie, &amp; his Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, together with all his seducing and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Teachers, and wicked and Antichristian courses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church of God. For no true-Christians ought, nor will, give anie better respect to Antichrist, especially after that they once know him &amp; have him discovered &amp; manifested unto them. God therefore open &amp; reveale his truth, more &amp; more unto us all, and incline all our hearts and affections to embrace it, &amp; evermore to walke in the wayes of it. AMEN.</p>
