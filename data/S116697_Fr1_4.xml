   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, thou shalt see in this Booke greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of remarkeable accidents, then, before the reading of it, thou couldest haue possibly imagined. The state of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion quite altered, in diuers Kingdomes and Countreys of Christendome; the <hi>Grandies</hi> sometimes diuided and armed one against another, sometimes ioyned in confederations and leagues; the <hi>Ecclesiastikes</hi> oppressed; the <hi>Protestants</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted; the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it were, acting their parts, and most liuely deciphered in their naturall colours. If learning will content thee, marke the disputations of the Theologues, and the deepe discourses of the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. If policie will please thee, thou shalt finde it in the consultations and treaties of Princes, managed, with admirable dexterity, by their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors and Ministers; and generally no delight will bee wanting to thee, which thy curiositie can desire, or any other Historie affoord. But consider, aboue all, in what a strange manner the Conciliarie Acts of this assembly in <hi>Trent</hi> were caried. By reading of those few words of thy Countrey-man <hi>Edmond Campian,</hi> below in this page, thou maist perceiue in what repute the Papalins doe hold it; and after, when thou hast read the Booke, thou wilt know how much it is ouer-valued. Compare thy iudicious censure with his that is partiall, and thou shalt finde them to agree as white with blackenesse, darkenesse with light. Farewell.</p>
