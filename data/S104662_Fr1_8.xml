   <p>FOr that the common people do fall into suche a numbre of errours as touching the length of the day, holding an opiniō that in euery .15. dayes, the day is an houre longer or shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the truth is this: the day dothe keepe no suche proportion in the lengthening and shorting, but dothe length and shorte according vnto the swiftnesse and the slownesse of the sunnes declination, for when the Sunne hath swifte declination, then doth the day lengthen and shorten apace: and when that the Declination is slowe, then dothe the day lengthen or shorten but slowly. And yet the most parte of the common people do holde an opinion, that at Christmasse or els at New yeares day at the furthest the day must néedes be an houre longer, &amp; yet the Sunne hath not declined or come towardes the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall .2. degrées and a halfe, whiche will not make halfe an houre in the length of the day. Wherefore I do thinke it good to declare thorowe the whole yeare when the day is an houre longer or shorter here in this place for the Latitude or heigth of the pole Articke at London, the Pole beyng raysed .51. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées and .32. minutes, or .34. minutes: and our longest So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day is .16. houres and a halfe, and our shortest winter day is .7. houres and a halfe from the rising of the Sunne vnto the setting of the Sunne: and firste this, the shortest winter day is the .11. or .12. day of December, and then the Sunne riseth a quarter of an houre after .8. and setteth a quarter of an houre before .4. of the clocke, and then the Sunne hath his greatest declination vnto the Southwardes. And then the .29. day of December the day is a quarter of an houre longer, then ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Sunne at .8. of the clocke and settes at .4. And then the 17. or .18 of Ianuarie the day is an houre longer and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the Sunne muste be declined from hir Solstick of winter .5. degrées and .12. minuts before the day is lengthned an houre, so that I do affirme, that from the .4. or .5. day of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember, vnto the .17. or .18. day of Ianuary, in all that time the day is but one houre shorter and longer, which is the time of 10. wéekes. And then the .27. or .28. of Ianuarie the night is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

and setteth halfe an houre after foure of the clocke. And then the .11. or .12. day of Februarie the day is .10. houres long, then riseth the Sunne at .7. and setteth at .5. of the clocke. And then the .26. day of Februarie the day is .11. houres long, then riseth the Sunne halfe an houre after .6. and setteth halfe an houre after .5. of the clocke. And then the .11▪ day of Marche the sunne is vpon the Equinoctiall and the day iuste .12. houres long all the world ouer. And then the .24. day of Marche the day is .13. houres long, and then riseth the Sunne halfe an houre before 6. and setteth halfe an houre after .6. of the clocke. And then the .7. day of Aprill the day is .14. houres long, and then riseth the Sunne at .5. of the clocke iust, and setteth at .7. of the clocke iuste. And then the .23. day of Aprill the day is .15. houres long, and there riseth the Sunne halfe an houre before .5. and setteth halfe an houre after .7. of the clocke. And then the .15. day of Maye the day is .16. houres long, then riseth the Sunne at .4. of the clocke and setteth at .8. of the clocke iuste. And then the .11. of Iune the Sunne hath hir greatest declination to the Northwarde, and then is our longest Somer dayes, and then it is .16. houres and a halfe from the Sunne rising vnto the Sunne setting, so that the Sunne riseth a quarter of an houre before .4. and setteth a quarter of an houre after eight of the clocke. And then the .10. day of Iulie the day is .16. houres long, then riseth the sunne at .4. and setteth at .8. of the clocke. And then the laste of Iuly the day is .15. houres long. And then the .16. day of August the day is .14. houres long. And then the laste day of August the day is .13. houres long. And then the .13. or .14. of September the sunne is vpon the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, and the day iuste .12. houres long. And then the .27. day of September the day is .11. houres long. And then the 11. of October the day is .10. houres long. And then the .26. day of October the day is .9. houres long. And then the .15. day of Nouember the day is .8. houres long, and so vnto the .11. or 12. of December, and then the day is at the shortest (as before is declared.) Thus much haue I sayde as touching the length of the day by euen houres, whiche some people will haue at

the entrance of the Sunne into the .12. signes, of which in the lengthing and shorting of the day there is no such matter, but onely this looke, when that the Sunne hath declined .5. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées and .12. minutes in this our Latitude, then is the day an houre longer or shorter, as you shall finde this matter more larglier spoken of in all places thorowe the worlde, in the .<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
