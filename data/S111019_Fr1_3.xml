      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F slouth and tract of time, (that wears eche thing away)</l>
   <l>Should rust and canker worthy artes, Good works would soen decay.</l>
   <l>If suche as present are, For goeth the people past:</l>
   <l>Ourselus should soen in silence slepe, And loes renom at last.</l>
   <l>No soyll nor land so rude, But som odd men can shoe:</l>
   <l>Than should the learned pas vnknowne, whoes pen &amp; skill did floe.</l>
   <l>God shéeld our sloulth wear sutch, Or world so simple nowe:</l>
   <l>That knowledge scaept without reward, Who sercheth vertue throwe</l>
   <l>And paints forth vyce a right, And blames abues of men:</l>
   <l>And shoes what lief desarues rebuke, And who the prayes of pen.</l>
   <l>You sée howe forrayn realms, Aduance their Poets all:</l>
   <l>And ours are drowned in the dust, Or flong against the wall.</l>
   <l>In Fraunce did Marrot raigne, and neighbour thear vnto:</l>
   <l>Was Petrark, marching full with dantte, Who erst did wonders do</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>
Among the noble Grekes, Was Homere full of skill:</l>
   <l>And where that Ouid norisht was, The soyll did florish still.</l>
   <l>With letters hie of style, But Uirgill wan the fraes,</l>
   <l>And past them all for deep engyen, And made them all to gaes</l>
   <l>Upon the bookes he made, Thus eche of them you sée</l>
   <l>Wan prayse and fame and honor had, Eche one in their degrée.</l>
   <l>I pray you then my friendes, Disdaine not for to vewe:</l>
   <l>The workes and sugred verses fine, Of our raer poetes newe</l>
   <l>Whoes barborus language rued, Perhaps ye may mislike,</l>
   <l>But blame them not that ruedly playes If they the ball do strike.</l>
   <l>Nor skorne not mother tunge, O babes of englishe breed,</l>
   <l>I haue of other language séen, And you at full may reed.</l>
   <l>Fine verses trimly wrought, And coutcht in comly sort,</l>
   <l>But neuer I nor you I troe, In sentence plaine and short.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>
Did yet beholde with eye, In any forraine tonge:</l>
   <l>A higher verse a staetly style, That may be read or song.</l>
   <l>Than is this daye in déede, Our englishe verse and ryme:</l>
   <l>The grace wherof doth touch y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gods, And reatch the cloudes somtime.</l>
   <l>Thorow earth and waters déepe, The pen by skill doth passe:</l>
   <l>And featly nyps the worldes abuse, And shoes vs in a glasse,</l>
   <l>The vertu and the vice, Of eury wyght a lyue:</l>
   <l>The hony combe that bée doth make, Is not so swéete in hyue.</l>
   <l>As are the golden leues, That drops from poets head:</l>
   <l>Which doth surmoūt our cōmō talke As farre as dros doth lead.</l>
   <l>The flowre is sifted cleane, The bran is cast aside.</l>
   <l>And so good corne is knowen from chaffe, And each fine graine is spide.</l>
   <l>Peers plowman was full plaine, And Chausers spréet was great:</l>
   <l>Earle Surry had a goodly vayne, Lord Uaus the marke did beat.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="4"/>
And Phaer did hit the pricke, In thinges he did translate:</l>
   <l>And Edwards had a special gift, And diuers men of late.</l>
   <l>Hath helpt our Englishe toung, That first was baes and brute</l>
   <l>Ohe shall I leaue out Skeltons name, The blossome of my frute</l>
   <l>The trée wheron in deed, My branchis all might groe,</l>
   <l>Nay skelton wore the Lawrell wreath, And past in schoels ye knoe,</l>
   <l>A poet for his arte, Whoes iudgment suer was hie,</l>
   <l>And had great practies of the pen, His works they will not lie.</l>
   <l>His terms to taunts did lean, His talke was as he wraet:</l>
   <l>Full quick of witte, right sharp of words, And shilfull of the staet.</l>
   <l>Of reason riep and good, And to the haetfull mynd:</l>
   <l>That did disdain his doings still, A skornar of his kynd.</l>
   <l>Most pleasant euery way, As poets ought to be:</l>
   <l>And seldom out of Princis grace, And great with eche degre.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="4"/>
Thus haue you heard at full, What Skelton was in deed:</l>
   <l>A further knowledge shall you haue, If you his bookes do réed.</l>
   <l>I haue of meer good will, Theas verses written heer:</l>
   <l>To honour vertue as I ought, And make his fame apéer.</l>
   <l>That whan the Garland gay, Of lawrel leaues but laet,</l>
   <l>Small is my pain, great is his prayes, That thus sutch honour gaet.</l>
