   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that the Prophet Isayas in great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie, had rebuked the vanitie of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolles, and Idolaters as in the 40.<note place="margin">Isa. 40 and 41.</note> and 41. chapters, of his prophecie doeth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, at last he bursteth forth in these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Let them bring forth there Gods (saeth he) that they may shaw vnto vs thinges that are to come, or let them declare vnto vs thinges that haue bene done before. &amp;c. Shaw thinges that are to come, that we may vnderstād you to be Gods, let you do ether good or euill, that we may declare it. By which wordes, the Prophet doeth as it were in mockage, prouoke Idolaters, and the Idoles to produce for them selues, some euident testimonies by the which mē might be assured, that in them was power, and that there religion had approbation of God. which when they could not do, he is bold to prononce this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: Behold ye are of nothing,<note place="margin">Isa. 41.</note> and your making is of nothing, abomination hath chosen you. In which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the Prophet damneth, bothe the Idoles, &amp; the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. The Idoles, because they can declare nothing to proue any power or wertue to be in them, why they sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uld be worshipped as Gods. And the Idolaters, because from Gods month they could bring no assurance of there addulterat and vsurped religion. If this reasoning of the Prophet, had sufficient strength in his aige, to shaw the vanitie of the Idoles, and the phrenetick foolishnes of suche as worshipped them: then may the godlie this day moste assuredly conclude against the great Idole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the Papistes to be worshipped in there masse, and against the patrons of the same: that it and they are
<pb facs="3"/>
vaine, foolish, odious, and abominable before God. It, because it hath mo makers then euer had the Idoles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the Gentiles: and yet hath no greater power, then they had. Albeit it hath bene worshipped as God him self. And they because, they worshipped there owne imagination, and the workmanship of there own hādes, without any assurāce of God or of his word. If any think that I speak more liberally, then I am able to proue, let him consider what makers the Idoles of the Gentiles had, and what makers the God of bread hath. And then let the power of bothe be cōpared, and let me be rebuked, if I speak not the treuth. The Prophet in discription of there vanities, maketh these gries. The earth bringeth forth the tree, it groweth by moistour, and natural wack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, it is cutted doun by the hand of the hew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t. A parte thereof is burnt, a parte spent in vses necessarie to man, an other parte chosen to be made an Idole. This is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the licknes of man or woman, and then set vp and worshipped as a God. All these and some mo, shall we find to assist &amp; concurre in the making of this great God of bread. The wheat is sowen and nourished in the earth, rain, dew, and heat bring it to maturitie. The reaper or scherer cutteth it doune, the carte or fled, drawen by hors or some other beast, draweth it to the barne, or to the barnʒaird. The tasker, or the foot of the ox tradeth it out. The fan deliuereth it from the chaff. The millar, and the milstones by the help of wind or watter, maketh it to be meall. The smith maketh the yrnes, that giues to that God, his lenth and breaid, licknes and form. The fyne substance of that God is nether wood, gold, nor siluer, but watter &amp; meal made ī maner of a drāmock. And then must the workmen take good hede to there hand. For if the fyre be to hote, that Gods skin must be burnt, if the yrnes be euill dight, his face wilbe blecked, if in making the roundnes, the ring be broken, then must an oher of his fellowes, receaue that honor to be made a God, and the crased or cracked miserable caik, that ones was ī hope to be made a God, must be giuen to a babby to play him withall. And yet is not all the danger past, for if there be not an anoynted preist to play his parte aright, all the formar artificers haue lost there laboure, for without him that God can not be made: yea, if he haue not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to cōsecrate, the fashioned God remaueth bread, and
<pb facs="3"/>
so the blind people committ Idolatrie.</p>
   <p>These are the artificers and workmen that trauell in making of this God: I think as many in nomber, as the Prophet reciteth to haue trauelled in making of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. And if the power of bothe shalbe compared, I think they shalbe found in all thinges equall, except that the God of bread is subiect vnto mo dangers then were the Idoles of the Gentilles. Men made them. Men make it. They were deaf and dum, it can not speak, hear nor see. Brieflie in infirmitie, they wholie aggre, except that (as I haue said) the poore God of bread is moste miserable of all other Idoles. For according to there matter whereof they are made, they will remaine without corruptiō ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares. But within one year, that God will putrifie, &amp; then he must be burnt. They can abyde the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the wind, frost, rain, or snow. But the wind will blow that God to the sea, the rain or the snow wil make it dagh again, yea, which is most of all to be feared, that God is a pray (if he be not wel kept) to rattes and mise. For they will desyre no better denner then white rounde Gods ynew. But o then what becometh of Christes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bodie? by myrackle, it flies to the heauen againe, if the papists teach treulie, for how sone soeuer the mouse takes hold, so sone flieth Christ away &amp; letteth hir gnow the bread. A bold and puissant mouse, but a feble and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable God? Yet wold I ask a question, whether hath the preist or the mouse greater power? by his wordes it is made a God, by hir teith it ceaseth to be a God. Let them auise, and then answer. If any think that I oght not to mock, that which the world so long hath hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and great Princes yet holde in so great venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I answer, that not onelie I, but also all godlie oght not onelie to mock, but also to curse and detest, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is not God, and yet vsurpeth the name, power, and honor of God. And also that we oght bothe to mock, gain say, and abhorr, all religiō obtruded to the people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out assurance of God &amp; his word, hauing nether respect, to antiquitie, to multitude, to authoritie, nor estimatiō, of them that mantean the same. The Idoles of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were more ancient, then is the Idole in the masse. There worshippers, manteners, and patrons, were mo in multitude, greater in authoritie, and more excellent before the world, then euer was any that bowed to that

Idole.<note place="margin">Isa. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> And yet feared not the Prophet Isayas to mock and iest them, yea, sharplie to rebuke them, in these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. They are dung backward with shame, they shalbe ashamed, whosoeuer trusteth in a grauen ymage, and that say to the molten ymage,<note place="margin">Isa. 44.</note> ye are our Gods. All the makers of grauē ymages are vaine, there pleasing thing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>es shall not proffet them. For they themselues are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, to there Idoles, that they nether se, nor vnderstād any thing, and therefore they shalbe ashamed, who then (sayeth he) shall forge a God? or a molten ymage that profiteth nothing? behold all those that are of the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thereof shalbe confounded, for the workmen them selues are men, let them all be gathered together, and stand vp, yet they shall feare and be confoūded together. And when he hath fully painted forth there vanitie, he concludeth. They haue not vnderstand, for God hath shut vp there eyes,<note place="margin">Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Gods iust pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishmēt for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.</note> that they can not see, and hartes, that they can not vnderstand, none considereth in his hart, I haue brunt half of it, euen in the fyre, and haue baken bread also vpon the coalles thereof I haue rosted fleshe &amp; earen it, and shall I make the residew thereof an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, shall I bow to the stock of a tree? &amp;c. Thus, I say, we see, how that the Prophet doeth triumph against the Idolaters, in mocking of there madnes, and paintīg forth of there vanitie. Who then can iustlie be offended against me or any other albeit by all meanes possible, we let the blind world see, the vanitie of that Idole? consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that by it, hath the glorie of God bene more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured, then euer it was by any Idole in the earth. For to none was neuer absolutlie giuen,<note place="margin">Let the Papists consider</note> the name, nature, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and honor of God, but to that Idole allone. If any think that the Scriptures of God giue vnto them patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinie, ether to beleue Christes naturall body to be there, after the wordes of consecration (as they cal them) ether yet to beleue that Christ Iesus, in his last Supper, did offer vnto God his Father his body and blood, vnder the formes of bread and wine, he is miserablie deceaued, for the Scripture maketh no mention, of conuersion or transubstanciation of bread in Christes naturall bodie, but witnesseth that bread remaneth bread, yea euē, when the faithfull receaue the same,<note place="margin">1. Cor 10</note> as the Apostle affirmeth in these wordes. The bread that we break, is it not the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Christes bodie? the cup of blissing which
<pb facs="4"/>
we blisse, is it not the cōmunion of the blood of Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> we many, are one bread, and one body, because we are all partakers of one bread. And after he sayeth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> as of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> as ye shall eat of this bread, and drink of this cup, ye shew the Lordes death till he come. Let therefore, a man try him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and so let him eat of this bread, and drink of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> &amp;c. By these wordes we may clearlie vnderstand, what iudgement the Apostle had of the substāce of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, euen in the verie action of the same. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that foolish opinion, that Christ Iesus did offer his body vnto God his Father, vnder the formes of bread &amp; wine. &amp;c. (which the Papistes make the ground of there masse) what suffrage that euer it hath by man, of God, nor of his word, it hath none.<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note> The Scripture dooth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that God the Father gaue his Sone vnto the world, that the world might be saued by him, and that Iesus Christ did offer him self ones vnto God,<note place="margin">Heb. 10 and 9.</note> for the destructiō of sinne, and for to take away the sinnes of many, but that euer he did offer him self vnder the formes of bread and wine (as the Papistes alledge) the holy Goste doeth no where make mention. And therefore the faithfull not onely may reiect it as the dreame and inuention of man, but also are boūd to abhor &amp; detest it as a doctrine broght in by Satan, to deceaue suche as delyte not in the veritie of God, to whose <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

He rīneth straight to his fortres &amp; shameles schift. O sayeth M. Quintyne, I haue hurt my own cause, I was caried away with zeal &amp;c. It apperteaned not vnto me to proue any thing, but to defend my artickles as they are written. If M. O.
<pb facs="5"/>
and his collat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ralles will resolue me an dout, then will I giue my iudgement, whether he oght to proue, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend onely. My dout is this, whether are M. Quintynes artickles necessarie to be beleued to Saluatiō, or are they suche as without danger of damnation, we may dout of them? If we may dout of them and not offend God, then assuredly I think that M. Quintyne may hold them for treuth, til that the falshead of them be manifestly declared. But if they be suche as we are bound to beleue as a treuth of God, and an doctrine necessarie to Saluation, then is M. Quintyne bound to shaw to vs that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonced them, and not man. which if he be not able to do, and that in plaine and expressed wordes, then must we reiect them as deceauable,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.</note> &amp; fals, accordīg as we be taucht by our maister Christ Iesus saying: My sheip heare my voice, but a stranger they will not heare. If M. Q. will not be reputed an fals Prophet, &amp; one that teacheth lies in the name of God, and so expone him self to Gods here displeasure, he may propone no doctrine to the Church of God, the assurance whereof, he bringeth not from the mouth of God. If M. Q. were brawling in the scooles, or bragging of knowledge amōgest the Philosophers, I wold pacientlie abyde, that he should affirme as many paradoxes, as pleaseth him. But in the Church of God to affirme that God hath spoken, when God hath not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or done that which he is not able to proue, by his plaine word, that he hath done, so to do (I say) is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether intollerable, and therefore let M. Q. searche the Scriptures, for the probation of his affirmatiue, or els I will cry als loud as I can, that he hath lost his cause, and is conuicted an manifest lear: in that he hath affirmed Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus to haue done that, which no Scripture doeth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that he hath done. Let all men therefore that will not follow lies, detest the masse, till that it find a ground within the booke of God, as I am assured it neuer shall. And that shall the reader more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sylie perceaue, by this confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that followeth.</p>
