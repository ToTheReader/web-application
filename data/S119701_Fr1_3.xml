   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Enerous Reader, I haue exposed to thy most iudiciall view a Discourse of Women: wherein expect not, that I should either enuiously carpe at the particular manners or actions of any liuing, nor iniuriously detract from the Sepulchers of the dead; the first I could neuer affect, the last I did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes detest. I only present thee with a Collection of Histories, which touch the generalitie of Women, such as haue either beene illustrated for their Vertues, and Noble Actions, or contrarily branded for their Vices, and baser Conditions; in all which, I haue not exceeded the bounds and limits of good and sufficient Authoritie. Here thou mayest reade of all degrees, from the Scepter in the Court, to the Sheepe-hooke in the Cottage: of all Times, from the first Rainebow, to the last blazing Starre: of all knowne Nations, from the North to the Meridian, and from the East to the Septentrion: of all Faiths; Iewes, Pagans, or Christians: of all Callings; Virgins, Wiues, or Widowes: of the Faire and Foule, Chast and Wanton, of each of these something: Briefely, of all Estates, Conditions, and Qualities whatsoeuer. In the Goddesses, and other Poeticall Fictions (which to some Readers may appeare fabulously impossible) you shall find their misticall sences made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous and plaine, with the true intent of the Poets, which was not (as some haue dreamed) meerely to transferre Worship and Honor vpon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Causes, thereby to debarre the true and euer-liuing Creator of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Adoration, but rather including in darke and aenigmaticall Histories, Precepts of Wisdome and Knowledge, least they should be made too popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and therefore subiect to contempt. The like Illustrations you shall find in the <hi>Nymphes, Graces, Oreades, Driades, Hamadriades,</hi> &amp;c. No seeming Fable being here remembred (though neuer so intricate &amp; obscure) which is not made plaine and easie. In the <hi>Muses,</hi> you shall meet with the first Inuentresses of all good Arts, and Disciplines; in the <hi>Sybills,</hi> their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Prophesies set downe at large; in the <hi>Vestalls,</hi> the honor due to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie; in Queenes, how such should beare themselues in their power, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Noble Ladies in their obedience. Wiues may reade here of chast Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, to patterne their Daughters by, and how to demeane themselues in all Coniugall loue towards their Husbands: Widowes may finde what may best become their solitude, and Matrons those accomplishments that most dignifie their grauitie: and so of the rest. Now if any aske, Why I haue
<pb facs="4"/>
shut vp and contruded within a narrow roome, many large Histories, not delating them with euerie plenarie circumstance? I answer, That therein I haue imitated <hi>Aelianus de Var. Hist.</hi> and <hi>Valer. Maxim.</hi> who epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised great and memorable acts, reducing and contracting into a compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Method wide and loose Histories, giuing them notwithstanding their full weight, in few words. Some also may cauill, that I haue not introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them in order, neither Alphabetically, nor according to custome or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident; which I thus excuse: The most cunning and curious Musick, is that which is made out of Discords; and <hi>Ouid</hi> preferres a blunt Carriage and a neglected Habit aboue all sprucenesse and formalitie. It may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise obiected, Why amongst sad and graue Histories, I haue here and there inserted fabulous Ieasts and Tales, sauouring of Lightnesse? I answer, I haue therein imitated our Historicall and Comicall Poets, that write to the Stage; who least the Auditorie should be dulled with serious courses (which are meerely weightie and materiall) in euerie Act present some Zanie with his Mimick action, to breed in the lesse capable, mirth and laughter: For they that write to all, must striue to please all. And as such fashion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to a multitude, consisting of spectators seuerally addicted; so I, to an vniuersalitie of Readers, diuersly disposed. I may be further questioned, Why I haue in the Front of my Booke no Encomiasticks, or commendatorie Verses from my friends, to vsher in the Worke (especially being so much and so long conuersant amongst the Poets) which is able to discourage a Booke, wanting their approbation and countenance? Let that (I entreat) be no preiudice to my Labours, since I did not communicate them vnto any: And how can any man truly commend what he hath not aduisedly perused? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I thinke I am so little knowne, or ill beloued amongst them, that any one would haue denyed me so small a courtesie. But being onely a matter of forme, and neither helpe nor hinderance to that which hath alreadie past the Presse; I expose it naked to the free view, and vnguarded with any such faction of friends; either by the worth thereof to be commended, and so liue; or by the weakenesse to be disparaged, and so perish. And these are all the difficulties of which I am now to expostulate, desiring thee to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse a suddaine Businesse, which began with the Presse, kept it still going, and ended some few dayes before it. These things well considered, may in any generous spirit preuent all Cauill and Criticisme: and to such onely I submit my selfe.</p>
