      <hi>

gentle reders, but
that if ye haue ben
conuersante in old
histories, &amp; so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
both howe
many moo prynces haue ben en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungered
by treason of theyr fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mylyer
seruauntes, then by open
warre of theyr enemyes, and also
sene, what ende they come to, that
venture vpon so daungerous an
enterprise, ye woll thynke my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
not euyll employed, whiche
tendeth hole to this ende, that all
subiectes ones being brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hatred of treason, maye at the
laste fall in loue with their duetie,
and seke truly to serue, where god
hath appoynted theym so to doo.
For as the incommodyties, that
<pb facs="3"/>
treason bryngeth into a common
welthe, be excedynge many, and
are ofte tymes the vtter vndoyng
of ryche and welthy realmes, so,
that kyngdome must nedes pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and flourishe, where all men
stryue, who may best do his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
best serue his countrey in that
god and his souerayne lorde hath
callyd hym vnto. We haue hadde
ofte experience, howe euylle they
spede, what infamye commeth to
them, what ende they make, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
at any tyme attempte treason
against their soueraigne lord and
kynge. These, whiche of late, lost
their honour, landes, and lyues,
are not the fyrste, that haue bene
moued with to many benefites, to
become traytours, no nor yet the
fyrst that came to shamfull death,
for soo foule an enterprise. They
<pb facs="3"/>
haue companyons, which though
they be not able to goo cheeke by
cheke with them, yet they comme
nat farre behynde.</p>
   <p>¶Perennius, a man that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
wonderful many benefites
of Cōmodus themperour, where
as he sawe, but oone aboue hym,
thynkyng that he myght by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
brynge hym downe, and sette
vp hym selfe, trayterousely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
the deathe of Commodus,
his lorde and maker.</p>
   <p>¶Plautianus an nother, of all
men mooste bounde to Seuerus
the emperour, soughte also to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye
hym, not that euer he hadde
receyued any iniurie or displesure
at his handes, but that the blynd
desyre he hadde to the Empyre,
wrought moche more in him, than
coulde al themperours benefites.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
¶Seianus as moche bounde,
as any of thother two, euen vpon
lyke cause, thought to haue slayn
Tiberius themperour, his lorde
and mayster. But they came euen
to suche ende, as dydde the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,
the lorde Montacute, and
suche other, as by their exaumple
teache all men, that be nat yet we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
of their lyues and honestie, to
be ware of treasone. Certaynely
who so wayeth, how hard a thing
it is, to enter with any manne in
treason, howe full of ieoperdies,
howe fewe there be, that a manne
maye truste, howe soone menne
maye be deceyued, takynge some
to beare them moch greatter loue,
than they do, howe no experience
can soo vtter one man his hart to
an nother, that in suche a case, he
may leaue lyfe in his handes, he
<pb facs="4"/>
woll, I suppose, moche wonder,
to see any man, thoughe the fyne
for it, were but the losse of goodis,
so madde to venture vppon trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Many chaunces make trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whan it is kepte most secrete,
to appere. An harte, that stylle fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the stinge of treason, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
at one tyme or an other, make
the tonge and countenance part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of his grefe.</p>
   <p>¶Lucilla, syster to Commodus
the Emperoure, hadde appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
oone Quintianus to slee her
brother. This traytour waited for
the Emperour at the entrynge in
to the Amphitheatre, and whenne
he sawe Comodus all moste come
to the place, where he intended to
haue slayne hym, his hande, his
tongue, his gesture, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
coulde suffre his harte to
<pb facs="5"/>
be no lenger hyd. No, he hauinge
his dagger redy naked, cryed out,
before the Emperour camme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the strooke, <hi>This the Senate sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the.</hi> Uppon whiche wordes, he
was taken, and Commodus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge
hurt.</p>
   <p>¶Likewyse, Marcus Antonius
of Uolterra, was set to kyll Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
Medices, and had so done,
but that he cried before, o traitour,
which voyce saued Laurence, and
disclosed as many as were of that
conspiracie.</p>
   <p>¶The same mornynge, that
Brutus, and the reste of his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
hadde determyned to slee
Iulius Cesar, it so chaunced, that
Cesar commened a greatte space
with Gneius Popilius, oone of
those that had conspired his deth.
<pb facs="5"/>
Brutus and many mo of his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panions
were bye, and were caste
into suche a feare, that they wyste
neyther what to doo, ne what to
thynke. They all were a frayde,
lest Popilius had vttered the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
vnto Cesar, and wolde euen
there haue set vpon hym, sauinge
that they perceyued Cesar his coū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenaunce
nothynge moued, ne his
colour any thyng altered. And yet
if Cesar had redde the letter, that
was delyuered hym, not halfe an
houre before his deathe, he hadde
knowen his enemyes counsel, and
myght haue broughte them all to
theyr confusion.</p>
   <p>¶The daye before, that Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinus
thoughte to haue slayne
Nero, he put an olde rustie dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
that hadde layne longe by
<pb facs="6"/>
hym, to gryndynge. He made his
testamente, he made all his bonde
men free, he gaue euery one of thē
a certayne somme of moneye, he
caused rollers to be made, to wrap
woūdes in, by which tokens Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lichius
his seruaunt, gathered, he
wente about some naughty pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and so accused hym vnto the
emperoure. Sceuinus streyghte
confessed that his intente was to
haue slayne Nero.</p>
   <p>¶This I brynge in, not so moch
to shewe that treason woll out, as
to make men see, howe god pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
wyt and prudency from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyciouse
traytours. He hath done
so, where treason was intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenst
Nero, one of the worst pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that euer the worlde had, and
trowe traytours, he woll suffre
<pb facs="6"/>
Henry the eyght, his chosen king,
a prynce that chyefelye aboue all
thinges, hath soughte and seketh,
to sette forthe his glorie, to restore
his holy worde, to put downe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrysie,
to banishe idolatry, &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to bryng this ones to passe,
y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> al his people, may be as they ar
called, that is trewe chrystians?
Rede this lyttell inuectiue that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
I truste by thynges past,
ye shall perceyue it, very vnlyke,
that any traytour here after maye
or can hurte his highnes. Ye shall
see who is his gracis protectour,
from what daungers, he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
hym, and therby gather an
assured affyaunce, that traytours
can but worke their owne confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
when so euer they seke to do
his highnes any displeasure. God
<pb facs="7"/>
hitherto hath wonderfully troden
downe his graces enemyes, styll
shewynge hym selfe to be of
his syde, if he be so stylle,
as our trust is, he wol
be euer, be tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
who woll,
he knoweth
his ende.</p>
