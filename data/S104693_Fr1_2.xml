   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O present you with a</hi>
long discourse, might perhaps wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
you in the reading; &amp; to write
obscurely, might be a trouble to
your vnderstanding: To auoide
therefore inconueniences, I have
chosen this litle peece of labor to fit
the patience of your idle leisure; hoping, that as in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
men of great Titles, would patronize the writings
of good Studies, not regarding the estate or quality of the
person, so your true spirits that can rightly iudge of the
natures of well deseruings, will not altogether shut my
Booke (with my better seruice) out of your good fauour:
the subiects are many, and of diuers natures, but (as
many flowers in one Nose-gay) they are here put together
in a little volume, which perusd with that good patience
that may make profit of experience, I hope shall giue you
some way contentment, and no way the contrarie: but
least I make to great an entry to a little house, I will
shut the dore to my further speech, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rest in some better seruice.</p>

      <signed>Your affectionately at commaund.
