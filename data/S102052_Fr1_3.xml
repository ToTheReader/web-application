   <head>TO THE COVRTEVS Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>I</hi> Am to request (gentle Reader) one fauour at thy hande, that if this worke of the iudgement of Natiuities seeme harsh and vnpleasant to thee, thou wouldest not therefore wound the same with iniurious words, to charge thy selfe with more follie then needes: but if thou finde it aboue thy knowledge or capacitie, saie as honest minded <hi>Chion</hi> said: <hi>Let my betters iudge of these matters.</hi> For I must and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that it is not a Booke for euerie mans reading, and hee that reades with derision, because he vnderstands not, must blame his owne insufficiencie, and not the booke: for if hee could learne as much in an hower, as cost a learned man many yeeres to compasse, then would his humor be pleased, and the worke not reproched. But let such loyterers vnderstand, that knowledge requires the whole circuit of a mans life, and liue he neuer so long, yet may he learne: but if it might be attained in a Sommers daie, a number would be excellent, that through default thereof remaineth vtterly ignorant.</p>
   <p>To vse many words, I account needlesse, knowing that the reproofe of the vnlearned, is rather the badge of their owne weake braine, then any blemish to a worke of worth: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them censure as they please, the learned (I know) will iudge like themselues, of whom I had rather be deseruedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled, then by the other be ignorantly commended.</p>
