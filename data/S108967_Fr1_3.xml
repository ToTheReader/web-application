   <head>To the truly Worthy, and Noble, Sir KENELME DIGBIE Knight.</head>
   <l>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His latter Age, the Lees of Time, hath knowne,</l>
   <l>Few, that have made both <hi>Pallas</hi> arts their owne.</l>
   <l>But you, Great Sir, two Lawrels weare, and are</l>
   <l>Victorious in Peace, as well as War.</l>
   <l>Learning by right of Conquest is your owne,</l>
   <l>And every liberall Art your Captive growne.</l>
   <l>As if neglected Science (for it now</l>
   <l>Wants some defenders) fled for helpe to you.</l>
   <l>Whom I must follow, and let this for mee</l>
   <l>An earnest of my future service bee.</l>
   <l>Which I should feare to send you, did I know</l>
   <l>Your judgement onely, not your Candor too.</l>
   <l>For t'was a Worke, stolne (though you'le justly call</l>
   <l>This Play, as fond as those) from Cat, or Ball.</l>
   <l>Had it beene written since, I should, I feare,</l>
   <l>Scarse have abstain'd from a Philosopher.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>Which by Tradition here is thought to bee</l>
   <l>A necessarie Part in Comedie.</l>
   <l>Nor need I tell you this; each line of it</l>
   <l>Betray's the Time and Place wherein t'was writ▪</l>
   <l>And I could wish, that I might safely say</l>
   <l>To th' Reader, that t' was done but th' other day.</l>
   <l>Yet 'tis not stuff'd with names of Gods, hard words,</l>
   <l>Such as the Metamorphosis affords.</l>
   <l>Nor has't a part for Robinson, whom they</l>
   <l>At schoole, account essentiall to a Play.</l>
   <l>The stile is low, such as you'le easily take</l>
   <l>For what a Swaine might speake, and a Boy make.</l>
   <l>Take it, as early fruits, which rare appeare</l>
   <l>Though not halfe ripe, but worst of all the yeare.</l>
   <l>And if it please your tast, my Muse will say,</l>
   <l>The Birch which crown'd her then, is growne a Bay.</l>

      <signed>Yours in all observance, A. COVVLEY.</signed>
