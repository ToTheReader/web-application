   <p>THou hast here deliuered to thee, good Reader, a little Treatise, first written in the Italian tongue, and printed at Venice, after that, translated into the French language, and printed at Lyons, and now translated and printed for thee to reade in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish tongue. Enquire not of the Author, hee is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, and to know him would doe thee but little good. Reade the booke deuoutly, regard the matter of it attentiuely, it may doe thee much good in these euill dayes. This may be counted among the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test euils with which this age is infected, that they which are called Christians, are miserably diuided about Christ. And yet in truth (as the Apostle saith vnto vs,) there is but one God, which is the Father, of <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 6</note> whom are all things, and we in him: and one Lord Iesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. To discourse on this diuision and the cause thereof, would be to some pleasing, to some it would be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. For what one truth can please minds so diuersly diuided? would God it could please all to become one in that one Christ, whose name we all doe carry. In this little booke is that benefit, which commeth by Christ crucified, to the Christians, truly and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably handled: which benefit if all Christians did true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderstand and faithfully embrace, this diuision would vanish away, and in Christ the Christians should become one. To this end reade this booke, and much good in Christ may it doe to all them which doe reade it.</p>
   <closer>Amen.</closer>
