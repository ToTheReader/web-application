   <head>A Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>THis <hi>Translation,</hi> long since, finished in blurred papers (and often called for) I, lately, made legible to others: &amp; it had my leave, to seek a publike <hi>Passe</hi> into the world: which if it merrit to obtaine; Be the fault theirs who shall oppose it. I waited long, to see a more exact <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance:</hi> But, none appearing, answerable to the dignitie of our <hi>English-Muses,</hi> I have sent forth my <hi>Essay,</hi> to provoke others, to discover their endeavours, on this <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi> that, choice being had, the best might receive the best Approbatton.</p>
   <p>I have had more care, to suite the Capacitie of the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> then to observe those <hi>Critiscismes</hi> which arride the <hi>Learned:</hi> yet, I hope, with so much descretion, that the best <hi>Iudgments</hi> shall have no cause to despise it. For, though the Language be plaine, it is significant; &amp; such a Dialect as is likely to continue vnchanged, when fantasticall expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions will growe as vnfashionable as our clothes. It is also breifer, by above a fourth Part, then the <hi>Translations</hi> which I have yet seene, in any language of <hi>Europe:</hi> and preserves, likewise, the words of the <hi>Prose;</hi> the fulnes of the <hi>Sence,</hi> &amp; the relish of the <hi>Scripture phrase,</hi> as well as any of them. VVhich, considering how much other vulger Tongues have ignorantly bene preferred before our, (how difficultly the <hi>Hebrewismes</hi> are contracted; how much the often <hi>Transition</hi> from one <hi>Matter,</hi> &amp; from one <hi>Person</hi> to another, interrupts breife knitting of things together; &amp; how much the frequent <hi>Rimes,</hi> &amp; other things considerable in <hi>Lyrick Translations,</hi> interrupt such Breifnes) is a great honour to our <hi>Language:</hi> Especially, seeing my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, hath made no Psalme obscurer; But rather, so easie to be vnderstood, that some <hi>Readers</hi> have confessed, it hath bene insteed of a <hi>Comment</hi> vnto them, in sundry hard places.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>
If you expect such elegant-seeming <hi>Paraphrases,</hi> as are composed by those, who selecting easy and Passionate <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> have trimmed them vp with Rhetoricall Illustrations, (sutable to their fancies, &amp; the changable garbe of Affected <hi>Language)</hi> I shall deceave your expectation: For, I have purposely avoyded those Descants, &amp; confined my self to the grave, &amp; simple <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Text:</hi> And I was thereby the better kept from wandring after mine owne sense, as in their <hi>Circumlocutions</hi> they have done. Beside; their <hi>Versions</hi> are sitted rather to be <hi>Read,</hi> then <hi>Sung:</hi> which giveth a greater Libertie to the <hi>Translator.</hi> For, though it be most gracefull in a reading <hi>-Poeme,</hi> when the Period is cast, sometime into one parte of the <hi>Line</hi> or <hi>Stanza,</hi> and sometime into another: Yet, in a Lyrick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, where the same <hi>Staff</hi> is often reiterated to one <hi>Tune;</hi> the <hi>Periods,</hi> and words of the same <hi>Quantity,</hi> must be alwaies observed in the same Places. For, if there be not allwaies a decent pawse in the Matter, when the Tune is ended; or, if in the singing, the naturall quantity of the word be adulterated; or, if wee be not carefull, that a <hi>full-point</hi> fall not, where the Tune is in the height of a continueng straine; It will sound verie absurdly to a iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious eare: as may appear, by offring to sing some of those Composures, which are plausible in Reading.</p>
   <p>I have vsed some, varietie of Verse; Because, <hi>Prayers, Praises, Lamentations, Tryumphs,</hi> and subiects which are <hi>Pastoral, Heroical, Elegiacall,</hi> and <hi>mixt</hi> (all which are found in the <hi>Psalmes)</hi> are not properly exprest in one sort of <hi>Measure.</hi> Yet, respecting thē who cannot attaine to many <hi>Tunes,</hi> I confined my selfe to such kinds of Uerse as I found in the old <hi>Psalmebook;</hi> fitting them in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that every <hi>Psalme</hi> in this <hi>Booke,</hi> may sung to some <hi>Tune</hi> formerly in vse, either in the single, or in one of the double <hi>Translations.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>
And, because some will thinck to examine my <hi>Version</hi> by the Prose <hi>Translations,</hi> I doe here inform them; that the <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Muses,</hi> in which the <hi>Psalmes</hi> were Orignally written, is not so properly exprest in the prose dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect as in verse: &amp;, that there is a poeticall emphasis, in many places, which requires such an alteration in the <hi>Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> expressiō, as will seeme to make some difference in the iudgment of the Common Reader; whereas, it giveth best life to the <hi>Author's</hi> intention; &amp; makes that perspicuous, which was made obscure, by those meer <hi>Grammaticall Interpreters,</hi> who were not acquainted with the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; Liberties, of this kinde of writing.</p>
   <p>I do likewise inform them, that I have not alwaies vsed the <hi>Metaphor</hi> which is in the <hi>Original;</hi> but, otherwhile (tendring the vulger capacity) do expresse it, by what it signifies. For, the <hi>Hebrewismes,</hi> being in some places ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure (as where the <hi>Tongue</hi> is interpreted, <hi>Glorie;</hi> and in many other suchlike perticulers) I do vse, expressions best agreeable with our <hi>English</hi> Dialect, &amp; the vulger Capacity.</p>
   <p>Moreover, when the Repetition of the same <hi>word</hi> or <hi>Clause;</hi> Or when two or three <hi>Synonama's</hi> togither in one sentence as <hi>(Heare, give ear, attend)</hi> or, where either a <hi>Periphrasis,</hi> or a <hi>transposition</hi> of some words, seemes not soe gracefull in <hi>English,</hi> as in the <hi>Hebrewe;</hi> nor so powrfully to expresse the meaning of the <hi>Holy-Ghost,</hi> by the same <hi>Idioms</hi> of speach: I have not superstitiously tied my self to the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> phrase, nor to any strict Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or number of words (except some <hi>Mystery</hi> seemed thereby touched vpon) but, vsing rather brevitie where <hi>Circumlocution</hi> appeared needles, &amp; affecting the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect most proper to our owne <hi>Tongue;</hi> I labored to deliver the meaning of the <hi>Originall Text,</hi> as powrefully, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; as breefly, as I could.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="8"/>
For that Cause, I have not everie where observed the same <hi>Tense;</hi> But, vsed the <hi>pretertense,</hi> the <hi>Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Future-tense,</hi> indifferently, one for the other, in some Actions attributed to God. For, most things, which God is said in this booke, to <hi>have done</hi> for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or against his enimies; he <hi>now doth, &amp; will doe hereafter.</hi> That, also, which he <hi>will doe,</hi> he may be said to <hi>do now,</hi> &amp; to <hi>have done heretofore;</hi> because, all time is <hi>present</hi> with God. Nevertheles, I have herein taken such care; That I confounded not <hi>Historie &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie;</hi> But, in these places, have religiously observed the proper <hi>Tenses;</hi> &amp; wheresoever els, I found it material, so to do.</p>
   <p>And, whereas, I perceaved that this particle FOR, is not alwayes. a <hi>Causual;</hi> Nor this particle BUT, an <hi>exceptive,</hi> in every place; But (as YEA, NAY, &amp; other such like words in our <hi>English)</hi> sometime rather inserted as <hi>supplements,</hi> only, becomming the Dialect, (or meerly customary) without any material significancy, according to their ordinary vse; And, finding that those <hi>Particles,</hi> in the <hi>English,</hi> did in some places, either ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure the sense, or make lesse powrefull the expression there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by interrupting a natural connextion of the sentenses; I have there, waved or quallyfied, the vse of those words.</p>
   <p>For like Reasons, I have in some places, kept the <hi>Person</hi> vnchanged, throughout the <hi>Psalme,</hi> which is sometime varyed in the <hi>Hebrewe</hi> (as in the <hi>18 &amp; 104</hi> Psalmes) But, with such heed, that where any worke (according to the <hi>Schoole</hi> distinction <hi>Ad intra,</hi> or <hi>ad Extra)</hi> seemes more proper to one distinct <hi>Persō</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> thē to the other (or where els it is Materiall) I have retained the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> according to the <hi>Originall.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And, in regard some abuse the propheticall <hi>Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      </hi>tions, as if <hi>David</hi> had given exemplary warrant of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="8"/>
their enimies, I have (to prevent that prophanation) otherwhile expressed that by the <hi>Future tense,</hi> which many do trāslate by the <hi>imparative moode;</hi> whereby, those passages, the more plainely appear, prophetically intended. In all which, let what I have done, be duely weighed, (not rashlie condemned) by those who shall by some prose <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations,</hi> examine my <hi>Paraphrase.</hi> For, I hope I have preserved the lawful freedomes of an <hi>Interpreter,</hi> in all these things: Seeing, I have not therein followed my owne opinion only; but the warrāt of best <hi>Hebrew Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians,</hi> the Authoritie of the <hi>Septuagint, &amp; Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deā paraphrase,</hi> the example of the auntient &amp; of the best moderne prose <hi>Trāslators,</hi> togither with the generall prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise &amp; allowance, of all orthodoxe <hi>Expositors.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Before every <hi>Psalme</hi> I prefixe a short <hi>Preface,</hi> partly declaring the <hi>Scope</hi> &amp; vse thereof; not thereby limiting either their <hi>Scope</hi> or <hi>vse.</hi> For, every <hi>Psalme</hi> is divers waies vsefull, according to the severall parts it hath; or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the many Ages, Estates, &amp; necessities of the <hi>Church,</hi> or her particuler members. But, that, which I have intended in my breef Prefaces, &amp; in those Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions after the <hi>Psalmes;</hi> is, to shew the vnlearned, how to make some good <hi>vses,</hi> of those many, to which they serve.</p>
   <p>Much more might be said as considerable (if it would not make this Preface overlarge) for, so it fares with some of us, that when wee have taken much paines to doe well, wee must take as much more to prevent misconstructions; &amp; thinck our double paines, well rewarded, if at last, wee may escape without a mischeef. But (how ever I shall be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured) I cann be well pleased when I have recollected my selfe: &amp;, though I seek to avoide <hi>Rubbs</hi> that are cast into my way; Yet, I can skip over them, or contemn them, if I find it more trouble some, then profitable, to remove them.</p>
   <p>Though others may performe this, more exactly; yet,
<pb facs="9"/>
Goodmen will confesse, I have bene honestly employed herein, &amp; attempted an honorable <hi>work.</hi> But, if I have soe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured; That it manifestly appeareth to be better, then, what the partialitie of this Age will accept, (and that <hi>Mumpsimus,</hi> must still be preferred before <hi>Sumpsimus)</hi> Then, this <hi>Worke,</hi> shall become the <hi>Iudge</hi> of those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Iudges; And, to their disgrace, gaine esteeme, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, in despight of their envy.</p>
   <p>I regard the Censorious approbation of none, but such, as are (in their vnder standing, at least) both <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Poets:</hi> For, they, only, are competent Iudges, who knowe how much the <hi>Phrases</hi> or <hi>Mysteries</hi> confine the <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator;</hi> what <hi>Proprieties</hi> are to be observed in both <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages;</hi> &amp; what Liberties, &amp; restraints, belong to a <hi>Lyrick-poem.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And,—but, I will now say no more save this; If I have pleased my <hi>Readers,</hi> I am glad: if not; Yet, I am glad, I have honestly endeavored it. And, (being assured my labour shal not all be lost) I will sing, &amp; be Merry, by my <hi>selfe,</hi> in the Use of this <hi>Translation,</hi> vntill others please to sing it with mee; or, vntill a more exact <hi>Version,</hi> shall be produced, &amp; allowed.</p>
   <closer>Fare well,</closer>
