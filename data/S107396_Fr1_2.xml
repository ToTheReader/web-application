                 <title>Puritanisme the mother, sinne the daughter. Or a treatise, wherein is demonstrated from twenty seuerall doctrines, and positions of Puritanisme; that the fayth and religion of the Puritans, doth forcibly induce its professours to the perpetrating of sinne, and doth warrant th committing of the same. Written by a Catholic priest, vpon occasion of certaine late most execrable actions of some Puritans, expressed in the page following. Heerunto is added (as an appendix) a funerall discourse touching the late different deathes of two most eminent Protestant deuines; to wit Doctour Price Deane of Hereford, and Doctour Butts Vice-Chancellour of Cambridge.

   <head>THE OCCASIONS (lately occurring) of writing this Treatise, are these following.</head>
   <p>IN the yeare <hi>1632.</hi> there was discouered in <hi>London</hi> a Society of certaine <hi>Sodomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> to the number of fourty, or fifty; all of them being earnest and hoat <hi>Puritans,</hi> who had their common appointed Meeting-place, for their abominable Impiety: Of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber diuers of them (and such as were of good temporall estates and meanes) were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the rest instantly fled.</p>
   <p>In this yeare <hi>1633.</hi> there is one called <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch A peuen,</hi> being of age betweene thirty and fourty, and borne in <hi>Clun</hi> in <hi>Shropshire</hi> a most fiery <hi>Puritan,</hi> and one who pretendeth learning. This man, lately killed with an Axe, his owne Brother being asleepe, and instantly after his owne Mother, because both of them (being temperate Protestants) did some few dayes before, receaue the Communion kneeling. This <hi>Henoch Apeuen</hi> being apprehended, and sent to <hi>Shrows bury</hi> Goale, and questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of this his blouddy Act, iustified and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the same; and produced for it certaine miscōstrued places, &amp; texts of Scripture, taken from the thirteenth, and seauententh Chapters of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>In this yeare also <hi>1633.</hi> there is one <hi>Cade</hi> a Minister, who was lately before, for diuers yeares, a stipendary Preacher at <hi>Hayton,</hi> a parish Church in <hi>Lancashire.</hi> This man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Warington</hi> (a Towne in the said shyre) at a Vintners house, called <hi>Gryses,</hi> began to vse most earnest words to the said Vintner &amp; others: That for his part, he belieued that there was <hi>no Christ, no Trinity, no God,</hi> besides other most blasphemous speaches, not fit to be set downe. The Vintner said to him; Syr, if you be of this Iudgment, why then do you weekely preach of Christ, of the Trinity, &amp; of God? The Minister replyed: I do preach of them, with the same intētion that you do draw wine, that is, to mantaine my self by this my trade of preaching. The Vintner, not brooking these his blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, accused him therof (vpon his Oath) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Iustice of Peace; his Name the Authour of this Treatise, liuing far distant from that Country, could not certainly learne. This Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce (being a <hi>Puritan</hi>) did set at liberty (to the great dislike of diuers) the said Minister vpon his Answere, That what he spake, was spoken only by way of dispute and arguing: The which the Vintner most confidently denied, auerring that he spake them by way of persuasion.</p>
