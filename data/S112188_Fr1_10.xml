      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the City is meant the World: by the King and Queene, God, and
Nature: by the two elder sisters, the flesh and the will: by the last
the soule, which is the most beautifull, and the youngest, since she
is infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, after the body is fashioned: <hi>Venus,</hi> by which is
understood lust is feigned to envy her, and stirre up <hi>Cupid,</hi>
which is Desire, to destroy her: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Desire has equall
relation both to good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, he is here brought in to love the soule,
and to be ioynd with her, whom also he perswades not to see his face;
that is, not to learne his delights and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: for <hi>Adam,</hi> though he
were naked, yet he saw it not, till he had eaten of the tree of
concupiscence. And whereas, she is said to burne him, with the
despu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Lampe; by that is understood, that she vomits out the
flames of desire, which was hid in her breast; for desire the more it is
kindled, the more it burnes, and makes as it were a blister in the minde.
thus, like <hi>Eve,</hi> being made naked through desire, she is 
<pb facs="9"/>cast out of all happinesse, exhil'd from her house, and
tost with many dangers: By <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Iuno</hi> both repulsing
of her, is meant, that neither wealth, nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, can succour a
distressed soule: in the separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of severall graines, is
understood the act of the soule, which is recollection; and the
substance of, that act, her fore-past sinnes: by her going to hell and
those severall occurrences, are meant the many degrees of despaire: by
the <hi>Stygian</hi> water, the teares of repentance; and by the golden fleece,
her forgivenesse. All which, as in the argument is specified, being by
divine providence accomplisht, she is married to her spouse in
heaven.</p>
