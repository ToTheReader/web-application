The first was naturally yours, for I came from farre to give it: The last is necessarily yours: for you came from farre to take it: Both preached before you, both graced by you, your honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, your attention: So both are yours, and you are Christs,<note place="margin">1. Cor 3.22.23.</note> and Christ is Gods. I confesse they are the two extreamest in this Booke: (for so the order of time required) but he which is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the first and the last,<note place="margin">Revel. 1.11.</note> no doubt will give a blessing unto them both, in regard that the extreames and the meane, and the maine, and all was intended for his glory. They are my first Infants which the light hath seene: &amp; nature bids me to seeke forth a nourisher: and whom sitter can I finde then him who (under God) was the chiefe cause of their life,<note place="margin">Isa. 49.23.</note>
      <pb facs="5"/> and is the common nursing Father of this Church. Vouchsafe therefore Right Honourable to reflect upon him vvho desires to expresse his dutie towards you, now by sight as then by speach: especially in a worke that is accompanied with hope of profit and comfort to the Church of God. Even so Right No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord: Ride on and prosper with the word of truth and righteousnesse. Keepe open the dores of the Temple and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire it.<note place="margin">Nehem. 2.19. Ezra 7.21.
