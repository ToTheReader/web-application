   <head>TO THE RIGHT WOORSHIPFVLL, AND woorthy gentleman, Maister

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, by intermission of your noble exercises in feats of
Armes, and your studious endeuor emploied in forrein tongs: I must needes
craue at your hands, to vouchsafe some spare tyme (for your recreation)
in the intertein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your old acquaintance <hi>Pub. Terē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius:</hi> whom I
here present vnto you, in such and so much, English attire, as my poore
iudgement found fittest for him to be clad withall.</p>
   <p>Whyle he liued at <hi>Rome,</hi> his most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and
conuersation, was among the Nobilitie, and most of al other, with those
twoo noble and learned gentlemen, <hi>Laeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and <hi>Scipio
Africane:</hi> In like sort, after his death, his woorks were right currantly
accounted of, and highly commended, by the two Princes of eloquence, euen
<hi>Caesar,</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/> and <hi>Cicero:</hi> as their own vvritings do
wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the same vnto vs. Therefore, sith <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> neither aliue,
nor dead, did euer vvant a noble Moecenas to protect him: I hope that novv,
being partly put into en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, &amp; hauing cheefly chosen you for his
Patrone in Englād: you likevvise, in regard of your noble birth, &amp;
vertues, wil graunt him like curteous &amp; frendly fauour, as by these noble
men in <hi>Rome,</hi> vvas heretofore affoorded vnto him. I trust also he
shal be neuer the vvoorse vvelcome vnto you, in that he is diligently
attended on, vvith my poore name: &amp; like as my first attempt to
translate him, proceeded cheefly frō you, so look I that my labour spēt
on him, shal be fauorablie protected by your vvhich to me vvill bee a thing
much comfortable, &amp; to you nothing cūbersome. And so, fully
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, &amp; relying my selfe on your vvonted curtesies, I here make
an end: &amp; besech the almighty, stil to increase &amp; accōplish,
those his good gifts &amp; graces, vvhich he hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in you most
shining &amp; apparant.</p>
