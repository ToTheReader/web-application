      <salute>SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ooks haue euer sought out the fittest Patrons. Thinking seriously with my selfe, who might most iustly challenge the dedication of this labour at my hands, which I trust shall euer bring some light and comfort to our Grammar Schooles, I could finde none to haue thereunto a better title then your self. Sith God hath indeed made you a worthy light, for the sound loue and true aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vertue and good learning, and that euen from your tender yeares. In as much as you (contrary to the course of the greatest
<pb facs="3"/>
part of the flower of the Nobilitie and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of our age) haue addicted your selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your studies, for the good (I trust) both of the Church and Commonwealth, in stead of following the excessiue pleasures of the time; and haue moreouer in a singular maner ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested your affection towards them both, and towards all good learning to that end. Whenas out of that maintenance, which in regard of your high birth and noble line might seeme farre too little for your selfe; you haue yet separated and consecrated, as your first fruites, a portion thereof vnto the Lord, towards the maintaining of sundry poore schollers in the Vniuersitie, by whom his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie may be aduanced, and the good of his people perpetually procured. Concerning which, let me craue pardon of you (good Sir) and beare the blame, that (though contrary to your minde) I yet still desire, as I ought, that memorable loue of yours to be knowne, for the good ensample and prouoking of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others to the like: wherein one day they should finde a thousand times more comfort, doing it with vpright hearts, then in all that
<pb facs="3"/>
they shall bestow, not onely in the ouerhote pursuite of their vaine pleasures and delights, but euen in sundry other kindes, which make the fairest shew. As my selfe am euer bound in all places to acknowledge those great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, which I iustly owe vnto your selfe and that right noble house for my selfe and mine, so I hope our God will enable vs to seek euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to be answerable thereunto, as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty shall vouchsafe vs fit opportunities. What is wanting in vs, his goodnesse (I trust) will fully recompence, that you may be euer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, walking with him in this world, and liuing with him in blessednesse for euer in the heauens. And in this earnest desire, with my heartie prayers incessantly for you, that God may make you to increase daily in all true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I commend you to his heauenly grace, resting</p>
