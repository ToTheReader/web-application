   <head>To the truly religious and resolute Gentlemen of <hi>England,</hi> louing their Country and the Truth therein professed.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orthy Gentlemen, which by your words, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or writings, shew your selues worthy of so good a cause: to you which loue vertue for vertues sake, without any other collaterall respect: to you which are the stationarie sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of this Kingdome, contemning the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering cannon of Romish excommunication, and the crosse-battery of domesticall artillery: to you (next to the maine columnes of this state) I dedicate this short Poem, as an applause to your constancie, and as a <hi>Perdu</hi> to giue notice of the motions of our Aduersaries. The reasons vrging me thus to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose my selfe to an infinitie of censures are these. First the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of floting humors generally discontented. Secondly, the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Romish Pirats to surprise them. Thirdly, the drousie security of these dangerous times. Lastly the vnseasonable curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Sectaries, which (like <hi>Archimedes</hi>) seriously busie thēselues in drawing circles whilst their Country is in danger. These con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations haue beene the weights, and plummets, to set my poore inuention on worke, to performe some dutifull office to the State, in the perswasion of <hi>Vnitie,</hi> the chiefest bond of peace, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the surest fortresse against a million of straglers, which hope to prey vpon vs in our disorder and confusion. The Clergie hath already done their most faithfull, and most commendable deuoire: many of whose bookes will neuer bee answered. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, that vertuous Gentlemen, hauing ioyned experience to their learning, and valour to their experience, should shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the first rankes, to beat back the golden hopes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Alcumists, <hi>Cum semiviro Comitatu:</hi> Neuer did <hi>England</hi> inioy a King more iudicious in matters of Diuinitie then now it doth.
