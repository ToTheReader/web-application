   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, <hi>Sathan</hi> is subtile, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades vs all goes well; there needes no sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in this age; and that if any vse it, the fals humor of their braines, rather then the tainted manners of these times, provokes it. Especially this crime of customarie tartnesse is like to be layd to my charge, who haue beene (as some thinke and I feele) too busie in discouering falshood and error, and haue followed <hi>Truth too neere the heeles, to haue my teeth beaten out.</hi> But whilst my tongue is left in my head; I will say with the <hi>Prophet</hi> Psalme 37. <hi>If I forget thee, O Hierusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning: If I doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee, let my tongue cleave to the roofe of my mouth, if I preferre not Hierusalem aboue my chiefe ioy.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I must confesse I am the more earnest against these common and crying iniquities, because I my selfe was long subiected to them, and doe yet beare the scarres and cicatrices of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice both in mind, body, and fame. My mind, though not naked, yet, by the time I wasted idlely in their company, being disfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of many necessaries, for which I doe often blush; my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, though not altogether crazed, yet being older, weaker, and more subject to diseases, and neerer the graue, then either my yeares or natiue constitution would haue carried me so early: My fame, though not tainted, yet being not so odoriferous, as 
<pb facs="3"/>
becomes either my generall calling as a Christian, or particular as a Minister of Christ, <hi>a Holy and sanctified vessel of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23 24. 25.</note>
      <hi>These considerations makes me</hi> (being delivered from the bondage, though not from the body of that sinne vvhich hath done me all this mischiefe) <hi>more eager a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the common and cursed corruptions of the time, and that for three respects.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>First, to warne other men least they fall into the same snare.</p>
   <p>Secondly, to binde my selfe, that the sinnes I haue by Gods mercy broken loose from, repossesse not my <hi>mortall body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, to excite, such as haue power, to sharpen the edge of Iustice <hi>against iniquity,</hi> which beginnes to grow so strong, <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 12.</note>whilst the <hi>loue of many waxeth colde,</hi> as a sodaine ruyne, without a speedy remedy, is threatned thereby to the Church and State.</p>
   <p>Wee cry out of <hi>Popery,</hi> and there is cause; but <hi>Popery</hi> gets ground of vs whilst wee want piety to withstand it; and keepe <note place="margin">Exo. 17. 12.</note>our owne ground constantly. <hi>Aaron and Hurr</hi> want care, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and courage, to <hi>hold vp their owne hands,</hi> much more to <hi>hold vp the hands of Moses</hi> in the constant course of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice against the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> that Actuall, Magisteriall and Maiesticall kind of prayer.</p>
   <p>The corruption of manners hath broken downe our Walles, and let in that <hi>Troian Horse</hi> laden with <hi>trumperies:</hi> And for my part I feare not <hi>what they bring in</hi> so much, as I doe the <hi>In-bringers. Atheisme</hi> brings in <hi>Papisme;</hi> irreligion, superstition. All are not true <hi>Christians</hi> that are truly <hi>christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Tit. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. 16.</note>as <hi>they may deny God,</hi> so may they deny <hi>Christ lesus in their liues too.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>These being the greater number are the more dangerous: otherwise,
<pb facs="3"/>
but for these, and but that wee know these will take part with the worser <hi>part,</hi> wee would not feare the <hi>Romane Catholikes,</hi> since certainly the number of the true <hi>reformed Catholikes</hi> are in our <hi>Isle</hi> the greater and stronger. But when I looke on these assistants I tremble.</p>
   <p>First, because I know they will gladly entertayne that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is most <hi>glorious to the eye,</hi> promiseth <hi>most world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantages,</hi> and giues most <hi>satisfaction to corrupted nature,</hi> and consists for the most part in <hi>externall rites.</hi> And if Turcisme should come next, they would preferre it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Christian,</hi> as <hi>Machiavell</hi> their maister doth.</p>
   <p>Secondly, I feare lest God in Iudgement should suffer these <hi>thornes and nettles to pricke and sting vs;</hi> because whilst <note place="margin">Ios. 23. 13.</note>wee had time, occasion, yea provocation, and meanes to weede vp these <hi>weedes,</hi> wee neglected our duties, and would not doe it, but keepe them as necessary <hi>fences to the garden of God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For these feares (if now it be not too late) I propound a remedy preached before, published now, <hi>that all may reade as they <note place="margin">Habacuck. 2. 2.</note> runne.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It was our <hi>Saviours</hi> charge to <hi>Peter, When thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, helpe to strengthen thy brethren.</hi> That he denyed <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 32. Mat. 26. 70</note>
      <hi>Christ</hi> thrice, made him thrice as eager and zealous in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Christ crucified.</hi> This is my case, <hi>Sathans buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 7.</note>makes me <hi>buffet Sathan</hi> and his associates; what Coward being smitten, will not strike againe? <hi>Christ</hi> that contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the blowes of <hi>insulting souldiers</hi> and is silent, yet to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> smooth temptation, replies sharply, <hi>Get thee behinde</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 23.</note>
      <hi>me Sathan.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If any say I rayle (as that is a common aspersion cast vpon all that now speake <hi>truth in sinceritie)</hi> let them know it is against
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Sathan</hi> that I raile, though he be hid vnder the Maske <hi>of Pet<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap> himselfe,</hi> or any other high or holy <hi>Stalking-horse.</hi> Pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these euils, lend thy hand also to remoue them, according as thy place and authority giues thee strength; strike not me for striking on thy side, and taking thy soules part against sinne; <hi>(so only doe fooles and madmen)</hi> but pray for mee as I for thee, that his grace may mend vs; so that wee may helpe to mend others, and none may be so gracelesse as to shun reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or hate vs for our desires <hi>to make them better.</hi>
