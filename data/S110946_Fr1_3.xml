      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T both is, and hath beene, (Right Honourable) the bountie of a noble mynde, not to expect remuneration or satisfaction for liberalitie frankly bestowed.

I am not obliuious, neither carelesse, when, and how, your Honour (aboue my expectation) nobly satisfied the request of me your humble seruant. I am most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that the vertue of your noble heart expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing of me, but that your goodnesse might abound to my profite: vppon which occasion, and bicause I would not be accounted ingratefull, I haue both boldly passed the limittes of my duetie, and also vnlearnedly taken vpon me to set foorth some thing worthie notice, in this last voyage of our Capteine and Generall, Maister Martine Frobisher, your Honours worthie Countrie man: vnder whome (as your Honours vnworthie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant) I was one in the said voyage.

Wherein your Honour, (if it shall so please you) for recreation sake, may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, what people, countries, and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities we haue found out, since our departure from England, which haue not ben knowne before. Thus, presuming vpon hope and assuraunce of your Honours pardon for my bolde attempt herein, I rest humbly at your Lordships commaundement: wishing your time so spent in this world, that you may inioy the felicitie in the worlde to come.
