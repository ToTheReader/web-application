   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>the Lords Spirituall and Temporall,</hi> the Knights, Citizens and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses of the high Court of Parliament.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a remarkeable speech, Right Honorable, that was often vsed by a reuerend and iudicious Prelate of our Church, <hi>Doctor Aylmer</hi> of happie memorie, sometimes Lord Bishop of London, whom for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor sake I nominate, a man both for wisedome and learning not inferiour vnto any in his time; that <hi>two sorts of men troubled the peace of our Church, Papists and Apists:</hi> both which, as much as in them lieth, labour to disioynt the frame of Ecclesiasticall Policie, and to ouerthrow the whole building, that so happilie was setled by our Fathers, and bequeathed vnto vs. The one sort assault our bulwarkes on the left hand; and the other on the right. The one, hating to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, endeuour by all vile and exorbitant meanes to reenter, from whence they haue bin disseised, and to retaine still their Idolatrie; the other, imitating forreine Noueltie, vpon extremity of hatred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church of Rome, doe striue to be as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="98" facs="56"/>like the Papacie as is possible, disdaining euen the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall practise and discipline of the Primitiue Church, lest they should seeme in any thing to be imitators of them, whom they so much abhorred. The one losing their gamme by short-shooting; and the other by ouer-shooting. Finally, the one being the very plague and bane, and the other the disgrace and shame of Reformation.</p>
   <p>Incredible haue bin the practises of both sorts, for the aduantaging and aduancing either of them their owne part. The former, like a cruell Tygre, or sauage Beare, haue not ceased from continuall plotting of bloodie designements, to accomplish their mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous intendment: and the later, like a wily Foxe, creeping into the bosome of their fauourers, vnder pretense of farther reformation, haue laboured to raise iealousie and suspition against the Kings sacred Maiestie, and the reuerend Gouernours of our Church, wherby, setting all States by the eares, they might the more easily bring in their deformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline, and anarchicall ataxie. But the more the waues and billowes beate against the rock, the more are they broken, and turne into a vaine foame or froath, and yet the rocke neuer the weaker: so the more the malice of our Aduersaries, on both sides, rageth against vs, our rocke is impregnable, hurt themselues they may, but cannot harme vs.</p>
   <p>To speake no more in this place of the former sort, against the trayterous and rebellious furie of whom, your Honors haue giuen the Church of God good hope of rest, by the iust lawes that were enacted against them, at your last Session of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="99" facs="56"/>to the perpetuall eternizing of your worthie names among al posteritie. I am now enforced once againe, euen before the barre of your most iudicious Court, to maintaine the iust and holy quarrel of our Mother-Church, against the restlesse malice, and importunate cauils of her owne superstitious and turbulent Children, our factious Brethren.</p>
   <p>It may please your graue Wisdomes therefore to call to mind, that at the last Session, there was a <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatorie Pamphlet</hi> directed vnto your H H. by the <hi>Apists,</hi> (that I may so tearme them with that worthy Bishop) of the concision, to prouoke you, either to become Suiters and Suppliants vnto his excellent Maiestie in behalfe of their Cause, or else to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of it your selues: wherein also the Auctor (presuming belike he could neuer be discouered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Cimmerian brood) both vndutifully, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly accused the Christian Magistrates, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Prelats of our Church, of rigorous and cruel dealing, and so mainely cried out, as if the Gospell of Christ Iesus were banished out of this kingdome, Gods worship prophanely adulterated, and our whole Ministerie strangely corrupted, to the eternal destructiō of many thousand soules. Against which libell containing so manifest sycophancie and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable vntruths, I haue opposed an equall (I hope) and iust <hi>Consideration,</hi> dedicated in like manner euen vnto your most wise and graue Assemblie. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, as there is nothing so sincerely spoken, but some cauilling witte or other, will be ready to carpe at: so hath there stept vp another bird of the same Cimmerian nest (as he would seeme to be) an abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="100" facs="57"/>and auoucher of that most slanderous libel, who hath vndertaken the <hi>Defence</hi> thereof against the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;</hi> hauing indeed worse prouided for the credit of their cause, thē his Auctor had done before him, by how much he is the more intemperate and immodest, not sparing any man whom he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to be of his owne priuate straine and spirit, throughout the whole course of his <hi>Defence,</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing euery man at his pleasure, vpon the theatre of enuious diffammation, notwithstanding he would seeme to appeare vnder the cloake and title of a <hi>Milde and iust Defender;</hi> yet he neuer ceaseth, tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the right hand of holy Iustice, armed of GOD with a punishing power against all euill doers, and namely against schismaticall procurers, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious frequenters of priuate conuenticles and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull assemblies: and complaining of great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities with tragicall speeches, as if the like rigour had neuer been heard of in the world that they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, only (as he saith) for their conscience sake for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, which cannot conforme it selfe vnto the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Discipline, and approued Ceremonies of our Church:
<note place="margin" type="runSum">Both in the <hi>Epistle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorie of the Milde Defence and also pag</hi> 30.40, 58. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
      </note> yea, and malepertly slandering the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Assemblie of Parliament, to be a partie with them, to fauour their factious schisme, and to haue intermedled and dealt for them alreadie, therby lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe open to the iust reproofe and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all Readers. For what English man will not now condemne both these Sycophants, for false witnesses against the Church of God, the Christian Magistrates, and all the noble States of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when they shal reade or heare them in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="101" facs="57"/>things, to be so fouly diffamed, contrarie to the knowledge of all the land.</p>
   <p>Against this infamous rhapsodie therfore, I haue once againe presumed by your Honourable leaue and fauour to stand in the gap, and penned this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing <hi>Reioynder,</hi> not in mine owne defence, for I freely forgiue them, and winke at all such indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and disgraces as are offered me in particular; but lest I should seeme to forsake so holie and iust a quarrell, in maintaining, to my weake abilitie, the Glorie of GOD, in the necessarie defence of his Church and the honour of our reuerend Bishops in their most lawfull, equall and moderate procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, against the schismaticall disturbers both of Church and Common-wealth. All which I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly submit vnto the iudicious censure, as of all indifferent Readers in generall, so of your HH. in particular, who, I hope, will be satisfied better with that which may bee rather sure for defence, than faire for shew; both for the graue Wisedome GOD hath endued you with, and for the accustomed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour you are wont to shew, to all such as to their power doe endeuour faithfully to serue the Lord.</p>
   <p>And now because it lieth in your power, to stay these false and slanderous exclamations, and to put a finall end to all quarrels amongst Brethren, by enacting some iust and straight LAVV, for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wilfull and obstinate Superstition of the <hi>factious Schismatique,</hi> as your Honours haue alreadie worthily done against the <hi>idolatrous Recusant:</hi> may it please your Wisedomes to consider that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof, through the blessing of God, must
<pb n="102" facs="58"/>needes be inestimable, both to the present state of the Church, in composing our home-Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and recouering those our poore Brethren, who now (alas!) are enstranged and alienated from vs, that there may bee but one flocke and one folde, as there is but one Shepheard Christ IESVS: and also to all posteritie, who hauing the holy Doctrine and Sacraments of Christ vniformely taught, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered according to the truth of the Gospell, as an inestimable treasure, left and committed vnto their trust, to be deliuered ouer from age to age to the end of the world, should haue infinite cause to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and praise God, for so vnspeakeable a benefit, and reuerently to keepe with all honour the famous names of their so Christian and noble progenitors and predecessors in euerlasting memorie.</p>
   <p>Which so honourable an ACT, for the seruice of GOD and infinite commoditie of the Church, though I bee not worthie vpon my knees to make any such motion vnto your Wisedomes yet appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the benefit thereof to be such as I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, with your gracious fauours, as kneeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the barre of your most noble Court, in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie and reuerence, I most humbly beseech your Honours for the zeale you beare to God and to his onely Sonne Christ Iesus; for the loue you haue to the faith and doctrine of the Gospell; for the pitie you must needs haue to behold the contentions and ruptures of our Church; and finally for the happie example and direction, not only of your own noble children, and childrens children, but of all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie of Christendome, to whom the knowledge
<pb n="103" facs="58"/>hereof may happely come; that it would please your Wisedomes to be the Honourable meanes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his excellent Maiestie, who (I know) cannot but Royally assent to what you shall decree herein, to vndertake so Christian and famous an enterprise, and to see so worthy an ACT performed, to the great Glorie of almightie GOD, and the perpetuall settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and quietnes of our most flourishing Church and kingdome. Which worke of immortall fame to all posteritie, if your Honours shall effect, the Church of God shall pray for you and blesse you, and the Lord IESVS shall abundantly reward you for it. Thus, leauing this most humble Suite, not of one, though offered by my vnworthie hand, nor of a few, but of the whole CHVRCH of Christ vnto your Honors godly Wisedomes, and the same vnto the happie direction of Gods holy Spirit; I come now to ioyne with my Antagonist.</p>
