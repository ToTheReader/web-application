   <head>¶ The Author to the Reader.</head>
   <p>I Could imparte vnto you many thinges touching this my present trauaile, excusing my selfe, for that I haue not called the same rather experiments, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisements, maximies, axiomies, precepts or sentē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thē cōceits: And therin to haue entermixt some morall and priuat matters, if I had not been assured that I should not preuaile. For I know very wel, that it is almost a general rule (by that I haue obserued in things past) that euery writer what good intent soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath moued him, or what trauail soeuer he hath endured for the vniuersall profit of all, yet is he euer taxed of criticall persons: forsomuch as our tunges being moued and stirred through enuie or hate, or through a certaine corruption which is brought in amongst vs, not to haue any taste but onely in our own proper matters we are much more easie drawne to speak euill, then the wisedome of him that is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, is prompt and readie to doo well. Therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring all my excuses to your vpright iudgement (when it is not driuen forward with any passion) I will onely say this that I holde for a certain, that this worke howsoeuer it be, will be of great helpe and aide to those that be studious, for that I imagine, it will enriche the priuat discourses, and the publicke actions of those that shall chaunce at any time to vse and handle these conceits in humain actions, which almost haue been euer the selfe-same in all times and amongst all men: and for that in the working and negotiating of affaires, as wel in publick as in priuat, they will minister vnto them many conditions and partes, the which conceites although they be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what generall, yet neuerthelesse they will giue no <pb facs="6"/> small light partitie: how to knowe the partes and conditions of greatest aduauntage in particular things, as well of publicke actions, as of priuate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. And although these accidents, which doo at vnawares chaunce vnto men in their affaires, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the deed dooing, are so many and so vnknowen, that they cannot be comprehended within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of precepts: therefore some vulgare persons do reprehend the studie of them: neuerthelesse, for that I presuppose I shal helpe and yeeld aide to men of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment, as my intent was, when I tooke this matter first in hand, drawing the substance (the finall end of this studie) foorth of histories, therby to take away from others, the length, tediousnes of reading and toyling themselues: I perswade my selfe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all accidents cannot be brought vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, yet that man that hath any meane assistance of diligence, &amp; that in working &amp; perfourming of thē, he be not moued nor altered more then is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent (either by his nature, or by any other newe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents) to dispose otherwise then well and aptly these actions which he meanes to bring to an end; he by great reason may receiue many benefits and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, by hauing his minde fullye replenished with these aduertisements and conditions, which he in any parte hath exercised in other operations, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther studiously read in some good and chosen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and stirred vp in his memory, only in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this hath been somewhat noisome vnto me: that I could not finde any full or perfect meanes (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the varietie of the subiect) to put them vnder firme and infallible titles for your commodities: and although I haue oftentimes conferred this difficultie <pb facs="6"/> with those excellent Gentlemen, Maister George Gradenigo and Maister Alui di Michele, as of great learning, who did enter into the same, and did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vpon it with great prudence, of Histreogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, and in matter of state, and of whom I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued great counsell in this enterprise, neuertheles they could not resolue me according to my desire. And although the foresaid gentlemen put me in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, that it would do well if I did place them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der six titles, vnder which are accustomed to light the consultations which are made in the counsels of common weales, and are drawn therinto by the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuers, and wherof Aristotle writ in his Rethorick: although they did not immediatlye come vnto the same, but as it were in consequence: at any time when the vnderstander therof would apply thēselues to their places, neuertheles I did dispose my selfe to make the table heereunto annexed, as a thing more perfect, and perchaunce more easie and short: The which although vnto some it seemes not able to serue the turne, to finde out sufficiently the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of those conceites that are fit for him, or wherin he hath need about his affaires: neuertheles, it will shewe you a way how to attain to your intent, if not in all things, yet at the least in some parte. Receiue therfore with a beneuolent minde this my good wil, to the intent, that perceiuing your ametie, I may with a feruent desire, bring ende to the second and third book of conceits, which I still am about to gather.</p>
