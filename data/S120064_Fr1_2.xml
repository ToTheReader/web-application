   <head>TO THE MOST HIGH and mighty Monarch, IAMES, by the grace of God, King of great Britaine, France and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Raffique, <hi>(Most Dread and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soueraigne)</hi> by Nature Admirable; and by Art Amiable; being the Sole peacible Instrument, to inrich Kingdomes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales: may properly be called, <hi>The
<pb facs="3"/>
Praeheminent studie of Princes;</hi> the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because the Sacred wisdome hath approued this <hi>Axiom:</hi> That a King is miserable (how rich soeuer he be:) if he Raignes ouer a poore people; and that, that Kingdome is not able to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist (how Rich and Potent soeuer the people be:) if the King bee not able to maintaine his Estate. Both which, (being Relatiues) are depending vpon Traffique and Trade, which is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnder <hi>Three Simples</hi> or <hi>Essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all parts,</hi> namely, <hi>Commodities, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and Exchange for Moneys by Bills.</hi> Whereupon hauing lately perused a <hi>Treatise</hi> intituled <hi>Free Trade,</hi> or, <hi>The meanes to make Trade flourish;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Author, either ignorantly or wilfully, hath omitted to handle <hi>The Praedominant Part of Trade,</hi> namely, <hi>the Mystery of Exchange:</hi> which is the <hi>Publike measure</hi> betweene vs and other Nations, according to which, all our Commodities are bought and sold in forraine parts: his only <hi>Scope</hi> being, to haue the Moneys of the
<pb facs="3"/>
Kingdome inhaunced in price, and the forraine Coynes made Currant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realme at high Rates, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by great inconueniences will follow:) I could not but bee moued, both by my faithfull alleageance due vnto your Maiestie, and the obseruant duty ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by mee, to the Publike good:) To make an answere to the materiall points of the saide Treatise, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring things by contraries for the better illustration; the rather for that it was published <hi>in Articulo temporis,</hi> when your Maiesties vigilant Princely Care, had beene pleased to referre the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of this important businesse of State, to the learned, Lord <hi>Vizcount Maundeuile,</hi> Lord President of your Maiesties most Honourable Priuy Councell, and other persons of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience: amongst whom (although vnworthy) my selfe was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and our opinions were certified vnto your Highnesse.</p>
   <p>For the Consideration of this weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matter of great Consequence, is
<pb facs="4"/>
absolutely to be submitted vnto your High Wisedome and <hi>Transcendent</hi> iudgement, by meanes whereof (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the saying of <hi>Epictetus</hi> the Philosopher, <hi>Hoc est Maximè iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis, Aptare Vniuersalia singularibus,)</hi> All Causes both <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</hi> are obserued, discerned and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to their proper and determinate ends.</p>
   <p>Your Maiestie therefore, may bee pleased to vouchsafe (with a gracious aspect) the reading of this small <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,</hi> which (like vnto the little fish, mentioned by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> swimming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great Whale, giuing notice of dangerous shallow places;) shall be amply explained in a Volume (almost imprinted:) intituled <hi>Lex Mercatoria,</hi> or the <hi>Auncient Lawe Merchant,</hi> which (in all humility:) is to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented vnto your most Sacred Maiesty; wherein the dangerous Rockes, (to be auoyded in the Course of Traffique, and the meanes therunto conducing:) are manifested for the preseruation and
<pb facs="4"/>
augmentation of the wealth of your Highnesse Realmes and Dominions, to bee effected by the Rule of iustice grounded vpon <hi>Aequality</hi> and <hi>Aequity</hi> according to <hi>Ius gentium,</hi> which is chiefly maintained by the <hi>Lawe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.</hi> The knowledge whereof, is of such moment, that all other Temporall Lawes (without it) are not compleate, but imperfect.</p>
   <p>Worthy of commendation, are those offices, who can by Prouidēce preserue the Treasure of Kings and Common-weales; worthier are those that both (by honest and lawfull meanes) can preserue and augment them: but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest of all immortall praise, are these, who can and doe (by easie, iust, and Politike meanes) inrich Kingdomes and Common-weales, and thereby fill the Princes Coffers with standing Treasure, to serue all occasions in the two seasons, which Princes are to care for; (obserued by the <hi>Emperour Iustinian,)</hi> namely the Time of Warre, when Armes are necessary, and the
<pb facs="5"/>
time of Peace, more fitting whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Lawes. In the <hi>Theoricke Part</hi> of which Study, I haue these forty yeares spent much time and charges at the pleasure of great personages: and albeit nothing did encounter mee but ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, yet my constancy to spend the Remainder of my dayes therein, (in hope of Practise,) is as immoueable as the continuance of my daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to the Great <hi>Iehouah,</hi> to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply your Maiesties dayes as the dayes of heauen. London the 25. of October, 1622.</p>
