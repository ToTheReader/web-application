   <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle and Curteous Reader; hauing for many yeares past spent my time both in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, practising, and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with others in, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the studie of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall Sciences, and through great paines and trauell, at the request of diuers Worshipfull Gentlemen. Merchants, and others of my very louing friends, haue at last collected and gathered together many excellent Rules and easie Abreuiations in the Science of Arithmatick, which at the entreaty, and by the meanes of the helpe of some of them, I haue at last made bold heere to present abroad vnto the worlds view, the first fruites of some idle houres studie, the most part whereof I doe acknowledge to haue gotten by the practice and vse of the most excellent Instrument, inuented by Master <hi>William Pratt,</hi> called, The Iewell of
<pb facs="4"/>
Arithmatick in which I haue done the best of my Indeauours, not to hide that Tallent in the earth, which God hath bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me for the benefit of others, but rather to his great glory and prayse, and for the benefit of my Country, and for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of all that are studious in the Art of Numbers, I haue laboured to set it forth in the most briefe, plaine, and easie manner that I could fit for the vnderstanding of the weakest and meanest capacitie. In which if any thing shall seeme obscure or doubtful to any man, I could wish my selfe were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to resolue his doubts, for I haue indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to make the Rules as briefe, short and easie, as I could deuise.</p>
   <p>In my first Book I haue intreated concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vulgar Arithmatick, with new inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my owne, in all the first foure parts of Arithmatick, <hi>viz</hi> in <hi>Addition</hi> and <hi>Subtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> with two seuerall kinds of <hi>Multiplication,</hi> not charging of the memory, neuer extant before in any Author that I haue read, with foure seuerall kinds of <hi>Diuision,</hi> the latter of them bringing the proofe by <hi>Addition</hi> of the figures vnder the diuidend, without any multiplication, or casting away of nines, according to the accustomed manner.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>Againe, in the worke of Fractions, I haue set them forth in plaine and perfit figures after another manner of my owne inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because the fractionall figures in most bookes of Arithmatick were so vnperfit, that they were scarce to be descerned, and in this manner they will performe all facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall operations, as well as if they were set out according to the vsuall manner. In the end of which Rules I haue shewed the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and proofes of fractions by the known parts of Coyne.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, in the second part of the former booke, I haue set forth Reduction, both in Coyne sterling `waights, measures, time and motion; the Tables whereof are in the first part of the book, with diuers Rules how to bring pence, or farthings at the first worke into pounds, shillings and pence; with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers questions wrought by Reduction, with Progression Arithmaticall and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall, with examples.</p>
   <p>And lastly, I haue shewed how to worke the Rule of 3 Direct and Conuerst, both in whole numbers and fractions, after diuers seuerall manners of workings, and how to find the diuisor in any question, as also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wayes to worke Fellowship, Barter,
<pb facs="5"/>
Exchange, Allegation, Interest, Position, and all other operations Arithmeticall, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and briefe Rules of euery part.</p>
   <p>In my second booke of Decimall Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, I haue first described out the parts and vse of the decimall Table, and how to set forth any number giuen in Decimalls.</p>
   <p>Secondly, I haue shewed how to worke all the seuerall parts of Arithmatick, <hi>viz. Numeration, Addition, Subtraction▪ Multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Diuision</hi> in Decimalls; with examples and proofes of euery worke in the knowne parts of Coyne.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, I haue handled in as briefe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I could, the Rule of 3 Fellowship, Barter, Exchange and Interest in Decimall Arithmatick, as before in vulgar, in which you may perceiue the great labour that is auoided, in vulgar Arithmatick, with diuers examples and proofes of the same.</p>
   <p>Lastly, I haue added a small Treatice of <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Annuities;</hi> with the manner how to calculate Tables or Breuiats at any rate, or yeares purchase giuen; all which I haue drawne into a pocket vollume. If therefore any Gentleman, Merchant, or other, be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to haue further instruction, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to my lodging in <hi>Coleman-street,</hi> I shall
<pb facs="6"/>
be ready to giue them any satisfaction.</p>
   <p>If therefore I shall find these my labours and indeauors to take that effect, which I do hope and wish for, I shall be thereby the sooner incouraged to hasten the comming forth of the third part of this volume con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the extraction of Rootes, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny easie operations and rules showing the vse of the Square and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ubicque rootes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mensurations of land Timber, Board, Glasse and Stone, and the reduction of Measures from one proportion to another by their squares giuen: and lastly, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Millitary affaires and Gunners Art; concerning the Arithmeticall worke, with demonstration by examples, which I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to haue ioyned to this vollume, but that it would haue increased it far beyond a pocket book. And so hoping of your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly censure &amp; acceptance of these first fruits of my labours, I cease, hoping to haue my true indeauors and meaning well taken, and the faults in the Printing friendly amended, desiring a blessing from God vpon these my poore labours, I take my leaue,</p>
