      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is more then halfe a yere (right worshipfull) since I handled this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the Sower, in a Sermon at London, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing instantly vrged by a friend which heard mee, to put it in writing, althogh I was very vnw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>ng, for sundrie considerations, yet I made some promise if lesure shuld serue. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when I wold very gladly haue ben released at her hands whom I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, I could by no meanes obteine it. I haue therfore at the last so nigh as I could, set down in writing, that which I then vttered in speking, I know that I haue omitted some things in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular applications, and exhortations which I made: &amp; also I haue added sōe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which either then came not to mind, or els time did not serue to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. I am bolde to present &amp; dedicate this my poore trauell vnto your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, moued therto with diuers respects as thinking my selfe in duetie bound,
<pb facs="3"/>
not onely with this common &amp; gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bond that ye are one which long time haue professed the glorious gospel of Iesus Christ: but with diuers more speciall, which are so wel knowne vnto you, that it wer needlesse for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them: only thus much, seeing I was born &amp; brought vp vnder you, my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents receiuing benefits daily frō you, I think I ought, when as I am not able to make any recompence, at least to shew some token of a grateful mind. But es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially I am moued heerevnto, with consideration of the greatest blessing which all my kindred haue enioyed by you now so long, in prouiding &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their spiritual instruction. I pray you accept of my good will, &amp; account of mee as one which praieth to the Lord for you, that he will multiplie &amp; increase his good giftes still in you, to the glorie of his holy name, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Church, &amp; your endlesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Iesus Christ. Amen.</p>
