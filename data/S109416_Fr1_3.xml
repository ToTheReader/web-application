   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He name of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is sufficient
Argument to perswade a friendly acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and from the better disposed (whome I
couet principally to please) I shall doubtlesse
receiue that reasonable and honest construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
As for those who haue their tongues
dipt in the poyson of Enuie, I write not to please them,
who wil neuer be pleasd with that which is most deseruing;
It being the nature of Enuie, to depraue that, which dooth
deserue the highest fauour of loue and good opinion. I may
example this in the wrong offered to the name of Queene
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who (though shee were the most admired of her
time) hauing extraordinary induments, and a gouernment,
much more in the degrees of honour and prosperitie, than
any her Predecessours: yet want there not malitious and
base deprauers, who (like dogges that barke against the
Sunne) couet to bite her honourable name, whome God
hath made more glorious than the Sunne, giuing her a place
of glorie, in fellowship with his holy Angelles and Saints.
For this double respect haue I therefore taken these paines:
First to please the well affected, in honouring her whome
all that haue honesty will honour: Next, in giuing Enuie
and her sonnes a morsell to bite vpon; wishing that all the
deprauers of her princely name, may either reduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
some degree of honestie, or else perish with their
enuious and euill breath, Accept then (I pray thee) these my
voluntarie trauells; and honour her remembraunce, whome
all the best in the world do honour with admiration, which
thou also wilt doe, if thou beest either honest, or truely En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.</p>
