      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout the Yeere, 1608. <hi>Ieremy,</hi> Prince of Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia dying, left 3. Sonnes, <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Bougdan,</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but 8. yeeres old, the Gouernment, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Minority, was by the deceased Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed to his Vncle <hi>Simeon,</hi> who dying within three or foure yeeres after, <hi>Constantine</hi> the eldest sonne, according to his right, and supported by the Councell of his mother, vndertooke the gouernment. At which time there liued at Constantinople, one <hi>Tomsho</hi> or <hi>Stephen,</hi> who falsly preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to bee sonne vnto <hi>Aron,</hi> who had been Prince of Moldauia before <hi>Ieremy,</hi> had by money and other sinister practices, framed
<pb facs="3"/>to his ends, <hi>Mehemet Bassha,</hi> Lieutenant to the grand <hi>Visier</hi> (which is the highest Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer vnder the <hi>Turk</hi>) and by falsly suggesting that <hi>Constantine</hi> refused to pay the yeerely tribute of forty thousand Chequines to the great <hi>Turke,</hi> obtained from him an Army of 20000. men vnder the conduct of a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Generall, to expell Prince <hi>Constantine,</hi> and establish himselfe in the gouernment. And notwithstanding <hi>Constantine</hi> endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to giue all due satisfaction to this Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Generall, and made euident the fraud and falshood of <hi>Tomsho,</hi> yet hee being also corrupted by <hi>Tomsho's</hi> bribes and great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, would admit no reason. Wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Prince <hi>Constantine</hi> making head to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himselfe and Country, was in a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile ouercome, taken prisoner, and after, seeking to escape, drowned in the Riuer Niestre. <hi>Tomsho,</hi> after this victory, being thrust into the Gouernnment, &amp; indeuoring to keepe by tyranny, what he had gotten by iniustice and vsurpation, the Nobility at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by armes to free themselues and their Country from his vnspeakable cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but with successe vnworthy their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
<pb facs="3"/>for, by an ouerthrow, both his malice, and the Countries misery increased. In which disaster, the greatest part of them fly into <hi>Poland,</hi> the refuge of the vnfortunate Princesse with her remaining children, and the Tribunall from which their country was in iustice to expect a Gouernour: the <hi>Polonians</hi> hauing by ancient Articles, and capitulations betweene the <hi>Turke</hi> and them, to the end their Kingdome might not be preiudiced by that neighbour Prouince, which though Christian, was yet tributary to the <hi>Turk,</hi> reserued to themselues the right and interest to name a <hi>Vaiuod,</hi> or Prince ouer that Country. And to this purpose the King of <hi>Poland</hi> sent an Embassadour to Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, whom the Great <hi>Turke,</hi> contrary, to the Law of Nations, Turkishly answered by detaining him prisoner, and euer since hath threatened that most Noble, and Christian Kingdome, with vtter subuersion, hauing (as it is probably conceiued) to that end drawne all his forces out of <hi>Asia,</hi> and made a greater leuy in <hi>Europe,</hi> then hath beene knowne in that Empire, consisting (by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)
<pb facs="4"/>of foure hundred thousand men; an Armie sufficient to satisfie the most coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, or religious Christian Souldier with riches, or glory.</p>
