   <head>The iust indignation the <hi>Author</hi> tooke at the vulgar censure of his <hi>Play,</hi> by some malicious <hi>spectators,</hi> begat this following <hi>Ode</hi> to himselfe.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>COme leaue the lothed stage,</l>
      <l>And the more lothsome age:</l>
      <l>Where pride, and impudence (in faction knit)</l>
      <l>Vsurpe the chaire of wit!</l>
      <l>Indicting, and arraigning euery day</l>
      <l>Something they call a Play.</l>
      <l>Let their fastidious, vaine</l>
      <l>Commission of the braine</l>
      <l>Run on, and rage, sweat, censure, and condem'n:</l>
      <l>They were not made for thee, lesse, thou for them.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Say, that thou pour'st them wheat,</l>
      <l>And they will acornes eat:</l>
      <l>'Twere simple fury, still, thy selfe to waste</l>
      <l>On such as haue no taste!</l>
      <l>To offer them a surfet of pure bread,</l>
      <l>Whose appetites are dead!</l>
      <l>No, giue them graines their fill,</l>
      <l>Huskes, draffe to drinke, and swill.</l>
      <l>If they loue lees, and leaue the lusty wine,</l>
      <l>Enuy them not their palate's, with the swine.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="62"/>
      <l>No doubt some mouldy tale,</l>
      <l>Like <hi>Pericles;</hi> and stale</l>
      <l>As the Shrieues custs, and nasty as his fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scraps, out euery dish,</l>
      <l>Throwne forth, and rak'tinto the common tub,</l>
      <l>May keepe vp the <hi>Play-club:</hi>
      </l>
      <l>There, sweepings doe as well</l>
      <l>As the best order'd meale.</l>
      <l>For, who the relish of these ghests will fit,</l>
      <l>Needs set them, but, the almes-basket of wit.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And much good do't you then:</l>
      <l>Braue <hi>plush,</hi> and velu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      <l>Can feed on orts: And safe in your stage-clothes,</l>
      <l>Dare quit, vpon your oathes,</l>
      <l>The stagers, and the stage-wrights too (your peeres)</l>
      <l>Of larding your large eares</l>
      <l>With their foule <hi>comick</hi> socks;</l>
      <l>Wrought vpon twenty blocks:</l>
      <l>Which, if they are torne, and turn'd, &amp; patch't enough,</l>
      <l>The gamesters share your guilt, and you their stuffe.</l>
   </lg>

      <pb facs="63"/>
      <l>Leaue things so prostitute,</l>
      <l>And take the <hi>Alcaick</hi> Lute;</l>

      <l>Warme thee, by <hi>Findares</hi> fire:</l>
      <l>And though thy nerues be shrunke, and blood be cold,</l>
      <l>Ere yeares haue made thee old;</l>
      <l>Strike that disdaine-full heate</l>
      <l>Throughout, to their defeate:</l>
      <l>As curious fooles, and enuious of thy straine,</l>
      <l>May, blushing, sweare no palsey's in thy braine.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But, when they heare thee sing</l>
      <l>The glories of thy <hi>King,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>His zeale to <hi>God,</hi> and his iust awe o're men;</l>
      <l>They may, blood shaken, then,</l>
      <l>Feele such a flesh-quake to possesse their powers:</l>
      <l>As they shall cry, like ours</l>
      <l>In sound of peace, or warres,</l>
      <l>No Harpe ere hit the starres;</l>
      <l>In tuning forth the acts of his sweet raigne:</l>
      <l>And raysing <hi>Charles</hi> his chariot, 'boue his <hi>Waine.</hi>
