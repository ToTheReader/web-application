   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the causes of all publique ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and of the scourges where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall diuerse realmes &amp; countries are grieuously chastised: S. Paul ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of the notable abuse &amp; contempt of the Lord his Supper. <hi>For this cause,</hi> saith he, <hi>manie are weake &amp; sicke among you, &amp; many sleepe: for if we would iudge our selues, we should not be iudged.</hi> Wherupon we haue not to meruaile, that the Lord God hath so sharply punished this poore realme of France the last yeare, <hi>1562.</hi> with plague, warre, and famine, seeing it is manifest that the contempt of the Gospel with the abusing and profaning of the holie Supper of the Lord, hath brought vpon vs the foresaid miseries &amp; afflictions. And for this cause, both the Pope his adherents may stop their mouthes, with the which they are so readie to cast reproch vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our God, and they that make profession of the Gospel in this lan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> may keepe like silence, seeing the causes haue flowed from both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties indifferently, and the fault belongeth as wel to the one, as to the other. To begin with the Papists, we may boldly auouch out of the word of God, that their Masse is stuffed full of blasphemies: that it abolisheth the holy Supper of our Lord Iesus Christ: that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his death &amp; passion is therein suppressed &amp; made o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

his name, to take, eate, and drinke the bread and wine, in the Masse there is but one that taketh, eateth &amp; drinketh for all the rest. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we see how there the creature of God, euen a morsell of breade, is worshiped in the place of God himselfe the creator: how they seeke Christ Iesus vpon the earth, whereas the word of God, the Creed of the Apostles, and the ancient Canons do teach vs to haue our hearts lifted vp on high, and to seeke him by Faith aboue in the heauens. Lastlie, in it we may behold manie other most shamefull and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous abuses, which for this time I thinke best to couer with silence. Now seing that manie do so stoutly and obstinately stand vpon that point, that in the defence and quarrell of a thing so vile &amp; wicked, they haue put to death so manie godlie and honest men, so many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie personages and true martyrs of our Lord Iesus Christ, I conclude that we haue iustly beene visited of God for their offences. As for the Protestants, we see they also haue beene marked with the foule spots and blemishes of manie grosse and notable abuses. How many of them haue bin found as vnable to render reason of their Faith as verie Papists, &amp; haue offered, like bruit beasts, their presence at the holy Supper of the Lord, some for learning as ignorant as Asses, others for life, as beastly as swyne. I ouerpasse an infinite number of hypocrites, of false brethren, of traitours, and such as haue fallen from their faith and knowledge, who being inwardly vnknowen, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried outwardly a shew &amp; colour of great vertue and holynes. And therfore not without cause hath the wrath of God beene kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his people, and they haue receaued double correction, seeing that in the strength of their knowledge they haue wittingly abused the knowledge of his holy name. Now to the intent that our good God by his Sonne Iesus Christ may cast his eye of pitie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion vpon this poore realme that lieth so desolate and forlorne: it behooueth the one &amp; the other henceforth to learne, how they may better performe their dutie of seruice and honor to their God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his word, then they haue done in time passed: and chieflie that they be verie circumspect and heedfull not to defile or profane the holie Supper of our Lord in any kind of condition whatsoeuer. To this end I haue addressed this small Treatise vnto their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, wherin they shall find that the true preparing vnto the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, consisteth not in the furniture of the bodie, in rich and costlie attire, in gorgious and statelie shewes, in counterfait colours, and in outward professing of the name of God: but in purenesse of heart and vprightnesse of conscience, that God which is a Spirit, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be worshiped of his in Spirit and truth.</p>
