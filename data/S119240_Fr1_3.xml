      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter this not onely Prince of Poets, but Philosophers, had written his two great Poems, of <hi>Iliads</hi> &amp; <hi>Odysses</hi>; which (for their first Lights borne before all Learning) were worthily call'd the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone</hi> of the Earth; (finding no compensation) he writ, in contempt of Men, this ridiculous Poem of Vermin, giuing them Nobility of Birth, valorous elocution not inferior to his <hi>Heroes.</hi> At which the Gods themselues put in amaze, call'd Counsailes about their assistance of either Armie, and the iustice of their Quarrels, euen to the mounting of <hi>
