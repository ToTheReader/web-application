   <head>THE PREFACE, BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING AN INDVCTION TO the following Discourse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I well know, that it is an hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to perswade people to aduenture into strange Countries; especially to remaine and settle themselues there, though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions thereof be neuer so beneficiall and aduantageous for them: yet I cannot be out of all hope, that when it shal be taken into consideration, what infinite riches and aduantages other Nations (and in particular the Spaniards and Portugals) haue gotten to themselues by their many Plantations, not onely in <hi>America,</hi> but also in <hi>Barbary, Guinnie, Binnie,</hi> and other places: And when it shall plainely appeare, by the following Discourse, that the Countrey of <hi>New-found-land</hi> (as it is here tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly described) is little inferior to any other for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities thereof; and lies, as it were with open armes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>England,</hi> offering it selfe to be imbraced, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by vs; I cannot be out of hope (I say) but that my Countreymen will be induced, either by the thriuing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of others, or by the strength of reason, to hearken, and put to their helping hands to that, which will in all likelyhood yeeld them a plentifull reward of their labors. But before I enter into discourse of the Countrey it selfe, I
<pb facs="7"/>
hold it fit to make knowne partly the meanes and degrees, whereby I attained vnto the experience and knowledge I haue thereof.</p>
   <p>And first, for mine owne poore estate and condition, it is well knowne, that my breeding and course of life hath been such, as that I haue long time set many people on worke, and spent most of my dayes in trauell, specially in Merchandizing, and Sea-Voyages. I haue been often in <hi>France, Spaine, Italy, Portugall, Sauoy, Denmarke, Norway, Spruceland,</hi> the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and <hi>Soris</hi> Ilands: and for the <hi>New-found-land,</hi> it is almost so familiarly knowne to me as my owne Countrey.</p>
   <p>In the yeere <hi>1588.</hi> I serued vnder the then Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, as Captaine in a ship of my owne, set foorth at my charge against the Spanish <hi>Armada:</hi> and after such time as that seruice was ended, taking my leaue of his Honour, I had his fauourable Letters to one Sir <hi>Robert Dennis,</hi> in the County of <hi>Deuon,</hi> Knight; whereby there might bee some course taken, that the charge as well of my owne ship, as also of two other, and a Pinnace, with the victuals, and men therein imployed, should not be any way burthensome to me. Wherein there was such order giuen by the then right Honourable Lords of the priuie Councell, that the same was well satisfied; which seruice is to bee seene recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Booke at White-Hall.</p>
   <p>Now, to expresse some of my Voyages to the <hi>New-found-land,</hi> which make most for the present purpose:</p>
   <p>My first Voyage thither, was about <hi>40.</hi> yeeres since, in a worthy ship of the burthen of <hi>300.</hi> Tunne, set forth by one Master <hi>Cotton</hi> of <hi>South-hampton;</hi> we were bound to the grand Bay (which lieth on the Northside of that Land,) purposing there to trade then with the Sauage
<pb facs="7"/>
people, (for whom we carried sundry commodities) and to kill Whales, and to make Trayne oyle, as the Biscaines doe there yeerely in great abundance. But this our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Voyage was ouerthrowne, by the indiscretion of our Captaine, and faint-heartednesse of some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of our Company: whereupon we set saile from thence, and bare with <hi>Trinity Harbor</hi> in <hi>Newfound-land:</hi> where we killed great store of Fish, Deere, Beares, Beauers, Seales, Otters, and such like, with abundance of Sea-fowle: and so returning for England, wee arriued safe at South-hampton.</p>
   <p>In a Voyage to that Countrey about <hi>36.</hi> yeeres since, I had then the command of a worthy Ship of <hi>220.</hi> Tun, set forth by one Master <hi>Crooke</hi> of <hi>South-hampton:</hi> At that time Sir <hi>Humfrey Gilbert,</hi> a <hi>Deuonshire</hi> Knight, came thither with two good Ships and a Pinnace, and brought with him a large Patent, frō the late most renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and in her name tooke possession of that Countrey, in the Harbour of S. <hi>Iohns,</hi> wherof I was an eye-witnesse. He sailed from thence towards <hi>Virginia;</hi> and by reason of some vnhappy direction in his course, the greatest Ship he had, strucke vpon Shelues, on the Coast of <hi>Canadie,</hi> and was there lost, with most part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in her: And hee himselfe being then in a small Pinnace of <hi>20.</hi> Tun, in the company of his Vice-Admiral, (one Captaine <hi>Hayes)</hi> returning towards England, in a great storme, was ouerwhelmed with the Seas, and so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.</p>
   <p>In another Voyage I made thither, about <hi>34.</hi> yeeres past, wherein I had the command of a good Ship partly mine owne; at that time one Sir <hi>Bernard Drake</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonshire,</hi> Knight, came thither with a Commission, and
<pb facs="8"/>
hauing diuers good Ships vnder his command, he there tooke many <hi>Portugall</hi> Ships laden with fish, and brought them into <hi>England</hi> as Prizes.</p>
   <p>Omitting to speake of other Voyages I made thither, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the late Queenes Raigne, I will descend to later times.</p>
   <p>In the yeere <hi>1611.</hi> being in <hi>New-found-land,</hi> at which time that famous Arch-Pirate, <hi>Peter Easton,</hi> came there, and had with him ten sayle of good Ships well furnished and very rich, I was kept eleuen weekes vnder his commaund, and had from him many golden promises, and much wealth offered to be put into my hands, as it is well knowne: I did perswade him much to desist from his euill course; his intreaties then to me, being, that I would come for <hi>England,</hi> to some friends of his, and sollicite them to become humble petitioners to your Maiestie for his pardon: but hauing no warrant to touch such goods, I gaue him thankes for his offer; onely I requested him to release a Ship that he had taken vpon the Coast of <hi>Guin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> belonging to one Captaine <hi>Rashly</hi> of <hi>Foy</hi> in <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall;</hi> a man whom I knew but only by report: which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly released. Whereupon I prouided men, victuals, and a fraught for the said Ship, and so sent her home to <hi>Dartmouth</hi> in <hi>Deuon,</hi> though I neuer had so much as thanks for my kindnesse therein. And so leauing <hi>Easton,</hi> I came for <hi>England,</hi> and gaue notice of his intention, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting passe my Voyage that I intended for <hi>Naples,</hi> and lost both my labour and charges: for before my arriuall, there was a Pardon granted, and sent him from <hi>Ireland.</hi> But <hi>Easton</hi> houering with those Ships and riches vpon the Coast of <hi>Barbary,</hi> as he promised, with a longing desire, and full expectation to be called home, lost that hope, by a too much delaying of time by him who carried the Pardon.
<gap reason="missing" extent="2+ pages">
         <desc>〈2+ pages missing〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="8"/>
too much delaying of time by him who carried the Pardon. Whereupon he sayled to the Straights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> and was afterwards entertained by the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> vnder whom he liued rich.</p>
   <p>I was there also in the yeere <hi>1614.</hi> when Sir <hi>Henry Manwaring</hi> was vpon that Coast, with fiue good Ships strongly prouided; he caused me to spend much time in his company, and from him I returned into <hi>England;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I was bound from thence to <hi>Marsellis,</hi> to make sale of such goods as I then had, and other imployments, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>In the yeere <hi>1615.</hi> I returned againe to <hi>New-found-land,</hi> carrying with me a Commission out of the high Court of Admiraltie, vnder the great Seale thereof, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising me to empannell Iuries, and to make inquirie vpon oath, of sundry abuses and disorders committed amongst Fishermen yeerely vpon that Coast, and of the fittest means to redresse the same, with some other poynts, hauing a more particular relation to the Office of the Lord Admirall.</p>
   <p>What was then there done, by vertue of that Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was wholly executed at my owne charge, hath been at large by me already certified into the high Court of Admiraltie. Neuerthelesse, seeing the same hath been ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slipt euer since, and not produced these good effects which were expected, I will, in some conuenient place of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, set downe a briefe collection of some part of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours spent in that seruice; not doubting but it will be as auaileable for the furtherance of our intended designe, as any other reason I shall deliuer.</p>
   <p>In the yeere <hi>1616.</hi> I had a Ship at <hi>New-found-land</hi> of <hi>100.</hi> Tun, which returning laden from thence, being bound for <hi>Lisbone,</hi> was met with by a French Pyrate of <hi>Rochell,</hi> one <hi>Daniel Tibolo,</hi> who rifted her, to the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb facs="9"/>
and losse of my Voyage, in more then the summe of <hi>860.</hi> pounds, and cruelly handled the Master and the Company that were in her: and although I made good proofe thereof at <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and represented the same also to this Kingdome, as appertained, after my returne from thence; yet for all this great losse, I could neuer haue any recompence.</p>
   <p>Shortly after my returne from <hi>Lisbone,</hi> I was sent for by a Gentleman, who about a yeere before, by a grant from the Patentees, had vndertaken to settle people in <hi>New-found-land;</hi> he acquainted me with his designes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some conference touching the same, we so concluded, that he gaue me a conueyance vnder his hand and seale for the terme of my life, with full power to gouerne within his circuit vpon that Coast; whereupon (being desirous to aduance that worke) in <hi>Anno 1618.</hi> I sayled thither in a Shippe of my owne, which was victualled by that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, my selfe and some others. We likewise then did set forth another Ship, for a fishing Voyage, which also carried some victuals for those people which had been formerly sent to inhabite there: but this Ship was intercepted by an English erring Captaine (that went forth with Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rawleigh)</hi> who tooke the Master of her, the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaine and two other of the best men, with much of her victuals (the rest of the Company for feare running into the woods) and so left the Ship as a Prize, whereby our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Fishing Voyages of both our Shippes were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and the Plantation hindered.</p>
   <p>Now seeing it pleased your Maiestie many yeeres since, to take good notice of the said <hi>New-found-land,</hi> and granted a Patent for a Plantation there, wherein many Honorable and worthy mens endeuours, and great charge
<pb facs="9"/>
therein, haue deserued good commendations (as is well knowne) the which I desire to further with all my best en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours: and not to disgrace or disable the foundation and Proiects of others, knowing they haue been greatly hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Pyrats and some erring Subiects that haue arriued vpon that Coast; it being indifferent to mee, whether there be a new foundation laide, or whether it be builded on that which hath already been begun; so that the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation goe forward. Yet I may truly say, that hitherto lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hath been performed to any purpose, by such as therein were imployed, worthy the name of a Plantation, or answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the expectation and desert of the Vndertakers; neither haue such good effects followed, as may be expected from a thorow performance hereafter. And seeing that no man hath yet published any fit motiues or inducements, whereby to perswade men to aduenture, or plant there; I haue presumed plainely to lay downe these following rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which is the principall end I aime at, whereby to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that worke so worthily intended, by prescribing fit means how a Plantation might be settled there; and haue therefore vndertaken it, as well to discharge my conscience, which hath often prompted me thereunto, as hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to stir vp many of your Maiesties good and religious Subiects, duely to weigh the pietie, honour and benefit that will arise from such a worke, considering how your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Kingdomes doe abound and ouerflow with people. And although I haue often suffered great losses by Pyrates and Sea-Rouers, and other casualties of the Sea, yet in this poynt, I haue tasted of Gods exceeding great mercy, that neuer any Ship, wherin I my selfe was present, miscarried, or came then to any mischance, or any casualty of the Sea, whereunto all Ships are subiect: so as I may well say, that
<pb facs="10"/>
my life hath been a mixture of crosses and comforts, wherein neuerthelesse they haue not been so equally ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, but that the one hath ouerweighed the other: for now, after more than forty yeeres spent in the foresaid courses, there remaines little other fruite vnto me, sauing the peace of a good conscience, which giues me this testimony, that I haue euer been a loyall Subiect to my Prince, and a true louer of my Countrey, and was neuer as yet in all my time beholding to any Doctors counsell, or Apothecaries drugs, for the preseruation of my health; and it will be to me a contentment, if I may be so happy, as to become the instrument of any publike good heerein: And so I descend to the particular Relation of the Countrey, &amp;c.</p>
