   <head>TO
GREAT BRITTAYNES GREAT
HOAPE, CHARLES, PRINCE OF
WALES, &amp;c.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>SIR:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>THis my ensueing Discourse of <hi>Votivae Angliae,</hi>
which in a Manuscript I sent to the King your Father,
on New-yeares day last; I now (in zeale and humilitie)
direct and send to your Highnesse in Print; I wrote it then to
his Maiestie, in fauour of the neglected Estate, and deiected, and
deplorable Fortunes, of the most Excellent Princesse (the Ladie
<hi>Elizabeth)</hi> your Sister; of the Illustrious Prince <hi>Pallatyne</hi>
her Husband, and theyr royall Progenie, for the vniust losse,
and shamefull detention of theyr <hi>Pallatynat</hi> and <hi>Electorat,</hi>
by the <hi>Trium-virat</hi> of Vsurpers, the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> the
<hi>Emperour,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> I send it now to your
Highness, that (next under God) you (resembling your selfe)
will please to lend your best assistance and give your best
furtherance, to drawe foorth the King your Fathers Sword for
the happie restitution and reconquering thereof, whervnto the
tyes of Religion, Empire, and Honnor, infalliblie oblige hym.</p>
   <p>The eyes of the whole <hi>Christian</hi> world, (as soe manie Lynes
conducing to theyr Centre) are constantlie and curiouslie fixed
on the Glorious action, to see whether Great <hi>Brittayne</hi> (in this
iust and famous quarrell) will couragiouslie resolue to redeeme
her lost Honnor, or else cowardlie consent to lose it without anie
further sence, or hoape of redemption.</p>
   <p>Your Highness cannot looke on your selfe without seeing your
<pb facs="3"/>
Illustrious Sister; nor see her without looking on her Princelie
Posteritie, sith you have as deepe Interest in theyr Blood, as your
owne heart hath in you. O then how can your Highness (whom
Grace and Nature, your Blood and your Vertues, haue made one
of the greatest Princes of the world) permit to see, or liue to
permit; That these <hi>Austrian</hi> Princes (whose malice is as
boundless as theyr Ambition and Treacherie) should, in a tyme
of a firm &amp; setled Peace, thus perfidiouslie bereaue them of theyr
Honnors, and thus treacherouslie rob them of theyr Inheritance
and Patrimonie, yea and reduce them to soe extreame a poynt of
Calamitie and Miserie, that you are inforced to behold Pittie▪
Griefe, Dispayre, and Ruyne, to act theyr severall partes uppon
the Stage, and Theatre of theyr afflictions. O that this Affront
and Indignitie, should bee offred them in the Reigne of a King
soe Wise, and Potent, as your Father; and tollerated in the life
of a Prince soe generous and magnanimous, as your Highnesse,
her Brother, yea her onlie Brother, as shee is your onlie Sister.</p>
   <p>But the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> (the head and Oracle of the House
of <hi>Austria)</hi> hath not onlie wronged the Princess your Sister in
<hi>Germanie,</hi> but your Highness likewise in <hi>Spayne,</hi> as if (in
an inveterat and premeditated quarrell) hee made it aswell his
delight, as glorie, to abuse, and seeke the disgrace and ruyne of
the Blood of Great <hi>Brittayne;</hi> Wherof I hoape your Highness,
this Illustrious and famous Parliament, and the thrice Noble
Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> hath now made the King your Father
sensibly confident, as before hee was confidentlie incredulous
therof.</p>
   <p>In a reciprocall requitall and revenge wherof (because these
manifestlie malicious affronts of <hi>Spayne,</hi> towards our
Souveraigne, and his Royall posteritie, are of too contemptible
<pb facs="3"/>
and pernitious a Nature, to bee suffered; and of too fatall and
dangerous a consequence to bee digested and tollerated) all the
Subiects of this Kingdome, (except those fierie Transalpine, and
factious Transmaryne <hi>English,</hi> whoe have onlie theyr bodyes
heere, but theyr harts in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spayne,)</hi> doe vehementlie
desire Warre with <hi>Spayne,</hi> as knowing it necessarie for our
Estate, and safe and honnorable for our King, and his Royall
Posteritie; yea, they all vniversallie applaud this highe and
prudent Court of Parliament, for motioning and seeking that
Warre, infinitlie honnor your Highness for soliciting and
advancing it, and exceedinglie blesse the King your Father for
approving and consenting thervnto, by his Royall <hi>Declaration,</hi>
which will make his Name famous, and his Fame immortallie
glorious to all posteritie.</p>
   <p>Yea it seemes Heaven and Earth concurre with us in this
happie resolution, to take downe the Ambition and pride, and to
curbe the power and mallice of <hi>Spayne.</hi> For the distaste of
the <hi>French,</hi> the Defiance of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the Iealousie of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> and the zeale and resolution of <hi>England,</hi>
(now demonstrated in her Representive bodie the Parliament,
whoe cheerfullie proffer theyr whole Estates and Lives, to soe
Iust, soe necessarie, and soe Honnorable a Warre,) the Honnor
and safetie of our owne Estate; the Glorie of GOD, and the
defence and protection of his afflicted Spouse the Church, doth
agayne and agayne invyte your Highness Sword, and c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>niure his
Maiesties last and speedie resolution to beginne this Warre.</p>
   <p>For it is not enough for the King your Father, your Highness,
and the Parliament, to give a forme to your Militarie Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
except yee (cast off all delayes, remove all letts, obstacles
and procrastinations, which may retard or oppose it,) give a life
<pb facs="4"/>
to that forme, and a resolution to that life by drawing your
Contemplation into Action, that our Ships and selues may bee in
a readiness to prevent <hi>Spayne,</hi> ere <hi>Spayn</hi> bee readie to prevent
us; and of power to strike him, ere hee can possiblie bee suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie
powerfull to threaten us; and that our Regiments and
Squadrons bee inrolled, and in sight of theyr Coullers, and ready
to March at the verie first calle of the Drumme, sith <hi>England,</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> never sawe feare but in the fronts and faces of
our Enemyes, and alwayes went to the Warres as to a Ioyfull
Wedding, or to an assured Victorie and Triumph.</p>
   <p>Great Prince, you saw and understood what a world of ioyfull
Bonfires, (or fires of Ioye) wee made, when your Highnesse
returned from <hi>Spayne,</hi> with as much safetie as you went foorth
with danger, yea our zeale and affection is soe ardent to your
Highness, because your Obedyence is such to the King your Father,
that wee shall iustlie hold our selues wronged of the Parliament,
if they (for themselues &amp; the whole Kingdom) be not Peticioners
to the King your Father, that hee will please to ordayne, that wee
may Religiouslie keepe and obserue two newe Holidayes and
Festivals, and that they may bee henceforth marked with
Rubrickes in our Almanacks, to the end that not onlie our selues
but our Posteritie may yearelie celebrate and obserue them, with
a world of Bonfires of Ioy and ioyfull shouts and acclamations
of reioycing; <hi>viz.</hi> The 5th of October, the day of your Highness
arrivall from <hi>Spayne,</hi> and the 24th of March following, the
day that your Match with <hi>Spayne</hi> was broken off, and Warres
declared for the restoring of the Count <hi>Pallatyne</hi> and his Heyres
to theyr <hi>Pallatynat</hi> and <hi>Electorat.</hi> That as wee therin doe
nowe participate of the causes of our Ioy, soe they hereafter may
enioye them by feeling and enioying the effects therof; For, for
<pb facs="4"/>
the honnor &amp; safetie of our King, and of all his Royall Posteritie,
and for the flourishing prosperitie &amp; welfare of the Church and
Estate of the <hi>Israell</hi> of our Great <hi>Brittayne;</hi> hee is not a true
Subiect, a faythfull and loyall-harted <hi>Britton,</hi> noe nor the sonne
of an honnest man, that is not ready and willing to beare his life
on the poynt of his Sword, and (if occasion present) to lose it,
rather then to retayne and preserue it in soe Iust and Honnorable
a quarrell.</p>
   <p>And your Highness (for seconding and fortifying of this your
Royall Fathers Warlike resolutions, agaynst his Maiesties, your
owne, and your Illustrious Sisters Enemyes, in the Two mayne
poynts of our Welfare and Honnor, <hi>(Englands</hi> preservation,
and the <hi>Pallatynats</hi> restitution) will accumilate and heape upp,
a whole world of Blessings and benedictions, on your Princelie
head from your Fathers good Subiects; whoe with one Tongue,
one heart, one affection, and one soule, will (with as much Ioy as
zeale, and as much zeale as Dutie) Pray unto God for the long
prosperous and victorious Life of the King your Father, (my
Gracious Souveraigne) of your Royall selfe, of our Gracious
Princess your Sister, of the Illustrious Prince her Husband, and
theyr Royall posteritie, The which none shall performe with
more true Zeale, and unfeigned Devotion, then</p>

humblie Devoted Seruant.
