   <p>OLiuer, if your name be Oliuer, by your leaue a cast, for I must show in betweene the doore and the wal, that is shuffle a letter in betweene your title and Pamphlets which Letter was directed to be let at the two fooles at London bridge: and for my hart I cannot finde the signe. Now since your Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet lackes both a Passe and a Patrone, I thinke this letter wil fit ye for either, and by wandring among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, happen at length into the right owners hands. It followes at auenture.
<q>
         <p>To Simon Huff-snuff the terrible Book-tearer, &amp; furious d-facer of the Tripe-wiues effigies, peace offered with cap and knee, to preserue all papers from like extremitie.</p>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>HAught minded, and hot spirited Simon, I salute ye. Understanding your valarous assaults against <hi>The Tricking of the Tripe-wife,</hi> in sundrie places: I could but commend your forwardnes: and praise your adus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed opinion vpon the first sight, both of the Author that made it, and of them that neuer heard of it before your selfe: twas well done, you shall finde <hi>Castalian</hi> of my minde, that of such swift censurers hath this sentence:
<q>
         <l>
            <hi>A fooles bolt is soone shot,</hi>
         </l>
         <l>
            <hi>Adpenitendum proper at, cito qui indicat.</hi>
         </l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Tut, what tell I you of repentance, proceed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, your neighbor Nichol and you may answere any
<pb facs="3"/>
thing you do. By your leave sir a little: and while I talke, haue some patience, glare not with your eyes, fome not at the mouth, strike not with your fists, stamp not with your feete: I will reason reasonably vppon my honestie, &amp; yet I care not if I leave argument, and vse example.</p>
   <p>A quaint fellow growen fortunate: excelling as hee thinkes both in wealth and wisedome all his other ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualls, forges to himselfe an imaginarie concept, that they enuying his good, intend to haue publike iests at him and his late won wife. The most of them whose good fortunes it was to loose (as it had been great pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to part so loving a couple) are most Scholler-like Gentlemen, and one of them generally beloued of act that in printing haue experience to publish any thing, &amp; at this time is possest of a worshipfull place, according to the laudable customes of this honorable Citie. Now which way in your opinion is best to preuent the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or publishing of anie odde toy: shall hee reconcile himselfe to those that were the <hi>quondam</hi> suters, &amp; giue good words, because his widdow hath been notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ridiculous: Or shall be run vp and downe the town, with friskes, and heighs, and fillops, and trickes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with some such wise-akers as himselfe, (Be not offended <hi>Simon,</hi> though you be his companion) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiling his betters, and abusing his equalls. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample needes no application: and for answere your neighbor <hi>Nichol</hi> tooke this last course. For I haue heard him that trickt the Tripe wife sweare, till her husband abused him, and your selfe consorting with Nick Trickes misused his whole companie, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters especially, one of them in kindnes and reuerence
<pb facs="3"/>
that honourable name yee vsde, vouchsafing both to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie and counsell you for your owne good: whose good will you rewarde with reproches: but they that touch pitch shall bee settled, and those that pleasure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull persons vnthankfully required. He protests before God, that the Masters of his Companie, are vtterly ignorant of his proceedings, and for ought hee knoweth are at him offended. He appeales to all the worshipfull Companies in <hi>London,</hi> especially to those of whom your selues are free, whether ye haue not done the parts of intemperate idiots, to abuse men in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie without cause: and protests, had he been but a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man, as he is a professor of the most noble Science of Printing, hee wound not haue suffered the abuse of his supertors. He repenteth not anie thing that he hath written, but is onely sorrie that he is by an honorable personage mistaken: but doubteth not shortly to proue how you haue abused one verie nere him. He sweares that where he hath been a mortall enime to all Ballad singers, he will neuer inuaigh against them more, if they will sing at pour windowes a new Tigge, termed <hi>Anie Tripes.</hi> Consider neighbor <hi>Simon</hi> the contents, to wast paper be pitifull, and learne patience: keepe a good tung in your head, least it hurt your teeth. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>Sim,</hi> and commend me to your euerthwart neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>

      <signed>Yours to vse, when ye know how to vse your selfe.
