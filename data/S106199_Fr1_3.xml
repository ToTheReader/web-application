   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendlie Reader, it is possible that you may dislike of mee, for that I am so boulde, as to publish these hard and difficulte matters of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers newe Inuentions or Deuises, the which some of them I haue gathered by one meane, &amp; some by another, but the most part of them hath been mine owne inuention vpon sundry causes in the affaires that I haue had to doo. And as it may chance at sometime any person may be driuen vnto an extremitie, and the thing see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnpossible to bee auoyded, yet by some small and slender Deuise the danger thereof may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, whereas otherwise the perill thereof must needes haue happened: and yet that thing that hath preuented the cause, hath been thought to bee of no importance when that it hath beene knowne, and before it hath been known it hath seemed most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible: wherefore I haue thought it good for to drawe them together into this rude and barbarous volume, more for that to haue them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, if that there dooth happen any cause to vse them, than the finesse of the writing or penning of them, for the writer thereof is most vnlearned and simple, desiring you gentle Reader, to beare with my rudenesse, considering that it is the good will that I
<pb facs="4"/>
doo beare vnto my natiue Countrey, for to profit the common wealth as much as lieth in me, which is the occasion that hath made mee to write these rude and simple <hi>Inuentions</hi> or <hi>Deuises:</hi> Although there is no doubte, but that there be a great number of most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and Politique and wiser or finer heades: that I being so rude and simple a person, to presume to be a medler in those causes, for that the first inuentions or Deuises is are concerning matters by Sea and ships, both in martial affayres and otherwise therevnto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining: And also there be Inuentions or Deuises of Ordinance, aswell for seruice as otherwise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto appertaining: and also there be Inuentions or Deuises, as touching the walles of cities, townes or castels appertaining vnto Martiall affayres: &amp; in like manner there be Inuentions or Deuises, as touching matters in the field, as wel meet for Generalles as for Captaines or leaders of mē, with other necessary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises or Inuentions, as in the table following it doth appeare, the which Inuentions or Deuises are verie necessary to bee had in memory, although that it is possible that those men that hath bin trayned of long time in Martial affaires, perhaps may or doo know a great number of better Deuises than these, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I haue written these, and although for their simplenesse they wil do them no good, yet I am assured that they wil or can do thē no hurt, although that they bee but of a simple mans inuenting, for all Artes, Sciences, or faculties, had a beginning before they came vnto their perfection: and yet it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there hath bin diuers inuentions that haue come
<pb facs="4"/>
vnto no perfection or purpose, and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they are rather to bee better commended than those persons that haue great reuenewes or liuings of their owne, yea and some haue great liuings of the Queenes highnesse, &amp; yet they do practise no other thing, but how to liue easily, to satisfie their lust and pleasure, and some of them, if they doo practise any thing, that shal be but mischief in the cōmon wealth, &amp;c. For by practising, they may attaine vnto know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in any affayres, though it be possible that some will say that in Martiall affaires that practise is to no purpose, if that hee haue not seene the seruice in the field. And also it may be saide againe, that there is a number that haue seene seruice in the fielde, and yet haue no iudgement at al in those affaires, for that we may see by common experience, that some persons haue been trained vp all the dayes of their life, to goe vnto the sea 20. 30. and 40. yeares, and yet haue no knowledge to be the Master of a ship to take charge, for that they wil practise nothing: &amp; other some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by practise be able to take charge in the space of 3. or 4. yeres, and be as sufficient men as those, to take charg, that haue bin masters the space of 20. yeres, &amp;c Wherfore we may see the practise doth much auaile, for by practise he that hath seen but a litle experience of seruice, by cōsideratiō of that seruice that he hath seen, may practise further: for it is not possible if a mā had seen seruice a hundreth yeres, yet at a time in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the field there may happen such a matter, that in al that time the like hath not bin seene nor happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: therefore in the reading of such authors as haue
<pb facs="5"/>
written in any affayres, although that hee hath had no great experience in the matter, yet practise shall much auaile him: so that you may conclude, that he that hath seene much and hath neuer practised no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, can haue no iudgement in any matter, then you must needes confesse, that hee that hath seene little and dooth practise, may haue some iudgement, &amp;c. But then it must needes bee saide, that hee that hath seene experience and dooth practise, must needes become cunning, according vnto the sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his wit, and the valiantnesse of his courage: And furthermore, if one should aske this question, and as it is many times saide, if that such a noble man came in the field, that it is no fighting against him, but if that hee dooth come into the fielde hee shall haue the victorie, and the question is true that it will come so to passe, then what should be the cause ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Now it is possible some will alledge one cause, and some another cause, as I haue heard a number of mens opinions, and yet few or none of them the trueth: for admit that there may bee two men elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or chosen, so indifferently in all respectes as may bee possible, both in wisdome, stature, age, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode or courage, and in all other matter alike, and that they doo not differ in no respect, and those two men haue been trained vp in seruice in the fielde of long time, and haue seene great experiences in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the fielde, as in sieges, and in being besieged, and in the dooing of other great exploytes, and they haue beene both of them alwaies in those seruices, that if the one hath been there, the other hath beene
<pb facs="5"/>
heere in like manner: but the one in the beginning being a Noble mans sonne, did alwaies serue neare the Generall, or as one in counsell with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and hath at more yeares of age serued as a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, &amp; the other hath alwayes serued but as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldier, or an inferour officer or Captaine: &amp; admitte the one of them should come into the field, the one against the other of them, and their strength or number of men to be in manner equall: and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that he that hath the smaller power is the Noble man, there is, no doubt, except great fortune be, but that he that is the Noble man that hath serued as a Generall, shall preuaile and haue the victory, and the cause is this, hee that dooth serue as a General, or hath beene in counsell with the Generall of long time, he doth know how for to prouide and set forth an armie: and contrarywise he that hath serued but as an inferiour Captaine, hath no other care, but to traine his men: the Generall and his counsell, doth foresee where for to lodge and prouide for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and all other necessary matters, and haue their spyalls abroad, and doe know what manner of men be meetest for al maner of purposes, and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doe know what manner of ground is best to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the enemies, and also knowing howe the enemies are prepared, &amp; so accordingly doth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and prepare his battell, to prepare for euery mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe that may happen, for that hee hath seene and heard so oftentimes the experience of those matters, wheras those that haue serued as inferiour Captains or Souldiers, haue neuer had any occasion to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="6"/>
of those matters, but onely to traine their soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers &amp; to make them handsom, how to keepe their order, and to handle their weapon: but for any other order of inbattelling of themselues, if that they came for to fight in the field, it was alwaies at the discretiō of the Generall and his Counsell. And furthermore, admit that in the fighting of a field that they are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, or haue giuen the ouerthrow, the Generall of the army &amp; his Counsel haue perfect intelligence by what meanes that hath happened, &amp; what thing stoode with them, &amp; what thing stood against them, that is to say, if that they that were ouerthrowne had foreseene such a cause, then they had not been ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, &amp; also they that did giue the ouerthrow, if that these had not done such a thing they had not preuailed: so that the General &amp; his Counsell dooth perfectly vnderstand of the matter, what was with them, and what was against them, for that they doo heare what hath happened in euery place in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, if that it bee worthie of knowing, whereas hee that dooth serue but as an inferiour Captaine, dooth heare nor see no other matter, but those matters that haue happened in his own band, or neare vnto him: and the Generall and his Counsell haue authority to send for, and to examine euery person, that can say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in any matter whatsoeuer that it bee, &amp;c. And furthermore, there is a greater matter than this, whereby that those that are the Generals or in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell neare about the Generall, if that they bee giuen vnto practise and haue good wittes, whereby that they may haue a great deale further instructions and
<pb facs="6"/>
knowledge in those affaires, than any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Captaine or Souldier: which is this: for what is hee that is a Souldier or any other person, but if that he dooth knowe any further matter or skill and secret than any person dooth knowe, but that hee will make meanes to shewe it vnto the Generall, whereby that hee may haue the better rewarde or entertainement; so that you may conclude, that if fortie or fiftie thousand men were in the fielde, that if that there bee any person that haue any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or cunning, but that it will bee vttered and shewed vnto the Generall, then if the Generall bee valiant, liberall and wise, as it is a place for a wise man, there is no doubtes but that if hee bee giuen to practise those matters, hee must needes of force become most excellent, for that an infinite number of other mens practises are put into their heades, so that of force they must needes exceede all other men in Martiall affaires, whereas he that is but an inferiour Captaine, although that hee bee giuen vnto practise, can neuer attaine to that which the other hath, for that hee hath not the like instructions in those affaires, not to bee a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall except great fortune bee. And thus (gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) I doo cease to trouble you any longer, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you to beare with my rudenesse, that I should take vpon mee to publish any new Inuentions, and especially in these affayres, considering what a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of wise and valiant Gentlemen and Souldiers, and other learned persons there hee in Englande. And there is no doubte, but that they doo knowe a
<pb facs="7"/>
number of better than these, but yet I am assured, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that it will doo them no good, yet it wil doo them no hurte, and it is possible that in the reading of these rude Inuentions, they may finde in some of them, that thing that may pleasure them, and they themselues may further gather of them: for at the first Inuenting of any Arte or Science, yet they that came after them brought it vnto perfection: so that vpon these rude and base Inuentions, that there may bee some further matter gathered of them, and may come vnto perfection, although some of them doo come vnto little purpose, &amp;c. And thus gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I desire you to beare with my rudenes, although that I haue written any thing that you may mislike of, for that some of them perhaps may seeme to bee but trifles or toyes, yet it may bee possible that some of them, if that it bee equallie considered of, may doo some pleasure vnto you.</p>
