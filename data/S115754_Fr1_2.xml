   <head>TO THE WORSHIPFVL, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> HVMPHREY BROVVNE, Increase of Grace, and <hi>the saving knowledge</hi> of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst other Doctrines here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore gathered from my Text, <hi>viz Act.</hi> 24.14.15.16. We learned, that, <hi>Wee are to ground our Faith onely vpon the Word written.</hi> Which Doctrine arose out of this Observation, That <hi>Paul</hi> doth not say, He beleeved
<pb facs="3"/>all things whatsoever as direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his worshipping the God of his Fathers; but Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things written in the Law, &amp; the Prophets, so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship I, &amp;c. This point is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy due consideration, in these prevaricating times, wherein <hi>Papists</hi> doe so fearefully decline the <hi>Word written,</hi> and runne vnto <hi>Traditions,</hi> which they call <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Verities;</hi> though indeede <hi>Traditionall very lyes;</hi> they runne (I say) vnto these, as vnto the rocke of their refuge. For if they could, but in shew, iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Antichristian Idolatry, and Superstitions by the <hi>Word written,</hi> how boasting they would then be, may appeare
<pb facs="3"/>by their catching at syllables thereof, which sound, in phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall eares, to some of their purposes. So that Christ his censure vpon the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises,</hi> may be iustly layd vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, <hi>viz: Yee haue made the Word</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 15.1.6.</note>
      <hi>written of none authoritie by your Traditions:</hi> But whosoever speaketh not according to this Word, it is because there is no light in them
<note n="b" place="margin">Isa. 8.20.</note>. For the whole Scripture that is, The Word written) is given by Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and is profitable to teach, to convince, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and to instruct in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, that the man of God may be absolute, being made perfect vnto all good works
<note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.16.17.</note>.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p> Amongst other Vses of the sayd Doctrine, this was one, If we are to ground our faith only vpon the Word written, then all, who are wise vnto Salvation, must diligently read the same; or, If they cannot reade, diligently heare them read in publique Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; els-where, as they may. For to what ende was the Word of God committed to Writing; but that Gods people should reade, or heare it read diligently? Therefore let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously take to heart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the wise exhortation of our Master Christ, <hi>viz: Search the Scriptures, For in them yee thinke to haue eternall life</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 5.39.</note>. Wherein ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue,
<pb facs="4"/>that He calleth the word of God <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that is, <hi>Writings,</hi> and not onely so, but <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> that is, Writings incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably excelling all other. For (indeed) they are given by inspiration of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to search them. Which word <hi>Search,</hi> implieth Diligence. As where we are exhorted
<note n="e" place="margin">Pro. 2.3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>
      </note>
      <hi>to Search for the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage of God as for Treasures.</hi> But how are Writings searched o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, than by diligent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? Thus did the Nobly-minded <hi>Baereans</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">Acts. 17.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </note>
      <hi>Search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures daily.</hi> So that Christ his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is this in effect. If ye thinke (indeed) to haue eternall life in the Scriptures, then
<pb facs="5"/>shew your selues wise vnto salvation by your diligence in reading, or hearing them read. This point requireth much pressing in these times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in too many are like those, whom <hi>Isaiah</hi> taxeth.
<note n="g" place="margin">Isa. 29.10.</note> VVho, being covered with a spirit of slumber, dreame of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake their soules are emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; Yet when a Booke is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to be read, they refuse, saying either <hi>The Booke is Sealed,</hi> as doe the Papists; or, <hi>They cannot Reade,</hi> as doe thousands of irreligious people, whose carelesnesse to heare the Scriptures read, (discovered by their late com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="5"/>to the Church, where the Scriptures be read, and their readinesse to heare the reading of vaine Bookes and Ball<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>des) doth manifest their want of religious zeale, to supply their disability to reade the Scriptures, by diligence in giuing attendance to the reading thereof. But there may come a time of tryall, when the Deafe shall heare the words of the Booke, as <hi>ISAIAH</hi> Prophecieth in the same Chapter.
<note place="margin">Vers. 17.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> VVhich Prophecie implieth, that he, who sayd, He could not reade, should (yet) haue signified desire to heare the Booke read. To prevent
<pb facs="6"/>which tryall (if it may so please our most gracious God) let's imitate, yea, emulate the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Iewes,</hi>
      <note n="h" place="margin">Acts. 13.14.15. And 15.21.</note> who so diligently heard the olde Testament read in their Synagogues every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, that Christ, and his Apostles saw it not necessary to quote Chapter, and Verse, when they preached, or wrote. And why? Because, by diligent hearing the Scriptures read, their memory was so confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that they could presently acknowledge every allegation to be conteined in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. To which ende, <hi>viz:</hi> the confirmation of memory by reading, was the Word of God written; Yea so, That the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb facs="6"/>of <hi>Israel</hi> were commanded
<note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 11.19.18.</note> as well to write Gods words vpon the posts of their houses, and vpon their gates, as to be speaking of them, when they sit, walke, &amp;c. that they might lay them vp in their hearts. These things I now write, that thereby I may stirre you, and others vp, by reading, to renew, and confirme your memory, that it may, vnto your farther edification, reflect vpon this ground of Religiō.
