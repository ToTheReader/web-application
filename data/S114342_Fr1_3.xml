   <p>First, that S. Peter was a Bishop by divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
   <p>Secondly, that he was Bishop of Rome? of which this <hi>Doctor</hi> is so impatient, that he breakes out unto <note n="h" place="margin">Page. 43.</note> these passionate words well worthy your Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall Censure: <hi>Whereby</hi>

   <p>Thirdly, Wheter Peter was sole Bishop of Rome, or rather Paul also Bishop as well as hee at the same time, and that by divine institution? whence it will follow, that there ought to be <note n="‡" place="margin">See Euseb. s: 3. c. 10. 11. or So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Fourthly, Whether it will follow from Peters being Bishop of Rome <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> that the Arch-bishops of Canterbury and Yorke most necessarily be Archbishops Iure divino?</p>
   <p>Fifthly, Whether if this Doctrine be true, this Proposition can be denied; that your Lordships being lineally descended from the Church and Popes of Rome, are both the true and genuine sonnes and members of these two ghostly Parents?
