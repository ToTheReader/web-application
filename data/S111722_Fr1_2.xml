   <head>TO THE READER.</head>

      <salute>Courteous Reader:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>IT will appeare to any man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense at first sight, that this rude draught, that sets forth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine considerable grounds in planting Colonies, being wrested out of the Authours hand, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overlooked, much lesse field and smoothed for the Presse, was never intended to be presented to publicke view, especially in this attire: wherefore the Reader is intreated to observe, that the particulars of this small Pamphlet, being all ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged under these two heads, matters of Fact or of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: In the former the Authour sets downe his knowledge, and consequently what he resolves to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; In the latter what he conceives to be most probable, not what he dares warrant as certaine and infallible. Wherefore if in the declaring of his owne opinion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning Colonies in general, or this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, he propose anything that to men of better and more solid judgement upon mature advise shall seeme either not sound, or not evident, or not well fortified by strength of reason; he desires rather advertisement thereof by some private intimation, than by publicke opposition, as not conceiving an argument of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,


<pb facs="3"/>
wherein neither Gods glorie nor mans salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have any necessary interest, (though the worke be directed to, and doth in a good measure further both,) worth the contending for in a time when so many weighty controversies in the fundamentalls of religion are in agitation: and withall professing himselfe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive backe any light golde that hath passed from him unweighed, and to exchange it for that which will be weight, as being conscious to himselfe, that he desires not willingly to beguile any man. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Reader may be pleased further to observe, that seeing the arguments produced in this Treatise are rather proposed than handled, they cannot carry with them that appearant and cleare evidence of truth at the first view, as they might and would doe, if they were more largely deduced, and more fully fortified. Wherefore he is intreated not to reject them too easily, as carrying more weight than they seeme to doe at the first appearance. Howsoever the Authors intention and opinion be construed &amp; approved; if it may be beleeved that the Gentlemen that are lately issued out from us, to lay the foundatiō of a Colony in New-England, haue not beene thrust forward by unadvised precipitation, but led on by such probable grounds of reason and religion, as might be likely to prevaile with men that desire to keepe a good conscience in all things: I trust these will holde themselves reasonably satisfied; howsoever both they, and such as wish the furtherance of your designe, have (I assure my selfe) a testimonie from God and your owne consciences, that they have endeavoured to take there footing upon warrantable grounds, and to direct themselves to a right scope, as will be further manifested in this ensuing Treatise.</p>
