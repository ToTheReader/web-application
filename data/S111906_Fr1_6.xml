   <lg>
      <l>MOngst <hi>Frenchmen, Spanyards, Hungars, Tartars, Turks,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>And wilde <hi>Virginians</hi> too, this tells thy works:</l>
      <l>Now some will aske, what benefit? what gaine?</l>
      <l>Is added to thy store for all this paine?</l>
      <l>Th' art then content to say, content is all,</l>
      <l>Th'ast got content for perils, paine and thrall;</l>
      <l>Tis lost to looke for more: for few men now</l>
      <l>Regard Wit, Learning, Valour; but allow</l>
      <l>The quintessence of praise to him that can</l>
      <l>Number his owne got gold, and riches, than</l>
      <l>Th' art Valiant, Learned, Wise; <hi>Pauls</hi> counsell will,</l>
      <l>Admire thy merits, magnifie thy skill.</l>
      <l>The last of thine to which I set my hand</l>
      <l>Was a <hi>Sea Grammar</hi>; this by Sea and Land,</l>
      <l>Serves us for imitation: I know none,</l>
      <l>That like thy selfe hast come, and runne, and gone,</l>
      <l>To such praise-worthy actions: bee't approu'd,</l>
      <l>Th'ast well deserv'd of best men to be lou'd:</l>
      <l>If <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spaine,</hi> or any forren soile</l>
      <l>Could claime thee theirs, for these thy paines and toile,</l>
      <l>Th'adst got reward and honour: now adayes,</l>
      <l>What our owne natives doe, we seldome praise.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Good men will yeeld thee praise; then sleight the rest;</l>
      <l>Tis best praise-worthy to have pleas'd the best.</l>
