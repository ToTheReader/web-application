      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am to give thee notice</hi> (Christian Reader) <hi>that</hi> M. Malone <hi>the</hi> Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite <hi>writing a</hi> DEMAUND, <hi>and sending it to the</hi> most reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God, the Lord Primate of all Ireland his Grace, <hi>when he was</hi> Chancellor <hi>of the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Church of S. Patrickes Dublin, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an</hi> ANSWER <hi>from him to the same, full of gravitie and learning, when he was</hi> Bishop of Meath, <hi>having the first coppie that came forth of the Presse sent unto him. Since which time he hath printed,</hi> A REPLY TO M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> VSHERS ANSWER, <hi>so fully expressing an impatient &amp; disquieted minde, that scarce a page may be found, wherein he useth not a licentious libertie and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tongue against the most learned</hi> Answerer. <hi>This booke travailed long before it could bee espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, but having got it at last, wee found it to bee as before is declared. Whereupon some
<pb facs="6"/> Divines did labour to disswade the most reverend the</hi> Lord Primate <hi>from rejoyning thereunto, in regard of the indignity of the raylor, and violence of the worke, as also because it would hinder him in other studies more necessary for the</hi> Church, <hi>and did offer their endeavours to examine the same; VVhich being accepted by his</hi> Grace, <hi>the worke is now so farre prepared, that it waytes at the Presse. Onely this Peice prepares the way, which I have sent out of due course and order with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the rest, occasioned by the adverse part, who have reported it to bee in answering before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sheetes thereof were printed, whereby I had reason to suspect, that to get the coppie they used some deceit.</hi>

   <p>
      <hi>But before I leave thee (Christian Reader) I must first acquaint thee, that in the examination of the</hi> Generall Controversie <hi>in the</hi> Iesuites Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>I have passed by sundry mistakes, solecismes, and false Quotations,</hi> casting them aside, <hi>as the</hi> Israelite <hi>did the body of</hi> Amasa <note n="*" place="margin">2. Sam. 2. 20.</note>
      <hi>lest they should hinder me in a more necessary pursuite. Neither have I beene moved with every provocation of the invious</hi> Iesuite, <hi>knowing that the sinne which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to this bitternes, is (as</hi> Cyprian <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves</hi>)

      <hi>though the fuell that nourisheth it come from</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>whereby the most learned</hi> Answerer <hi>is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, in regard that the more</hi> GOD <hi>hath beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified him with excellencies and admirable perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the more he is persecuted by this fierie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation.

      <hi>and therefore he being condemned by them, I did take libertie many times to spare my reproofe. VVhat errours have passed in the Presse, I have taken the best course I could for their correction. I pray</hi> GOD <hi>blesse and protect his</hi> Church <hi>against all the proud holdes that are ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted against the</hi> Scepter of IESUS CHRIST.</p>
