      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, the great and good report which my beloued friend (the bearer hereof) hath giuen of you, hath made me more then halfe in loue with you, which makes me thinke in some sort (as the rude and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke phrase is) to scratch acquaintance of you. But sir beleeue it to be thus, for you shall finde it so, that this is not done of purpose to draw from you any bounty or rewarde to me, for my Penne neuer was, nor neuer shalbe, (God saying Amen,) Mercinarie: but to let you know that the bringer hereof, who doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himselfe to be more indebted to you then his poore estate or deiected life can make satisfaction for) hath some friends, that will in some measure giue you thankes for the more then fatherly kindnesse you haue shewed to him. This vnspeakable loue and kindnesse of yours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to him, hath made me to dedicate this sillie work vnto you, which by the generall report of your worthinesse, <hi>I</hi> thinke vnworthie your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. But if it please you to call back againe some of the loue which you haue heretofore borne him, and withall to consider that this is sent to you, but as a gratulation from me for him, then <hi>I</hi> make no doubt but you will accept it for his sake, if not, yet still I will rest your friende and Wel-willer, made so by my friends report.</p>
