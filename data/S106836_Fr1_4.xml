   <head>THE AVTHOVRS PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome men are borne so farre in loue with themselues, as they esteeme nothing else, and thinke, that whatsoeuer fortune hath set without the compasse of their power and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should also be banished from their knowledge. Some others, a little more carefull, who finding themselues inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by their birth, or aboad, to some one place, striue to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how matters passe there, and remaine so tied to the consideration of their owne Commonweale, as they affect nothing else, carrying themselues as parties of that imperfect bodie, whereas in their curiositie, they should behaue themselues as members of this world. And there are others, which lie groueling in the dust of their studies, searching out with the sciences, the actions and manners of the Auncient, not respecting the Moderne, and they seeme so to admire the dead, as they haue no care of the liuing.</p>
   <p>As for the first, they must needs confesse their fact to be meerely brutish, seeing that men are not borne solely for themselues, that humanitie requires companie, and the knowledge of that which other men practise, and that to frame a mans life, as it ought to be, it is needfull to see the actions of many. As for the second, we see in them a childish and simple curiositie: for what know they if the Commonweale, which containes them, be a cage of fooles, and whether they haue need to borrow something from strangers, to better the Estate thereof, or else to settle themselues there? And how can they judge if affaires in their owne Estate be well ordered, if they doe not confront them with their neighbours, or with some more remote to the end they may repaire the defects, or better the beginnings? Touching the third ranke, obserue in them a vanity, worthy of blame, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides they busie themselues about dead things, and which are for the most part out of vse, they perceiue not that at the same time, whilest they debate of the rolling<pb facs="5"/> of the Heauens, they are ignorant after what manner the earth, whereon they liue, doth roll and moue with their Seigneuries and Estates; yet after another sort, than a subtile and phantasticall Mathematician of this age, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the opinion of some of the Auncient, propounds it.</p>
   <p>Of these three sorts of men, leauing the first to their pasture, with Lyons and Beares; and passing ouer the second, as incapable to see any farther, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the blindnesse of the last, who being endowed with excellent spirits, and exceeding curious, fill them with friuolous things, contemning the learning of that which imports them most, and as a man may say, know nothing in knowing all things.</p>
   <p>They that make a distinction of the cleare and certaine knowledge of things, diuide all Sciences into Speculatiue and Practique; and they subdiuide specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue knowledge, into naturall Phylosophie, the Mathematickes, and Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sickes, lodging physicke vnder the first; Arethmaticke, Musicke, Geometrie, and Astrologie, vnder the second; and vniting to the third, Diuinitie, to the which they giue also for an adjunct the Canon Law. As for practiue science or knowledge, they first of all make it to embrace morall Phylosophie, which they diuide into three, that is to say, into Ethique, which frames the manners of euerie particular man, into Oecanonicall, which disposeth of domesticke acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and politicall, which comprehends the ciuile actions that concerne the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of a Commonweale; and this containes vnder it in a manner all the knowledge of the Ciuile Law. They doe also lodge vnder practise, Logicke, the art of Memorie, Grammar, and Rhetoricke, to the which may be added Poesie, and Historie.</p>
   <p>But they which by their diuisions (the which I will not draw out at length, as tedious, and in a manner vnprofitable in this place) haue in their opinions truely described all arts and sciences, doe not consider that they haue forgotten the most necessarie, which is called the Science or Knowledge of the world, the admirable Booke of that great and religious <hi>Anthonie.</hi> It is this knowledge which more than any other thing doth aduaunce men to honours and dignities, which makes Families and Commonwealths to flourish, and the actions and words of those that vnderstand it, pleasing both to great and small; which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all things to succeed wishfully, and doth in a manner force the Destinies. This knowledge is gotten by the conuersation of many, by diuers discourses and reports, either by word or writing, by the managing of affaires, conference with straungers, voyages into diuers places, the knowledge of diuers humors, and in a word, by the iudicious consideration of the manners and life of one and other.</p>
   <p>But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o come to the poynt, I say, That a good part of this knowledge is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the discourse of this Booke, where you may see all sorts of persons and nations liuely and naturally described, and represented with their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and customes, as curiously as might be: so as if there lackes perfection in<pb facs="5"/> any part, this defect proceedes rather from the want of true relation, than from my diligence. I neuer vndertooke this worke, but with a firme des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seigne, not onely to make it pleasing, as Geographers doe in the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth, describing and setting downe such singularities as they find: but also profitable, labouring to obserue not lightly, but in intelligible tearmes, whatsoeuer may make the life of man either more happie, or more ciuile.</p>
   <p>And for proofe, if any one will vouchsafe to cast his eyes vpon this worke, although ill pollished, he may in a manner at the first view, obserue what I I say, and seeing the distinction which I vse, and the order which I hold throughout all the whole booke, he may easily judge, that beside the Readers content, I haue sought their profit, giuing them herein all the satisfaction they could desire vpon this subiect. For although my first and chiefe desseigne was to deale onely with politicke and ciuile matters; yet to the end, they might find all together, and not be forced to seeke for the description of countriess, whose custome I represent, I haue made the Corographie, and would not faile in that point, painting out the prouinces, whose discourse I vndertooke, it may be with as much care, as my desseigne would giue me leaue, setting down the most remarkable places.</p>
   <p>But for the that this representation of countries would be vnprofitable, if they vnderstood not their qualitie, I haue added it vnto the rest, with all that the countrie yeelds, and the beasts which naturally liue there, and haue their breeding. Yet all this were little, to spend much time in the curious search of things the which are void of sence or reason, if I should not spew you the man which dwells in euere countrie, and for whom all those things seeme to haue beene made, first in his auncient posture, and with his old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, either altogether, or for the most part abolished; then in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne habit, either with more ciuilitie, or with more rudenesse, according to the changes and reuolutions of the world, to the end that euery man may judge which is the better of these two Estates, and make vse of part of the one, and part of the other, hauing carefully ballanced the most considerable particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both.</p>
   <p>And for that all this labour were little, to giue the Reader a solid content, if I should haue left it thus naked and bare, it importing little to know the actions of nations, if they had not meanes to judge by the commodities which the place doth yeeld, what they should adde or take away from their manner of liuing, and to know the causes for the which they suffered themselues as it were to runne headlong into some error and defect, or else haue loued or embraced something worthie of great praise and commendation: and if withall they did not vnderstand the meanes which these people haue to liue in the Estate where in they are borne; I haue next vnto their manners, ioined their wealth and riches, which shew by their aboundance, how men which enioie them haue abandoned themselues to delights, or else giuen themselues vnto Sciences,<pb facs="6"/> and by the want thereof in what manner some haue con tinued rude and barbarous, and others haue applied themselues to arts and trades, to the end, they might repaire the defect of nature by the perfection of their industrie and labour.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, knowing well that although a countrie be furnished with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities which suffice or abound, yet the inhabitants are subiect to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged, if they be not able to repell them which shall vndertake to wrest that violently from them which they hold: for this cause, I haue presently after the discourse of their wealth, added that of their forces, to the end the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may obserue the meanes which Nations haue to resist either the enuie of their neighbours, or to withstand the furie of a multitude of strangers, the which haue come from some miserable countrie to seise vpon another mans right; and to end they may judge if the Estates whereof I discourse may be easily ouerthrowne and changed, and if for their defence they make vse of any which is vnknowne to vs, and which might yeeld vnto vs some profit, we might applie it to our owne vse, and haue consideration of the forces of another nation, to make our owne more fearefull: but all this being without policie, is like vnto a building which is in the Aire, without any support or foundation, I haue ioined vnto the rest, the gouernement and conduct of the Estate, whose discourse I haue vndertaken, to the end that knowing the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of those that are subiect vnto it, they may judge if they be gouerned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their naturall disposition, and by this judgement they may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that all nations are not to be ruled after one sort; and if vnder such a conduct, the nation whereof we treat, hath not succeeded well, or hath beene often afflicted or ruined, they may seeke out the defects of this gouernement, to make the countrie more calme and quiet, and others which are not engaged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the like commaund much better instrusted in that which they haue to do for their assurance.</p>
   <p>Hauing done this, I would not omit the principall peeces of Commonweales, the which is Religion, whereof I haue discoursed, to shew that it is the feare of some diuinitie which maintaines people in their duties, makes them obedient to their princes, and diuerts them much more from all bad desseignes, than armes and souldiers which enuiron and threaten them. I doe it also to shew, that whereas religion wants, of what sort soeuer it be, policie and order faile in like manner, and barbarisme, confusion, and rebellion, raigne there in a manner continually: whereas they that seise on them, should presently settle in their rude mindes the apprehension of some power ouer all, to dispose of things at pleasure.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>t I</hi> was not contented herewith, so desirous I was to giue satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all men: but I haue annexed and ioined hereunto the names of those which haue gouerned the countries which I describe; and if this curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath not extended to euery discourse, the Authors which haue gone before me, are to bee accused of this defect; for that hauing forgotten<pb facs="6"/> to treat particularly of this subiect, or being not able to doe it for want of sufficient instructions, they haue taken from me the meanes to acquit my selfe worthily of that which I haue vndertaken, and in like manner they haue as it were depriued the Reader of that satisfaction which he might haue desired or expected.</p>
   <p>Thus I haue laboured to make this worke, not perfect and compleat in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie point, yet at the least in that estate, as it may yeeld both pleasure and profit to those that shall vouchsafe to lend it some houres, and which shall resolue to read it at leasure, and not in hast, as they doe commonly which desire onely to passe the time, and not to imploy it commendably in some worthie search: for who so will looke narrowly to the benefit which may be drawne from these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, shall easily find that there are verie few men but should be inuited to the reading thereof, either to exercise their iudgements, or for to make the dessigne of some fortune, or else to be profitable and commodious to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or for their owne entertainement, or for the entertainement of others, or for both together.</p>
   <p>If they duely consider of all that is treated of in this Booke, they shall first see that Princes, besides the relation of diuers sorts of places, whereon they may ground some enterprises, fortifie themselues with more aduantage, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the trade of their subiects, and imploy them either to the beautifying or enriching of their Prouinces, and shall here find meanes to augment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their reuenues, making vse of some forraine inuentions, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Nations which they commaund, according to the disposition of times, and the humour of their subiects, bringing them alwaies in with wisdome and judgement.</p>
   <p>Noblemen shall draw instructions from hence to please their Soueraigne Lords and Princes, and also to make their owne subiects pleasing and humble; they shall make themselues capable of some worthie Embassage, whereof they shall acquit themselues much better by this kind of course, and they shall be much better enabled to vndertake or execute any enterprise, be it neere or farre off.</p>
   <p>As for simple gentlemen, they that are aduaunced in yeares shall find where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to entertaine themselues, and withall to instruct youth: They that are of a middle age, may obserue particularities, whereof they may make vse, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that their courage carries them farre from their houses for any dessigne or enterprise, or liue in Court, whereas the reading hereof may purchase them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and credit, and draw them vnto good imployments, if they can make true vse of it, conferring iudiciously that which passeth in the State wherein they liue, with that which is done in many others. Finally, young men before they see any thing, shall in a manner see all things; they shall know the Court, and the humours of Courtiers, before they know themselues; and if their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inclinations thrust them on to the profession of armes (as it doth commonly fall out) whenas peace is setled in their owne countries, they shall find here<pb facs="7"/> others which are in action, they shall sound their meanes and forces, according to the qualitie of those places whither they will go, they shall see if their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be able to indure the extreame cold, or violent heat of those countries where the warre is; they shall consider of their manner of liuing, and iudge if their humors will be compatible with that of the inhabitants of those places; if strangers, especially they of his nation, may purchase any honour there, which is the chiefe end of Nobilitie; and to conclude, to the end they may win reputation, hauing considered all these circumstances, they will seeke to force their owne nature if it be wayward, lay aside all their passions whatsoeuer, support all kind of discommodities, and fit themselues to any thing that may happen.</p>
   <p>Simple souldiers, which seeke to raise their birth and fortunes by the proofe of their valour, haue in a manner the same things to consider of: And to this end, hearing of any leuie of men to go into countries which are in question, they may instruct themselues before they dislodge of that which they shall encounter there, and by this meanes resolue with more assurance of the voyage; they shall not find themselues surprised with any thing that is strange, hauing learned the truth before their departure, and seeing it, shall hold it, as a thing well practised among them.</p>
   <p>They that will deale in the managing of affaires and businesses of Estate, shall draw many Maximes from hence, the which they may vse to so good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (although they be borrowed from the customes of other nations) as they shall seeme their owne, and will make them appeare inuentiue, iudicious, and capable to giue some good and wholesome councell for the welfare of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale.</p>
   <p>The Aduocat who seemes onely to haue need of the laws, ordinances, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, which are in force in the place of his aboad, may, by the meanes of this Booke, mingle in his pleading, some custome or forraine law in fauour of his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and making the most curious Iudges to obserue it, it may be he shall moue them to haue such regard thereof, as many times it shall win him his cause, or at the least purchase him reputation.</p>
   <p>And is not the Merchant to be held happie that shall meet with these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, seeing that in short time he may know the places whither he is to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, aud instruct himselfe sufficiently of the nature and qualitie of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where he may find that which he seekes, or sell that which he hath; and also haue meanes to learne after what manner commodities are bought and sold in those places, either by exchange, or for readie money, and by what meanes they must gaine the Barbarians which sell, or preuent the wiles and trickes of the most subtile and warie, who know how to disguise or impaire their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise.</p>
   <p>As for Artizens and Tradesmen, they haue newes here of Prouinces which seeme to haue need of their arts and professions; and therefore (me thinkes) it is no difficult thing for them to resolue to change their aboads, whenas they<pb facs="7"/> shall assuredly know that the change will be profitable vnto them, and that they shall benefit themselues more in other places, than where they haue first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselues. To conclude in few words, there is no sort of people but may reape some profit by this booke, which containes, as I haue sayd, a good part of that great and most necessarie science of the world, the which cannot sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be esteemed, for that it makes men worthie of esteeme.</p>
   <p>I haue not spoken all this for any account I make of that which I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, neither will I euer confesse, that any desire of glorie hath inuited me to praise mine owne worke: my humour will not suffer me to be so vaine; onely a desire I had to be profitable to my countrie to whom I haue vowed all the good I can, with the losse of mine owne rest. And I protest with trueth, that if I haue giuen any ranke or commendation to this worke, I will giue much more to those that shall labour to make it perfect; for that in my opinion it is not yet ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finished, and that any man may adde something dayly vnto it, for that from time to time they haue more certaine aduice from all parts, especially from those countries which haue not been much frequented, either by reason of the distance, or for their barbarousnesse.</p>
   <p>I would willingly end my speech, as desiring the Reader should speedile make some triall of the truth of my words. But before I proceed any farther, seeing I discourse of the Seigneuries of the world, I desire to shew as in a briefe table from what stockes, in a manner all the Commonweales, and Monarchies of the Earth at this day are descended, to the eud that they may obserue the changes and alterations here below, and see after what manner free people were made subiect to the power of those that were more mightie. This may be chiefely done by the meanes of the foure soueraigne Empires, the which after some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance being diuided into many branches, haue suffered a great number of principalities well knowne to vs, to rise out of their shipwrecks, and which in time may feele the like accidents, either by their increase, or by the cutting off of some parts.</p>
   <p>The first of these Monarchies owes his beginning to mightie <hi>Nimrod,</hi> whom some haue called <hi>Saturne</hi> of Babylon. This was he which he founded the principalitie of the Babylonians (the which was confounded with that of the Assyrians) one hundred thirtie and one yeares after the Deluge: and some hold that the fiue and fortieth yeare of his Empire, he sent <hi>Aslur, Magog,</hi> and <hi>Mosc,</hi> with certaine troopes to people countries, and to erect kingdomes by their owne names.</p>
   <p>This <hi>Nimrod</hi> had for successor <hi>Bel,</hi> called <hi>Iupiter Bel,</hi> who seised vpon all the countries towards the West vnto Sarmatia in Europe: and his sonne <hi>Ninus,</hi> who held the Monarchie after him, extended his bounds farther. After the death of <hi>Ninus,</hi> his wife <hi>Semiramis</hi> raigned, and brought Ethiopia vnder her subiection, and made warre against the Indians. But her sonne <hi>Zameis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained quiet, and did nothing worthie of memorie. <hi>Arius,</hi> who succeeded him added the Bactrians and Caspians to his Empire. After whom they put these<pb facs="8"/> that follow: <hi>Aralius,</hi> then <hi>Baleus,</hi> who extended his bounds vnto Iudea, and after him, <hi>Armatrite,</hi> then <hi>Beloch,</hi> who had for successor a second <hi>Baleus.</hi> This man was followed by <hi>Altadas, Mamite, Mancalee,</hi> and <hi>Sphere:</hi> after whom there raigned <hi>Mamele, Sparete,</hi> and <hi>Ascarades,</hi> who reduced all Syria vnder his Empire. After him they reckon twentie kings vnto <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> the eight and thirtieth Emperour, who was forced to burne himselfe with all his treasure, being reduced to that extremitie by two of his Lieutenants, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards diuided the Monarchie betwixt them; so as <hi>Beloch</hi> was king of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and <hi>Arbaces</hi> of the Meedes and Persians. <hi>This</hi> Monarchie had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued one thousand and three hundred yeares, vnto the end of <hi>Sardanapalus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Beloch</hi> was the nine and thirtieth, or first king of Assyria in the new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, and made <hi>Manahem</hi> king of Israell his tributarie; whom the holie Scripture calls <hi>Phiel</hi> and not <hi>Beloch.</hi> He had for successour <hi>Phul-Assur</hi> surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Tiglat Pillesser,</hi> who seised vpon some townes of Iudea, and led the people captiue into Assyria <hi>Salmanazar</hi> followed him, who made himselfe mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Samaria, and he had for successour <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> who was slaine by his owne children. These murtherers fled, and yet they tooke armes against <hi>Assa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radon</hi> their brother, who had seised vpon the Monarchie. <hi>Merodach,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the countrie of Babylon, reuolted and hauing vanquished all, he ioined the monarchie of the Assyrians to the Babylonians. Some authors place after him <hi>Ben Merodach, and Nabuchodonosor,</hi> or <hi>Nabuchadnezar,</hi> of whom the Scripture makes mention after <hi>Merodach.</hi> He made warre against Aegyptians, and tooke from them all the countrie which lies betwixt the riuer of Euphrates, and Pelusium or Damietta: then hauing vanquished the kings of the Ammonites and Moabites, in the end he subdued all Aegypt. After him raigned <hi>Euilmero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dach,</hi> then <hi>Labassardach,</hi> and after these <hi>Balthazar</hi>: but some put <hi>Balthazar</hi> presently after, <hi>Euilmerodach</hi> his father. This <hi>Balthazar</hi> was the last Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Babylon, as all authors hold.</p>

      <hi>Darius</hi> of Media, who ruined the Empire of the Assyrians, and tooke Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon is called <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> sonne to <hi>Astyages</hi> the eight, king to the Medians, called by <hi>Daniell, Assuerus,</hi> who gaue his daugter to <hi>Cyrus</hi> of Persia, his sisters sonne. This was the beginning of the monarchie of the Persians, the second in number; for that after the death of <hi>Darius,</hi> all came into the hands of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who alone enioyed the countries of Assyria, Media, and Persia, and had for successor his sonne <hi>Cambyses:</hi> after whom raigned <hi>Darius</hi> sonne to <hi>Histaspes,</hi> to whom succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Xerxes</hi> his sonne, who was slaine by his owne followers, after he had spoyled Greece with two millions of men and had beene chased from thence with all his po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>anquished by <hi>Alexander,</hi> who ruined the monarchie of the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which had continued two hundred yeares and more.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Alexander</hi> was the author of the third monarchie, the which was presently<pb facs="8"/> dispersed, for that it ended with the life of this Prince, after whose death the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was torne in peeces, and diuided among the Noblemen and Captaines of his traine, which were, <hi>Ptolomeus, Laomedon, Cassander, Antigonus, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus, Eumenes, Python, Lysimacus, Antipater, Meleager,</hi> and <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>; among the which, the chiefe were, <hi>Seleucus</hi> King of Syria, <hi>Ptolome</hi> of Aegypt, <hi>Antigonus</hi> of the Lesser Asia, or Natolia, and <hi>Cassander</hi> in the end King of Greece, and Macedonia. These ambitious spirits not able to liue in rest, there grew great wars among them, and betwixt their children and successors, which gaue occasion to the Romans to inuade them, and in the end to become Maisters of all that part.</p>
   <p>As for the empire of the Romans, for that I haue made an ample relation thereof in my discourses, I will passe it ouer with silence, sending the Reader to that which I haue formerly said, to the end he may see how all the countries haue beene since diuided, and after what manner they haue drawne the principalities which wee see at this day, from those foure great and principall peeces dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
   <p>Now that I haue freed my selfe from this little scruple which remained, I will onely tell them that shall busie themselues in the reading of these discourses, that I haue transplanted some peeces of certaine Authors which might serue my dessigne, as well to auoid the reproach of some defect, as to spare the Readers paine in seeking that in many places which they might find in one. Moreouer, this, which is a Historie, except in some places which are subiect to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of more important matters, requires no points of wit or subtile inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but a naked report of the truth which hath beene learned by the writings or verball relations of men worthie of credit. And of the two principall peeces which shall be found, the first is an Abridgement of the Historie of the Kings of Persia, compiled by a Portugal, who trauelling through Persia, and hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the Chronicle of <hi>Taric Mirkond,</hi> a Persian borne, one of the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Historians, and of greatest credit and autheritie among the Persians, tooke the paynes to translate it into the Portugal tongue. This worke containes a true relation of the beginning, descent, and succession of the kings of Persia and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, vnto the entrie of the Arabians and Portugals into those kingdomes; with a List of the Califes of Bagadet or Babylon, which haue commaunded in Persia since the entrie of the said Arabians into those countries. This abridgement of the Historie containes truth in stead of lies, which antiquitie would make vs belieue of the Persian Monarchie: and shall serue for a great light touching the affaires of this realme, the which are verie confusedly written, with great contrarieties and disagreements, by <hi>Procopius, Agathius, Genebrard, Zonaras, Torna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira,</hi> and other auncient and moderne writers. You shall also find another dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the beginnings of Knighthood, and Militarie orders of Christendome, and how, by whom, and at what time they were instituted, and to what entent, and vnder what rules and disciplines, with the blazons and deuises of the sayd order.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>The other peece which we haue held necessarie for the finishing of this worke, is a discourse of the beginning of Religious orders instituted in Christendome: the which, for that it could not be fitly inserted in all the places where we haue discoursed of the religion of States, I haue annexed it to the end of this Booke. The reading of this little discourse is not onely pleasing and curious, but profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, yea necessarie, for such as finding themselues vnfit for worldly affaires, desire to imbrace a contemplatiue life, and leauing the temporall, giue themselues to the spirituall.</p>
   <p>I doe willingly offer you this worke, such as it is, and wish you may haue as great a desire to read it, as I had to trace it, and that taking some tast in the reading thereof, you may receiue as much pleasure, as I haue had paynes. Read it then I beseech you, not rashly, but with care and diligence, and if any thing dislikes you, blame not the whole bodie for one blemish or wart. Passe on still to content your selfe, and seeke the subject that may giue you satisfaction; and whatsoeuer you find, if you will not spare me for mine owne defence, doe it at least in regard of my dessigne.</p>
   <closer>Farewell.</closer>
