   <head>To the right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sir Henrie Pakenham Knight, and to his religiously affected Ladie, all good and sound comforts ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the best and most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured ioyes in glorie are heartily wished.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT Worshipfull: man was made for his Creators glorie; the way is to know him, to obserue his good pleasure, and with alacrity of spirit to doe his will; Though all receiue <hi>Being</hi> of him, yet most, as the Heathen, know him not at all. Some sort in the world professe him: but are little obseruatiue of his will: these onely say, Lord, Lord; and therewith rest so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: other doe aske, what he would haue done; and when they know his pleasure, they haue it onely vpon their tongue, but far from practise. Very few know with faith, and doe what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and know, with conscience. Turks for their liues, are as good as many Christians: and these
<pb facs="3"/> no better then other, but for an idle profession. Meanes sure haue we many to amend this; as his holy word, his multitude of mercies and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold chastisements: But the first is despised, therefore it preuaileth not: the second is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefully abused, and mercies mooue vs not: and the last is contemned, we grow hard, and therefore o Lord saue vs, for iudgements re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime vs not. But the godly wise, will I hope, lay these things to heart, though most be carelesse: lest correction turne to destruction, mercies be remooued, and of the Gospel we be vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued. The Lord may thus doe, it is our deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing; that by iustice he reuenge not himselfe of vs, it is mercy still without any mans merit God make vs thankefull, that our knowledge may cause an acknowledgment heartily, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment seriously, so shall we enioy what we haue, and haue what yet we possesse not, for our greater good.</p>
   <p>My words of complaint and my heartie wish tend to stirre vp some to well doing, that, if so. God please, in a world of wickednesse, there may be found <hi>Noahs</hi> preparing the Arke, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Lots</hi> dwelling in <hi>Sodome,</hi> that when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction commeth, such may find in that day fauour in Gods sight for themselues and their families. For this end I haue sent forth, with the principles of religion, and the points of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme,
<pb facs="3"/> certaine instructions deliuered Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue wise, teaching and perswading all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to a mutuall care of one an others saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; euery houshold gouernour, with the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, to an orderly disposing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that Iesus Christ may dwell amongst them, and that the houses of Christians may be lodgings for the Lord, and not dennes of infidells, or habitations of diuells.</p>
   <p>What hath bin deliuered after an other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the same changed for a more easie informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I now offer (right Worshipfull) thankefully vnto you: let it please you to accept my litle la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for your Worships so large kindnesse alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die shewed. I do acknowledge my selfe beholden: I professe readinesse, to expresse still more thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, as time shall afforde fit occasion. In the meane space I shall not cease to pray for you, that <hi>Iosuahs</hi> resolution may be euer in you, that you may follow the steppes of Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and your good Ladie imitate the holy graces of <hi>Sarah,</hi> to your housholds happinesse, and both your endlesse comforts here and in heauen,</p>
