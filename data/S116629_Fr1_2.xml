BRIGET COVNTESSE
OF LINCOLNE.</head>
   <p>FOR the better expressing
&amp; keeping in memorie my
Loue, and your Worthines;
I doe offer vnto your LA:
the first worke of mine that
ever came in Print; because
your rare example, hath given an excellent
approbation to the matter contained in this
Booke; for you haue passed by all excuses, and
haue ventured vpon, &amp; doe goe on with that
loving act of a loving mother; in giving the
sweete milke of your owne breasts, to your
owne childe; wherein you haue gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the greatest number of honourable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of your place, in these latter times. But I
wish many may follow you, in this good
worke, which I desire, to further by my kinde
<pb facs="3"/>
perswasion. And such women as will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to read this little short treatise; may be
put in minde of a duty, which all mothers are
bound to performe; and I shall be glad if any
will consider, and put in practice, that which
is both naturall and comfortable. I hope they
will at the least commend with me such as do
this good deede, and no more speake scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
of that which is worthy of great praise;
and for my part I thinke it an honour vnto
you, to doe that which hath proued you to
be full of care to please God, and of naturall
affection, and to bee well stored with humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and patience, all which are highly to be
praised; to giue praise to any person or thing
deseruing praise, I dare doe it, &amp; for this loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
action of yours I can with much thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
praise God, for all his gracious guifts
of grace and Nature, wherby he hath inabled
you, to doe the same: desiring also with my
heart, that you may euer, and euery way ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God, who hath honoured you many
wayes, aboue many women; and I reioyce,
that I can beare witnesse, that God hath ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
you with fayre tokens of his loue and
mercy to your soule: As the practise of true
<pb facs="3"/>
Christian religion; dedicating your selfe to
Gods seruice; answerablenesse to all holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the holy God, which are Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Gods loue, and doth challenge a very
great esteeme from me, amongst the rest, that
can truly iudge and rightly discerne what is
best; I am full of thoughts in this kinde, or of
this matter: yet I say no more but this, Goe
on and prosper, Hold fast all that is good,
Trust in God for strength to grow and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in faithfull obedience to his glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
And I wil not cease to intreat the Lord of
Heauen, to powre aboundantly all Blessings
of heauen and earth vpon you, and your
Children, as they increase in number.</p>
