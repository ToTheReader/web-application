   <p>RIght worshipfull, it is sayd in other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and <hi>written</hi> in some of their bookes, that there are three <hi>disgraces</hi> of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Nation: The Ignorance, or (that I may so call it) the vnlearned of our <hi>Gētrie &amp; Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> the beggery of our <hi>poore,</hi> &amp; the Basenes of the bodie of our <hi>Ministerie,</hi> The <hi>first</hi> blot, our Nobilitie and Gentrie haue well wiped off, since the first daies of our blessed Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> partly by <hi>studie</hi> at home, partlie by <hi>trauell</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, and I hope they will do it more &amp; more: The <hi>second</hi> hath beene well lessened by good lawes of late, and would hee more, if the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> were as good as our lawes b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

But now for the <hi>third,</hi> I feare none but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hand of God, can wipe out that staine from our Church: The basenesse of the generall body of our <hi>Ministerie,</hi> whence is it, but either from the vnworthinesse, or <hi>Pouertie</hi> thereof: and the vnworthinesse, whence is it, but from the <hi>Pouertie,</hi> and base maintenance of our <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,</hi> which was once robbed by the <hi>Abbies,</hi> and after by some in our owne State, which was then Popish, and Poperie that stands so much
