   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Know, that many of you, e're this time, expected the first Decade of the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> according to the promise, in my <hi>Preparation.</hi> And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when you behold here, but a tenth part of it, I shall be thought to come too much short of what I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. As indeed I doe (seeing, I then wanted not much, of hauing fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the whole <hi>Decade</hi> in that manner, as I purposed to set it forth) But, if it were here fitting (or any way for your profit) to discouer them,
<pb facs="5"/>
I might giue vndenyable reasons (to excuse my selfe) which I now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale.</p>
   <p>Onely thus much, I will say. Few men consider, how many paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dayes (after the maine labour is ended) the writing ouer againe of such a volume will aske; how many moneths it may be afterward atten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded at the Presse; how much charge, the Authors little means, may (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any profit of his labours) bee put to; nor, through how many vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked-for troubles and businesses, hee must make way vnto the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it. For, if they did know, and weigh this; so many, that are idle ones themselues, would not so often (as I heare they doe) blame my
<pb facs="5"/>
idlenesse. But, rather wonder, how; and when, I got meanes and time, to performe what is already done.</p>
   <p>Discouragements, and hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I haue had many, since I began to meddle with the <hi>Psalmes.</hi> But helps, or encouragements, I haue had none; no, not the least part of one: saue the comforts, which I haue found, within mine owne heart. And they are so great, that I am still resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to proceed in this work, as I shal be enabled. For, though it may come the more slowly forward, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of some lets: yet, I am perswaded, God will supply, by his grace, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, I am that way depriued of. And (if I can haue patience) bring what I intend, to much more happie
<pb facs="6"/>
perfection, then if I had receiued no obstacle in the performance.</p>
   <p>This <hi>Psalme,</hi> in the meane while, my friends were desirous of; and haue wished me thus to publish the rest, by one or two together, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a whole <hi>Decade</hi> be imprinted: That so (euery <hi>Psalme,</hi> being an entire thing of it selfe) those poore men, who are desirous of them, and vnable to spare so much money to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as will buy a greater booke, may by little and little, without any hinderance furnish themselues of all. And beside, they thinke the portable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, may make it the more frequently read; for which causes I haue hearkned vnto them.</p>
   <p>Take then in good part, this little
<pb facs="6"/>
beginning. Value it, as it shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue to bee esteemed; And, let not my vnworthinesse bee any blemish vnto it. For, though I am no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Diuine; yet, my profession is Christianitie, and these my labours, hauing the approbation of Authority, are not to be despisedly reckoned of, as mine; but receiued as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the <hi>Church</hi>: who hath now, by her allowance, both made them her owne, and deliuered them ouer vnto you. So; Gods blessing on you, and me, and farwell.</p>
