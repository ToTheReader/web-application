   <head>A direction for the use of this Harmonie.</head>
   <p>THis Harmonie is divided into five books:</p>
   <p>The first contains the historie of Christs private life.<note place="margin">Books.</note>
   </p>
   <p>The second, the historie of the first yeare of his publick Ministerie.</p>
   <p>The third, the historie of the second yeare of his publick Ministerie.</p>
   <p>The fourth, the historie of the third yeare of his publick Ministerie.</p>
   <p>The fifth, the historie of the fourth yeare of his publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, together with his Passion, Resurrection, and Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
   <p>It is also divided from the beginning to the end into 212 chapters,<note place="margin">Chapters.</note> (which divisions come nearer those of the Greeks, then our own) not beginning to number them again at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of every book; that (if there be occasion) it might the more easily be compared with <hi>Chemnitius.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Every page in the title,<note place="margin">Pages.</note> shews in what yeare every thing was done; and hath its margent divided into foure columnes: every of which doth severally contain the name, chapter, and verse of every Evangelist: that the margent might shew in what chapter and verse every part of the Context is to be found: that the text of any one of them might be viewed; or, where they all speak of the same thing, they might (if it be thought requisite) the more fitly be compared.</p>
   <p>The Romane letters inserted,<note place="margin">Letters.</note> signifie that there begin the words of that Evangelist, which continue till the next: <seg rend="sup">M.</seg> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the words of S. Matthew; <seg rend="sup">Mr.</seg> Mark; <seg rend="sup">L.</seg> Luke; <seg rend="sup">J.</seg> John. Words added to the text, are printed in a smaller letter.</p>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <p>The Asterisk referres to places which be like,<note place="margin">Asterisk.</note> and might seem to some to be the same; though indeed they be not: or if the same words, yet used at another time, and upon other occasion.</p>
   <p>The translation which I have followed strictly,<note place="margin">Translation.</note> is the last of our own (allowed by authoritie) as being the best, and most exact. Where we had but one English word to expresse two or more in the Greek; there the Greek is placed in the margent.</p>
   <p>The Table at the end,<note place="margin">Table.</note> shews in what chapter of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie any chapter, verse, or sentence of any of the Evangelists may be found; which being known, it will thence appeare, at what time it was done or spoken. And know that <hi>Ch.</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the chapter of the Evangelist, and <hi>C. H.</hi> for the chapter of the Harmonie: <hi>As for example,</hi> If you desire to know in what chapter of the Harmonie, the first of Matthew, from the beginning to the end of the 17 verse, is handled, you shall finde it in the third chapter of the Harmonie; and from the beginning of the 18 verse, to the 25 and last verse, in the 7 chapter of the Harmonie. And so in the rest.</p>
