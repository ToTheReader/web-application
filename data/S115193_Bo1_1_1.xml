      <hi>Ierome</hi> desired to deale with <hi>Origen, that our Countrymen shoulde know your best things, and bee ignorant of your worst.</hi> For my witnesses be in heaven, &amp; in my owne bosome, that no motion of envy, gaine, glorie, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular

And therefore I doe refraine all disparagements, and personall aspersions against you: wishing you had done so, against those manie worthy <hi>Doctors of our Vniversity.</hi> An act, which I know you once disliked in that baaling Priest<note n="c" place="margin">His booke entituled <hi>de Triplici homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis officio</hi> &amp; his epistle to the Vniversitie.</note>

   <p>Experience doth well approue Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> saying; <hi>Efficacior lingua, quàm litera:</hi> the tōgue is of greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie, then the pen. And therefore I suffer no little disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, in that I must now speake vnto you in a silent letter, &amp; pleade my cause by a mute advocate of my mind.</p>
   <p>ANSVVER.</p>
   <p>It is true, <hi>efficacior lingua, quàm litera;</hi> but yet, <hi>meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
<pb n="3" facs="4"/> anima, quàm lingua.</hi> If your pen expresse not what your tongue is able fullie, I would your hart woulde conceiue that which your tongue may speake truly, that as some thinke there bee certaine strings that passe from the hart to the tongue, so there might bee a concatenatiō that what your hart thinketh, &amp; your tongue speaketh, and your pen writeth, may so agree, that they may be all to the glorie of God, the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of others, and saving of your owne soule. For if your tongue could thunder, as<note n="f" place="margin">Aul. Gell. lib. 17-c. 17.</note>
      <hi>Aristophanes</hi> spake of <hi>Pericles;</hi> or you had a tongue like a trumpet, as<note n="g" place="margin">Hier. adver. Ruffin. tom. 2. fol. 221.</note>

   <p>But since I write vnto thē, who are not strangers in my busines, but as well eie witnesses of the wrongs, which I haue endured, as eare witnesses of the doctrine which I preached among you; my vndoubted hope is, that your harts will be touched with some compassion either toward me, vnworthyly entreated by a faction (for I will not impute
<pb n="4" facs="5"/> the crime of a few vnto all) or towards your selues, whome this particular doth very highly import, in respect of your learning, honor, and estimation.</p>
   <p>ANRVVERE.</p>
   <p>You write to those that are <hi>strangers,</hi> to your <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> not to your <hi>person;</hi> or <hi>strāgers,</hi> not to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, but <hi>approuing</hi> your opinion: <hi>strangers</hi> wee are all to any <hi>wrongs done to you,</hi> not to <hi>the wrongs offered by you.</hi> And therefore thinke you not to touch the hartstrings of our students with a dittie of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as if you were (as you say) wrongfully and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily entreated by a faction. Compassion every honest hart will afford you for being <hi>misled,</hi> rather then <hi>misused.</hi>
      <note n="i" place="margin">Lib. 1. de Controver. ad Cler. c. 31.</note> S<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Bernard distinguisheth of <hi>pacidicos</hi> and <hi>pacificos,</hi> those that in word speake of peace, but indeed make ready to battaile. So may I concerning your request for compassion, and yet even in that your petition, you breake into a furious passion, to accuse those reverend learned Doctors, who censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you, as if they had beene a faction. I will not be nice to climbe ouer those seeming difficulties that <hi>lie</hi> in my way: and yet without enlarging the limits of your speech, as all your <hi>assertions</hi> like so many <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases</hi> attend vpon the <hi>ague of error;</hi> so this among the rest, wherein you censure those that iudicially censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you, to be a factiō. If any afforded your <hi>pen main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> or your sermons <hi>countenance</hi> by clancular approbation, contrary to the iudgement and truth deliuered by the learned <hi>Vicechancelor,</hi> and his <hi>worthy asistants;</hi> they were the faction, not these. It is not a
<pb n="5" facs="5"/> factious position which is generally maintained by the happy and gratious Church of <hi>England,</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpō irrefragable places of holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> taught by many impregnable places of ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> yea your <hi>grand</hi> Iury of Fathers called into the <hi>Star cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of iudgement by a iudicious learned &amp; religious<note n="k" place="margin">Doctor Benefield.</note>

Were you vnworthily intreated when <hi>loue</hi> allured you, and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> sollicited you to take better councell? Were you silenced, or imprisoned, or censured at all, til that engastred impostume brake out, in your last sermon, all dayly expecting a much more earnest course a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, the discommoning rather of you, thē the losse of your commons? And whereas you desire vs to be moued with compassion toward our selues; we may vse the words of our Saviour, weepe not for me but weepe for your selues, so compassionate not vs, but your selfe. And for my selfe among many others I shall ever afford you that harty pitty, <hi>non</hi>

   <p>For as the iniury, which God, and his truth haue sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in my person, is now made knowne not only vnto our nation, but the fame thereof beginneth to spread it selfe abroad in these forraine parts, so it concerneth you (my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fathers and brethren) to wipe away that disgrace, and blemish from your mother, and your selues, which some of har vnnaturall children would both staine her with, and
<pb n="6" facs="6"/> deriue vpon you; endeavoring to obscure their private folly in the publike shame. Which protection I will neuer afford vnto them, vnlesse they can obtaine it by your own consent.</p>
   <p>ANSVVER.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="7"/> I doe both humbly desire, and earnestly require you to avert this infamy from your noble mother, and to free her from the imputation, which, otherwise, you draw vpon her, as being either a Patronesse of falshood, or fearefull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the truth: which folly in the first, or pussillanimity in the second, is a great staine to men of your quality and place.</p>
