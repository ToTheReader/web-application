      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the very name of the author of this exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vvere a sufficient argument to commend the same vnto thee, yet because I haue vndertaken the publishing hereof after so many labours of our ovvne learned and godly countrimen faithfully performed in this kinde, I thought it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse in a word or two to giue some reason of my fact. And first of all the excellencie of this exposition, vvhich I commend not so much of mine owne knowledge, as vpon the iudgement of very godly and learned men, mooued me in this sort to communicate it to the whole countrie. The praise vvhich seemeth peculiar vnto it, issueth from a double fountaine: first from the learned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the words in their natiue sense, secondly from the ample and euidei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">

      <pb facs="3"/>declaration of the true and full meaning of the Spirit of God in euery petition, which he hath indeauoured to set downe from the proprietie of the wordes in the Greeke and Hebrew tongue: shewing in such sort what blessings we are to aske, and what sinnes we must bewaile, that not onely the simple by the blessing of God vpon their endeauour may in short time hereby learne to pray in faith and in obedience, but the godly also and the learned, that haue atteined to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther measure of knowledge and of grace, may increase their knowledge, and further edifie themselues in their most holy faith. Thus wishing vnto thee the Spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which may teach thee to vse the meanes whereby thou maist pray with the Spirit and with vnderstanding also, I take my leaue, and here ende.</p>
