   <p>The Author of the <hi>Grand Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi> in his first Epistle dedicated to his Maiesty, sets only forth in generall the heads of that doctrine he afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauors (though vnluckily) to make good. But Error without apparence of proofe, confutes it selfe: And it would anticipate the designe of my study, if here I should labor thy satisfaction; since the whole ensuing Treatise disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers euery of his mistakes in particuler, which at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to his Booke, he affirmes in grosse. Yet could I wish, that only truth should dare to approach the throne of Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty; and that a conscience guilty of deceipt, should not be able to pretend the confidence of the innocent: for the falsest do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may easily winne beliefe vpon the Laity, whom either much busines diuerts from the search of truth, or an vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse to be disturbed, encourageth to follow that easy path, they from their infancy haue beaten; especially when it appeares in publike asseuered by them who haue their large stipend, and high honor, only on condition to be sincere in
<pb facs="6"/>what they teach. But howeuer he may flatter himselfe that hs Reader will neuer arriue to patience inough, to trauaile beyond his Epistles, or that his authority will be sufficient, though his proofes are defectiue; I hope he will find his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to haue betrayd him: for the businesse which here we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouert, being of value far beyond the whole world beside, I meane the soule of man, and the Church, in which only that can expect safety; I doubt not <hi>(good Reader)</hi> but thou wilt be so charitable to thy selfe, as to reade, distinguish, and then reiect error, how plausible soeuer it may appeare to sense: Nor, though his reputation may haue gained heretofore much vpon thee, wilt thou belieue, that Truth is by couenant bound to christen all the abortiues of his Opinion.</p>
   <p>And wheras in his second Epistle, directed to all Romish Priests, whether Iesuits or others, he seemes by a Rhethoricall figure, to heare them censuring his charging the Church of Rome with <hi>Imposture, the bold assumption, or rather impudent, and impious presumption of an Heretike;</hi> I cannot but commend the iudgment he instructs them to pronounce: for how could the wit of Iustice inuent a more proper, or seuerer? Or to speake more truly, how could Mercy vse a gentler? And though in that single word, <hi>Heretike,</hi> all Impiety is comprehended; yet how can he deserue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sentence, who hath dared to defame thy innocency, O thou Immaculate Spouse of our great Redeemer? Who hath termed thy doctrine, which threw downe the Statues of the Heathens, and rooted vp all false worship, <hi>Idolatrous, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious?</hi> Thy doctrine, which planted the fayth of Christ with the bloud of Martyrs, and tyed vp the common enemy of man, <hi>Satanicall, and Antichristian?</hi> Thy doctrine, which is the only safety of the soule, <hi>Execrable, and Pernicious?</hi> which teacheth the true adoration of God, <hi>Blasphemous &amp; Impious?</hi> which neuer varied in the least article from the
<pb facs="6"/>truth, <hi>Schismaticall, and Hereticall?</hi> But how farre vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are these weake calumnies to wound thy strength, which hath triumpht ouer all the opposition of heresy, and hell? Thou art built vpon a Rock of Diamond, which yields the brightest lustre, when impure slander raifeth the blackest night: A Rock, which neuer moued since Christ designed it, as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for his greatest worke on earth: A rock, against which her many Aduersaries haue battered with continuall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, but still ended in froth, and noise.</p>
   <p>But all these fowle aspersions might be interpreted the wild expressions of an extrauagant zeale, and perhaps challenge that pitty we throw away vpon the franticke. Neither can any man be enraged with such infamous language, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders, it is that spirit, which possest the first professors of this pretended reformation; who created a Religion in contempt of iurisdiction. And as euery where they derogated from the spirituall, so spared they not the temporall, where feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment restraind not their tongues to modesty.</p>
   <p>But what euen amazeth my Vnderstanding, is, that so well practis'd a man in controuersy, so iealous of honor, and such a pretender to integrity, should fall into that deceitfull, and, I may say, fatall crime of the writers of his Coate, false citation, and misinterpretation of Authors. What iniury hath he done the dead, whose soules are blessed in heauen, and whose ashes are reuerenced on earth, to make them defend a doctrine, in opposition to which they emptied euery veine in their most (acred bodies? What cruelty to the liuing, by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended obedience to the authority of the primitiue times, to inforce them to belieue the errors of the present? Doth he hope, his Volumes shall fall only into the hands of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or els of the negligent, so far, that any doctrine shall posse for currant, which his fancy hath bene pleased to coyne? Did he intrust others to make scrutiny into Authors for his
<pb facs="7"/>purpose, &amp; so aduenture his reputation to the world, on an vncertaine, and perhaps vnfaythfull euidence? Or did he belieue, according to the rule of the worst Statesmen, any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation how iniurious soeuer, most iust, if it serued the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his designe? For certainly he hath giuen the world an example of such a courage, that no good Writer will euer follow, in daring thus to be disproued by any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who hath the benefit of a Library, and the patience to compare truth with falshood. For without giuing credit to the testimonies I here alleage, if any man will search into the Authors themselues, he shall find them mangled, as that<note n="(*)" place="margin">Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crustes apud Plutarch, in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seo.</note> Tyrant did his ghests (who with most barbarous torment shortned or lengthned their bodies, according to the proportion of his bed:) No man writes short of his sense, but is extended on the rack: no man beyond, but is mutilated without mercy.</p>
   <p>This discouery of his vnhappy practise I wish may beget his conuersion, not confusion. But should he be so enamoured on his error, as not to be remoued by the most forcible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Truth; I hope <hi>(Reader)</hi> in thee to reape some fruit of my labor. The Almighty in distribution of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, will not be directed by humane iudgment. Let his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wisdome therfore bestow the fruit of my study, where, &amp; on whom he pleaseth: for to his glory I must consecrate that, with whatsoeuer I am.</p>
   <p>Only <hi>(Curious Reader)</hi> I must beg thy pardon, that in endeauouring to write busines, I haue neglected language, which like that musick Poets ascribe to the Syrens, hath bene often treacherous to the hearer. Elegancy of speach is a gift, in which the wicked share equally with the good: and the most sacred tongue that euer spake, disdained to adulterate truth with any fallacy of an artificiall Phrase. The policy of some Republikes hath expeld their Orators, as subiects whom the power of eloquence rendred formidable; the multitude being
<pb facs="7"/>easy to receaue any impression through the eare; and Oratory being a weapon as sharpe to destroy, as defend the State. Nor doe I value the cunning of language worthy the industry of the serious: It may be of consequence, where well directed; but truth needs not borrow any ornament of language, to make it selfe more amiable. That which I aime at, is thy satisfaction; and that the Church of God, which is on earth no other, but the Roman, may shine vnclouded in the sight of men, as it hath euer bene most pure in the eye of God. And that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind whom error hath misled, may re-vnite themselues into her fayth; guided by which, the innocent can only hope for perseurance to glory, and the repentant a way to mercy.</p>
