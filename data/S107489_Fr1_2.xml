   <head>TO THE RIGHT
REVEREND FATHER IN
GOD, AND MY HONORABLE
LORD, WILLIAM BY DIVINE
PROVIDENCE L. BISHOP OF DVRHAM,
Grace and Peace bee
multiplied.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Reuerend Father,</hi>
the sweet refreshing your
Honourable fauours did
yeeld to such of my labors
as hitherto enioy the light,
when a suddaine vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
blast had sorely
nipt them in the very setting, makes these last
gatherings of that spring seeke that comfortable
warmth vnder your benigne protection, which
the vnconstant frowning season would hardly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord
them in their growth. Besides these and
other my personall obligements, that famous and
worthy founder of this <hi>Attick Beehiue,</hi> of whose
<pb facs="3"/>
sweetnesse would God I had beene as capable as I
haue beene long partaker, had neuer allotted any
Cell therein for me or other Countriman of mine,
but with particular relation to that seat of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which he sometimes did, your Lordship now
doth, and, to the encrease of Gods glorie and
good of his Church, long may enioy. Seeing this
our great foster Father is now ignorant of his
childrens demeanor, and knowes not me; it shall
be my comfort, to haue his honourable successors
witnesses of my care and industrie to fulfill his
godly desire, whose religious soule in his life time
(as his written lawes doe testifie) did detest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then idlenesse in the Ministrie, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in his adopted Sonnes. The matters I here
present vnto your Lordships &amp; the worlds view,
are sometimes in themselues so harsh and hard to
be concocted, as he that would striue to make them
toothsome vnto nice tastes, should put himselfe to
excessiue paines; vnlesse his iudgement be much
riper, his wit readier, his inuention pleasanter,
his opportunities better, and his leisure greater
then mine are. But it is one and the same point
of iudgement, not to require exact Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
proofes in discourses of moralitie, or a smooth
<pb facs="3"/>
facile Rhetorical stile in Logical or Scholastique
conflicts. And, as by the statutes of that societie
wherein I liue, I am bound to auoid barbarisme:
so my particular inclination moues me, in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
especially, to approue his choice that said;
<hi>Fortia mallem quam formosa.</hi> If any profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
enemie to the truth we teach, will answere me
from point to point, or attempt (not as their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
now is only in scoffing sort but seriously) to
auert those vnsupportable, but deserued imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
I lay vpon the foundation of his Religion,
I shall (I trust) be able to answere him; the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by continuance of your Lordships wonted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
whom I still request the Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as many as reape any profit from my paines
on my behalfe to remember with such respect as is
due to honorable Patrons of religious studies, or
cherishers of painefull endeuours in good causes.</p>
