                 <title>The tell-troth's reqvitall, or, Truth's recompence : as it was preached the 12th day of November, 1626, at Eckington: wherein are contained these three propositions, (vindicating Paul from the aspersion of enmity, and laying it on the Galatians,) viz. 1 No grace of God in man can secure him from the enmity of the unregenerate. 2 Sometimes a ministers owne hearers are set in variance against him. 3 The publication of the truth is the cause of this variance. By Samuel Kenrick student in divinity, and preacher of Gods word in the same place</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T were as great an injury to <hi>Custome,</hi> to write, and not to dedicate, as tis to your <hi>love,</hi> to receive a <hi>courtesie,</hi> and not study a requitall. Now, tis the happy lot of a Scholler, to play the <hi>Surgeon,</hi> and partly at one clap (with a <hi>paper-plaister</hi>) cure both griefes. I confesse, I am indebted to them both; and, in both, to you. If then, I seeme to presume, either blame Custome, or your Love. Common sense sent me to Custome; Custome, to your Love; and both challenged from me the <hi>debt</hi> of this presumption. Receive then these few rude lines, as your due, in part of payment. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them with your acceptance, as sometimes you have graced mine <hi>Auditory</hi> with your presence. I have perceived your love unto the <hi>truth;</hi> I have
<pb facs="3"/>found you a friend unto it: whither then should I send the <hi>truth</hi> but to<note n="*" place="margin">Talmud: Cholin, <hi>62.1.</hi>
      </note> such a Patron? Every thing (by some native inclination) hastens to that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it gaines. The <hi>Dog</hi> knowes his grasse; the <hi>Hart,</hi> his Dittany; the <hi>Pigeon,</hi> her Lawrell; and the <hi>Swallow</hi> her Celidon: neither is the <hi>Truth</hi> ignorant of her well-wishers, or insensible of her Physitians. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I trust, however it goes forth from me in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and disgrace; it will returne (like her selfe) in strength, and honour. But, if you knew all, you would say, it were too young to make a <hi>Martyr,</hi> and indeed the <hi>Presse</hi> befits not its infancy. It was but conceived in the morning; and brought forth ere night; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to<note n="*" place="margin">

      </note> twatle on the morrow; and (being a little sawcy with the sonnes of <hi>Belial</hi>) met with a checke, and almost dared unto martyrdome, before it could get home to my study. So, it was neither my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumption, nor foole-hardinesse, that sent it to the <hi>Printing-house,</hi> (if any shall so thinke, he will offer injury to my simplicity) nor was it (simply) that usuall argument of Apology (the <hi>Importunity</hi> of friends) but the audacious malipertness of the Adversaries of <hi>Truth,</hi> that drew it, as it were, perforce, out of mine hands. Let it therefore find the <hi>burrow</hi> of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, and you shall encourage me hereafter unto more deliberate exercises.
