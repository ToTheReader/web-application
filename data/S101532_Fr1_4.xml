                 <title>A quench-coale. Or A briefe disquisition and inquirie, in vvhat place of the church or chancell the Lords-table ought to be situated, especially vvhen the Sacrament is administered? : VVherein is evidently proved, that the Lords-table ought to be placed in the midst of the church, chancell, or quire north and south, not altar-wise, with one side against the wall: that it neither is nor ought to be stiled an altar; that Christians have no other altar but Christ alone, who hath abolished all other altars, which are either heathenish, Jewish, or popish, and not tollerable among Christians. All the pretences, authorities, arguments of Mr. Richard Shelford, Edmond Reeve, Dr. John Pocklington, and a late Coale from the altar, to the contrary in defence of altars, calling the Lords-table an altar, or placing it altarwise, are here likewise fully answered and proved to be vaine or forged.

   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That the Church of Rome is a true Church.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That personall Succession of Bishops is requisite and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall
to make a true Church.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That the Arch-Bishops and Bishops of England derive
their lineall Succession and Episcopall dignity from S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Chaire, and the very Sea of Rome, and that we should
not acknowledge them for Bishops in case they either did
not, or could not doe so.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb n="63" facs="32"/>
      <q>That the Pope of Rome or Papacy is not the Antichrist;
Nor Antichrist yet come or revealed.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That Crucifixes and Images in Churches are Lawfull
and necessary comly Ornaments.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That Christ is Really present upon Earth, on the High-Altar
and Communion-Table.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That Communion-Tables are Altars; Ministers of
the Gospell, Priests serving at the Altar; The Sacrament
of the Lords Supper, the Sacrament of the Altar, and may
yea ought so to be phrased.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That men ought to bow to Altars and Communion-Tables,
and to place and Rayle them in Altar-wise at the
East end of the Church, and come up to them, and receive
when there is a Sacrament; And that Ministers must read
their Second Service at them when there is none.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That auricular Confession to a Priest and Absolution are
very fitting and necessary: (points much insisted on, and
pressed at this present, when Cleargie-mens sinnes are so
open and notorious, that they need no Confession, but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
rather.)</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That the Lords-day is no Sabbath.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That it is Iewish to call or keep it as a Sabbath.</q>
   </p>

      <q>That it is not of divine but humane Institution, nor
within the morality of the fourth Commaundement.</q>

   <p>
      <q>That two howers only of it are to be sanctified, nor the
whole day.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That Morrises, Dancing, Sports and Pastimes (yea la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

on it.</q>

      <q>That men may fall totally and finally from
Grace.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb n="64" facs="33"/>
      <q>That they have free-will, and may exactly fulfill the
Law of God if they please themselves.</q>

   <p>
      <q>That men are justified by workes, yea by charity, and not
by faith alone.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That men are Elected from the foresight of faith and
workes, and Reprobated only out of the foresight of their
sinnes.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That there is an universall grace given to all men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they may be saved if they will.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That Christ died alike for all men wha soaver.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That preaching is an extraordinary thing<note n="*" place="margin">Among the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops it is so.</note> necessary
only for extraordinary times, and belonging to none but
extraordinary men.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That one Sermon in a Month is enough and better then
two a day.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That reading is properly preaching.</q>

and degree is above other Ministers, <hi>Iure divino.</hi>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That the Ministers know more then the Lay-people,
the Bishops more then the Ministers, the Arch-Bishops
more then the Bishops; And therefore; what ever the
Ministers shall teach or prescribe the people, what ever the
Bishops, the Ministers and people; what ever the Arch-Bishops,
the Bishops, Ministers and people too, are bound
to believe and obey, without further question or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That the Popes Lawes, Decrees and Canon-Law are still
in force, and our Church ought to be governed by them,
and our Ecclesiasticall Courts proceed Legally according
to them.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That Bishops have power to make and publish Articles,
Canons, Injunctions, Oathes, Orders, Rites &amp; Ceremonies
in their owne names and rights, and to enforce both
<pb n="65" facs="33"/>
Ministers and people to obey them.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That they may silence, suspend and excommunicate,
(yea deprive and imprison) Ministers at their pleasure
without any Legall cause.</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That Bishops are not bound to preach so much or so oft
as other men, (though they have greater wages, and so
should doe more worke;)</q>
   </p>
   <p>
      <q>That they may Lawfully and laudablie neglect their
spirituall functions to mannage temporall Offices and
affaires, exercise both Swords at once, and rule both Church
and State together.</q>
   </p>
   <p>When I see out owne Divines (if we may believe them)
by publike License in printed Bookes defending all these
with sundrie other erronious Romish Positions, maintaining
all Popish Ceremonies, conforming themselves to Popish
Masse-Priests, in their noddes, cringes, genuflections, habits,
preaching, writing, Ceremonies; And joyning thus with
them in a most treacherous confederacie against the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished

many late Writers, and by Name <hi>Bishop Mountague, Bishop
White, Edmond Reene, Dr. Pocklington, Dr. Heylyn, Dr.

      </gap> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
Bookes in print, (which no man can have free liberty

to ingrosse the power and commaund of all our
printing Presses into their owne hands, and to stay what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
may either detect or crosse their Antichristian Romish
designes.)</p>
   <p>When I behold all this, I say, even with a bleeding
heart and troubled spirit, how can I but unloose my hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
silent tongue and penne, and cry out aloud that all may
heare, to these open Powder. Traytours, who would blow
up our Religion and our Church at once; <hi>O men, doe not
thus murther and destroy the Church of England.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now, because I cannot at once encounter all those who
are guilty of this unnaturall Treachery, nor crush all these
viperous Cockatrices in the shell, I have here single &amp; out
some three or foure of them to combate with, (especially

         </gap>swing
<pb n="67" facs="34"/>
of the Communion Table an Altar, and the placing of it Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
with one side against the Wall, as the East end of the
Church.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>VVhich they have earnestly pleaded for in late printed
Bookes, in open affront and defiance to <hi>our Statu<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>es, Articles
of Religion, Booke of Common-Prayer, Injunctions, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
Martyrs, and most Eminent Writers.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Which particulars though they seeme small at first view,
and are slighted by many, as matters of no great moment,
yet, all Circumstances considered, they are very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
and the conniving at them without Opposition, like to
prove fatall to our Religion, as the Reading of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
itselfe, will evidence more at large.</p>
   <p>To make this apparant in few words; There is no man
almost so ignorant, as not to know; So blinde, as not to see
that there is a strong faction sprung up of late among us (the
heades whereof were particularly voted and descried in
Parliament-House the last Parliament) who labour with all
diligence, power, and cunning artifice, to bring the whole
body of Popery into our Church againe, yet secretly by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
with as little noyse as might be, by those severall Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagemes
and meanes, which that cunning-pated Iesuite
<hi>Adam Contzin in his Booke of</hi>
      <note n="e" place="margin">L. 2. c. 17. 18. 19 See the Booke called, Looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you.</note>
      <hi>Politickes printed at
Mentz, Anno 1621.</hi> hath prescribed them for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
Which they prosecute and follow to an haires-breadth.</p>
   <p>To effect this Plot the better (according to the Popes
consultation and direction in his Conclave) they first vented
all the Arminian points in printed Bookes; Which though
at first oppugned by many to their hazard, have now (under
a pretence of silencing all controversies in this kinde) quite
silenced the truth itselfe; Being now publikely printed and
<pb n="68" facs="35"/>
preached every where without controll, contrary to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Proclamation, concerning the inhibiting and calling in
of</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">P. 20. 21. 42.</note>
      <hi>Mountagues Booke</hi> (which led the Dance,) <hi>in his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before the 39. Articles;</hi> And concerning the <hi>Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the last Parliament;</hi> Which are now made snares on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by these potent Confederates (contrary to his Majesties
pious intention) to suppresse the truth, and bring those into
trouble, who defend it against Arminian Novelties or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Tenents, either by printing or preaching.</p>
   <p>Next after this, they began to crie up, practise, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ny superstitious Popish Ceremonies, especially
<hi>bowing at the name of Iesus, both in time of Divine Service and
Sermons,</hi> to the end it might usher in bowing to Altars,
Images, Crucifixes, with adoration of the Sacramentall
bread and wine; Which Ceremonie getting head by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
many suffring for opposing it, and others either ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
or cowardly submitting to it, though not prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in the Booke of Common-Prayer; Then they began at
first in some private places to set up Images, Altars, yea Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifixes
in Churches, directly <hi>contrary to our</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">Against the Perill of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</note>
      <hi>Homilies;</hi> To
call Lords-Tables, Altars; To turne them Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
or into Altars, and bow downe unto them.</p>
   <p>And because an Altar without a Priest was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
they next begin, to tearme themselves with other
Ministers by no other name but Priestes; Yea Priestes to
dance attendance on these new Altars, both in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
Bookes and VVritings.</p>
   <p>VVhich being done but secretly in corners (as every
Evill is bashfull at first, and creepes up but by degrees)
these new devises also got<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> ground by litle and litle, some
potent Bishops setting them on, and countenancing them
under hand, Crushing such who chiefly oppugned
<pb n="69" facs="35"/>
these Innovations in the High-Commission and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
   <p>And having thus by publike Censures and these under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>and
Devises given open countenance to them, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned
people from opposing them, they grew in a short
time so impudent as openly to plead for Jmages, Altars,
Priestes, turning of Communion-Tables Altar-wise, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them and at the name of Iesus, reading of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Service at them, standing up at <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> the
Gospell, &amp;c. and that not only in the Pulpit, but in the
High-Commission and in print, setting some shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
fellowes (as <hi>Giles Widdowes, Reeve and Shelford)</hi>
in the fore-front to breake the Ice, to see how the people
would relish them; And then when these men had borne
the brunt and blame for a while, and the strangenes of the
things was almost vanished, seconding them with others
of better note and parts, to give greater Countenance to
them, that people might the more willingly embrace these
Innovations.</p>
   <p>VVhich being thus once pleaded for in print, our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
(the chiefe Plotters and fomenters of them) begin
first more covertly under-hand by way of persuasion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie,
and now at last openly in their Visitation-Articles

him in their fore-plotted order,) to enjoyne all these
Innovations, Popish Practises and Ceremonies to be put in

are growen so impudent, as to excommunicate, suspend,

      </gap> it is plaine (according to the moderne Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists

Masse without an Altar, or Super-Altar; No Altar but at
the East end of the Church, as remote from the people

And neither Masse nor Altar without a Sacrifice, a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Controversie by our owne English Martyrs, VVriters and

though he writ <hi>An History of it,</hi> so J wonder how he
