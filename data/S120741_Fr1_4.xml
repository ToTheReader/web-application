   <head>THE PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>YRESIAS King</hi> the <hi>Thebanes</hi> being in that foolishe minde, &amp; so perswaded with him selfe that the Stars had no such Pryuiledge or rule in Mans body, or else, as the Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logians did playnely affirme, was (as the Poets Imagine) with the aduise and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the all (not suffering such speech) striken starke blind and quite bereued of his sense of seing. And in deede those ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant men or vnaduised sort which are in a manner come to the same passe that COTTA the Epicure with CICE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RO, &amp; DEMOCRITVS were at, that all things here belowe come to passe by chaunce, meere Casually, or at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, accordingly as they hap well or ill, they are eyther blinde in knowledge, or else are wedded to much to their owne Wits and Willes, dealing with the caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall povvers preposterously. For PTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOMY plainely proueth an especiall
<pb facs="5"/>kinde of Influence from them all, vvhich disposeth all bodies here beneath accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to euery ones especiall and naturall propriety. In so much that BALBVS the Stoycke is rather to be borne withall, then these kynde of Men, which vppon three Principall causes, and considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was enforced and driuen to graunte some superior kindes of fatall prouidēce. And the firste reason and cause therevnto moouinge him vvas the viewe of such sundrye Varietyes, and such plentifull stoare of Commodities, as which doe dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arise both in the Earth as in the Sea and Ayre, through the contemperature, and variable disposition of the heauenly powers. The second occasiō that brought him hereto was, the perceyuinge of the wonderful differences and contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertyes both of minde as of body in all thinges almost, that hee coulde not chose but thinke and Imagine a sundrye cause for euery one. Thirdly the distinct order and placinge of eche thinge to the better cōtinuation of the same in his kinde, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked and enforced him for to rest and grounde vpon some Superior workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters or Authors aboue. Moreouer a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
<pb facs="6"/>of the Planets, property, and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth in this respect offer it selfe to be seene apparantly, euen in the frame &amp; Workemanship of Man kinde, vvhereas euery person almost hath his seuerall and sundry Inclination: some to vertue, some agayn to vice: some also hauing good hap, and other some hauing sinister fortune. And whereas vvicked men for the moste porte ruffle in the vvorld, fortune alwais laughing on thē: as MARIVS, SYL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LA, DYONISIVS the cruell Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, PYSISTRATVS, POLY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRATES, &amp; PHALARIS, And cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwyse it is here vvith goodmē for the most parte, as it vvas vvith PAVLVS AEMILIVS a valyaunte Vanquisher, and a good man, yet through cruell fate murdered &amp; slayne vvith his vvhole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at a skyrmishe fought at <hi>Canna.</hi> It vvas also Aphricanus his hap to be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his countrey and to dye in exile. It vvas CATVLVS his chaunce to bee slayne of his mortall enemy MARIVS. The two valiaunte SCYPIOES lost their liues in <hi>Spayne.</hi> Yea and vvee see dayly the suddayne rysing of many men from their lowe Estate to the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb facs="6"/>of dignity: as IPHICRATES a Coblers sonne, aduaunced to bee a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnder ARTAXERZES king of <hi>Persia.</hi> RVMENES CARDIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVS borne in <hi>Peloponesus</hi> a Carters son, aftervvards made Cōusay lor to ALEX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANDER the greate. AGATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLES a Potters son, aftervvards chiefe of <hi>Syracusa.</hi> IVLIVS LICINIVS a Husband mans son aftervvards Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Dacia.</hi> Yea, and many contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise being Royally and nobly borne by fatall destiny haue fell from aloft: as AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIBIADES, POMPEYE, yea &amp; PTOLOMEVS the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> king vvhich in hys ruffe and youthfull dayes, banquetted &amp; feasted dayly a Thowsand Guestes ordinarely, seruinge them all in their Golden Plate, and yet hee himselfe aftervvardes as he grevve olde vvas dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to that extremity, that he vvas faine to be sustayned &amp; relieued at other mens handes very barely and coursly. Yea, and besides this many haue such cruell desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye that as soone as they bee borne they are subiect to be swallowed and soopt vp straightwais of some one daūger or other:
<pb facs="7"/>as was SEMIRAMIS borne of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bloude: and PYRRHVS, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards King of the <hi>Epirotet.</hi> Which both were throwen out &amp; cast frō their frends being Sucklings and Infants, and yet by fate of Fortune and by great prouidence preserued euen at the very dent &amp; brym of present and Imminent destruction. By such meanes also was CYRVS so hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of from his friends, sustayned &amp; nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by the meanes of a Bitche: so was TELEPHVS by a Harte: PELIAS Son to NEPTVNVS by a Mare: PARIS by a she Beare: AEGYSTVS by a she Goate: ROMVLVS, and REMVS by a she Woulfe. In the wonderfull deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery &amp; dealing vvhereof vvhat kinde of Fate and Prouidence this and an Infinite number such lyke was, I referre the same (gentle reader) to thine owne determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereof this Treatise (if thou vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chsafest the thorough Readinge thereof) doth shewe forth both in proofe &amp; in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample more aboundantly. The name al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so vvhich I haue gieuen to this booke cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge it the <hi>Dyall</hi> of <hi>Destiny,</hi> doth well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough as I thinke agree to the purpose. For Dyall vyise it goeth from poynte &amp;
<pb facs="7"/>poynte, and frō Degree to Degree shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the subiection of euery eche kinde to his sundry and seuerall Superior Planet. Which labos of mine such as it is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue thou thankfully: And thē haue I that Recompence that I doe require.</p>
