And as for the oration<note place="margin">Oracy</note> it selse which as it is most learned / so is it most elegant / to what purpose shoulde I make any wordes of it / seīge it praiseth it selfe ynough / &amp; sence good wyne nedeth no tauerne busshe / to vttre it. But yet in this oration who so ever thou arte most gentill read: thou shalte /

beside other maters / see it notably &amp; learnedly handled / of what importaunce and how invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible the power and excellencie of Goddes tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the is: which as it maye now and than be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of enemies / so it can not possiblie be oppres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed after suche sorte / but it commeth agayne at leynght behinde the scriene / more glorious and more welcome. Thou shalt see also / touchinge obediēce / that it is subiecte to truthe / and what is to be iudged true obedience. Besides this / of mennes tradicions / which for the most parte are vtterly repugnaunt against the truthe of Goddes lawe. And ther by the waye / he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the kinges said highnesses mariage / which / by the rype iudgement antoritie and priuilege of the most and principall vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the worlde / and than with the consent of the hole churche of Englande / he contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the most cleare and most noble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy / Quene Anne.</p>

   <p>Lastly of all / of the false pretensed suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Bishop of Rome / in the realme of Englande / most iustly abrogated: and how all other bishoppes / being felowe like to him in

   <p>It is an olde saide sawe: Marie Magdalene {pro}fited vs lesse in her quycke belefe that Christ was risen / than Thomas that was longer in doubt.

Thou shouldest / gentill reader / este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me his censure and authoritie to be of the more weightye credēce / in asmuche as the mater was not rashely / and at all advētures / but with iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement (as thou seest) and with wisedome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and discussed.
