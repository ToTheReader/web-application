      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue perused your learned and
godlye trauayle touchynge the
matter of vsury, M. D. Wilson,
and haue no doubt, but if it may
please you to make it common:
verie much good may growe of
it. Suche varietie of matter, suche weyghte of
reasons, suche examples of antiquitie, suche au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of doctours both Greekes and latines,
suche allegation of lawes not onely Ciuil, and
Canon, but also prouincial and temporal, such
varietie of cases so learnedly and so clearely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
suche learninge, suche eloquence, and so
euident witnesse of gods holye wyl, can neuer
possibly passe in vayne. I wyll not flatter you,
I cannot, it becommeth mee not. I assure you,
I like all notably wel: <hi>Si quid mei est iudicij,</hi> and
if my liking be worth the liking. But of al other
<pb facs="17"/>
thinges this liketh mee best. Of the three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
you make eche one to speake naturally like
hym selfe, as if you had beene in eche of them, or
they in you. What it shall worke in other I can
not tell, for mine owne parte, if I weare an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer
neuer so gredyly bent to spoile and rauine,
<hi>vt sunt faeneratores,</hi> yet woulde I thinke my selfe
most vnhappye, if such perswasions, coulde not
moue mee. For what man woulde not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
to lyue desperately in that state of life, that
hee seeth manifestly condemned by heathens, by
Christians, by the olde fathers, by the auncient
counselles, by Emperours, by Bishoppes, by
decrees, by Canons, by all sectes of all regy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp; of al relygions, by the Gospel of Chryst,
by the mouthe of god? <hi>Ago breuiter, vt vides, non
enim id mihi sumo, vt damnem large hoc tám horren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
peccatum, id tibi relinquo.</hi>
