And bycause that a number of these whiche so greatly reuerence Councels are Atheistes and Epicuriens, saying in their hartes there is no God, and do scoffe and fleere at the word of God, being ouer well sene in the principles of the Popes diuinitie, which say that there is no God, and that all that euer is spoken of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is but fables, and the whole Scriptures lyes, as by their lyues right well they do declare.

This Alexāder when he had made an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunce with deuils, he gaue him selfe wholly vnto them and became their subiect, to the end that by their meane he might
<pb facs="5"/> attaine to the Papall dignitie, whiche thyng they promised &amp; did fulfill: after that he gouerned him selfe in so holy a sorte that afterwarde durynge his lyfe he neuer entreprised any thynge, without their counsell. There are manye thinges in writyng, whiche are very notable, and worthy of a Pope of Rome and successor of S. Peter: for there are in the Latin certaine excellent verses and very worthy to be noted, which set forth very well the prayses of this most holy father, the sence wherof doth folow here. Alexander selleth Crosses, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tares yea &amp; Iesus Christ him self: first he bought thē, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he may well sell them.

      </gap> into a chamber in a certayne place called mount <hi>Cauallus,</hi> and there came vnto him my Lord the Prothonota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, beyng a man of a meane age very honorably apparelled, who after certayne deuise and discourse hadde, assured him, that he should be Pope, who beyng then full of ioy enquired of the tyme, and how long he should raygne. This reuerend prothonotarie made hym a deceptiue aūswere, full of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, to wit that he should raigne xi. and viii. the Cardinal foolishly persuaded him self that he should raygne in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pall dignitie. 19. yeares, albeit that the promes was but for xi. yeares and. 8. monethes when Innocent the. 8. was dead Rodericke Borgia was created and established Pope, who forthwith named hym selfe Alexander the vi. now he did for the space of. 11. yeares and 8. monethes meruelously trouble and oppresse Italie, he beyng old began to be diseased &amp; sicke wherupon he kept his bed, and commaunded one of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes named <hi>Modena</hi> (who was most priuy and familiar with hym of al those of hys Court) to go into his garde robe and to bryng hym a litle booke richly set, with gold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones: which was in a certaine boxe or drawer, which he appointed hym vnto. This litle booke contayned all the sortes and kyndes of illusions and enchauntements of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gromancie, where at, this old man determined to enquire &amp; to assertaine him selfe, of the ende and closyng vp of his lyfe: this seruaunt accordyng to the commaundement of his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, went to the place, and as he was entryng in at the dore of the chamber, he saw one fit in the Popes chaire, who was very lyke vnto hys maister, which when he saw (beyng hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly affrayd) returned and ran to his maister, without brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gyng the boke with hym, to whom he declared what he had sene: which thyng when the Pope vnderstood fully, and saw his seruaunt so affrayed: he let hym alone for a tyme, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde he so wrought with hym, that he caused hym to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to hys garde robe, to see if he could espie the aforesayd Pope: &amp; whether he would say any thyng to hym or no. The
<pb facs="6"/> seruaunt beyng entred into the chamber agayne, found there hym whom he had sene there before but he was far greater: he that sat asked hym, why he came thyther, and what he had to do there: who beynge excedyngly affrayde &amp; in maner out of breath, aunswered, that he came for a certayne garment for the Pope, Then the deuill cast forth an horrible grone, &amp; sayd to hym, what Pope? I am Pepe my self. when Alexāder vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstood this, hys maladie encreased, &amp; his death approched. Shortly after one appareled lyke a courtier, came to the chā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber where the Pope laye, and knocked very lowdly, saying that he must nedes speake with hym. The doore beyng ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto hym, he came and spake with the Pope, all others wer retired from them. The Pope and he talked very secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but mē might se be their coūtenances, that they wer very earnest and in great contention betwene them selues, &amp; that the Pope was not well cōtent, for he sayd to hym: how may this be? my tyme is not yet expired, thou knowst that I had 19. yeares, wherof I haue passed but. 11. &amp; 8. monethes. wher upon they heard the courtier aunswere hym boldly, you dyd mistake that worde, for I sayd not. 19. yeares, but I ment. 11. yeares and 8. monethes, should be the raigns of thy Papacy, and therfore thou must needes dye. Now albeit the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quested instantly, that he would haue consideration of hys lyfe, and terme of yeares concernyng hys Papacy: it was as if he had spokē to a deafe man, for al hys exceptiōs, requestes and allegations could stand hym in no stede: for al that were in the chamber might well see, that the deuill was more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Arithmetique, then was the Pope, and in the ende it was easyly cōcluded that Alexander had erred in hys accōp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Finally to cōclude the matter, when Satan departed frō thēce, forthwith the soule of the Pope: most miserably depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted frō hys body, with horrible cryes and feareful gronyngs and bewaylyngs. And in this sort most miserably, wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wickedly, dyed the Pope Alexander, surnamed the 6. leauyng to hys sonne his patrimonie, greatly engayged and encombred, &amp; the Italians theyr Romane common wealth, wholly confused disordered and spoyled, to the end he might be an example, to all ages to declare how that thynges euyll goten are consumed &amp; spent miserably &amp; wickedly, <hi>

Touching virgins S. Paule sayth. I haue no cōmaundmēt of the Lord, but I do coūsel or aduise, if the doctor of the Gentils had no commaundemēt, who is he that might haue any? And truly he had no cōmaundment, but he did counsell therunto, for virginitie can not be cōmaū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded, it may wel be desired, for that which is not in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is not to be cōmaūded, but it is to be wished for.

Yet is not the Pope affrayde to say (and stand agaynst God and Christ) that mariage is vnclennes, pollution and carnal filthynes, as it is said in the. 4. of the sentēces. <hi>Dist c.</hi> 17. chap. 4. and his decret. 27. <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. chap. whiche begynneth. <hi>Cum so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietas</hi> Tertulian in his prescriptions agaynst the heretikes, sayth.

And I doubt not (although these men haue nothing in their mouthes but the fathers, the fathers which must authorise the scriptures vnto thē) if the fathers liued in these daies, but they wold be as readye to persecute them as they are to persecute those which in these dayes do professe Christ.

I suppose the number wil appeare very smal, for they are al in leage with Sathan.

S. Chrisostome vpon S. Iohn in hys. 10. Homely. 5. Tome and. 1. chap. sayth: And <note place="margin">Gōmoditie of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture.</note> you shall be much more sharpe &amp; subtil, not onely to heare &amp; vnderstand, but also to teache others. &amp;c. And within fewe lines after in the same Homelie he sayth, they which ar neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligēt haue yet an other excuse verye vn apt, to wit that they haue no bookes. This were a very vayne aunswere for the riche to make, but for so much as many poore men do often tymes make this excuse, I will some thyng say to them: and <note place="margin">Carelesse nesse of the Christians</note> will aske thē, if they haue not al theyr tooles &amp; instrumētes, which do belong to theyr occupatiōs &amp; craftes not withstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyng theyr pouertie. Is not this then a great foly to excuse
<pb facs="12"/> thē by theyr pouertie, &amp; yet they so prouide that they wāt no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing belōgyng to theyr occupatiōs, &amp; yet they excuse thē sel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues vpō theyr pouertie &amp; occupatiōs, in a matter which is so cōmodious vnto thē. S. Chrisosto. in his. 3. sermon of Lazar sayth: Seest thou not the workers of metals, gold smythes, siluer smithes, &amp; such like mē of occupatiōs, that they haue al theyr tooles redy which belōg to their occupations? &amp; albeit that hūger pinch them, &amp; pouertie afflict thē, yet had they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endure any kynde of these miseries, thē to sel any instru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment that belongeth to their occupation, by the whiche they liue. &amp;c. S. Chrisostome in the same sermon sayth, that a man may get great holynes and perfection by reading of the holy Scriptures, and the holy Ghost hath so tempered them, that he would haue sinners and Publicans saued: yea &amp; to the end that the Idiots and vnlerned should be without excuse tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chyng the hardnes of the vnderstandyng therof, he hath wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led that the thynges therin spoken, should be so easy euen at the first sight, that men of occupation &amp; laborers, seruaunts, women, widowes, and such like that are most ignoraunt of all others, might by the readyng therof obtayne vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. &amp;c. The Scripture is the power of God to saluatiō, by it we knowe God and Christ, by it we knowe our selues, by it we are taught our duety toward our neyghbour, by it we learn to obei our prince, by it we know the true Prophet frō the false: the Scriptures ar to be preferred before al the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of men, it is the touche stone wherby we ought to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <note place="margin">Ad Regina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer Origene vpō the Prophet Iere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mie in his. 1.

And within fewe lynes after he sayth: Assuredly thorowe ignoraūce of the law, men shall receiue Antichrist for Christ. &amp;c. S. Cypriā to Cecil in his. 3. boke of his Epistles &amp;. 3. Epi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stle saith: yf you do that which I cōmaūde you. I will not cal you my seruaūtes, but my frends. And also that Christ ought onely to be herd, the father hath borne witnes from heauen, saying: This is my welbeloued sonne, in whom I am well pleased, heare him: wherfore, if it be so y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Christ onely ought to be herd, then ought we not to looke what any man before vs hath thought good to be done: but y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which Christ, who is <note place="margin">Christ and not custom is to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed</note> before all hath done: for we are not boūd to folow y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> custome of mē, but the truth of God, for so much as God sayth by his Prophet Esay, in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>. 29. chap: They honor me in vain, teaching
