   <head>TO EACH READER OF <hi>whatsoever qualitie or condition.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Vdicious and Courteous Reader, knowing (by many experiences) that those who are most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, learned, or capable, are generally ever most favourable and sparing in their censures. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have presumed to commit this Poeme to thy view, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating thee, that though perhaps it doe not give thee every way content, and that in respect it is voyd of ornate or elegant phrase, and not of an Heroicke stile: and therfore not answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to thy expectation, nor my desire: yet since it is (though not as I would, yet such as I could) allow me this gaines for my paines, that it passe without checke. But after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsing hereof, if thou bee so benevolently disposed, (though not to commend the worke) yet to approve my aime, I shall for that vndeserved favour, ever esteeme my selfe infinitely bound to thy courtesie. But if thou prove towards mee an invective Critick, I am enforced to tel thee, that <hi>Momists</hi> are little or nothing respected. And <hi>Zoylus,</hi> though through car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at <hi>Homerus</hi> his workes, acquired the name of <hi>Homero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastix</hi> (which is <hi>Homers</hi> scourge) yet was he laught at for his paines, because he disapproved the worke which hee could neither amend nor paralell. It likewise was reputed a cynical humour in <hi>Phocion</hi> (though hee was <hi>Plato</hi> his scholler) to carp at every man that wore shooes, because he himself went alwayes bare-footed. Likewise let me advise thee, if thou be a Poet, that thou doe not, with <hi>Theon,</hi> satyrickly inveigh at those who are thy betters, because thou thy selfe comest short of their worke, and therefore canst neither merite nor attaine the like commendation. Grudge not therefore because that the Poetical talent is not bestowed vpon every one alike, but rather endevour through study (if thou be so vertuously incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) to extend the Talent thou hast allowed thee. But if thou be illiterate, and yet aime to censure (if thou hadst vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding) this Poeme invectively, I will advise thee for
<pb facs="4"/>
thy profite (though I have small reason so to doe, in respect of thy malevolentinent) to desist, lest thou give me occasion to say, <hi>Ne Sutor vltra crepidam:</hi> or, smiling at thy peevish humour, intreat thee to meddle onely with such things as come within the compasse of thy capacitie. Yea, though thou be indifferently well affected, yet if ihou be vnlearned, I dare hardly adventure to come within the circuite of thy censure, lest either through misconstruing the subiect, or maimedly reading the verse, thou value my labour at too low a rate. But vnhappy hee (and worthy to bee esteemed the Prince of fooles) who willingly consents to vnder-goe the censure of those who are both besotted with ignorance, and of a Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick disposition. Yet expecting the best of every Reader, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I by those, no otherwayes have deserved, I thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, which every one that is capable must allow, as a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma,</hi> that since love ever aimes at a correspondencie, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of the inequalitie of persons. For as the old Scottish Adage goeth, <hi>Love cannot stand on the one side.</hi> So Reader, I whatsoever thou be) according to thy censure of these my labours, rest towards thee affected, even thus,</p>
