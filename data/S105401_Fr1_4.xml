Vpon the Lords day, beeing
the third day after our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
sufferings, two disciples
<pb facs="8"/>
trauelling from Ierusalem to
a village called Emaus as they
walked on their way, they
talked of Iesus. And as they
thus communed, Iesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
drew neere, and went
with them,<note place="margin">Luc. 24. 13.</note> and afterward
questioning with them, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto them the Scriptures
tarries with them, sits witb
them, blesseth their meat, eats
with them, giues them a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>For this cause I haue often
bowed the knees of my heart
vnto the God of heauen for
you all, and haue presumed to
reduce the summe of all into
this little Manuall, as the
Protestants portuize to carry
in his hand, in his bosome,
and to accompany him in your
trauels, as <hi>Paul</hi> had his parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with him, which casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
he left at <hi>Troas,</hi> and
whereof it seemed hee had an
especiall care. Let not the
prudent Iudge disdaine or
despise that I become his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer,
for the time is
come that wee must looke to
our Christian principles, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many are gone so farre to
question long receiued truthes
in the spirit of subtiltie and
error, as if the <hi>Metempsyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
of the Pythagorists were
<pb facs="9"/>
reuiued, and the soule of
<hi>Iohn Duns Scotus</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the bodyes of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuing
schollers, to trouble
the world with nicities, and
to lose themselues in misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
extrauagant wandrings.
It was a good rule therefore
that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> gaue, <hi>That we
should diligently heede
neuer to bee transported
beyond the limits of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall
Principles,</hi> which
indeede is a glosse of that of
the Apostle, <hi>Sapere ad so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietatem.</hi>
The iolly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celler
that learnedly argues
titles of land, pleas of debt,
dammages of clyent, &amp; cause,
may hereby bee counselled to
call to minde what claime, or
challenge he hath to heauen,
what plea hee ought to make
for his owne debt, which hee
<pb facs="10"/>
oweth to his Creator, and if
the damnage or wrong of his
Clyent were his owne, what
plea, what care, what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e vse to redres
himselfe. The disturbed, yea
oft times the poore miserable
distracted Clyent, that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed,
crossed, encumbred,
snibbed, &amp; many times ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,
may herewithall ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to qualifiè and settle his
wearyed and perplexed heart
and looke vp vnto the master
of requests in heauen, and to
referre his cause vnto the
Iudge of the world Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
who iudgeth righteously.
And if his cause goe well
with him, yet hereby h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e
may bee caused to remember
in what passe his case is with
God, and to know who it is
<pb facs="10"/>
that lets a man see his desire
vpon his enemies.</p>
   <p>All what soeuer they be, if
they will be pleased to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised,
may herein see (as in
a viewe) what Creation is,
that tendeth to saluation. And
so to abandon from their holy
intentions all needelesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies,
and fruitlesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the prefixed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</p>
   <p>For the lamentable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies
about Religious

      <note place="margin">An abridge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies. raysed from the word of the Context, <gap reason="foreign">

      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in nature, that the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
labours of any one
man (were he neuer so well
qualified) cannot sufficiently
(no not all the time of his
life) so much as enter
<pb facs="11"/>
into all the ambiguous labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths
thereof, much lesse bee
euer able to compose, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them. For it falleth out
in this kind, as it doth in the
quirks and quiddities of law
cases, and thats a thousand
pitties, for the more lawyers
retained oft times the more
suites, pleas, counter pleas, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrers
in Law, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such like quaint deuises
so the morewriting of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies,
the more subtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ies, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasions,
distinctions, perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
aspersions, mistakings
with all maleuolent stirrings,
and striuings to make good
either part. Such also hath
beene the rotten condition of
mankinde, that when one
hath once hatched, &amp; brought
foorth neuer so absured an
opinion, yet he findeth wits
<pb facs="11"/>
in the world ready to deuise
trickes and shifts by nice di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,
and doubt full dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
to mainetaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
possible glosses the absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
and shadowes thereof.
Besides, if we consider the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilitie
of composing, and
reconciling the controuersies
of the setimes, by reason of the
auerse, and setled resistance
of the opponents, both foraine
and domestick, together with
the irreconciliable natures of
the things controuerted, and
questioned, and the little hope
of any meanes to bee expected
either from them that striue,
or from others their well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wishing
neighbours, or from
both to reconcile, and pacifie
the furiousrage of either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
wee may euen despayre of
<pb facs="12"/>
expecting any certaine and
setled ende of these miseries,
vntill the Lord Iesus come
himselfe from heauen in his
second and most glorious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent,
and <hi>Consume with the
spirit of his mouth</hi> all the
gaynesayers and impostors of
his sacred truth, and abolish
<hi>with brightnes of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>
all the mistie fogges of
misperswasion and mis-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe.</p>
   <p>Doubtlesse therefore in
the meane while, the best,
and most assured way for vs
(that loue, and looke, and
long for Christs comming) to
finde rest to our distressed
soules amidst such perplexed
distractions and laborinths,
is, to haue recourse to the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and foundation of all
<pb facs="12"/>
Christian faith, the director
to heauen, which is the <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
word of God,</hi> the one
and onely way to the word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
wherein, many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
wee shall finde couched in
in few words the summe and
substance of all our hope, and
happinesse in Christ, both in
nature grace, and glory, and
that summe of Christianitie
in so compendious an abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
oft times reported, that
the shortest memorie may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it, and so playnely set
downe that the weakest capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
may conceiue it. Such
is this Scripture prefixed, in
which as in a running stream
in some place the Elephant
may swim for deepenes, and
in other the Lambe may wade
for shall ownesse.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="13"/>Leauing therfore behind vs
the hellish afronting of all
Godlinesse to the damned A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest,
that sayth in his hart,
<hi>There is no God,</hi> which
some Achrists of <hi>Spaine</hi> (I

most <hi>Lucian</hi>-like, and
<hi>Iulian</hi>-like haue tearmes to

their <hi>Peccadillos,</hi> or little

because they feele not the
power thereof, nor endeauour
to practise it together with

who neyther cleaue to God,

needes must be dough on the
one side, and burnt on the

abandoning from vs all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell

or by what other

they bee tearmed, who
<pb facs="14"/>
vndertake to haue the onely
direction for all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<hi>in ordine ad Deum,</hi>
or with the Capucini, who
aspire the onely mortification
(forsooth) in a patched Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouch,
and with them vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forsaking all other rabbles,
and swarmes of monasticall,
and secular nominals, who
neglect the truth, and the
light thereof, Let vs flie
homeward with the distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
doue into the Arke, which
is the holy Scriptures to saue
our selues from the general
deluge and cataclisme of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities,
questions and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowings
of vngodlinesse,
which assault vs here in this
life, the Ocean and sea of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and hide from vs the
brightnesse of Iesus Christ,
with the mists of impietie,
<pb facs="14"/>
and fogs of vanity.</p>
   <p>And let vs call to minde
that all vnderstanding in
Godlinesse is eyther Opnion
Faith, or perfect Knowledge.</p>
   <p>Opinion beeing like the
Twilight, neyther certaine▪
nor euident. Faith, as the
dawning, certaine but not
euident and perfect.</p>
   <p>Knowledge as the Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine
both certaine and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
   <p>Opinion beeing the
Conduite pipe of all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies,
the mother of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
the seede of schisme, and
the heade of a Foxe, and
perfect knowledge, onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to our triumphant and
glorious estate in Heauen:
wee must here in this Life
walke by faith. This faith
<pb facs="15"/>
must haue a foundation to
build vpon, Whats that?
must it bee built on the
Church? thats to generall: so
the Sarazens, or Hagarens
rather (as <hi>Zozomene</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
a thousand yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe,
haue their Masters. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the Fathers? thats too
rusticall, so the Iewes haue
their Rabbins. Vpon the
Pope, thats too Phythagorical?
so the Gentiles had their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
of their seuerall
sects, Vpon suddaine and
fancifull reuelations, thats
meerely Anabaptisticall, God
in an engine. Vpon what
then? Euangelical Esay
the Lordes Prophet tels vs,
That our faith must bee
founded vppon Gods Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
the Scriptures, and Christ
<pb facs="15"/>
the sonne of God biddes vs
<hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> and
<hi>Saint Peter</hi> a chiefe pillar
of the Church, sayeth, <hi>Wee
shall doe well to heede
that certaine end of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
as vnto a light
that shineth in a darkplace
vntill the day dawne, and
the day starre arise in our
hearts.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But stay, who then
shalbe iudge of the scripture?
that our faith may bee set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with iudgement: for as
much as most Heretikes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch
scripture.</p>
   <p>Shall Christians iudge
betweene Christians in cases
of controuersie? no they are
too partiall, because they are
parties. Shal Pagans? no, they
are not capable of holy myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
shall Iewes? no they are
<pb facs="16"/>
enemies of Christ. What then?
Shall wee knocke at heauen
gates, that Christ Iesus may
come downe and decide these
doubts, What neede that? Wee
haue him in the Gospell, sayth
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> wherein if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
our selues diligently by
conferring scripture with
scripture, and expounding
according to the Analogie,
and rule of our faith, beeing
guided by the iudgement of
holy reformed Church, which
acknowledgeth no other guid,
but onely the Euangelicall
and Apostolicall writings,
nor any other rocke to builde
vpon but Iesus Christ, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other City of refuge, to flie
vnto then the word of God,
which as Dauid sayth, is a
Lampe vnto our pathes for
our liues &amp; a light, as S. Peter
<pb facs="16"/>
sayth, in darkenesse for our
knowledge, a ballance for our
decision, to weigh the light
from the ponderous, sayth S.
<hi>Augustine,</hi> a touch stone for
our tryall, as sayth <hi>S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,</hi>
to discern the currēt
from the counterfeite, and in
a word as <hi>Constantine</hi> in
the Nicene counsell, sayde of
all sufficiencie for our ful sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
and the onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyment
of all controuersies
for our resolution wee shall
doe well. This being added,
that we pray earnestly with
<hi>Dauid, That God would
open our eies that we may
see the wōders of his Law,</hi>
Otherwise, they that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyted
in their owne singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and priuat spirite, either
for doctrine of faith, or direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for manners. <hi>Sathan
<pb facs="17"/>
stands at their right hand,
and the thinges that
should haue beene for
their good, are occasion
of their falling.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>These thinges beeing so,
what meanes the cursed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
of our Church of
England to trouble mens
mindes with niceties, the
breeders of controuersies,
whence many monsters of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and thousand of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
doe dayly arise, which
entangle the simple in many
wofull Laborinthes, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
of vnsetled soules,
where was your Church hid
vntill of late, some hundred
yeares since? What Emperor
raigned when it came forth?
or on what day was it hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
What age did the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you professe, arise in?
<pb facs="17"/>
What is become of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers?
These and the like
interrogatories are as intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
and preambles to
insnare and entangle the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with needlesse questions,
and quiddities. As if <hi>Petrus
Valdus Lugdunensis, Iohn
Wicleefe, Husse, Luther,</hi>
and others such reformers,
did at any time endeauour to
beget, or set vppe a new
Church, whereas the truth
is, they onely diligently labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the word of God, and
by the power thereof, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
that Church, which by
mens traditions and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,
was most miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and defaced, and to
reduce it to its former splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
and integrity. Alwayes
saluting that church, though
much deformed by the louing
<pb facs="18"/>
Sister. And doubtlesse wee
know many pious and chaste
Matrones, who iustly may be
ashamed of their owne sisters
enormious courses, and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
conditions. Neyther
did they vse any other means
in seeking reformation, but
by yeelding onely, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
sayd, <hi>Oh how is that
faithfull City become an
harlot? It was full of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and iustice lodged
therein, but now they are
murtherers. Thy siluer, O
sister, is become drosse, thy
wine is mixed with water:</hi>
For these and the like impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
consideratiōs of the great
defect, miserable reuolt, and
dāgerous obliquities of those
times they had learned Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall
counsel, <hi>To haue no
fellowship with such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb facs="18"/>
but to reproue them
rather.</hi> Were these and their
followers then to bee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
enemies, and to be scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
branded with the names
of <hi>Waldenses, Wicklefiās,
Hussites, Lutherans, and</hi>
other the like disgracefull
tearmes, as if they had beene
Nouelists, because they tolde
the truth, God forbidde?
<hi>George Cassander</hi> the
choyce diuine of his time said
well and iuditiously, when he
gaue his sentence of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions
of the Church, both
to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
the Emperours, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that in the beginning
many were iustly stirred vp
by a godly zeale, earnestly to
reproue, and reforme some
apparāt abuses in the church,
and that the principall cause
<pb facs="19"/>
of the Churches calamity,
and distraction, was not to
bee imputed to those who
sought reformation, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to such as ruled the stern,
who beeing puffed vp with
disdaine, and scorned to be
rebuked, proudly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
despised, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
those that modestly,
meekely, and iustly did but
admonish and aduertise
them.</p>
   <p>And hee thought that
there could bee no firme, nor
constant concord in the
Church, vnlesse they bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to reforme, who
first gaue the occasion of
distraction, to witte, that
those of the Churches Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
must abate theyr
rough rigor and sternnes, &amp;
<pb facs="19"/>
yeeld somewhat for the peace
of the church, and by liste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the petitions, and
counsels of many godly and
well disposed men, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the apparent errors
and abuses crept into the
church, and conforme them
according to the rule of Gods
word and the primitiue
integritie from which they
were in many things decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
   <p>If the case were come to
this, who would not embrace
that sacred peace of the
church wherewith the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
of heauen congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mankinde in the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which Christ left
as his legacie to his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
people when hee was to
<pb facs="20"/>
forsake the world, and the
Apostles as their principall
doctrine enioyned to the
Christian Church.</p>
   <p>Euery one (you say) is
ready for peace, but what if
we cannot haue it? <hi>Then
must we make peace</hi> as
Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaks) by our
diligence, by our sufferance.
What if wee make peace once,
and it depart? <hi>Then must
wee follow peace</hi> (as <hi>Paule</hi>
commands.) What if it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
vs (<hi>Peter</hi> wisheth
vs) <hi>to seeke it, and ensue it.</hi>
What if it will not come? (as
<hi>Abrahams</hi> seruant sayde of
<hi>Rebecca</hi>) after wee haue
sought it and ensued it? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then must wee studie to bee
quiet.</p>
   <p>For what good Christian
<pb facs="20"/>
is not of worthy <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>
minde, who desired of
God to passe his dayes free
from trouble and vexation.
And of <hi>Iouians</hi> who sayd this
by chance, touching a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roulous
libel of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
I hate contentions
and strife, and those that are
giuen to peace and concord, I
deerely loue and reuerence.</p>
   <p>Oh what hellish furie hath
enraged the malignant
Church to stirre vp strife,
and controuersie against vs,
not onely all the day long, but
euen for time, and times, euen
many ages. The <hi>Arrians</hi> and

raged against the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe,

   <p>For beholde and see, if

   <p>Thus they do fat &amp; please
