      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, it is ingrafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men by the instinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to loue their owne Countrie best, and to endeauor in all lawfull (and laudable) meanes for the prosperitie thereof: We know what great paines and perill, our worthy Generals, Captains, and Souldiers vndergoe in their marshall affaires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, whiles we recreate our selues with ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure at home: But hee that may take pleasure in such recreations, which may redound to the honour and welfare of his Countrie, and will neglect it, such are no louers but rather enemies to their Countrie: And so much I say in approbation of that laudable exercise of Shooting, which [exercise] is now (in this late se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure age) altogether neglected, but onely in this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable City of <hi>London,</hi> where it is countenanced and maintained: And therefore I may not omit to set downe in honour thereof, that once euerie yeare for the incouragement and maintenance of Archery, the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, doth by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation giue notice vnto all Archers, of certaine sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="7"/>games, which they freely doe bestow vpon the best deseruers: And this is maintained as a custome vnto this day: And out of those famous Archers were wont to be chosen the chiefest and most fittest, to bee of the Kings Yeomen of his Guard; which incouraged many in hope of such preferments, to exercise shooting, and thereby to be very expert Bowmen: and by these and such like meanes, the best deseruers were preferred, and the King well furnished with all Bowmen, and the whole Land likewise was inuincible by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Bowmen.</p>
   <p>And now (courteous Reader) to make thy recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to redound to thy honour and thy Countries wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, I present vnto thee a new Inuention (which is practised and approued of) whereby thou maist bring that famous weapon, the Bow and Arrowes, into the field againe, to doe seruice for thy Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: Now if thou wilt endeanor to practise it, as I haue endeauored to inuent it for thee, and so make thy selfe perfect therein by practice, (which thou maist do with little difficulty) then shalt thou againe illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the glorious splendor of our Brittish Nation, (which formerly was obtained by the seruice of the Bowmen) and as thy Predecessors haue done, bring home into thy Country Trophees of Victories and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: In hope whereof I euer shall rest</p>
