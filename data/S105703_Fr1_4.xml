   <head>Captaine Robert Hichcock, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of this Booke: who wisheth to the worthy Reader, great grace, good fortune, and euerlasting felicitie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Booke (courteous Reader) trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of all kinds of traynings of Souldiours, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, encampings, orders &amp; discipline of war, with all the Offices belonging to a Campe Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and leaues foure poynts of Martiall exercises vntouched in the highest degree of knowledge, and playnest discourse, wherein a number of rare and probable matters are sette downe, with great studie, diligence, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: as well of forraine and familiar examples &amp; proofes, drawn out from fatherly counsell and their graue admonition, as also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by newe pollicies and practises of the greatest Souldiours in Christendome, in these our present dayes, and compounded with the long experience, toyling after the Cannon-wheele, and sharpe seruices, pennury, hunger, cold lying on the ground, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred sorrowes, hazards, daungers, and hard aduentures, the which he himselfe hath sustained being the Authour heereof. Thys Booke shall shew and teach the order of the Fielde, the duety of Officers, the charge of Generals, the arte of Warre, &amp; the whole discipline belonging to the exercises of Armes, and marshalling of a Campe and Armie, how great soeuer: and to make manifest the orders, directions, dignities, and princely powers that forraine Kings thys day hath deuised, ordained and sette downe, for the gouerning of theyr Campes, and leading of theyr people.</p>
   <p>This Booke also, is so necessary for this time, and so excellent a peece of worke, as cannot be spared, nor red too often, nor too much praysed, and shall be such a myrrour to looke in, that euery vnlearned Souldiour, beholding the same with eyes of iudgment, shall at the first sight behold his owne ignoraunce, and become a leader of the ignoraunt multitude, the which before did it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb facs="5"/>
but with braue words, and bare speeches, that neuer bringes foorth any good knowledge.</p>
   <p>Thys Booke shall not with sencelesse imitation leade men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, but with sweete perswasions, and probable matter, shal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the errors of wilfulnes, and confirme the auncient and olde rules for the substantiall order and gouernment of a Campe, and with deepe aduisement to discusse &amp; descide all opinions of wars.</p>
   <p>Thys Booke dooth likewise plainly expresse the mistery &amp; hid cunning of fortifycation, and declare in ample and fine drawne plots. goodly plotformes, needfull inuentions, and noble works of great suretie and maiestie, worth the noting, and meete for men of warre to haue in euerlasting memory.</p>
   <p>And now, to tell you how thys Booke came to my handes, it is to be vnderstood, that a Gentleman called <hi>William Garrard,</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the King of Spayne fourteene yeeres in his warres, drew and made this same Booke, with great iudgement &amp; good leysure, and comming into England, in short time after sickned, and before his death, sent the sayd Booke to Sir <hi>Thomas Garrard</hi> Knight, vnto whom he was a very neere kinseman. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> hauing regarde to the seruice of her Maiestie and his Countrey, and seeing the time required the publishing of the same, conferred with mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same: praying me, to correct the faultes of the Booke, the which I haue doone with good consideration. Confessing, though somewhat I haue seene and red, beside my experience in the warres, that neuer to thys day came such a Booke into myne hands: for goodnes, for plainenes, for perfectnes, &amp; true demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, hoping that no man of iudgement, but will yeelde due commendations to the dead deuiser of thys large and worthy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, and that the reading of the same shall so please, &amp; content, all that shall behold it, that they shall giue their common consent, that the Booke is worthy the embrasing to be red, to be knowne, and the directions therein to be followed. The worke it selfe is sufficient to winne fauour, and perswade more good matter, then any Booke that euer I sawe touching the arte of warre, to the reach of myne vnderstanding, as knoweth Almighty GOD: who send you all happines. 1590.</p>
