Luther. And the Catholike religion euidently deduced through all our kings and archbishopps of Canterburie from S. Austin to our time, and the valour and vertue of our kings, and the great learninge and sanctitie of our archbishopps, together with diuers saints and miracles which in their times proued the Catholike faith; so sett downe as it may seeme also an abridgment of our ecclesiasticall histories.

      <hi>EPISTLE TO THE MOST Noble and renovvned ENGLISH NATION</hi> my most deere Countrimen.</head>
   <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT Honorable, right worshipfull, and dearelie beloued Countrymen giue me leaue to ioyne you all in one Epistle, whom I contayne in one brest of loue, and include in one lincke of entire affection. Because the end for which I write vnto you concerneth you all alike and equallie, to witt, the true Religion and worshipp of God, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of your owne soules. A matter vs of the greatest weight and worthiest of Search, fo in these our miserable dayes of most controuersie and perplexed diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie. Wherin to helpe you the better to discerne true gold from shyninge brasse, true religion from false and counterfeit. I haue framed for you <hi>a Prudentiall Balance of Religion.</hi> by which euery one of you, may by the weightes and rules of right reason,
<pb facs="3"/> and true prudence weighe the Roman Catholique and the Protestant religion together, and distincklie perceaue whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them is more likelie to come from God and to lead you to him.</p>
   <p n="2">
      <note place="margin">VVhy this course of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions is taken.</note>2. And this course of comparinge these two religions together I haue taken before any other, because as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher teacheth and experience confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. <hi>Contraria iuxta se posita magis elucescunt: Contraries put together do more apppeare.</hi> As beautie in presence of deformitie see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth more gratious and deformitie more vglie; Truth before lies appeareth more loue lye, and lies more odious; vertue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vice more amiable, and vice more detestable. Euery thinge as it were striuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge to shew it selfe more when it is set as it were to wrastle with the contrarie. And I haue made choyse of comparinge these religions accordinge to the rules of ttue prudence and right reason,<note place="margin">VVhy the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe of religions accordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge to rules of vvisdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen before others.</note> rather then otherwise, as the most generall, most easie, most euident, and most effectuall for all sortes of people. for albeit Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques &amp; Protestants agree that to be the true religion of God which is most agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his word, yet sith they neyther agree which is his word, (Protestants reiectinge much of that which Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques reuerence for Gods heauenly word)
<pb facs="3"/> nor which is they sense therof,<note place="margin">Thus Tertullian <hi>lib. de praescript.</hi> proued by▪ reason the Cath. reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be preferred befor anie heresie.</note> they can not be brought to agree about one balance of Gods word wherby they may weigh their religions together. Besides that not onely Catholicks teach but also Protestants confesse, that <hi>the weaker sorte of Christians can not iudge which is the true exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scriptures.</hi> And therfor to weighe religions to them by the balance of Scripture,<note place="margin">D. Reinolds Confer. pag. <hi>149.</hi>
      </note> were to weigh one vnknowne thing by an other. But the weights of Prudence and right reason are both commun and euident to all, &amp; therfor the weighinge of religions by them must needs be most generall, most easie, and most effectual with all sortes of people. And if anie refuse to haue their religion tried by these kinds of weights,<note place="margin">VVhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is against vvisdom and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is follie.</note> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse therby that they fear their religion to be contrarie to wisdome and reason, which is as much as to be fabulous and foolish. For what can be opposit to wisdome and reason but follie and fables?</p>
   <p n="3">3. Nether let anie think that that religion which is most agreable to Prudence and the light of reason, is not also most agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture. Because reason and Scripture are both God his word and Gods truth, the one naturall, written by his owne hand in our soules by creation; the other supernatural, written in paper
<pb facs="4"/> with the hands of his holie Scribes by reuelation.<note place="margin">The agreable<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of Religion and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> And therfor though these two words be of different degree they can not be contrarie, but rather as twinnes of one and the self same parent haue great sympathie and connexion together. For as God doth not by his grace destroie the naturall inclination of our will to good but perfecteth it: So by his word and faith he extinguisheth not but increaseth the naturall insight which our vnderstanding hath of truthe. yea such is the force of our vnderstanding to pearce into Gods truth as that by it the Philosophers (as the Apostle witnesseth Rom. 1.) came to know <hi>the inuisible proprieties of God and his euerlasting power &amp; diuinitie.</hi>
      <note place="margin">S. Paul.</note> And sith we see that men by the light of reason know so much of other moral vertues as without all other teaching they perceaue in manie things what is honest, what dishonest, what iust, what vniust, what is vertue, what vice, why should we doubt that God hath giuen to vs equal knowledge of matters of religion and worship of him self. Which vertue as it is the cheefest of all morall vertues, so the knowledge therof is most necessaire of them all vnto vs. Yea S. Austin accounted so much of Reason as <hi>lib. de vtil. credendi cap.</hi> 12. he said that <hi>Recta ratio est ipsa virtus.</hi>
      <note place="margin">S. Austin.</note> because it
<pb facs="4"/> is the naturall square and rule which God euen in creation giueth to euery one to know what he ought to do.<note place="margin">Calvvin.</note> And Caluin saith that <hi>Semen religionis est in mente humana.</hi> And Iewel <hi>art.</hi> 6. <hi>diuis.</hi> 12. <hi>that naturall reason holden within her bondes is not the enemye,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iuel.</note>
      <hi>but the daughter of Gods truth. And therfor he must be very vnreasonable that will without cause be angrye with reason.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Doct Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds.</note> And Doctor Reinolds in his conference <hi>pag.</hi> 207. saith, <hi>Reason is a notable helpe of mans weaknes.</hi> This rule ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for of naturall reason and prudence giuen vnto vs by God, common and euident to all authorized by verdit of the Apostle, confirmed by reason and approued by consent both of Catholiques and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantes is that wherwith I intend to direct you in the choyce of Religion, and the Balance wherwith I purpose to to weigh before your eyes the two more famous religions which are in our Lande.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Not because I thinke that onelie natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light of reason is able without all supernaturall illustration from God to discerne in all points which is the true religion. But because it is able to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer which is false Religion, and amongst many religions it can iudge, which is most likelie to be the true for albeit God hath not made his faith and religion euidentlie true,<note place="margin">S. Greg. hom. 26. in Euang.</note> because then as S. Gregorie saith our
<pb facs="5"/> faith should haue no meritt. Nay as Saint Thomas,<note place="margin">

      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.</note>
      <hi>of thinges not seene.</hi> Yet hath he made his faith and Religion euidently credible, and worthie to be beleeued, or as the Psalmist speaketh,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 92.</note>
      <hi>Credibilia nimis.</hi> for if both God and mans law iudge the testimonye of two or three such eye witnesses,<note place="margin">Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion evvident<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> as no iust exception can be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against them, to be euidentlie credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthie of belife euen in matters of life and death, much more will they iudge the testimonie not of two,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Deuter.</hi> 17.</note> but of twelue eye witnesses, which (as they say) haue heard,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Math.</hi> 18.</note> haue seene, haue fullie percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with ther eyes, and haue bene behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, their handes haue handled, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers haue touched,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 20.</note> and against whose fidelitie no iust exception can be made; yea whose vertuous and vpright cariage in all other matters the world admired,<note place="margin">Eye vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and they many holie. fortold by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetie past and confirmed by present miracles.</note> and besides haue ther saying and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie contested by such wonderous facts as no mans witt can deuise how they should be done by any power of nature or arte, but be true miracles wrought onelie by the diuine power of God who is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue nature, much more (I say) will the law of God and of man too, (if it proceede ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge
<pb facs="5"/> to it selfe) iudge the testimonie of so many, and so substantiall witnesses, contested both by diuine propheties afore hand (as is euident by the old law, which that they feyued not nor Deuised themselues, is manifest to the world by the attestation by their enemies the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es) and by many wonderfull factes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and those facts so authentically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded and regestred, as it can not be doubted; but they were done, vnlesse against all sense and reason we will denie all recordes of time past; and so wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and so far aboue the course and order of nature and arte, as no man can iustlie thinke, but they be true miracles and contestations from God himselfe. And this is that kind of authoritie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rof S. Austin speaketh when he saith,<note place="margin">Lib. de vtil. Cred. cap. <hi>16.</hi>
      </note> that if God haue any care of mankind he hath vndoubtedlie appointed in earth some kind of authoritie, vpon which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyinge, may as it were by some steppes mount vp to God. And no maruell; for sith we haue no meanes to be certayne of a thinge, but by euidencie of the truth or by sufficient authority, and that we cannot haue euidencie of the true way to heauen, because it is as supernaturall as the end it selfe, and therfor as well out of the reach of our vnderstanding, as other
<pb facs="6"/> supernaturall thinges are, vnlesse god had prouided some certayne authoritye, wherby we might be assured of that way, we could neuer be certayne therof but euer either erringe or doubtful. But god hauinge left such sufficient authoritye as he hath to shew vs the way to heauen, hath made it therby euidentlie credible, and worthie to be beleued, and far more certayne to vs, then, is they way to a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller in a strainge countrie by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of those that dwell in the countrie.</p>
   <p n="5">5. And on the other side as he hath ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed our will with a naturall taste and relishe of vertue, wherby of nature we abhorre all vice and loue vertue. So also hath he infused into our vnderstandinges a proportionable and correspondent light and naturall insight of truth, which sheweth vnto the will, which is indeed vice, which vertue. This light cheiflye cōsisteth in certaine generall principles of vertue which God hath giuen to our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandinge as it were rules and squares to direct it selfe in particular actions, by meanes of which it is assured that what is agreable to them is true and vertuous, and what disagreable false and naught, and what seemeth to be most sutable to them, most likelie to be true and good. Of these kind of principles for choyce of
<pb facs="6"/> religion one is that principle which S. Paule mentioneth <hi>Hebr. cap.</hi> 11. That god is rewarder of them that serue him. And that which the Psalmist mentioneth that <hi>Lex Domini est immaculata;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psalm. 18.</note> condemninge no vertue, nor admittinge anie vice, but contrarywise most exhortinge to vertue. and deterringe from vice; That onelie Gods religion can be confirmed with true miracles. That his Religion hath preachers lawfully sent by him, and the like. And what religion we see clearlie to be contrarie to these principles, we may be sure cometh not from God. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie wise amongst all religions, what we see most agreable to them, that we may thinke most likelie to be Gods Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. As what religion we finde amongst all to be most immaculate from vice, and most vrginge to vertue, whose Preachers we see to shew best warrant for their cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from God to preach it, and to bringe best proofes of Gods miracles to testifie it, that we may be full assured is most likelie to be Gods religion. For if all reason iudge him to be the most likelie to be the true Embassadour frō a Prince, who bringeth the best assurance and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Commission from that Prince, and consequently that which he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be the Prince his message, rather
<pb facs="7"/> than any other! what reason, what wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, what sense can ther be to tinke, but that is most likely to be Gods message &amp; meaning which being in it selfe voyd of vice, is deliuered by those, who shew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proofes of ther sendinge and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ther doctrine then any others? And heervpon it comes to passe that whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer Gods true religion came in question with heresie before men addicted to ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but guided onely by the rules of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and naturall insight of religion giuen to them by God, it was allwayes iudged more likely to be Gods truth then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. When in the tyme of the old law the Samaritanes contended with the Iewes for the truth of religion before the King of Egypt, the King hauinge heard the reasons and proofes on both parties, gaue sentence for the Iewes.<note place="margin">Ioseph. <hi>18.</hi> Antiq.</note> And in the tyme of the new law, when Manes the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke contended with Archilaus a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Bishop before Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,<note place="margin">Hieron in Archla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> Epiphan. haer. <hi>66.</hi> Cyril. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teches. <hi>6.</hi>
      </note> iudgment was pronounced against the Hereticke. Yea generally all sects, as Iewes, Turkes, Heretickes in iudgment preferre the Catholicke Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion before all other religions besides ther owne.<note place="margin">See infra l. 2. c. 13.</note> Which is a great argument, that it alone is indeed the true religion of God. For as when diuers Citties of
<pb facs="7"/> Greece contended whether of them deserued greatest praise for a victorie which they obtained against the Persians,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> the iudges before whome the cause was brought demaunded of euery one of them whom they thought to haue deserued best after them selues, and all answeringe that the Lacedemonians; the wise Iudges gaue sentence that indeed the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians had deserued best of all, for they seinge euery cittye to preferre the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians before others, they perceaued therby, that if their affection had bene as indifferent betwene them selues and the Lacedemonians, as it was betwene the Lacedemonians and others, their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would haue preferred the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians before them selues, as well as it preferred them before others. And in like sort all sectaries who preferre the christian Catholique faith before all others but ther owne, would also preferre it before ther owne, if ther iudgment were guided with as much in differencie to ther owne religion, as it is to others, and not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed with custome of likinge ther owne and affection to ther preconceited opinions.</p>
   <p n="6">6. Wherfore seinge that on the one side Gods true religion is thus euidently credible, and on the other side our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge
<pb facs="8"/> when it is not miseled with passion or affection,<note place="margin">Force of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</note> but guided by the principles of religion engrafted in our soule by God and directed by the light of reason is of such force that euen by Creatures it can come to the knowledg of God as it is said <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. that my deare Countrynen may with more facilitie and perspicuitie find out this so important matter as vpon which dependeth their eternall saluation, I haue framed this <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall Balance</hi> in which by the weightes of prudence and light of Reason they may weighe and compare the Romane Catholique, and Protestant religion, and see whether of them is more like to come from God, and direct men to their euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastinge happines. And in the first parte therof (which heere I offer to them) I compare these two religions accordinge to their first founders in our English nation: And in the second God willinge, I will compare them accordinge to their claimes to the word of God, their transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Copies of that word, accordinge to their manner of expoundinge it and other such generall groundes of Religion: In the third I will compare them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to their Doctrines: And in the fourth and last parte accordinge to the effectes which eyther of them hath
<pb facs="8"/> wrought, especiallie in our English Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
   <p n="7">7. In this first parte I proue that the Romane Catholique,<note place="margin">Se l. 1. c. 2. l. 2. cap. 1. VVhat is sevved of luther many by also Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vved of Calvvin or anie other sect maister of our time.</note> and Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions in our English Nation, came first and originallie from S. Augustine, and Martyn Luther. And therfor I compare these two religions together in these two first founders of them in our Nation: and lay the qualities and conditions of them fitt for Preachers, in the two first bookes, as it were ech of them in his seuerall Scale. And in the third I compare them together according to the qualities dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, that therby the Reader with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different iudgment may weigh them, and consider, whether is the more likelie to come from god and to bringe his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whether, from the Deuill and to preach his deceites. The qualities wherin I compare them are these fiue. <hi>Learninge, vertue, motiues to preach,</hi>
      <note place="margin">In vvhat S. Austin and luther are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</note>
      <hi>lawfull vocation or mission, and right orders to preach the word of God and administer his sacramentes.</hi> And the pointes wherin I compare the Doctrins which they brought, are these fewe <hi>Approbation of Christendome,</hi>
      <note place="margin">VVherin their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trins are compared.</note>
      <hi>allowance of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, Diuyne attestation by Miracles, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</hi> And I shew euidently by many irrefragable proofes (wherof euer one is the confession of Protestantes) that S.
<pb facs="9"/> Austin was very learned, Luther ignorant; S. Austin vertuous, Luther vicious; S. Austin moued to preach by heauenly motiues, Luther by humaine &amp; naughtie, Saint Austin lawfully sent to preach his doctrin, Luther not sent at all to preach his; S. Austin rightly ordered to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister his sacraments, Luther not orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at all to administer his; Saint Austins doctrin to haue bene the vniuersall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Christendome in his time, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doctrin to haue bene contrarie to the vniuersall beleife of Christians in his time; Saint Austines doctrin to haue bene confessed by his aduersaries then, &amp; ours now, to haue bene sufficient to saluation, Luthers doctrin neuer acknowledged of vs to be able to assure any; And finally Saint Austines doctrin to haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by true, euident and confessed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Luthers to haue wanted all color of such confirmation.</p>
   <p n="8">8 All these pointes (I say) I haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by euident and irrefragable proofes and testimonies, yea euen by the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Protestants. Which, what man of iudgment and carefull of his saluation considereth, will (I hope) make choyce rather to follow Saint Austin and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, than Luther and his. For what wisedome or reason, yea what sense
<pb facs="9"/> should ther be to thinke that God and his truth were with ignorance, vice, naughtie intention, want of mission and orders, want of consent of Christianitie, of confession of aduersaries, and of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; And the Deuils lyes shold be with learning, vertue, holie motiues, lawfull mission, right order, consent of christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, confession of aduersaries, and diuine miracles. If any say that though Luthers Doctrin want the fore said titles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation and credibilitye, yet it hath the ghospell which is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all: I desire such to consider with themselues, how vnlikely it is,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that the ghospell should stand with ignorance against learninge, wirh vice against ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, with wordlie against holie motiues, with runninge of his owne head against lawfull sendinge, with no orders against right orders, with auersion of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome against consent of the same, with detestation of aduersaries against ther al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, and finally with want of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, against certaine and confessed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie miracles; and I hope they will be easely persuaded that howsoeuer some make shew therof, yet the ghospell cannot indeed, and in the right sense stand with Luther against Saint Austin. Or if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perswade such men thus much, yet
<pb facs="10"/> let me entreat them to suspend their iudgment concerninge the Ghospells being on either side, till they see the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of this Ballance, wherin God-willinge I shall weigh Saint Austins and Luthers religiō according to their claimes to the ghospell, and the right sense therof, and by Gods assistance euidently shew, that Saint Austins religion hath as much aduantage ouer Luthers, touching the true possession of the ghospell, and right sense therof, as it hath concerning the foresaid titles.<note place="margin">All our ancient Clergie, Catholik.</note>

<pb facs="11"/> euen by Protestantes confession against meane skill; for vertue we haue famous and confessed sanctitie against ordinarie, if not vicious life. If therfore either number, or time, or learninge helpe any thinge to finde out Gods truth, our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Archbishopes are far more like to see and espie it than the Protestant Prelates: or if vertuous life moue God to reueale his truth, surelie the Catholique Archbishops are more like to know it than the Protestants. And in the like sort touching Princes, for two which Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants can produce, we can bring aboue one hundred and twentie: for their child of Nyne yeares old, and ther woman we can produce aboue an hundred, mature, graue, and wise men; who haue they in valour comparable to our Kinge <hi>Egbert,</hi> first authour of our English monarchie? to Kinge <hi>Alfred the great</hi> vanquisher of the daines, and deliuerer of his Countrie; to our Kinge <hi>VVilliam Conqueror</hi> of England? to our <hi>Edward the first, Edward the third, Henrie the fift,</hi> and many moe most valiant and victorious Princes? whom in magnanimitie haue they aunswerable to our Kinge <hi>Ethelstan,</hi> to our Kinge <hi>Edgar,</hi> King <hi>Canute,</hi> Kinge <hi>Richard Ceur de lyon,</hi> and diuers others? who in largenes of Dominion to our Kinge <hi>Canute,</hi> our

   <p n="11">11. And shall we thinke that one child and a woman in so short time should espie that diuine truth which so many Princes in a thousand yeares could not finde? That the infancie of a child and weaknes of a woman should discouer that which the rare learninge, wisedome, and iudgement of so many graue Princes could not attayne vnto? That the fruitles life of a child, and the ordinarie, (if not farre worse) life of a woman should deserue of God to haue that reuealed vnto them, which the rare vertue and holynes of so many excellent Princes who preferred his seruice before their kingdomes, could not obtayne? what were this but in matter of religion and euerlastinge saluation to giue that iudgment and make that choyce which
<pb facs="12"/> in no other matter we would do? for who is ther if it lay in daunger of leasing liuinges libertie or life would not make choice to follow rather seauentie then fower, an hundred rather than two, men than children and women, and men of famous and confessed learninge wisedome and vertue than others of meane learninge and ordinarie (if not naughtie) liues? And will we when it is daunger of losse of soule and saluation make the contrarie choyce? what defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce or excuse can we make of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedinge either before God or man? will we say it is prudence in monye matters and temporall affaires to follow many rather then few, men then children and women, learned wise and vertuous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others lesse qualified, and not to trust to much to our owne iudgments; And can we thinke it prudence to obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the contrarie course in matters of religion and eternall saluation? doth the matter so alter the case? Is prudence become contrarie to it selfe? or is Gods religion so against all reason wisdome and iudgment? Can we not become christians, but we must leaue to be reasoable men, admitt Christes faith, but we must banishe all reason discreation and wisedome? No surelye.</p>

Our first Christian forefathers had good reason to relinquish the Pagan stuperstition of their progenitors, and to imbrace the Christian Religion,<note place="margin">See this proued <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. 5. 13. 23.</note> which Saint Austin and his fellow labourers preached vnto them, because they saw it taught by great learned and vertuous men, to worke great pietie and godlines in them that imbraced it, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from God by assured miracles, such as Britons then and Protestantes now confesse to be true miracles.
