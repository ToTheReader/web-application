   <head>TO THE
CATHOLIQVE
Christian Reader.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>Courteous Reader:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Few daies since a friend of mine
shewed me a Booke intituled a
<hi>Parallel,</hi> which I gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
from him, and perused
it the more readily, because I
well hoped, that some of the
<hi>Parallel</hi> lines would sute to our <hi>Meridian.</hi> But
taking an exact view of them, and applying them
to our <hi>Horizon,</hi> I found they were somewhat
short of our <hi>Eleuation:</hi> yet I discouered some
thing drawne in those <hi>Parallels,</hi> which I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="3"/>
to be of some vse, to wit, the <hi>Lineal</hi> descent of
<hi>Arminius</hi> by the half bloud at least, frō <hi>Pelagius;</hi>
for if it be confessed, that <hi>Arminius</hi> his pedegree
is lineally to be deriued from <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and that
<hi>Pelagius</hi> is the great <hi>Apenninus,</hi> from which the
diuided streames of corrupt doctrine flow; then
vndoubtedly the assertions of <hi>Arminius</hi> were
<hi>priùs damnatae, quàm natae</hi> were condemned
by the Catholique Christian Church, before they
were brought forth by <hi>Arminius:</hi> And we haue
the Prescription of the Christian world, for more
than 1200. yeares, against the new encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of these <hi>Sectaries.</hi> But me thinks I heare
thee ring in mine care the peale of the Poet,
<hi>Ole quid ad te?</hi> what is this to thee, or me? or to
the matter now on foot? It is not <hi>Arminius,</hi> but
an <hi>Appealer</hi> that troubles our Israel; <hi>Aemilius
fecit, plectetur Rutilius?</hi> Aemilius hath done
wrong, shall Rutilius beare the blame? Because
<hi>Arminius</hi> browseth vpon some branches of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianisme,</hi>
(a plant which our heauenly Father
neuer planted, and therefore in time must be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out) is it reason, the <hi>Appealer</hi> should be
muzled, or any mans teeth whet against him?
Verily, the <hi>Appealer</hi> disclaimes all kinred or affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb facs="3"/>
with <hi>Arminius;</hi> nay he protesteth, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the man; and if peraduenture some <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi>
or skilfull Genealogist may be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
him, yet certainly the vulgar reader is not.
I haue therefore thought it worth the paines, to
take the line of <hi>Pelagius</hi> which is already brought
downe to <hi>Arminius,</hi> and from <hi>Arminius</hi> to draw
it out euen to the <hi>Appealer,</hi> to the end, all, that
are not forestalled with preiudice, may see,
that both the <hi>Appealer,</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> hold their
errors <hi>in capite</hi> from <hi>Pelagius;</hi> And that at the
first the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and other parts receiued
the infection of pestilent doctrine from <hi>Britaine</hi>
by <hi>Pelagius;</hi> and now at last, that <hi>Britaine</hi> hath
receiued it from the <hi>Netherlands</hi> by <hi>Arminius:
Mater me genuit, eadem mox gignitur ex me.</hi>
But before I open the leaues of my Tablet, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
on the one side the <hi>Arminian,</hi> and on the
other, the <hi>Appealers Demi-Pelagianisme,</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the Reader <hi>emunctae naris</hi> to follow the
sent of <hi>Arminianisme</hi> in the <hi>Appealers</hi> writings
by these foure steps.</p>
   <list>
      <item>1. His sleight and dilute purgation from
the aspersion of <hi>Arminianisme.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>
         <pb facs="4"/>
2. His direct and professed defence of the
<hi>Arminians.</hi>
      </item>
      <item>3. His casting a blur vpon the <hi>Synod</hi> of
<hi>Dort</hi> that blasted them.</item>
      <item>4. His disparaging the Articles of <hi>Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hith,</hi>
which are <hi>è diametro</hi> opposite to
the tenets of <hi>Baro</hi> then, and since <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius.</hi>
      </item>
   </list>
   <p>To begin with his Purgation. Although in other
Criminations it may be an argument of Innocencie
not to be moued or any way sensible of them; yet
in the suspition of heresie,<note place="margin">Tacit. Maledicta si irascaris, agni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta videntur▪ spreta exolescunt.</note> no man (as saith <hi>Saint
Hierom)</hi> ought to be silent. Silence in such an
accusation is a crying sin, <hi>Et patientia digna om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
impatientiâ,</hi> and patience it selfe is vnsuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Euery man is bound to professe his faith,
and consequently openly to discharge himselfe
from all imputation, especially of heresie, which
is so foule a crime, that the water of penitent
teares alone hath not bin thought enough to wash
it away. <hi>Scelus hoc exuritur igne;</hi> it hath bin
vsually burnt out with fire. It leaueth such a spot
in the conscience, that <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> conceiueth, The
blood of Martyrdome cannot fetch it out. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula
haec nec sanguine eluitur.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cyprian. epist.</note> Now whether
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> be heresie, I thinke it is a question
without question, vnlesse we will take vpon vs
to censure the censures of the ancient Church, and
most eminent Doctors thereof. <hi>S. Austin</hi> in his
booke <hi>de bono Perseuerantiae,</hi> is not content to
call it <hi>perniciosissimus error, c.</hi> 17. but c. 21. he
calls it twise,<note place="margin">Antequam Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana haeresis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareret. <hi>and</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colant aduersus haeresin Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anam.</note>
      <hi>Pelagiana haeresis.</hi> And that <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianisme</hi> is <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> either in whole or in
part, I take the <hi>Parallel,</hi> till I see it not slightly
glanced at, but substantially refuted to be an ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
demōstratiō.<note place="margin">Concil. Carth. sub Aurelio. Nefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius &amp; ab omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus anathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zandus error. Concil. Mileuit. Perniciosissimi erroris auctores perhibentur Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestius &amp; Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.</note> But if this be yet <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, a point
not yet gained, yet that <hi>Arminianisme</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the <hi>Appealer</hi> is charged, not only by two
Presbyters of his owne ranke, but a reuerend Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
his Diocesan) is formally heresie, <hi>Appello

appealed vnto,<note place="margin">August. p. 94. ad Hilariū: Omnes qui spem habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in Christo huic pestiferae impietati resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere debemus.

      <hi>King IAMES,</hi> of blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,

      <hi>hath not
<pb facs="5"/>
onely presumed to publish of late a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
booke of the apostasie of Saints; but
hath besides bin so impudent, as to send the
other day a copie thereof, as a goodly present,
to our Archbishop of Canterbury, together
with a Letter, wherein he is not ashamed, as
also in his booke, to lye so grosly, as to auow,
that his heresies contained in the said booke,
are agreeable with the Religion and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church of England.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To cleare then himselfe from the foule spot of
this heresie, what course doth the <hi>Appealer</hi> take?
Doth he call God, and his Angels to witnesse, that
he renounceth from his heart all <hi>Arminius</hi> his
vnwarrantable and dangerous assertions? Doth
he <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, fairely and openly make this, or the
like protestation? <hi>Arminius</hi> teacheth none, but
respectiue Predestination: I am for absolute. Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
grace and redemption is an Article of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>
faith: It is none of mine. The coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mans freewill with grace in the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion,
and the power it hath to hinder, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the worke of regenerating grace, is current
doctrine with <hi>Arminius.</hi> But I take it for a
leaden <hi>Leyden</hi> error. <hi>Arminius</hi> maintaineth a
<pb facs="5"/>
totall and finall falling away from the grace of
Iustification: I detest and abhominate that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
and will haue no <hi>Confarreation</hi> with the
apostate defender of such Apostasie.</p>
   <p>This had beene indeed to vnclaspe the right
hands of fellowship with <hi>Arminius,</hi> and if he had
euer walkt in his path, to shake the dust from his
feet: but in stead hereof, the <hi>Appealer</hi> casts
dust in the Readers eyes, by making a deepe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,
<hi>idque in verbo Sacerdotis,</hi> of not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any word in <hi>Arminius. I protest</hi> (saith he)
<hi>before God and his Angels,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Appeal. to Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar pag. 21.</note>
      <hi>the time is yet to
come, that euer I read word in Arminius.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I read this Protestation, I confesse, that my
selfe with many others imagined, that, as <hi>Osorius</hi>
writeth, that some in the <hi>Indies</hi> by often smelling
to <hi>Brasell,</hi> had Scorpions bred in their braines; so
the <hi>Appealer</hi> by frequent reading of <hi>Arminius</hi>
his bookes, and smelling to his exotecall positions,
had hatcht this Serpents brood in his braine. But
because hee denieth it, <hi>in verbo Sacerdotis,</hi> I
rest satisfied, that he neuer read <hi>Arminius:</hi> but
for ought he saith to the contrary, he may haue
heard all <hi>Arminius</hi> read ouer to him. Admit he
neuer read, or heard of <hi>Arminius,</hi> this will be no
<pb facs="6"/>
good plea, if his doctrine be the doctrine of <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;
Legat</hi> that was burned in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> for
an <hi>Arrian,</hi> might protest truly, that he neuer read
word in <hi>Arrius</hi> his bookes, as indeed he could not,
because <hi>Arrius</hi> his bookes, with himselfe, were
many hundred yeares ago eradicated, will the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealer</hi>
from thence conclude that <hi>Legat</hi> was no
<hi>Arrian?</hi> How many thousand <hi>Nestorians</hi> are
there in the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church at this day, who
yet neuer read word in <hi>Nestorius</hi> his writings;
not now extant (I take it) any where? I dare say,
<hi>Arminius</hi> himselfe neuer read word in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his workes, or the workes of the
<hi>Semipelagians,</hi> or <hi>Massilians,</hi> yet he cannot free
himselfe from the brand of Pelagianisme; neither
doth much desire to be acquitted from the note of
Semipelagianisme. Wee reade in the Ciuill Law,
<hi>Malitia supplet aetatem:</hi> Malice oftentimes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the defect of age. In like manner it is most
certaine, that where there is a propension in any
mans minde to any old heresie, the malice of the
Deuill easily supplyeth the want of reading: <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barel</hi>
hauing coyned, as he thought, a new distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
vnheard of before, was as proud of it, as euer
<hi>Pelius</hi> was of his new sword, saying, <hi>Ego hanc so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionem
<pb facs="6"/>
primus inueni:</hi>
      <note place="margin">In comment. in poster. Analyt.</note> yet afterwards he inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously
confesseth, that perusing <hi>Gandauensis</hi> his
writings vpon the same argument, there he found
the selfe-same distinction; and it much reioyced
his heart, that so acute a Philosopher as <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uensis,</hi>
should hit vpon the same conceit with him.
Might it not be so with the <hi>Appealer?</hi> might he
not first proiect the new plot of Predestination in
his owne head, and yet afterwards light vpon the
same in <hi>Arminius,</hi> or some of his schollers, and
exceedingly applaud either their conceit in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or his in theirs? For mine owne part I will
not vndertake to proue that the <hi>Appealer</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
an apprentice to <hi>Iames Harmin;</hi> but by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp both of their loomes, I will make it appeare
that they are both <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, of the same trade or
craft.</p>
   <p>Thou seest, Christian Reader, that his purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of himselfe needeth a defence, but his direct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the <hi>Arminians</hi> much more needeth a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
No doubt the <hi>Appealer</hi> read often in the
Heathen Orator,<note place="margin">Cic. pro Sylla.</note> that it taints a man deepely once
to open his lips in the defence of such a man, whom
he suspecteth to be an enemie to the State: <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
contagio est sceleris si eum defendas
<pb facs="7"/>
quem patriae obstrictum esse suspiceris.</hi> How
much more doth it blurre a mans reputation to
frame an apologie for him, whom King <hi>Iames</hi> of
blessed memory, vpon iust and religious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Declar. aduers. Vorstium.</note>
proclaimeth to be an enemie of God? Either
the <hi>Appealers</hi> charity, or his cōscience must needs
be very large, wherein such an offender finds a
Sanctuary,<note place="margin">
         <hi>King</hi> Iames, ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note> against whom all the Churches of
<hi>Germany</hi> made complaint to our then dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne:
<hi>Nemo omnes, neminem omnes fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellerunt:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Plin. Panegyr.</note>
Neuer one man deceiued all men, neuer
all men deceiued one man: yet the <hi>Appealer</hi> is not
only content, some way to blanch <hi>Arminius,</hi> and
his schollers errours (whereof diuers by the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
way, as a conuenient bridge, haue fairely wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ouer to Popery:) but he, to the infinite wrong
of the Primitiue Saints and Martyrs, compareth
these Comets to those Stars, and would make these
as innocent &amp; vnguilty of the late troubles in the
<hi>Nether-lands,</hi> as they were altogether free from
the aspersions, which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> odiously and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously
cast vpon them, scil: <hi>Appeale pag.</hi> 41.
were these late of-spring of the <hi>Semipelagians</hi> so
harmelesse and free altogether from sowing seed of
dissention in the Church, as the ancient Christians
<pb facs="7"/>
were from mouing sedition in the State? Why did
then the wise and Christian States generall in the
Low-countries, by the aduice of our then <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
call a nationall Synod, and so long continue
it at their great charge, to suppresse these, not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
vipers, tearing the bowels of her mother,
(in the <hi>Appealers</hi> esteeme) but silly and harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
wormes? Why did our gracious Soueraigne
King <hi>Charles,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Balchanquall Concio ad clerū.</note> by his Embassador, the Duke of
<hi>Buckingham</hi> his Grace, deale effectually with the
States to root vp the weed of <hi>Arminian</hi> Liberty,
so far spreading among them?<note place="margin">Appeale <hi>ibid.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Yea, but</hi> (saith he)
<hi>did no crafty Interloper put in his stocke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

that?</hi> No question, as it was there, so it will be
here, <hi>Dum pastores odia exercent, lupus intrat

of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 7.</note>
      <hi>Woe be to him by whom offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
come?</hi> But it should seeme there is such a neare
tye betweene the <hi>Appealer,</hi> and the <hi>Arminians,</hi>
that they are entred into a league defensiue, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue,
<pb facs="8"/>
for as he holdeth his buckler ouer them: so
he mainly foiles at their opposites: He slighteth,
vilifieth,<note place="margin">Pag. 70. &amp; Pag. 108.</note> and falsly traduceth the Synod of <hi>Dort;</hi>
for what reason, but because they touch the apple
of his eye, the <hi>Arminian</hi> theologie? He stirs the
Articles concluded at <hi>Lambhith,</hi> he carpeth at the
most reuerend Metropolitans, reuerend Bishops,
and renowned Doctors,<note place="margin">Appeal. pag. 71. 72.</note> the floure of both Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
who subscribed them, and published them.
Neither can hee yeeld any reason hereof, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
those eminent and euery way accomplisht
Diuines at <hi>Lambhith,</hi> crushed the addle egge now
smelling in the <hi>Appealers</hi> writings, when it was
new laid in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> before <hi>Baro</hi> could hatch
it. If these proofes be not pregnant, that the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealer</hi>
is deepely engaged in the <hi>Arminian</hi> pact, I
intreat the Reader to trust his owne eyes, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the ensuing doctrines and arguments, set
one against the other by way of Parallel, where he
shall finde, that as in the water, face answereth
face: so in the humor of renuing <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> the
<hi>Appealer</hi> doth <hi>Arminius.</hi> If <hi>Arminius</hi> or <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
