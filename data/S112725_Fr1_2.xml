      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Ore Pilgrimes vse, Right worshipfull sir, that after their wearie iournies, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into their natiue soile, to communicate the troth, of anie thing worthie to be knowen and of them seene, among their es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall friends which are learned, and also louers of such kinde of vocation. The holy scripture sheweth vs, that when the wise men called Magi, being led by a straunge starre, to the place where Christ our Sauior was borne, at which place the starre did not only staie, but also gaue a wonderful bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with shining beams, to assure them that there the Sauiour was. Vndoubtedly these men letted not to declare these maruailous things &amp; visions, at their returne, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth at this present, that in Aethiopia &amp; the East Countries, are an infinite number of Christians▪ Likewise the Eunuch, messenger to the Queene of Candace, letted not to manifest in his Countrie, the miraculous things that he had seene in Ierusalem when
<pb facs="3"/>
Christ our Redeemer suffered the most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death of the crosse. Nor yet the Queene of Sabba, kept in secret the wisdome of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</p>
   <p>But the cause Right worshipfull, that I tooke this little Pamphlet in hand, was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the writing of Andrewe Theuet a Frenchman, who wrote of the Fortunate I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landes by hearesay: But I poore Pilgrime maie call those Ilands infortunate: for there was I apprehended for an heretike and an open enimie to the Romish Churche, and there deteyned in that bloudie Inquisition, the space of fiue yeares, &amp; now come home to offer this little worke to your worship, because your helping hand is alwaies ready to fauor and further anie vertuous or good attempt. Beseeching your worship to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, &amp; to consider that poore Pilgrimes haue not any other thing to giue, &amp; the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie graunt your hearts desire.</p>
