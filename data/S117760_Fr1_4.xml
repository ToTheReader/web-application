   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE ENSVING HISTORIE.</head>
   <p>IT is a thing most true, and some finde it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that here below in this world, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing eternall: And how can it be otherwise, when the great Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the earth, who seeme to be created of the most pure substance of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of a matter, as may bee said, for their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency incorruptible, of the fine gold of <hi>Euilath,</hi> and of the best mould, to the patterne of the fairest <hi>Ideas,</hi> and beare and carry the Image and Seale of all puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, as the chiefe impression of natures worke, in the plaine greatnesse of Maiestie, which engraueth their forehead with a gracious statelinesse. Yet doe we see them euery day, who seeme vnto men to be lasting and durable, as eternity it selfe, to quit the arches o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

death. And more than that, the most part of them finish their daies, not in the sweet and calme waters, like <hi>Pourcontrells,</hi> but by a death disseasoned, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in their greene youth, and flourishing age, by the stormes and tempests, as doe the <hi>Dolphins,</hi> within the torrents, billowes, or waues of the sea, tossed by diuers factions. And it seemeth that this fatality pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth ordinarily the most worthy and vertuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: so that they finish their liues many times with violence or precipitation; and not to goe vnto their death in a smooth path, but to bee interrupted with some strange accident, which cclipseth the bright shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning lustre of their greatnesse, which dasell the mindes of men, that from below beheld them sitting aloft on the throne of Maiestie. All which appeared most plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and euidently to be true in the most worthy and royall Princesse MARY STVART Queene of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who in all her life being tossed and turmoiled with infinite misfortunes, concluded it with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death, as followeth in the sequell of this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of her life and death.</p>
   <p>MARY STVART Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was daughter vnto <hi>Iames</hi> the fist, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a wise and valiant Prince, and of the Lady MARY, of the Illustrious family of the Dukes of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> (whose fame for valour is renowned thorow all Christendome,) was borne on the eighth day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember in the yeere of our Lord 1541. She was not aboue eight daies old when her father died: being left thus young, the Noblemen of <hi>Scotland</hi> being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided (whereof the family of the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Lynnox</hi> being the heads,) the one side sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth of <hi>England,</hi> and the other by the French King <hi>Henry</hi> the second▪ she was by the care of her mother who inclined vnto the
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>French</hi> King, at the age of six yeeres or thereabouts, sent into <hi>France</hi> in the Gallies of <hi>Villagagnon</hi> a Knight of the <hi>Rhodes</hi> appointed by the <hi>French</hi> King vnto this seruice, in the which voyage by the West Seas (for in the other passage neere the Straits of <hi>Calice,</hi> the <hi>Englishmen</hi> had laid a strong Nauy to intercept her) she hardly escaped drowning by meanes of a storme or tempest that happened, neere vnto the coast of little <hi>Brittaine</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where she afterward tooke land, from whence she was conueyed vnto the Court of <hi>France,</hi> where she was brought vp vnder her Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators the <hi>French</hi> King and the Dukes of <hi>Guise,</hi> and by their exquisite care she drew in with the aire the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the humours of the countrey, and in the end by the singular grace of nature, and carefulnesse of her friends and Kinsfolks, became with her age the fairest and goodliest Princesse of our time. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side this her rare beauty, she had her vnderstanding and intendment so pure and perfect, her iudgement so certaine, surmounting, and aboue the condition of her age and sex, that it bred and caused in her a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of courage, which was yet mixt and qualified with such sweetnesse and modesty, that you could not see any thing more Royall, any thing more gracious. Her manners and priuate actions were such, and were so well liked of generally, that it caused King <hi>Henry</hi> the second of <hi>France,</hi> and his Queene (who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired for her prudence) to marry their eldest sonne, <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and heire of their Crowne, vnto this Lady, as vnto one well deseruing to be ioyned in mariage vnto their sonne, heire apparant of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test kingdome in <hi>Europe:</hi> And so vpon the foure and twentieth day of <hi>April,</hi> in the yeere of our Lord 1558. <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and MARY STV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ART Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were maried in the Church
<pb facs="6"/>
of <hi>Nostra Dama</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi> One cannot declare with what applause of all the people, with what congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all the neighbour Princes, with what Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, this mariage was solemnized. By this her mariage her husband obtained not onely the Title of King of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the right of his wife, but also another more rich and great, which was, of the most contented Prince the earth then beheld, for that hee was ioyned in mariage with a Princesse who besides many other great vertues composed her selfe wholly to please and to giue content vnto her husband, and therein vsed not the ordinary care of a Princesse, but more trauell and sollicitude than doe the women of meane condition and qualitie maried vnto great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as also appeared after his death (which befell not long after) by her immeasurable mourning, not being able to finde any consolation for her sorrow in that place where shee had lost that which shee had loued better than her selfe, so much that the amitie of her kinsfolks and allies could not retaine her, nor the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and regret of all <hi>France</hi> could not call her backe, nor the sweetnesse of that Court which inuited her could not stay her, but that shee would depart from thence.</p>
   <p>After this on the seuenteenth day of <hi>Nouember</hi> the same yeere deceased <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> at which time the Parlament was holden at <hi>Westminster,</hi> being certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of her death, with a vniuersall consent, in regard of her most certaine right vnto the Crowne of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (of the which none could doubt,) both the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Nobles with the Commons agreed to haue the Lady ELIZABETH proclaimed Queene, which was done with the generall applause and consent of them and all the people.</p>
   <p>Queene ELIZABETH being established and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="6"/>
taken order for things at home, and domesticall affaires, applied her minde next to settle her affaires abroad: For which end it was thought fit to send Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors vnto Princes to signifie vnto them the death of Queene MARY, and her succession vnto the kingdome: Vnto <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperor was sent <hi>Thomas Challenor</hi> with letter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, wherein the Queene, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her owne hand, certified him that her sister Queene MARY was dead, and that she by the goodnesse of God was succeeded as her rightfull heire, and with the generall consent of her subiects, in the gouernment of the Realme; and that she desired nothing more, than that the ancient League and amitie betweene the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Austria,</hi> might not only be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued but also increased. Vnto the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> being in his Low coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ries, was sent the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> with instructions to the same purpose.</p>
   <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> vnderstanding the decease of Queene MARIE his wife, fearing lest <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> should be adioyned vnto <hi>France</hi> by m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>anes of the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> her Title, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lt seriously with Queene ELIZABETH by the <hi>Conde</hi> of <hi>Feria,</hi> whom he had sent before to visit his sicke wife, and the then Lady ELIZABETH also, about his mariage with her, promising to procure a dispensation for the same. This motion troubled her much, for to reiect the most mightie King of <hi>Europe</hi> (hauing deserued well of her) and suing to her for mariage vpon his owne motion: This thing no lesse disquieted the <hi>French</hi> King, who was also fearefull that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> should bee conioyned againe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> one by mariage; therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ee did all that was possible to be done at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Bishop of <hi>Angulesme,</hi> that no such dispensation should be granted, but yet very secretly, lest he should prouoke the <hi>Englishmen</hi> against him: but she put him off with a
<pb facs="7"/>
modest and shamefast answer. And when hee saw that he could not obtaine his suit for himselfe, and had also giuen it quite ouer, being agreed with the <hi>French</hi> King to marry his daughter, yet that the kingdome of <hi>England</hi> might be retained in his family still, he moued the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to commend one of his sonnes to be a suiter vnto Queene ELIZABETH, which motion he willingly entertained, and for that purpose sent vnto her very louing letters, and by <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par Preynerus,</hi> free Baron in <hi>Stibing,</hi> diligently follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prosecuted the same, the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe also, to bring it the sooner to passe, and to further it, most courteously offering and promising vnto Queene ELIZABETH his singular loue, kindnesse and affection.</p>
