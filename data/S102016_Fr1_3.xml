   <head>To the Gentlemen Readers.</head>
   <p>WOrthy gentlemen, of what degree soeuer, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this Pamphlet will hap into your hands, before a play begin, with the importunate clamour, of <hi>Buy a new Booke,</hi> by some needy companion, that will be glad to furnish you with worke for a turn'd Teaster. I rest well assured some of you will know mee at the sight of the infant, to such I commend it for acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance sake; others (I make no question) haue heard of me, to those I send it, in hope of better acquaintance; A third sort (it may be) neuer knew mee, nor I thinke care not whether euer they doe or no: To them I present it as carelesly as vnthrifts spend their anuities. Last to Criticks, I wish it may hap as seldome into their hands, as Vsurers giue almes, or Lawyers plead <hi>pro nihil.</hi> If any chance to say my inuention runs low, in regard I sell relations for demonstrations, to such I answere, not like a light hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, that will be wonne before she be wooed; but like a chaste virgin that would be scarce wonne with wooing: as for example, it is three yeeres since I spake some of these speeches, and since that time I haue beene earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated by noble personages (who haue had priuate copies for their owne vse) to print it for publike delight, at length I consented, &amp; since I am won, haue amongst you gallants, let it speed as it will. This is my comfort, how ere it proue in the reading, it was well lik't in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsing, by that Imperiall power; for whose prosperous continuance we are all in dutie bound to pray, <hi>Farewell.</hi>
