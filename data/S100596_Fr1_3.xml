In that priesthode he arose from death and ascen ded to heauē, he sytteth now on the right hand of his father almighty, cōtinuallye he maketh interpellacion for vs sinners, and shall come at the latter day to iudge the quicke &amp; the dead. Thys priesthode<note place="margin">Priesthod</note> requireth neyther oyle nor shauē crown, neyther chalyce nor aulter, neyther my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor cope, neither vestiment nor crosse, wyth such lyke toyes of Antichrist.</p>

      </note> to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> same, whych neuer was in full force tyll Sathan was at liberte, Apocali. xx. So long as they were permitted to haue wyues in marriage, they were ministers of the churche and no prestes. But nowe sens they haue left marriage, by vertu of their vowes, they became prestes and no godly ministers, to serue Antichriste and y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Deuil in all blasphemouse ydolatries. And because men shall not be ignoraunt of theyr vowes, I wyll declare vnto thē<note place="margin">Uowes.</note> what they are and frō whēs they came, ere they shall entre into the readinge of thys boke folowynge. This was their firste originall, as I haue gathered of moste learned and auncient wryters. A maner the people among the olde paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes conceyued first of all, to geue gyftes to their superior gouernours, to obtaine therby their beneuolence and fauour, the<note place="margin">For fauer</note> dyspersed commens to their kinges, and the enclosed citiezens to their magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
<pb n="viii" facs="9"/>
And as they perceyued thys commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouse in seruing their expectacion, they practysed vpō the same a religiō to their goddes, to please them by y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> lyke, hauing it in a continual &amp; dayly exercyse, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they obtained in processe of time, both<note place="margin">Gaynes.</note> prodigiouse answers of their false god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and also myracles of diuerse kindes, as the Deuyll is euer readye where true fayth is wantyng, and his worde neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to subuert all ordre of godlinesse.</p>
   <p>The Hebrues though they wer the pe culyar and chosen people of God, conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually exercised in his good doctryne, by<note place="margin">Teachers</note> Melchisedech, Abrahā, Isaac, Iacob, Io seph, and other graciouse fathers in that succession, yet were they very flexible and prone to ydolatry, whych laye moche in that practysed kinde of vowynge, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysinge sumwhat.

Though these vowes were thus conuerted into a rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the set ordynaunce of God, and serued to these. ii. very profytable endes, to kepe the Hebrues from the fylthynes<note place="margin">Hebrues</note> of ydolatry, and to be specyall types or

fygures of Christe in thys fleshe, yet were they in themselues but ceremoniall sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes. Continual wer they not, bycause they were but tollerate for a tyme for mannys infyrmytees sake, and had not their first institucyon of God. For by his holye prophetes he sumtyme reproued them, and sumtyme forbad them, and by hys sonne Iesus Christe he vtterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshed<note place="margin">Uowes.</note> them in the ende as vayne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppynges, S.

Yea, nowe cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely abolyshed and takē away by Christ, we are compelled by hys lyuely documē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to iudge them moche wurse.

For they ar not only a myserable<note place="margin">Uowes.</note> captiuite &amp; seruitude of Egipte, but also a clogge, a yoke, a snare of sathā, a cheane of iniquite, and the moste sinnefull cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the great beaste, or a marke to bye and sell by, whyche is to haue an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupying in that wycked generactō, Apo. xiii. He that beareth that character or marke in his forehead &amp; hande, that is to saye, he that beleueth that wycked doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine<note place="margin">Doctryne</note> of Antichrist, and foloweth it in his lyfe, shall drynke of the cuppe of Gods heauye wrathe, Apocai. xiiii. A noysome wounde and sore botche falleth vpon all thē that beareth the marke of that horti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mōstre, Apo. xvi. for so haue they their consciēces defyled wyth filthines vnspea kable, &amp; ar geuē vp into their own lustes.
<pb facs="11"/>
They whych beare that character in the beastes obedyence, are stayne by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> swerd<note place="margin">Character</note> that procedeth from the mouthe of hym which sytteth on the horse. Apo. xix. that is, they be cōdēpned vtterly by the wurd of God writtē, Iohan. iii. &amp; by that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che shall be pronounced at the lattre day by Christ sytting on the iudgement seate in our humanyte. Math. xxv. Lo, this is the rewarde of ydell vowers, that neglec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyng Gods wayes, wyl folow their own inuencyons. Nothyng ought of a christē<note place="margin">Rewarde.</note> man to be attēpted, that is not expreslye taught in the testament of Christe. For that whych is not in the scryptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, is fryuolouse, vayn, and wycked.</p>
   <p>Here perauenture it wyl be reasoned. How can I be Gods, vnlesse I do vowe my selfe vnto hym? Thus I answere thy vnlearned and foly she question. In the olde law, the first borne were the lordes,<note place="margin">Answere</note> Leuit. xxvii. yet they neuer vowed them selues vnto hym. In the newe lawe are we the firste borne so manye as beleue in Christe, and are regenerate, Iohan. i. thā are we his by fayth and baptysme, &amp; not by vowes.

We may do as deo the sonnes of Aarō, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre<note place="margin">Aaron.</note> a straunge fyre in the sacryfyce, &amp; be consumed of the same, Leuitic. x. We maye putte to hys wurde, and be founde reprouable lyars. Prouerbio. xxx. We maye adde to hys boke of prophecy, and haue added vnto vs the plages therin wrytten, Apoca. xxii. Oh tempte not the lord to moch, least in his high displeasure for thy wylfull rebellion, be destroye the<note place="margin">Rebellion</note> for euer with Core, Dathau, and Abiron, Nume. xvi. None of vs lyueth hys owne seruaunte (sayth S. Paule) neither doth anye of vs dye his owne seruaunte. But whether we lyue or dye, we are y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lords, Roma. xiiii.</p>
   <p>A promise or vowe, is alwayes of this nature, it dyspossesseth the first owner, &amp; maketh the thynge promysed, to be his, whose it was not afore. See than what<note place="margin">A vowe,</note> thou doest, whan thou bryngest thy selfe vudre a vowe. Where as thu werte the Lordes afore, thu becomest thyne owne by a newe creacion, as the tree that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

For by thy vowe, thu thus becomeste of Gods creature, an ydol of thyne own. But this thu wylt offre to God? This sacrifyce is vnsauery. Thu cannist not herein please<note place="margin">An ydoll</note> hym, but most wyckedly blaspheme him.
<pb facs="12"/>
Whan thu arte hys creature, it standeth wele wyth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> to be saued by Christes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytes. But whan thu art thine owne, thu wylte make clayme to thyne owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruynges, whiche can not further the to saluacyon. Thu wylte paraduēture say, that thou art styll Gods, notwythstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge thy vowe, though thou in that pel<note place="margin">Not gods</note> trye be nothynge lesse. For thus is a vow dyffyned of Lyra. Uotum est, cum aliquid de nostris offerimus deo. We calit a vow whan we offer anye thynge of our owne to God. But standynge the case, that thu werte hys in dede, thu doeste but mocke hym, yf thu offre hym hys owne, for thu cannyst not do it wythoute a thefte.

   <p>O bruty she fole and beastlye ydyote, thu sekest and procurest by thyne own de uyses to make Gods commaundements of none affecte for Antichristes wycked tradycyons, Mathe. xv.

   <p>He y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> voweth to lyue wythout a wyfe, or any other kynd of papystry, is nomore boūd to performe y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> vngodly vowe, thā he<note place="margin">Not bosid</note>

that hath professed the faythe of a Iewe or the religiō of a Turke, is bounde to ob serue it to hys lyues ende. If an English vower in the time of peace, shuld promise by othe to serue the Frenche kynge of a thousande vowes at a certayne day, and warre betwyxt Englande and Fraunce were proclamed in the meane tyme, he<note place="margin">Breake it.</note> shulde better please God to breake hys othe, than to kepe it.

If a man professing that lyfe, shulde afterwarde fele hymselfe not able to perfourme it, but were lyke to fal into greater mischeues than is the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge therof, he may breake it wythout daunger, as a thinge begon of rashenes.<note place="margin">Submit.</note> For no man ought to preferre his owne acte to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ordinaūce of God. And againe, the chaunge of thynges by hys secrete prouidence, dyschargeth the necessitye of the othe or promyse. How folyshe, vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uysed, and presumptuouse is the vowe, whan promyse is made to lyue all the yeare of an other mannys purse wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hys graunte or consent?

   <p>
      <pb n="xii" facs="13"/>Sucht are the rashe vowes of the ydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrouse and mockynge papystes.

They feare not the parell of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which is most daūgerouse, as to geue to a mad man a weapon, that maye stee therewyth. Neyther doubte they the impossibilite of that whyche is to nature vnpossible, as to lyue wythout sustenaunce of meate and of drynke, or whan they haue eaten, neuer to auoyde the superfluouse matter. I wold wysh y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> al rashe vowers wolde layserly consydre<note place="margin">Dewers</note> the rashe vowe of Peter the Apostle, to what conclusion it broughte hym, and so wyth hym to repente it at the lattre.

He was neuer able to perfourme hys vowe, bycause God had not promysed to assiste it.

Why these. ii. vertues shuld fall at vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aūce<note place="margin">ii. vertues</note> or cōtend for the highar place, I can not by the scryptures cōceyue. They wer in Mary Christes mother at a peaceable agrement, and the one serued at hys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnacyon so wele as the other. Neither was the one more praysed for her seruice there, than was the other.</p>
   <p>But in thys ydell presthode, the one could neuer abyde the name of the other, by reason of the vowe that antichrist had placed therin. Whych in processe of time<note place="margin">The vow.</note> exyled thē both, &amp; nourished for thē. ii. vn happy gestes, called whoredom and bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. Away with that wycked vow, that setteth varyaūce among vertues, &amp; that placeth in their rowmes most execrable vyces. That vowe is not all vnlyke to y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Angell of myschefe, whiche set the firste stryfe among Angels in heauen, &amp; amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest<note place="margin">Doctors.</note> men here in earthe. I maruele what hath moued the fyckle heades of our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, so earnestly to mayntayne a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by their doctrin, of so moch mischefe. It is in my opiniō a great madnes, to at tende so moch to the voyces of Hierome, Ambrose, &amp; Gregory, dyssuading frō mar<note place="margin">Apostle.</note> riage, &amp; so lytle to regard hym which cre ated mā to lyue honestly therin, cōmaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng by hys Apostle, that men shulde ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marry thā burne, rather to haue wy ues of their owne, thā inordynatly to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte

I omit to declare for lengthe of the matter, what mischefe and confusion, vowes broughte to thys realme by the Danes and Normannes, whan the lyues of the vowers in their monasteries were more beastlye than<note place="margin">Beastly.</note> eyther amonge paganes or Turkes.

   <p>I exhort the (gentyl reader) to accept al thynges here, as I do meane them. If thu be of God, to the glory of God, for to that ende haue I proponed them.
