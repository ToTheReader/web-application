      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His pamphlet of <hi>Doctor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> which hath ministred the occasion of this discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, is pretended to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by him in manner of a letter, dated at Rome the 20. of Aprill, 1587 to satisfie the consciences of those English souldiers, which had in Ianuarie before deliuered vp the Cittie of <hi>Deuenter</hi> vnto the King of Spaine, and reuolted frō her Maiestie (their liege Soueraigne) vnto his seruice, <hi>that their action therein was both lawfull, honorable, and necessarie, and that all others, especially those of the English nation, that deteine any Townes or other places in the lowe Countreies from the King of Spain, are bound vpon paine of damnation to doe the like:</hi> for occasion wherof, there is also prefixed before it, another very short letter, only of three pages, pretended in like sort to bee vvritten to <hi>Doctor Allen</hi> from <hi>Bruxels,</hi> the 20. day of March next fore past, by an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Gentleman,</hi> (whom <hi>Doctor Allen</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

Which comming by hap vnto my hands, and vpon diligent perusing therof, finding nothing in it but meer malice &amp; mischiefe, no one iott of sound doctrine or substance, ansvverable to the grauitie and learning of such a <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor thereof is esteemed to be: I did at the first vtterly contemne and reiect it, as a thing of no account, thinking it neither vvholsom to stirre so foule and stinking a puddle, nor glorious to ouerthrovve so sclender and superficiall a defense. Yet considering better of the most seditious driftes and deuilish persuasions cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conueyed in the argument of this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flet, vnder the cloak and shadovve of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb facs="3"/>
by meanes of vvhich title it might happly obtaine the more credit, if the fraud vvere not detected, I thought it a thing verie necessarie, to discouer and lay open to the vvorld, the slye &amp; subtile dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of <hi>D. Allen</hi> in this pamflet, together vvith the most absurd, prophane, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious shifts vsed by him therein, to th'end that no man might either by simplicitie and ignorance, or for affection to him &amp; his faction, or through ouermuch credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of his doctrine, be seduced by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful abuses &amp; impostures, to their ovvn vtter ruine &amp; destructiō. As for the more apposite and perticular ansvvering of this pamflet from point to point throughout, the chiefe questions therein being matters of Diuinitie, not of pollicie, I leaue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the further disquisition of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Diuines,</hi> of vvhom some perhaps vvhē this pamflet shall happen to be more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blik, and come to their hands, vvill for the quarrels sake, being good &amp; iust (though not for the woorth or weight of the thing
<pb facs="4"/>
it selfe) vouchsafe to bestow a litle paines in that argument. For mine owne parte, being neither of that profession, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing also another purpose, it sufficeth me to confute only those arguments, which lye in my waye, to hinder the scope of mine intent, which is only in the behalfe of our countrey, to discouer his pollicies, and encounter his persuasiōs, which tend wholy to the hurt and ouerthrow of our countrey. The safetie, peace, and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie whereof, whosoeuer respecteth, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and wisheth to continue, as (no doubt) all good, honest, and well affected subiectes doe; let him with iudgement reade this small treatise ensuing, and with reason, and conscience vveighe the abuses therein discouered, and then I doubt not but he shalbe thereby stirred vp, to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Religion tovvards God, a more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience tovvardes hir Maiestie, and a more naturall loue of his countrey.</p>
