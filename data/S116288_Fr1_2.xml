      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is sayd, that all things naturally affect their place of birth. Fire fain'd to be stolne from Heauen, of its owne Nature tends upwards. The Soule of Man desires to be united with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence from whence it is derived. Tis then but reason that these Poems should of themselves returne to you, by whose influence they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; Both of them being borne in your house: The one whilst I admir'd the serenity, and sweetnesse of your disposition: the other when I kept time with your greife, which you tooke for the losse of that noble Lady, your deare wife: So that now I doubt whether I may call my selfe the Author, or you. At least, if this be my worke, I am yours: And

could my capacity have reacht those Heroique vertues, which in the time of my attendance I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in you, I might perhaps have dar'd a higher flight, and from the hūble straine of shepheards, have growne up to you, as you are, the subiect of all morall vertues: I shouldh ha' then describ'd your <hi>valour, Industry,</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> in your actions at sea, your <hi>Bounty</hi> still exercised in the right place, your <hi>Piety</hi> in the memory of your deceased Lady, of whom, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Monument you have erected to her,) the statues and pictures you have, and what ever else might render her, testifie what a value you set on the originall. <hi>Vxorem enim vivam amare voluptas est, defunctam religio.</hi> But these aymes are too high for me, yet may you somewhat raise my thoughts, if you descend to keepe these in your esteeme, and with them,</p>
