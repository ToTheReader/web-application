   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O yeeld any reasons for the publishing these Sermons (considering the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie of the Author, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the Argument) were to call into question the valew of an Offering cast into the treasurie of Gods Church. If <hi>TERTVLLIAN,</hi> an ancient and learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (when the Light of the Gospel shined neerer the times of the primitiue puritie) confessed that hee did adore the fulnesse of the Scriptures: Haue wee lesse cause, in these dayes (indeed not of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but of contention and libertie) to respect the sincere Expositors of the Mysteries of GOD? espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when euerie man is almost become an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretor to himselfe. But for as much as they who are the Publishers of these exercises, can best giue resolution for their publication, (how euer extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie occasions vnexpectedly withcal'd them for the present;) yet, where a man in his life time so knowne, and so deseruing to be knowne for since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of conucrsation, generalitie of learning, graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of iudgement, and soundnesse of Doctrine (as
<pb facs="3"/>the Author was) hath left any monument of his studies; there it cannot bee but an iniurie to his memorie, and a kindt of defrauding the Store-house of Religion, to conceale that for any priuate vse, which concernes a publique benefit. A Teacher, after his death, is best commended, by the remaining fruits of his labours; those parcell-reliques of this worthie man, being then read, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderstood, and applyed, cannot but both informe the charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Christian Reader, and confirme him.</p>
