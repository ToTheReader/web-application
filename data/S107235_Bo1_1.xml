   <p>AMong many diseases whiche do raigne in a Horse, I haue seene that the foundering hath bene reputed the moste difficult to be cured. And as the goute in man is accompted an infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie incurable: so is the foundering in a Horse (of most men) thought irrecouerable. I wishe I could as well heale the one, as (by Gods sufferaunce) I can giue remedie for the other, I would as willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly present vnto you both, as I doo this one. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding accept this as it is, and refuse it not, as sundry curious &amp; scornfull Farriers haue done vnto me, who neither knowing howe to remedie the disease, nor willing to learne, haue reiected at my hands the vnderstanding of the cure, and as it were, in spite of arte &amp; cunning, cut out the sowles of the horses feete (a thing commonly vsed among suche ignoraunt persons) by whiche any Horse so misused shall neuer haue his feete sound agayne, (whatsoeuer they promise you,) where by this which I do here set out, neither shall you once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue your horses shoes, neither yet touch any part of his hoofe or feete, and yet shall your Horse be as sound as euer he was.</p>
