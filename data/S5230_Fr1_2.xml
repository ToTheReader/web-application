   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, the Wiseman saith, that <hi>Al riuers go into the sea</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>Eccle.</hi> 1.7.</note>, shewing themselues (as it were) homagers and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries to that place, from whence (so farre as wee may credit Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie <note n="b" place="margin">Plato in Phaedone.</note>) they haue receiued their first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It hath bin often in my thoughts, and more than often in my desires, that in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of my remembring that, (which it were euen a sin in me to forget) there might passe backe from me to your Worship, some little streame, of those larger brooks of your both countenance and beneuolence, with which my studies in the Ʋniuersitie being much refeshed, and my first endeuours in the Ministerie (as it were) by a kinde wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, helped forward in their growth, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse my selfe to be become that <hi>Little,</hi> which
<pb facs="3"/>
by the grace of God I now am in his Church. Wherfore hauing a disposition for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of some friends, to copie a draught of these Sermons, I thought I might with one labour doe a publique good, and giue thē their priuate contentment. And withall it came into my minde to tender them to you, not as the full paiment of so great a debt, but as an insinuation of my desire to bee thankefull, and of my meaning, hereafter to present you with some matter of more worth, according as God shall enable me, and any conuenient vacation from the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my publike function shall afford me opportunitie. Thus presuming, out of your former loue, that this poore offer shall at the least be kindly looked vpon, with my many and vnfained prayers for the enlargement of Gods graces vpon your selfe, your Lady, and all those young plants, which by the great blessing of God haue branched from you both, I humbly take my leaue. From <hi>Modbury</hi> in <hi>Deuon.</hi>
