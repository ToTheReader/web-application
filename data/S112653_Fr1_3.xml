      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Assyng hence into some the partes beyonde the sea, not yet long since (righe worshipfull) of parte for myne experience to acquainte my self with the nature of straūgers, to se their order, and gouernment, in the administration of the weale publique, to see the soïle it self; and the commodities therof, to sauour of their language, with others the semblable but chiefly for myne increase, in the studie of good letters, wherein as Englande lacketh not good schooles, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, so thought I theim lesse able yet, in the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectes to satisfie, and aunswere my desire. VVhere afewe monethes after myne arriuall, the worlde grewe to bee suche, so tumultuous, and troublesome, that no manne could assure hymselfe, or promise him self safe beyng: gates eche where were shutte, tounes and holdes were fenced, castles, and fortes furnished, all passeges straightly, and diligently obserued, the
<pb facs="3"/>
fieldes full of armed menne, readie to the battaile, and in fine, throughout one onely face, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of hostilitie. By meanes whereof, the lawes were lockte vp, as if thei neuer had been knowen, iustice was then to none, or sure to fewe menne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, all artes Mechanicall, and Sciences surcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, euery corner full of cloase, and whisperyng mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, no manne from others malice, or safe, or well assured. In schooles now were the chairesvoide of their learned doctours, no man deliuered lawes from Iustinian the Emperour, the solace of the sicke Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates was then, and Galene eke vnknowen, the sciences exiled then, the scriptures were not taught, the tonges were all forgotten, Philosophie, the loue of wisedome, there a straunger. Besides these I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng speake of the greate nomber of houses, chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, chapelles, and villages, vtterly wasted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed with fire, of the wilfull profusion of wine, oyle, corne, and the semblable: of the moste lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and marueilous penurie, and want of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie victualles, of the pitifull complainte of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gente, and neadie, of the frownyng faces betwixt neighbour, and neighbour, of the little truste the maister had in his seruaunte, the father eke in his childe, or one manne in an other. Thus therefore,
<pb facs="3"/>
when all thynges grewe on, to suche disorder, when policie gaue rome, and place to hostilitie, when ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and armed menne had all thynges in possession when none liued voyde of feare, when no state was assured, then knewe I not what better to dooe, or how better to spende the long, and wearie howers, then at tymes to busie my selfe in some lighte, and pleasant studie. By meanes whereof, I chose to wade into this Foreste, wherein I muste confesse, I had suche present likyng, as seldome my happe hath been or neuer to finde the semblable. So hauyng then bothe redde hym, and redde hym through againe, with due consideration of the excellencie, and great learnyng of the aucthour, I thought I could not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spende that so wearie a tyme, then in transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng this Foreste, into our naturall language, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie my countrie therwith, to whiche not to our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues we liue still, and still are borne. Especially for that I knewe it written, in three sunderie tounges, in the Spanishe firste, by Petrus Messia, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manne of Siuile, and thence dooen into the Italian, and laste into the Frenche, by Claudius Grugette, late Citezein of Paris: wishyng that wee were so labourous, and so diligent, that no thyng emongeste them were written, whiche we with theim impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="4"/>
not. And yet I muste confesse, that in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente vertion, diuers chapiters are lefte out of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and aduisedly, not by ouersight, by slouth, or by negligence, whiche I thought I might with as good warrante dooe, as others some to adde, or chaunge at their pleasure, especially for that the matter so dependeth not, one parte of the other, that the firste without the seconde, or the seconde without the thirde, or that without theim bothe, might please or contente in any thyng the reader. For beyng as it is a collection of sunderie matters, the lacke of one annoieth not, or maihemeth not th' other, yet for my full discharge, and purgation herein, I wishe that the skilled in the tounges, at their leasure should cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what thei are, how many, of what weight, or importance, that whileste my desire was onely to giue that, whiche was profitable, and pleasyng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I might not be thought more daintie, then trustie to carue hym at my pleasure. Neither would I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine be thought so rough, and harde a censor with idle superfluitie, to charge in oughte the aucthour, whose vertues and learning, I reuerence and honor. And farther doe promise, that if it maie be thought expedient, at some tyme hereafter, to collecte also the remnante. In the meane season, I beseche your
<pb facs="4"/>
worshippe to accepte herein my doynges, garde and defende from wrong this little Foreste, for whose cause onely, I tooke it firste in hande, of parte, that if the reader conceiue herein any likyng, that he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stande bounde to none, but to you onely, of part also, to leaue you some small shewe, or token of my poore minde, readie alwaies, and vowed to dooe you all kinde of seruice, trustyng that you will as fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie accepte it, as in cases not dissemblable, hath been your wonted vsage, whiche if I maie perceiue, (wherof I neuer doubted) it shall cause me to attēpte some other thyng in tyme to come, percase with my greater paine, and laboure. And this trustyng that this rude, and simple vertion shall finde some grace, and fauour with the indifferent reader, shadowed especially with the countenance of your willyng, and fauourable protection, I ende, wishyng you many, and good daies in this world: and in the other to come, eternall ioye, and felicitie.</p>
