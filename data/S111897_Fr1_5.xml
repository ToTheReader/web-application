      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I had many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues to set forth this my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise in latin, yet regarding the good of those that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in that tongue, I haue written it in English, with as much shortnes and breuitie as I could possibly. I confesse I might haue made a great volume of it, if I had insisted vpon the amplification of euery reason: but for diuerse respects, I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it in this small manuall. And as I haue disswaded men from popery by these twelve seuerall reasons, so did I once thinke to haue adioyned more, but for causes known to my selfe, I haue yet concealed them. Their senselesse paradoxes, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse arguments, with which their bookes are fraught, haue caused me so to abhorre their religion, that I may protest in simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a good conscience, I could neuer read any argument to perswade me to papistrie: yet haue I read their writers without any praeiudicate opinion at all, being neuer fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled
<pb facs="7"/> with this religion, in which through Gods grace nowe I stand. And Bellarmines corrupting of fathers, his foolish distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, his cōtradictions with himselfe, &amp; with other Papists, his sencelesse sophismes, his wresting of holy writte, haue in them (as I thinke) this force to perswade his readers from his religion. Now it remaineth (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian reader) to desire this of thee, to weigh these my motiues with an indifferent mind, and if thou receiuest any good by them, to be thankefull to God, and to commend me in thy praiers vnto him.</p>
