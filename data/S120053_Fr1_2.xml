      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y heart is inditing of a good matter: I <note place="margin">Ps 45.</note> speake of the things which I haue made touching the King; my tongue is the pen of a readie writer.</p>
   <p>God shall wound the heart of his enemies, <note place="margin">Ps. 68.</note> and the hayrie scalpe of such a one as goeth on still in his trespasses.</p>
   <p>Loe they that are farre from thee shall perish: thou hast <note place="margin">Ps. 73.</note> destroyed all them that goe a whoring from thee.</p>
   <p>But it is good for me to draw neere to God: I haue put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all thy workes.</p>
   <p>Confounded be all they that serue grauen Images, that <note place="margin">Ps. 97.</note> boast themselues of Idols.</p>
   <p>It is time for thee Lord to worke, for they haue made <note place="margin">Ps. 126.</note> void thy Law.</p>
   <p>Thou hast giuen a banner for them that feare thee, that <note place="margin">Ps. 60.</note> it may be displayed because of thy truth.</p>
   <p>The righteous shall see it and reioyce; and all iniquitie <note place="margin">Ps. 107.</note> shall stop her mouth.</p>
   <p>So that a man shall say verely there is a reward for the <note place="margin">Ps. 58.</note> righteous; verely he is a God that iudgeth in the earth.</p>
   <p>All men shall feare and shall declare the worke of God: <note place="margin">Ps. 64.</note> for they shall wisely consider of his doing.</p>
   <p>The workes of the Lord are great: sought out of all them <note place="margin">Ps. 111.</note> that haue pleasure therein.</p>
   <p>Who so is wise, and will obserue these things, euen they <note place="margin">P. 107.</note> shall vnderstand the louing kindnesse of the Lord.</p>
   <p>Many O Lord my God are thy wonderfull workes which <note place="margin">Ps. 40.</note> thou hast done, &amp; thy thoughts which are to vs ward, they cannot be reckoned vp in order vnto thee: when I would
<pb facs="4"/>
declare them, they are more then can be numbred.</p>
   <p>I haue preached righteousnesse in the great Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: loe I haue not refrained my lips, O Lord thou knowest.</p>
   <p>I haue not hid thy righteousnesse within my heart, I haue declared thy faithfulnesse and thy saluation:</p>
   <p>I haue not concealed thy louing kindnesse and thy truth from the great Congregation.</p>
   <p>I will speake of thy testimonies also before kings and will <note place="margin">Ps. 119.</note> not be ashamed.</p>
   <p>Helpe me O Lord my God, O saue me according to thy <note place="margin">Ps. 109.</note> mercie.</p>
   <p>That they may know that this is thy hand: that thou Lord hast done it.</p>
   <p>Let them curse, but blesse thou: when they arise let them be ashamed: but let thy Seruant reioice.</p>
   <p>Let my aduersaries be clothed with shame, and let them couer themselues with their owne confusion as with a mantle.</p>
   <p>As we haue heard, so haue we seene in the Citie of the <note place="margin">Ps. 48.</note> Lord of Hoasts, in the Citie of our God, God will establish it for euer.</p>
   <p>The Lord is knowne by the iudgement which he execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: <note place="margin">Ps. 9.</note> the wicked is snared in the worke of his owne hands.</p>
   <p>This shall be written for the generation to come, and the <note place="margin">Ps. 102.</note> people which shall be created shall praise the Lord.</p>
