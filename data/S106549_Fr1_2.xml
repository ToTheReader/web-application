   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter many thoughts to whom I
should more particularly dedicate
this my hoped Consolation, (right
Honourable able and right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,)
the Lord in his wisedome
and mercie (I trust) directed me
vnto your selues, as those whom it doth in a peculiar
manner concerne. That like as he hath appointed you
<pb facs="3"/>
to these places, so ye may euer haue before your eies, the
speciall ends for which he hath assigned them to your
trust, &amp; for which you must be answerable to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Maiesty. The first and chiefe whereof (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue)
is this, That his pure religion, honour, and true
worship, may be set vp, and aduaunced in them;
the next, that the wealth and sauing of all his poore
people in those places, both of their soules and bodies,
may be by you procured, so farre as in your power
shall lie. And these things to be effected principally,
by a learned, holie, and faithfull Ministerie, protected
and assisted by a godlie Magistracie, and by propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and spreading all good learning and knowledge
amongst them. To this purpose God hauing ordained
schooles of learning to be a principall meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a barbarous people to ciuilitie, and thereby to
prepare them the better to receiue the glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of Iesus Christ; as also for the breeding and
nourishing of such a holie Ministerie, with a wife and
godlie Magistracie, and people to be perpetuallie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued;
your care as I take it, in the next place (that
I may speak with all reuerence and submission) ought
to be for prouision of meete schooles and Seminaries
for them, according to the natures and conditions of
the places, and as God shall raise vp meanes thereto.
And for those which are alreadie so prouided and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished,
<pb facs="3"/>
that the best orders may be knowne and
receiued, for the speediest aduancement of the best
learning in them, and for accomplishing all the good
thereby desired; and withall for supply of what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
helpes Gods goodnes shall vouchsafe, for bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and nourishing, and also preseruing all true pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and grace amongst them.</p>
   <p>The benefit therefore and comfort of such small
mites, as his heauenlie bountie hath vouchsafed me,
which may be helpefull hereunto, I do most thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and cheerefully, as from his goodnesse, tender
vnto you to this end; And more specially to you, right
Honour able and right Worshipfull the Gouernour,
Councell and Companie for <hi>Virginia,</hi> and of the
<hi>Sommer Ilands;</hi> that planting in a right order,
beginning with the Lord, and the carefull planting
and watering of his sacred Religion, you may finde
a more happie growth, and increase, and euermore
sound and lasting ioy to your owne soules. First, the
mite of my Schoole-labours trauelled in, now manie
yeares for all inferiour and ruder places, whereunto
what blessing his heauenlie bountie hath giuen, I
leaue to the iudgement of all true harted wel-willers
vnto good learning. Secondly, I desire to commend
vnto you, for them, and that vpon vndoubted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
the helpe, and benefit of another poore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb facs="4"/>
which he of his goodnes hath likewise granted
vnto me, namelie of a little Treatise called, <hi>The true
Watch, and Rule of Life:</hi> which hauing receiued
the witnesse of sundrie godlie learned, (of whom I
haue for manie yeares intreated the examining; and
censuring of it, after the publique authorizing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
to be that waie of godlines, wherein we all who
truelie professe Christs Gospel do agree, and that
narrow path, in which all that walke conscionablie,
and carefullie, shall certainely finde eternall Life: I
dare be the more bold in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>tie to make tender of, for
the furtherance of their perpetuall comfort and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.
And vnto the same adioyned the <hi>Rule of true
Prayer,</hi> the second part of the same <hi>True Watch;</hi>
wherein I haue followed, (so neare as I haue beene
able) the perfect patterne of our blessed Sauiour:
which two so conioyned, may be for directing pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately
euerie soule (which hath grace to vse them,
and to put them so in practise) as their Sea-card and
Compasse, to keepe them in the right course to their
intended Point; that they may not be carried ouer
farre, nor fall too short of their desired hauen; Yea
to performe that for them, which neither Card nor
Compasse can; to wit, that they may not onelie be k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>pt
from splitting; or dashing vpon the Rockes or Sands,
but that they may saile securelie amongst the most
<pb facs="4"/>
dangerous rockes and perillous tempests. That ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuing
happily, they may likewise euer after be kep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
safe, in the midst of all sauage and cruell enemies.</p>
   <p>And finally, what straits or miseries soeuer they
shall come into, either by Sea or land; that but onely
crying vnto the Lord, they may be graciously heard;
and mercifully deliuered in due time, according to that
which shalbe most for the glorie of his Maiestie
and their owne saluation, with the good of his people.</p>
   <p>Though the dedication and patronage of my
Schoole-labours belong vnto our most hopefull and
illustrious Prince, and so in like maner of my <hi>Watch</hi>
vnto most Honourable personages (to whom I am
euer bound) yet I know that the tender of the assured
benefit thereof, after so long triall in the right vse
and practise of them, euen vnto your Honours and
Worships, for these poore soules, and for your more
happie execution of your charge, will be most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vnto them, as who desire the wealth of all.
Yea (giue me leaue to speake iointlie and freelie, yet
in all humble duty vnto you all before mentioned, both
right Honourable and right Worshipfull) euen yee
are they to whom the charge of these poore Countries
and places are committed in speciall manner, and the
prouiding for them. If therefore you should not vse
all holie meanes for the honour of our God, with the
<pb facs="5"/>
sauing and preseruing of all those soules, and their
posteritie, and gaining the verie sauage amongst
them vnto Iesus Christ, whether <hi>Irish</hi> or <hi>Indian,</hi>
but onelie respect your owne ends and proiects, you
could neuer stand before his heauenlie Maiestie, to
answere his Highnesse for it; especiallie, if hee most
graciouslie offering you helpes thereto, you should not
embrace them accordinglie, and to your vtmost abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
see them put in execution. You cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the wofull estate of all sorts, so long as they
remaine in ignorance and blindnesse, without the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ, and much
more of all such, as haue bene nourished long in feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
superstition and Idolatrie: and aboue all other,
those who haue bene bred in a manifest, and most
palpable, and euen a visible adoring of Sathan; nor,
how the Holie Ghost hath told vs plainelie,<note place="margin">2. Thes. 1. 8, 9</note>
      <hi>That our
Lord Iesus will come, in flaming fire to render
vengeance to all who know not God, and
which obey not his heauenly Gospell.</hi> Who
must then be punished with euerlasting perdition,
when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to
be made maruellous in all them that beleeue. Oh set
before your faces the miserable condition of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and so the danger of all liuing in blindnesse, whilst
they so remaine. If we beleeue the word of the Lord,
<pb facs="5"/>
and looke stedfastlie with the eies of Faith, vpon
the wretched estate and wofull torment of that rich
Glutton in Hell (by whom our Sauiour fore-warneth
all sorts for euer) it will surely cause vs to looke vnto
our selues.<note place="margin">Luke 16. 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

those soules must be required, if they perish for lacke

      <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 18</note>
as the Holie Ghost witnesseth most plainelie,
and we may see it by d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ilie experience, (when as m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
a good soule, which hath bene carefull to walke
with God, yet in distresse of conscience, and a little
left to Sathans buffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tings, for their humbling, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
such miserie, and is so hardly rescued from
him and from vtter destruction) it will surely awake
vs all to looke more carefully to all committed to our
charges. Yee are those whom our blessed God hath
appointed; vnder our dread and gracious Soueraigne
to be as foster-fathers vnto them, and therefore it
concernes you neerelie, to thinke seriouslie hereof;
for if that way of godlinesse, which we professe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the word of the Lord and our good Lawes
(which I haue long endeuoured to set plainely before,
our faces, in that little Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>atise, the vse and benefit
whereof I desire to commend vnto you for them) be
<pb facs="6"/>
that narrow way of life, as wee are assured from
the mouth of the Lord it is; then their contrary cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
must needes be the way of death and hell. Though
therefore, wee should haue no commiseration of the
poore soules themselues, yet remember the things
that may concerne your owne blessed estate and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie,
and your ioyfull appearing before the high
Tribunall of our Lord and Sauiour, and then there
will be no more need to mooue you therein, nor anie
other whom the charge of soules concernes, who shall
consider hereof aright, to do your vtmost endeuour
for their saluation. There will be no more need to call
on you to see the gospel of Christ planted among them,
or to prouide them of faithfull Ministers, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
by all possible meanes all other helps, or that, that
which hath bene most charitablie giuen, and former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
collected to these ends, may be rightlie employed,
and whatsoeuer else the Lord shall hereafter affoord
for their benefit, chieflie to bring them into and keep
them in this narrow path. Wofull is the case of all
those, amongst whom Sathan reignes, and who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him instead of Christ, as all such do, who know
him not, and much more those poore <hi>Indians,</hi> among
whom he (as is reported) is visibly adored &amp; sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
vnto, as their God. Maruell not if honest and
vnderstanding Christians be so hardly drawne ouer
<pb facs="6"/>
to these places, as namely into <hi>Virginia,</hi> or so much
as to perswade their friends to such a voyage, when
as there are in the same so manifold perils, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of falling away from God to Sathan, and that
themselues, or their posterity should become vtterly
sauage, as they are. This holy care being first had,
for their soules and eternall happinesse; and withall,
that there be no wrong offered to the poore sauage
there, nor scand all giuen to them, there may be a
greater hope of a happy Plantation, and that he will
in mercy afford a plentifull supply of all good things,
and raise vp many to be benefactors and furtherers,
and giue a prosperous successe to all your holy ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
with assurance of his fauour present, and for
euermore. But if thorough the wickednes or offensiue
carriage ef Ministers or people, minding nothing
but for their owne aduantage, these poore soules shall
take occasion to conceiue euill of the Lord, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
all this hope is vtterly ouerthrowne, in the
very hauen.</p>
   <p>Here upon in my desire of their conuersion and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
with the sauing and preseruation of our owne
countrie-men there alreadie, and which hereafter
shall go to them, and of all other in these ruder coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and places, I haue bene bold to tender these my
poore trauels, vpon much hope and confidence: That
<pb facs="7"/>
first euen this course of instruction, to be presented
vnto you, being embraced and rightly put in practise,
a most speedy and sure foundation, may be layd for all
future good learning, in their schooles, without any
difference at all from our courses receiued here at
home; and whereby both Maisters and Scholars, may
proceed speedily, and cheerefully, and with certaine
assurance of a blessing; and that so from vs may be
sent continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ll supplies of teachers to proceed in the
same order. The triall whereof I dare (through Gods
goodnesse) tender to any by your selu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s appointed to
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ke full demonstration of it to them, like as I haue
formerly done to the most learned and fit that I could
chuse to this purpose, as appeareth in the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sure, in the closing vp of this little Treatise.
And withal, to help that we may haue by the same, not
onely the puritie of our owne language preserued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all our owne people th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>re, but also that it may
be readily learned in the Schooles, together with the
Latin, and other tongues, and so more propagated to
the rudest <hi>Welch</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> yea to the very heathen
&amp; sauage, brought vp amongst them, the more easily
thereby to reduce them all (as was said) to a louing
ciuility, with loyall and faithfull obedience to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne,
and good Lawes, and to prepare a way to
pull them from the power and seruice of Sathan, that
<pb facs="7"/>
they may ioyntly submit themselues to Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p>And for the <hi>Watch,</hi> being agreeable to the word
of the Lord, as I trust euery one that tries aright shal
find it, I dare boldly a vow, that euery soule that shall
truely put in practise, first that <hi>Rule and Way of
life</hi> to walke in it, shall find more true comfort by it,
then by all the commodities in <hi>Virginia,</hi> yea more
true ioy, with all heauenly riches and felicity, then
all the golden mines of the <hi>Indians</hi> can possibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
vnto them. Secondly, for that <hi>Rule of Praier</hi>
in the same, that euery one who shall learne to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
it, as the Lord Iesus hath taught him, shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
whatsoeuer good thing his soule shall desire:
and finally, that so watching and praying, he shall be
kept safe, euen in the midst of Diuels and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
other perils, and haue the Lord to be vnto him,
as he was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> God all-sufficient, whither
soeuer he calleth him, to be seene of him in the Mount,
and the inheritance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to him and his, so
walking, for an euer lasting possession.</p>
   <p>Thus haue I presumed to tender vnto you (right
Honourable and right Worshipfull) whatsoeuer the
Lord hath vouchsafed me, whereof I haue had hope,
that it might help you in your gouernments and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
for the good of those poore people committed to
you, and specially which might further the happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<pb facs="8"/>
of that so much desired Plantation, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of the heathen, and training them vp in good
learning, and the feare of the Lord, and that so from
the children, it may please God more easily to deriue
the same vnto their fathers, from the younger to the
ancients; and so in time, by some of themselues so trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vp, to propagate it to all their posterity: which
(if after further triall made by you) it shal be as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
accepted, as it is heartily and cheerefully of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
according to that which I haue receiued from
the Lord, I shall not onely haue more cause to blesse
his heauenly Maiestie, but also be encouraged still to
prosecute these poore trauels, and to study the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good of them all during life, especially for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the poore natiues in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and all other of
the rest of the rude and barbarous from Sathan to
God, and so rest,</p>
