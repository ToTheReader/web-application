   <p>AS <hi>for Maister Correctors Declenson</hi> of a Nomen Heretique, I omit as a Bable for a foole to play with: It appeareth the man trauelled with follie, and coulde not tell where to lay his burden els, but in the forefront of Parsons Book, euen vnder his nose; that it might be as a taste to the Reader of the stuffe contained in it. It is pitie that his name was not set to it. For now he must needs forgoe the fame and praise of so woordie and foolishe a worke. Belike he was some Vsher, that was appoynted to be a Corrector, and rather then he woulde say nothing, he woulde censure his Maisters worke both to shame himselfe and his Maister also.</p>
