   <head>TO THE INDIFFERENT READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE present estate, that the realme of
England is in a fewe yeares come vnto,
and the sundry aduersites sustayned
by the inhabitāts of the same, are such,
and somany, as the lamentable and ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerall
cries and complaintes of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
multytude, cā declare them to exceede all those
of all ages past, in the memorie of man.</p>
   <p>And yet of the redresse of these calamities, so litle
hope is giuen, that nought els, but the terrors of farr
greater trobles, are daily sounded in the eares of the af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>flicted
people: which can be to no other end, then to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duce
them to beare such further extreame misery, and
pouertie, as by the newe intended exactions, pressures,
&amp; pillages, they are lyke to be broughte vnto. But strā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge
it is to consider, that the auoydance of such great
daungers, as are pretended vnto the realme (and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;
as is insinuated, by a spanish inuasion) is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
soughte nor desyred, by geuing that king satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the manifeste iniuries don vnto him, nor in
the restitution of his townes and cities wrongfully
possessed by the English: But falsly supposed to consist
in the persecuting and killing of a fewe poore priests
and Iesuytes within the realme, that there do secretly
practize their priestly functions, to the consolation of
such afflicted Catholikes as liue within the same, or to
the conuersion of such well mynded protestants, as
will not obstinately refuse to vnderstand their owne
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
errors, when they are made manifest vnto them, by
which meanes many are confirmed in Catholike reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and some numbers brought from heresy to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the truthe. which albeit the malice of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sary
hath not letted to withstād, euen with the effusiō
of bloud, yet cōsidering that the force of truthe is great
and dothe preuaile, the violence of the enemy is also
mightely encreased, who directly seeking the lyues
and goods of Catholikes, for their conscyence and reli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giō,
laboreth by all meanes possible, to make the cause
of their sufferance to some to be for treason. Vnder
pretext whereof, by a late proclamation published in
London in Nouember last 1592. in the name of the
Queene, theire are yet more exquisite meanes of inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
deuysed, to bring them vnto the slaughter, then
were euer vsed afore.</p>
   <p>And because all men can not without some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
so rightly discerne the truthe of this case,
and the causes of the supposed perills, as it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syte
for euery man to know, and the sway of the tyme
not permitting the same otherwise to be vttered, they
are in the ensuing treatise briefly set downe.</p>
   <p>In the which, albeit that euery fryuolous point
of the aforesaid proclamation be not expresly answe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red,
yet is the intention of the inuētor thereof direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impugned, and the iust blame imputed where it
is iustly deserued. It may therefore please the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
reader (laying a syde all partialitie) with an in
different eye, to behold the manifest truth, that shal (in
this treatise) be laid open vnto him, the which for his
owne safty he must vse with secreesie, and sylence,
because of the great a-do, that the great Lord Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherer
will kepe, to depresse and conceile it from the
sight and knowlege of the world, the which may serue
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
for one especial motiue, to prooue that he knoweth
himselfe to be guilty in conscience, yf he haue any
at al. And thus leauing the reader out of the
matter ensuing (with some addition of
somthing here omitted) to make a
commentarie vpon <hi>Chaucers</hi>
prophesie, I wish him
well to fare from
Colen the 26.
of Marche
1592.</p>
