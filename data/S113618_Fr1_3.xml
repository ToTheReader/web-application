                 <title>Mans actiue obedience, or The power of godlines : especially in the commandement of the gospell, which requireth faith in euerie Christian: or A treatise of faith, worthily called precious faith, as being in it selfe a most rare iewell of ioy, and peerelesse pearle, that excelleth in worth the highest price. Wherein is plainly declared what faith in Christ is what properly is the obiect of it, what is the speciall operation of faith, by which it may bee discerned; and the worke about which it is principally imployed, the subiect wherein it is placed; what things are needfull to the making it up, what to the being, and what to the wel-being of it; with the differences that are betweene true beleeuers and fained in all of them, and the vses thereof.

   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O preuent that preiudice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the regard and benefit of many good bookes is much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; we haue thought good to premit somewhat touching the Author, the treatise it selfe, and the reasons why it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to the presse. First, for the Author, he may well be reckoned amongst the Worthies of Gods Israel; who, while he liued, was (as another<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 18. 24.</note>
      <hi>Apollos</hi>) an eloquent man, and mightie in the Scriptures, instructed in the way of the Lord, and feruent in the spirit, and spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord: a man of indefatigable paines, both in his priuate studies and exercises; and also in the publique worke of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie; to the great benefit of the Church of God, ouer which the holy Ghost had made him an ouer-seer: and finally he was a iudicious and pious Diuine, well seene and practised, especially in these points of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, wherof he hath here written. So that the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Author doth deseruedly commend the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, as also the nature of the treatise may wel commend the Author; with whom in the birth thereof it fared as with<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 35. 11.</note>
      <hi>Rachel,</hi> who died in trauell: whereupon
<pb facs="8"/>
though this abortiue orphan may, in regard of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thereof, well brooke the name<note n="c" place="margin">The sonne of my sorrow.</note>
      <hi>Benoni;</hi> yet for our due esteeme &amp; vse thereof it may fitly by vs be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<note n="d" place="margin">The sonne of my right hand.</note>
      <hi>Beniamin.</hi> The reasons mouing this our Author to write any thing for publique vse, as one of vs hath obserued them from his owne mouth, was first, for that he being restrained from benefiting the Church by the ordinarie course of his ministerie, hee was both willing and desirous to be seruiceable and helpfull to the same, in what he might, by this way and meane. Secondly, he seeing the people generally both pestered with many needlesse idle vaine pamphlets, and multitudes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous historicall discourses; and also much encombred with manifold polemicall diuinitie tractats, of curious and litigious points, tending rather to contention and diuision, then to godly edifying, and that many good and necessarie bookes were more framed to giue satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the learned, then to edifie the simple: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he might in a subseruient manner endeuour to supplie the preteritions of the latter sort of bookes, and to helpe to iussle the former rotten rapsodies out of place; he thought it expedient, that treatises of such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie matter, concerning the eternall saluation of all, handled in so plaine a manner, that the meanest may vnderstand, should also be obtruded vpon the readers, at the least if it were but to interrupt and hinder some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the reading of such bookes as be either hurtfull or vnprofitable.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, that he might leaue in speciall to that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and<note n="*" place="margin">Lee.</note> congregation, to whom he was a carefull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, a particular remembrancer to bring to their minds some chiefe points of his former doctrine, taught
<pb facs="8"/>
amongst them; which upon their second meditations thereof, they might the more affect and regard; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to bequeath some note of his good affection to his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing friends and well deseruing acquaintance; this treatise did he entend and fit for them, often to peruse and well to respect as the last farewell and loue-token of their deare friend.</p>
   <p>Secondly, for the treatise it selfe; though it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> both for the extent in parts and measure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and also for the manner and forme of the same, so that now it commeth farre short of that perfection, which was intended, and would haue been performed by the Author, if God had not taken him away before that he could finish or reuise it: yet seeing for substance and matter, it is touching iustifying faith and sound repentance; without which none can be saued; neither doth any perish but by defect and error in these two: therefore is this discourse thereof most worthie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent perusall and consideration of all; who may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in finde a new discouerie of the manifold slights of the diuell, and deceits of the heart; whereby many men be cunningly cosoned of their saluation: and heere shall they haue vnfallible markes and sure direction, how both exactly to trie and certainly know the soundnes of their spirituall estates.</p>
   <p>The methode and phrase of this discourse is indeed plaine and familiar, fitted of purpose for the capacitie of the meaner sort of people; for whose good especially it was intended. For though the simpler sort cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand euen plaine things in an artificiall methode, briefly expressed in proper and quaint tearmes of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and art; yet people of better vnderstanding
<pb facs="9"/>
can easily conceiue profound things vnfolded but in an ordinarie phrase of speech, and vulgar order: it being farre easier for the stronger to yeeld and condescend to the weaker, then for the weaker to ascend, in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of their power, to the stronger: so that the same spirituall food is so diuersly to be dressed, that to the one it may bee strong meate, and to the other milke. In regard of the which plainnesse, with the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of truth, this treatise is the more to be esteemed; for that without all coloured masking, the naked truth is therein simply pronounded; with the pure beautie whereof al are to be enamoured: and seeing herein the Author hath more regarded the spirituall good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then to gaine any worldly respect to himselfe; it is not the lesse, but the more remarkable and worthie of esteeme.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, to come to the causes of publishing hereof,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I (to whom the Author vpon his death-bed did so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely bequeath this Treatise, as a poore orphan vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age, to bee wholly at my disposing) had no small doubt and conflict within my selfe, whether it were best to keepe it as a domesticke seruant in priuat, or to let it be made free and publique. Two reasons did much moue me to the former, first, respect to the Author, our reuerend friend, for that in this knowing age this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ortiue birth not perfected fully to answere either his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, or m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
      </gap>s expectation, might somewhat disparage him. Secondly, the many good and godly treatises al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie published vpon the same subiect, did deterre me from doing so with this, for that it seemed to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse; notwithstanding I haue bin perswaded to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, first, that I might cleerely manifest my fidelitie in
<pb facs="9"/>
that which was committed to my trust, for the vse and benefit of others, who both earnestly expected, and often flagitated the same from me as their owne, what or how euer it were. Secondly, that the Authors diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour and true intent not only while he liued, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so after his death, to edifie the Church of God might be euident to all, for the help and encouragement of others in all good courses: whereupon I haue surrendred this orphan vnto the naturall elder-brother of the same pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, by him to be sent abroad. The learnednes of the age is so farre from being any iust discouragement, that it is rather to be an encouragement to publish such ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie treatises, so long as they are orthodoxe for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though they doe want some ornaments of garnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, proceeding not from want of power in the Author, but of opportunitie in time; seeing that then there shall not want sufficient and equall Iudges, both by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of veritie, and also by the Chancerie of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, who will pleade for equitieâª for neuer true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but ignorance is an enemie to truth. The diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and multitude of seuerall treatises vpon one subiect, (so long as none of them is so absolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>â¢</desc>
      </gap>ly perfect, but that somewhat may be supplied by others thereunto, neither is any of them so vniuersally fit for all persons, times and places, but that according to diuersitie of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances they may be various) is no barre to exclude o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the same nature: for so long as they doe all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the same substance of truth, though they do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the manner of the frame, phrase, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the same, according to the varietie and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of the graces of Gods spirit in the Authors, and the diuers dispositions, manners, and opinions of seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="10"/>
people, in sundrie places and ages, to whom they doe write, thereby an vnanimious and vnde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>â¢</desc>
      </gap>iable testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is publiquely giuen to the truth; and the Church and people of God still built vp in goodnesse. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though there were sufficient alreadie written, if men would carefully vse it, and therewithall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; yet seeing that old bookes, like old garments, are in time neglected and despised; and the new coueted and read rather for the nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>â¢</desc>
      </gap>ltie of the edition, then for any newnesse of matter contained in them; it is not amisse so to renew bookes of the same things, for the spreading and continuing of the truth, euen as they say by new Phenixes rising out of the ashes of the old, their kind is still propagated. But blessed be God we do dwell in the land of <hi>Goshen,</hi> hauing the two great lights of preaching and printing, as the Sunne and Moone to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and comfort vs, in the seruile Egypt of this world: therefore while wee haue the light, oh how carefull should wee be as the children of light to walke in the light, that at the last we may raigne with God for euer, who dwelleth in light, which cannot be approched vnto; which the Father of mercies grant vnto vs. Amen.</p>
