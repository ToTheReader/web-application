   <head>TO THE NOBLE AND VERTVOVS LADY, THE LADY LVCIE, COVNTESSE of Bedford: And to the Right Honourable and highly honoured Lady, the Lady <hi>Anne Harrington,</hi> Barrones: mercy and peace be multiplied.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honourable:</hi> The holy Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diuers subiects he had to worke vpon in his ministeriall function) is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced sometimes with <hi>Isaiah,</hi> his fore-runner,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.1.</note> to lift vp his voice like vnto a <hi>Sonne of Thunder;</hi> and eftsoones, with the same Prophet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to altar and change the same, into the still, and soft voice of a <hi>Sonne of Consolation:</hi> wherein,<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.12.</note> as Gods faithfull messenger, hee carries himselfe faithfully. For as a <hi>Sonne of Thunder,</hi> he sharply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyes against the sinnes, and sinners of his time; boldly denouncing Gods iudgements against them: and as a <hi>Sonne of consolation,</hi> (for their sakes whom the Lord had appointed to bee heires of saluation) hee sweetly preacheth Christ: mixing
<pb facs="3"/> often with the terrible threats of the Law, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing promises of the Gospell. That if any came by the ministery of the one,<note place="margin">Act. 2.37.</note> to be pricked in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and humbled: he readily, like the good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan, powreth in the mollifying and healing oyle of the other, to cure and reuiue them. And thus as a wise disposer, and dispenser of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold secrets of God,<note place="margin">Psalm. 101.1.</note> his song (in a maner) through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Prophesie (like <hi>Aarons</hi> Bels) soundeth forth iudgement and mercy:<note place="margin">Exod. 28.33.</note> preaching iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to such as were,<note place="margin">Isa. 33.14.</note> &amp; would be sinners in Sion, and mercy to such as he saw to to be mourners in Siō.<note place="margin">Isa. 61.3.</note> In which respects he may serue as a liuely pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for all Preachers to follow, in their ordinary course of preaching. These Sermons of his (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them) doe notably sute to our times; and therefore ought to be read, and read againe, of all estates, high and low.</p>
   <p>But for as much as in reading the Prophets, sundry difficulties are met withall, which euery one hath not the skill of himselfe to dissolue; it would (as I thinke) be very beneficiall for such, if they had an holy helper, such an one as this, ready at hand:<note place="margin">Iob 33.23.</note>
      <hi>An interpreter: One</hi> (indeed) <hi>of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;</hi> that might helpe to dissolue their doubts, and vnloose their hard knots for them: That so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding what they read, they might (by the blessing of God) with the more ease come to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by their reading.<note place="margin">Act. 8.34.35</note> This hath our <hi>Philip</hi> faithfully performed (according to that light of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wherewith the Lord had extraordinarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed him) throughout the Prophets: and pity
<pb facs="3"/> it is, that so great light should after a sort lie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in darknesse, from many well minded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; onely because they are not (as they might be) turned into our owne natiue language.</p>
   <p>Not many yeeres since, a Lampe (if I may so speake) began to be kindled, for giuing them some insight into the harder passages of the Prophets; by translating this Authors Commentaries vpon the Prophesie of <hi>Isaiah</hi> into English: but much more cleere would the light haue now shined, if thereunto had been added the translation of all his Lectures vpon the Prophesie of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> also. For mine owne part, seeing sufficiency of oyle hath failed me, to furnish out this second Lampe vnto the end; I haue for the present proceeded onely through the fiue first Chapters.</p>
   <p>The which (Right Honourable) as a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that seruice and duty I owe your Honours; I haue presumed (as one ouertaken with <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> his hast, somwhat abruptly I confesse) to dedicate vnto you. And if in token of your fauourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance thereof, you shall be pleased to suffer the same to passe, vnder your Honourable names, and patronage; many may be occasioned thereby to blesse God for you: and my selfe still to pray, that the blessing of him who was ready to perish, may come vpon you.</p>
