   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is good for men oftentimes to call to minde those testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which eyther do compell them, or allure them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto the doctrine which GOD hath especially deliuered vnto his church, and doth perseuer therein: of which sort are Myracles, Antiquity a kind of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, a myraculous preseruation thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst the ruines of Empyres, the constancy of confessors, and pledge of Gods spirite in the hart.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>In the first place, are reckoned Miracles, which are wonders done beyond the course of nature; for although the whole course of of nature be both a witnes and a warning of God, yet when he preferred his doctrine, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially that which goeth beyonde the sight of reason; he added singuler deedes beyond the course of nature, that it might be known not to be deuised by man, but set foorth by the guider of nature, and a most mightie cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, being distinct frō the opinions of other nations: which miracles do boast of certaine of our owne Miracles: but there are other Miracles peculier to the church not to be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitated by any creature: as raising the dead, to stay the course of the sun, the going backe of the sun, a virgine to be with childe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers such like. These God would haue vs to looke vpon, that wee mighte bee throughlie perswaded that the doctrine is giuen by the very ruler of nature. Among the miracles, I also account the prophetes, forsayinges of of Empires, &amp; other affaires, which the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of no creature could certainlye forsee: for in that the euent hath been aunswearable vnto them, we must confesse that those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayings were manifested by that diuine spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that knoweth all thinges.</p>
   <p>In the 2. place, is antiquitie named, which albeit, that it doth not conuince as miracles <pb facs="4"/>do, yet doth it alure the mindes of men: for it is likely that God should from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing haue laide open himselfe, and haue been of this mind, that amōgst men there shuld be alwaies some of whom he might be truelye known, and not that al mankind as wretched shuld from y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> begining be made, only for eter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal destructiō. Therfore, comfortable is that former age, and well is that spoken by Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulian. Whatsoeuer is most auncient, is most true: In like maner, doth <hi>Iustinus</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> confute the <hi>Ethnickes:</hi> that seeing the doctrine of the Church is more ancient then the opinions of the Ethnickes, the oppinions that do gain-say it are to be reiected, &amp; that the bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> are of more antiquitie then the writinges of the heathens, the very order of times &amp; Empires do make manifest For no Nation hath a certain obseruation of yeeres from the begining, as haue the Ecle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical books: the names of the heathens do also shew, that the monuments of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Church are more auncient, for that the Grecians doe retaine the names of <hi>Iapetus, Ioue, Aeolus,</hi> and many others, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whence they sprong: but when the storie of <hi>Moses</hi> doth shew their kindred, we must needes confesse, that it is more auncient then the monuments of the Greekes: a mightie &amp; <pb facs="5"/>a famous people was that of the <hi>Imerians,</hi> whose posteritie without all doubt, was the Cimbrians, but their stocke your Greekes know not, which the some of the word doth shew to be <hi>Gomer</hi> the son of <hi>Iaphet.</hi> Nowe there is a kindered among the Egiptians, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their naturall speech, and in the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian tongue,
<hi>Mizrai,</hi> but bookes doe shew <hi>Nizraim</hi> to be the son of
<hi>Cham,</hi> the first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient among the Greekes, were the wars of the Argonians, and then of the Troianes, but the time &amp; course of yeers, which the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians themselues haue obserued, doth shewe that the Troiane warre was not long before <hi>Dauid,</hi> and that <hi>Hercules</hi> was almost of the same time with Sapson: So the names &amp; histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the heathen do testifie, that the books of the church are the more auncient, which is very necessarie for the studious to consider.</p>
   <p>In the third place, wee haue set a kinde of doctrine, whereof there are two partes, the Law and the Gospell, and seeing that the knowledg of the law is graffted in the minds of all men, reason in all men is inforced to confesse, that it is impossible for any nation to be the people of God, which do establish lawes, contrary to the law of God: but this is the common madnes of all the Gentils, to call vpon a multitude of Gods, and to deuise <pb facs="5"/>monstrous fables of the gods, and euen in their lawes to yeeld vnto the filthy confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of lust. Some of them also, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of men, whordoms and adulteries, haue bin thought a good seruing of God. Reason therfore enforceth to confesse, that in the church, the law is taught much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This argument also, the olde writers haue vsed in confuting the heathen: and howsoeuer the Gospel be not knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reason, yet doth it lay open those things whereof the doctrine of the heathen can speake no certainty: and yet it cannot bee denied, but that the vnderstanding of thē is necessary; forsomuch as man is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, and is made to knowe and praise the Lorde. From whence come so many doubtes in the disagreements of the minde and hart? whence is that stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the hart, and such a burning desire to sin, seeing that y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> law shineth in y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> mind? Are men made to liue in euerlasting sin &amp; mysery? what is sin, &amp; whence comes that vast heap of humane myserye? whence are those so manye dissentions about God, as whether god doeth heare men, or why hee shuld regard them. Whether after y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> bodies are once dead, there shalbe another life; in which shalbe a differēce betweene good &amp; bad?</p>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <p>What, men are Gods temple who he doth heare and helpe. Of these so waighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what great darknesse is there in all the wisedome of the heathen? Howe many fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Phylosophers, who like the sons of
<hi>Tytan</hi> make war with heauen: eyther imagining that there is no prouidence, or being God to secondary causes, and labour to proue that al sins are of necessity.</p>
   <p>Seeing therfore we must confesse, that the doctrine of the causes and remedies of euil is necessary for men; and yet the wisdome of the heathen seeth it not truly, let vs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Gods voice in the church, seeing hee hath added great testimony therunto Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son acknowledgeth, that the law is no wher purely deliuered but in the church. And seeing it is certaine that the voice of God is there, let vs heare this doctrin of which the Heathen are inforced to confesse, that ther is great ignorance in their religion and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: and yet the opening of these questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are necessarye for the knowing of God (for the which man was made) and for true comfort. Therefore that kind of doctrine in the Church, is most delightfull to good mindes, when the pure fountaines are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of tasted. I account not in the Church the Romane tyrants, and the Monks their chā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, <pb facs="6"/>who haue dispersed throughout the world their filthy poison, for the doctrine of the sonne of God, and haue transformed the doctrine of the church, into heathenish opinions. They pray vnto the dead men, they command men to worship their brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den God, which they carry about in theyr great solemnity: they sel sacrifices for the quicke and dead: they make Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship stage-like vestures, and other delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and confirme their rouing lusts. This wicked rout, I cal not the church, but them which deliuer the sounde doctrine of God, deliuered in the bookes of the Prophets &amp; Apostles, and in the Creeds. Many others also doe corrupt the simple truth, and the sleights in disputing are delightful to som: as in time past, to the Stoicks, Epicures, &amp; Academicks. But when wee commende this kind of doctrine, we do exclude al cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption and toyes in vaine disputings.</p>
   <p>In the 4. place, we account the wonder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful preseruation of the church, in the midst of the ruines of Empires: which although it may be gathered vnder the first testimony that is among myracles, yet in this it differs from the former, bicause it is a perpetual mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the continuall presence of God, &amp; pertains to that special rule. The worde of
<pb facs="7"/>the Lord abideth for euer, and not by the helpe of man, as it is written, <hi>Not in an host nor in strength, but in my spirit,</hi> saith the lord God of boasts.</p>
   <p>In the 5. place, is the constancy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors accounted, which confirm others 2 waies. First, bicause it is a mannes myracle, wherin God strengthens the weak against fear &amp; punishments, &amp; shews his presents many waies, euen in their suffrings. Many simple men haue raised the dead, and done many wonders. 2. Bicause the high minds in such as quietly bear affliction, doth shew the gospel is powerfull in them, &amp; that it is the seed of god, as <hi>Iohn</hi> saith: <hi>wherby eternal life, righteousnes and ioy is begun in them.</hi> 6, This testimony of the gospel in the faithful doth plainly conuince their minds: namely, the comfort and ioy which is kindled in thē by the holy ghost (wherof
<hi>Paul</hi> saieth, you haue receiued the holy spirit, whereby wee cry
<hi>abb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> father</hi>) whereby they see, howe in great sorrowe they are comforted, which vphold themselues with meditation of the Gospel &amp; with prayer, as
<hi>Paule</hi> saith, <hi>The spirit helpeth our infirmity.</hi> These testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies must be often thought on, &amp; especially let vs be careful of the sixt, least it be taken from vs by the illusions of mad men: as the <pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>Anabap.</hi> &amp;c <hi>Steukfeldians</hi> boast of false in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations: who setting apart Gods worde, pretend their reuellations, as I haue found out the lies of many such, &amp; the examples of <hi>Munster</hi> shewes the maliciousnes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Steukfild writeth, that God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with mens minds, without any means: from whence he proues the diuine motions are kindled, not by meditation of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doctrin, but by a faming of heauinesse. If with their speech they mixe fained sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Crocodiles teares, &amp; other legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines deuised by Art, amongst y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which slanders &amp; strange positions, doe specially increase their authority. As <hi>Sebastian</hi> the Frenchmā reuiled the teachers, and called a great volume of the sayings of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> prophets &amp; apost. which in shew seemed not to agre. From whence he gathred, that we must not iudge after the letter, but as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> spirit directs. And in their Paradoxes they insert thinges to please people, &amp; inlarge licentiousnesse. Some there are which carry about with them the books of <hi>Sibils,</hi> whence they take such Oracles as best befit theyr affections, whom they flatter. This kind of Idol priest must be taken heed of, &amp; that rule is firme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to be held, <hi>Thy word is a lantern vnto my feet.</hi> And againe, To the Lawe and the <pb facs="8"/>testimony. And againe, The Gospel is the power of God vnto saluation to euery one that beleeueth: and those deceiuers are not to be harkened vnto, which crye out, that inspirations must else-where be sought for, without thinking of the holy worde. The saying of the sonne of God must bee helde fast, whoe commandeth to preach repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; forgiuenes of sins in his name. To this end let our teaching be applyed: that repentance, faith prayer and newe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may increase in vs, by the meditation of Gods word, and let god be praised with true duties, according, to that saying: <hi>Fight thou a good fight, holding fast faith &amp; a good conscience.</hi> For traps may be laide by men by the aduancing of Inspiratiōs as we haue often seene. By this meanes, as by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment the people discerned of sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Therfore the sonne is sent to reueale vnto all creatures, the secret and vnknown promise of reconciliation, and that it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard, faith might be wrought in men, and God might communicate himself with vs, as <hi>Paule</hi> saieth: <hi>Faith is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> Wherfore these Idol priests of <hi>Cibel,</hi> which withdraw mens mindes from the written word, do reproch the son of God, and take away both faith,
<pb facs="8"/>and al the exercise of faith.</p>
   <p>If the writinges of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles were taken away, so that euery hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite might lawfully brotch his counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait Oracles from his inspirations, as from his three footed seate: howe great furies would ensue? We haue seen example heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the Tragedies of <hi>Munster</hi> &amp; elswher. Wherefore all holye teachers and hearers, with al constancy, ought to set themselues against these doting deuises.</p>
   <p>Thy purpose and indeuour therefore (O <hi>Peter</hi>) I do commend, that thou art an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of all the godly vnto reading. As
<hi>Paule</hi> saith: <hi>Be conuersant in reading,</hi> she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the way to euery book, &amp; declaring the arguments of them. I woulde to God that our youth were accustomed rather to reading &amp; godly praier, then to cauilles in disputing: for when matters are well ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and no kind of false doctrine approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, there should be an end of disputing; and it is a most true saying: that to playe the Sycophant is too great diligence.</p>
   <p>And whereas, by the wisedome of your noble King, and the diligence of godly tea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chers in your kingdom, the studies of your youth are so ordered, that no liberty to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill <pb facs="9"/>is permitted vnto them. You haue wel prouided for the peace of the church; and their wits are accustomed to modesty. All things though wel deliuered, may be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, if cauels may be regarded; as in time past were those of the
<hi>Pirchonians,</hi> and the <hi>Academicks.</hi> Therfore <hi>Paule</hi> doth strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge the <hi>Phillippians,</hi> to hold faste the Canon or the rule of the word.</p>
   <closer>Now I beseech the Sonne of God our Lords Iesus Christ, to keepe and to gouerne the churches in the kingdome of the Danes, and in Germany, and to make them to abide for euer one in him.</closer>
