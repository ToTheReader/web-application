                 <title>Christian offices crystall glasse : In three bookes. First written in Latine, by that famous and renowned Father, Saint Ambrose Bishop of Millane. Whereunto is added his conuiction of Symmachus the Gentile. A worke tending to the advancement of vertue, and of holinesse: and to shew how much the morality of the Gentiles, is exceeded by the doctrine of Christianity.

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE difficultie of this taske of translation (Christian Reader) is not well knowne to any, but to such, as haue throughly tasted of it by experience: The translation of the fathers is rare, and such as hath seldome beene vndertaken and least of all of this our author, because of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusenesse of his style. For neither is it<note n="a" place="margin">Non flaccidus, nec hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milis. <hi>Erasmus.</hi>
      </note> langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing without vigour, nor poore,<note n="b" place="margin">Hierom de Spiritu <hi>S<seg rend="sup">to</seg>.</hi>
      </note> and naked, but as it is worthily answered by the<note n="c" place="margin">S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. Augustin.</note> worthiest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in his behalfe though it be more demisse, yet such as well sorteth with those great, and deepe mysteries. But euen there, no lesse then else-where, when the matter requireth it, and cheifly in his books <hi>de viduis et virginibus,</hi> he hath his <hi>aculeos,</hi> pricketh forward the reader to try his wits, and beate his braines not a little to find out his meaning: and so it fareth with vs in this peice of worke. If any man make a question hereof, let him read over the last chapter of the first booke or that against<note n="d" place="margin">Which hath beene the cause that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary paines hath beene spent about it both to cleare the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties therein &amp; to inlarge the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
      <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi> and accordingly passe his verdict concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the residue. He breaketh not out into tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call passions with <hi>Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Hilarie,</hi> but goeth on in an argute, and sharpe, pleasantnesse<note n="e" place="margin">Est quem non omnino si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne causa mellistuum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorem vocant. <hi>Erasm.</hi>
      </note> of speech: the whole frame whereof is checker-worke
<pb facs="187"/> like a great deale of matter wrapped vp in a little roome, which is <hi>Senecaes</hi> high delight. Some times the whole furniture of his collections, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether sententious, <hi>Epiphonema</hi> is frequent with him, and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: the one is powerfull to peirce the conscience, the other implicate, to set wits on worke, the one quicke, and quaint, the other curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and cunning, which the more intricate it is, the more acceptable is it reputed. Pithy, persuasive compendious aboue all other formes of speech are interrogative points: of these almost are his whole volumes compounded. He is full of piety, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mystery in all variety every where, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially here, where occasion is offered him to touch all sorts of morall subjects, which was one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall inducement to move me to pitch my labours vpon it, as a prime worke: yet so, that this part like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is covered oftentimes with the mists, and cloud of much obscurity, and<note n="f" place="margin">The cause of obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is his concisenesse according to that of the Poet, <hi>dum brevis esse laboro, obscurus fio,</hi> which to cleare, and to make the text more evidently to cohere together, was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to the many and more large margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall notes.</note> the sence so shadowed, and cast over eftsoones throughout the same: that some <hi>Ariadne</hi> is still wanting to get <hi>Theseus</hi> out of the streights, some <hi>Aaron</hi> to lay out more clearely <hi>Moses</hi> meaning. What is done herein, I submit my selfe to the censure of the learned, nothing regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the virulent tongues of the enemies of all such pious indeauours. I was not so carefull at the first evermore to tye my selfe strictly to the words but rather to the meaning,<note n="g" place="margin">
         <hi>Non verbo verbum curabis reddere fidus Interpres; nec desilies i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitator in arctum, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. in Arte Poët.</hi> may give some liberty of inlargement in point of obscurity. Yet I know that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames lye on both sides, which is the cause of the often putting downe his words in the margin in his own tongue, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the better perceive it, and beare with me, choosing rather to reteine them though they may seem harsh &amp; strange then not to hold me narrowly to what I vndertake: that of S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
         <hi>Hierome</hi> which followeth, is not against this, but against the taking the Scripture alwayes according to the literall sense, as for example in the participation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the supper. For who so take it deceiue themselues. <hi>Qui verbo tenus corde fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci et mente aridi sacris participant donis, lambunt quidem petram, sed inde mel non sugunt Sic Cypr. sermone de caena Dom.</hi>

      <hi>foolishly vnderstood is not the word of God</hi> I haue studied rightly to vnderstand my author, and haue rendred him thereafter: so that hee hath lost little I hope of his beauty in the substance, though peradventure comming forth in a new and vnwon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted suite stripped of his ornaments of a better dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and thrust out of his owne element, he may seeme to be another, and not the same. I haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a supply to some few chapters, and likewise to some few points partly from other places of his owne workes where I found him more plentifull to that purpose. He following the <hi>Septuagints,</hi> I haue laboured, as appeareth eft-soones in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, to reconcile the same with the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the difference much betweene these being advisedly observed. <hi>Melancthon</hi> out of his matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of judgement saw it to bee so, and that in the matterials they both agree. Likewise acute and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious <hi>Iunius</hi> by invincible arguments convinceth it to be so in his paraphrase. The mouth of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <seg rend="sup">l</seg> and mirror of Antiquity next to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive easily reconcileth the great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> texts<note n="m" place="margin">Ion. 3.4.</note> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Nineves</hi> destruction.

      <hi>was delivered to death for our sinnes, rose againe for our justification.</hi> For the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of our Lord is knowne to bee both in the resurrection, and ascention, whereof the one was after three dayes, the other after fortie. Let vs not
<pb facs="188"/> say therefore one of these to be false, neither let us be litigious herein for one interpretation against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when both they which interpret out of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> doe confirme vnto us, that to be written which they deliver vs, and when also the authority of the <hi>Septuagints,</hi> which we have commended to us by divine<note n="o" place="margin">

It is strange that the name of a <hi>Father</hi> should worke such contrary effects to that it importeth. For what else doth it import, but a leader, and guide in the way of veritie, and piety. Next to the foundation of the prophets, and Apostles, are the Fathers, and Councels in their times for 600. yeares after Christ produced of the worthies, and walls of our church, as vouchers of our doctrines.

It is overwhelmed with vanity, covered with injustice, it swarmeth with intemperance, lyeth naked, and is stripped of zeale, fortitude, courage, and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in the cause of the maintenance of thine honour, of syncere doctrine, vertuous life, true practise after much profession, many religious exercises, and peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing multitudes of godly bookes. We acknowledge that this increaseth our sinne, heapeth an heavier judgement upon us, with-holdeth thy love from us, and incenseth thine indignation, when wee bring not forth answerable fruits. Adde therefore we beseech thee (deare Saviour) the fire of thy Spirit to warme our affections, and by the flames thereof so kindle our spirits, that we may bee moved forward with a fervent affection in the way of a pious conversation abounding in all manner of good workes for the great glory of thy Name, the credit of our profession, the continuance of thy Gospell, the turning away of thy judgements long threatned, yet hitherto in thy unspeakable mercy with-held from us. And because
<pb facs="190"/> of thine inexplicable love toward us, and merits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that we are able to aske, or thinke, with thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father for us, our humble duty also binding us thereunto, stirre us up through the fervency of the same spirit of strength, to seeke continually at thy mercifull hands by hearty, and earnest praier, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of thy speciall blessings upon thine anointed, the breath of our nostrels King <hi>Charles,</hi> with his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all consort, upon Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> the rest of the royall Progeny; the Princesse <hi>Palatine</hi> likewise, and her Princely issue; upō the house of <hi>Levi,</hi> and the whole Common-weale of this kingdome from the highest to the lowest. Incite us we instantly pray thee in the last place, but not with our least, but best remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance unto all thankfulnesse for thy primarie mercy unto us for the same, our most religious, and vertuous <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> &amp; the continuance of the pretious jewell of thy Gospell under him our gratious Soveraigne. Cause us in sincerity of soule, in a burning desire, and indevour to render for both these (then the which nothing in the world can be greater) not unmindfull of whatsoever benefit beside, to thee our only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, with the whole undividable most sacred Trinity, one in Nature, three in Person, (infinitely worthy to receive of the whole familie in heaven, and earth, of Angels, men, and all creatures,) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting honour, and glory immortall praise, and benediction. <hi>Amen.</hi>
