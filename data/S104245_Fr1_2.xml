Ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cepte he wyll denye vtterlye Christe to be Christe and the Gospel to be trewe. If there be any suche (as there hath ben in dede: and I feare me there be many: whiche louynge the Deuyll as well as the Gospell wyll put awaye theyr ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes: yf they maye knowe that they do but ons smatter therof) such I wold wyssh to be banyshed foor from al mens company: suche wolde I desyre to be in lowe auctoritie &amp; rule: that they might do lytell harme or none, I wolde wisshe (I saye) that God of hys infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye wolde open theyr eyes that they myghte se the lyghte of theyr saluation that theyr eyes shoulde be nomore blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the phantasies and auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men.</p>
   <p>¶ Thys worke bycause the learned as well as the vnlearned myghte be full in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>structed and ledde as it were by a lyne to the perfecte knowledge and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standynge
<pb n="vii" facs="7"/>
of thys proposition. Onely faythe iustyfyethe. Therefore it is de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyded into foure partes.</p>
   <p>¶ The fyrste conteynethe the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyon of this vocable and word Iustice howe it is taken in the Phylosophers and howe with the Gospell, and what they be bothe in effecte, shewynge what the lawe of God doth requyre of vs: and what we can perfourme of oure owne selfes. And at the laste what remedy by what meanes is to be hadde for oure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmytye.</p>
   <p>¶ The seconde parte doethe teache the ryghte vnderstandynge of these voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and wordes. The lawe, the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, Synne, Iustification, Grace, and faythe, howe and in what maner after the sincere doctryn of the Gospel euery one of these vocables must be taken. The blyndnes and ignoraunce wherof: hath broughte so greate darkenesse into the worlde: that the cleare bryghtnesse of the Gospel coulde nat be perceyued: but made darke, clowdye, and so mysty that men hadde no lyst to haue the worde of God in theyr handes, as a thynge most asperous and bytter and fore frome all comforte. The whiche thinge did cause the vngracious and peruerse maner of
<pb facs="8"/>
interpretacion of the sayde vocables and wordes contrary to the ryght sence and meanynge of them. The ryghte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandynge and meaninge therof per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyued and knowen: that whiche semyd before darke and cloudye, shall appeare nowe bryghte, shynynge, lyke the sonne as cleare as any Christall: that whiche was harde and rogged: shall be founde softe and tender: and fynally, which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myd to be as bitter as Gall, shalbe more swete then any Honye. So great an all teratyon shall the worde of God brynge with it.</p>
   <p>❧ And bycause that the Papystes do beat into the heades of the simple plain and vnlearned people to styrre them to the hatred of the worde of God, sayeng and beatynge theyr handes that these newe felowes they do teache no good workes: they bydde you do no more but beleue, and you shall be saued, lyue you neuer so licensiously, so lewdly. To cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them therfore of theyr most deue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshe malice and open sclaunder in the thyrde parte he speaketh and teachethe good workes, what workes, and howe they muste be done, howe they shalbe pleasaunt and acceptable to God. The whiche workes he callethe a Christian

   <p>¶ In the fourthe and laste parte, lyke a moost diligent Scholemayster, be set<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tethe forthe one after an other all theyr Sophistical cauillations and croked ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gumentes, where with they myght de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue and begyle a ryghte good clerke that bothe you maye knowe what they be, and howe they are to be dissolued and put awaye, whiche thynge shall be very necessary to be marked, that when men do heare them in theyr reasonynge wryenge and wrastynge the woorde of god, thei may stop theyr mouthes with the ryghte vnderstandynge of it, that at the laste they shalbe ashamed to brynge anye more suche durte before men. At thys poynt this Godly clerke finisheth his worke very profytable and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye for all men.
