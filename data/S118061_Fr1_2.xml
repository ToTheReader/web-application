   <head>ROVLAND HALL TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>THere be thre causes specially that moueth me to printe these sermons of maister Ihon Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine the faithful seruant of god and the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of our time. Th'one is the worthines of the mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter set furth in these sermons. The other is the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and simplicitie that thys great clarke vseth in all his sermons to the people. The third is the reuerent handling of the scriptures, without tauntes, skoffes, or iestes, or any trifling tales, wherby our english na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion may se &amp; iudge what power the word of god hath of it self, whē it is most naked &amp; bare and void of that painted sheathe that men would put vpon it. The matter is mete for al men to know, and stan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth in these foure pointes. Fyrst, there is a generall admonicion to flye idolatry. Secondly an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to folow Christ in suffering of persecution, and bearing of the crosse. Thirdlye the liberty to serue god, and the cōmoditie to liue in the church of god is commended. Fourthly with how great paines &amp; care this liberty to worship god purely in som chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sten congregation oght to be soght for and desired of all christians, is described. And for a conclusion there is addded the exposition of the .87. psalme, which teacheth that the church of god thogh it seme miserable in this world, yet doth it excel al the kyngdoms of the earth because god loueth it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth it, stablisheth it, multiplieth it, and taketh the count and numbre of his elect people out of it.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>Concernyng the second poynt. The simplicitie is such, as our Sauiour Christ and hys apostles vsed in their sermons, of the which sainct Paule speaketh to the Corinthiās, saying that he came not with ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellencie of wordes, or of mans wisedome to shew vnto them the testimonie of God, lest the crosse of Christ and the power of God workyng thereby sholde be of none effect, whyles men should attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute that to eloquence which only is wrought by the spirite of god in the heartes of the faythful.</p>
   <p>For the thyrd: he obserueth the precept of sainct Peter. Yf any man speake, let him speake as the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of God So that all hys sermons seme nothyng els but the swete licour of the scriptures and liuely word of god set furthe before our eyes in Christal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line vessels to entice vs to beholde them and to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoke vs to tast and to smel of these lycours of lyfe whiche he brocheth vnto vs of that abundance which god hath geuē vnto him in these our times. God grant vs grace thankefully to receyue Gods good gyftes in this and all other thynges offered vnto vs. So be it.</p>
