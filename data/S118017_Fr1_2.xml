   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing about (by the grace of God) to cleare some difficulties, and to collect a few observations from some verses of this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel written by S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> it will not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, first of all, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve a generall question or two. Our first question then shall be this.</p>
   <p>
      <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>1</label> How this Booke or any other may bee knowne to be the divine word of God, dictated by the Holy Spirit of God, and not the humour or fancy of a private, erring spirit.</p>
   <p>
      <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
      </label> I answer, Scripture is knowne to be <hi>Scripture,</hi> and canonicall bookes are knowne to bee such by these proofes; properties, &amp; infallible markes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> First, by the evidence of the Spirit imprinted in the Scriptures, and shewing it selfe in every line of them: or the testimonies of the Scripture it self, that is, the testimony of God speaking unto us in the Scriptures, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. <hi>This is the word of Faith which we preach.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 10.8.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Secondly, the purity and perfection of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> sheweth it to bee Canonicall: For they teach nothing but truth, and teach all truths necessary unto salvation: They are both pure and perfect.<note place="margin">Psal. 19.8, 9.</note>
      <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.8.9. First pure, they being a doctrine according to holines, a rule to direct our waies in righteousnesse, all the exhortations and examples therein tending thereto. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are perfectly holy in themselves, and by themselves; whereas all other writings are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, farther then they draw holinesse from these, which yet is never such but that their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse is imperfect, and defective (<hi>Prov.</hi> 8.8. and 30.5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 12.7.) But the Scriptures are perfectly profitable in themselves to instruct unto salvation.<note n="a" place="margin">Iames 1.21.</note> All other writings are utterly unprofitable thereunto, any further, then they draw from them: yea they containe full and perfect Doctrine, for the pacifying, setling and directing of the conscience in all things. Many Histories shew us the heavy wrath of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on man for sinne: but the <hi>Scriptures</hi> onely shew us <hi>Morbu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>, medicin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>, &amp; medic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
            <desc>•••</desc>
         </gap>.</hi> That is both the sickenesse, the physicke, and the Physitian to cure it.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly the consent of one part with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ere being a perfect concord and harmony in all the Bookes both of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament; notwithstanding the diversity of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>by whom,</hi> the places <hi>where,</hi> the times <hi>when,</hi> and matters <hi>whereof</hi> they have beene written.<note n="b" place="margin">Acts 26.22.</note> There may seeme some contradiction amongst the writers of holy Scripture, but indeed there is none, but a perfect harmonie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we see the heathen history, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall bookes contradicting the holy history, we should stand for the holy Scripture against them: but when we see any appearance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in holy writ, we should labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile it. When <hi>Moses</hi> saw an Aegyptian and an Israelite striving together, hee killed the Aegyptian, and saved the Israelite,<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 2.12.</note> but when he saw two Israelites striving together, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to reconcile them, saying, <hi>Yee are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, why doe ye strive.</hi> So when we see heathen History, to contradict the Scriptures, we should kill the Aegyptian, and save the Israelite: as for example, <hi>Iacob</hi> cursed <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> for murthering of the <hi>Sichemites</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 49.7.</note> But <hi>Iudith</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Simeon</hi> for killing of them, <hi>Iudith</hi> 9. So <hi>Ieremiah</hi> saith, <hi>They shall returne in the third gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
      <note n="e" place="margin">Ierem. 27 7.</note> But <hi>Baruch</hi> saith, <hi>They shall returne in the seaventh generation, Baruch</hi> 6. Here let us kill the Aegyptian, but save the Israelite: but when we see any appearance of contradiction in the holy Scriptures, we should labour to reconcile them, because they are brethren. <hi>Weemse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Fourthly, the antiquitie of it: the Scripture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> being the most ancient of all Histories: from the creation of the world to the flood, was to the heathen <hi>Tempus</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, a hid &amp; unknowne time: there being no humane Historyes of any thing before the flood: but the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne at the beginning of the world, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the History of the world, unto the flood. Againe, from the flood to the <hi>Olimpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ds</hi> of the Grecians (which began but in the dayes of <hi>Vzziah</hi>) was unto the heathen <hi>tempus</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> a fabulous time, and all their Histories of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules Prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>thine,</hi> and the rest being but lying and forged tales: but the Scriptures goe on, setting downe unto us the History of the Church, from the stood even unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ. Thus we see how farre Gods word exceedeth humane writings in antiquitie: it beginneth with the world.<note n="f" place="margin">Luke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>

      <hi>For the world of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Fiftly the Majesty of it in plainnesse of speech; the Scriptures seeme at the first view, to bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> very plaine, but at a full sight are full of Majesty above all other writings.<note n="h" place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> Cor. 1.17, 18.21.24. and 2.15. 1 Tim. 5.21.</note> Thus their plaine and cleere manner of setting downe things sheweth them to be Divine.<note n="i" place="margin">Esa. 8.1.</note>
      <hi>Take a great roule and writ in it with a mans pen, Behhoret Enosh,</hi> that is cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the simplest among man may understand it, so<note n="k" place="margin">Deu. 30.11.</note>
      <hi>This Commandement which I command thee this day is nor hidden from thee, neither is it far off,</hi> In the Hebrew it is <hi>Lo niphleeth, non separatum a te. i. e.</hi> It is not separated from thy knowledge, that thou canst not understand it: neither is it farre from thee, those things which are obscure, which wee cannot take up, are said to be farre from us, and those things which we understand are said to be neare us.<note n="l" place="margin">Rom. 10.8.</note> Sixtly, the power and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> force, it hath over the conscience: it makes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the stoutest hearer with <hi>Faelix</hi> tremble, and the most stubborne with the souldiers cry out, <hi>Men and brethren what shall wee doe to be saved?</hi> Although it bee contrarie to mans corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet hath it in all ages won some unto it, wheresoever it came: and by an admirable force inclining their hearts from vice to vertue. <hi>The Spirit in us lusteth after envie, but the Scriptures gives more grace</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> 19.7. Hebr. 4.12</note> that is the Scriptures offer grace and abilitie to doe more, then nature can doe: Nature cannot heale a spirit that lusteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter envy, or after money, or after uncleannesse:<note n="b" place="margin">Iames 4.5, 6.</note> but the Scripture offer more grace to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come any of these sinnes, bee they never so strong.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Seventhly, the certaine prophecies of things to come, which none but God could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> Eightly, the admirable preservation of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst time &amp; tyrants: many other books have beene written which now are lost, or falsifyed, or grosly corrupted: but the Lord by a speciall providence hath still preserved the fountain of the Scripture <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>entire:</hi> Thus God by his especial care of them, shews them to be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then his divine Oracles.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Ninthly, the Divells rage against those that desire and endeavour, to regulate, and moderate their conversations according unto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: those that walke contrarie unto them he keepes in peace<note n="c" place="margin">Luke 11.22.</note> and persecutes with war, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and rage, onely <hi>The woman and her seed,</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Apoc. 12.13.15.17.</note> who conforme themselves according to the will of God manifested unto them in his word.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> Tenthly, the judgement of God upon those that have opposed it, and the professors of it: as might bee proved by innumerable examples ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from all ages: to instance but only upon the ten bloody persecutors, none of them escaping hence out of this life, without a stroke of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and some remarkeable iudgement.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> Eleventhly, the constant, couragious, and cheerefull sufferings of many millions of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, who have shed their bloud for the Gospel of Christ, and truth of God.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> Twelftly, a gracious simplicitie in the writers of these bookes of the Old and New Testament, neither fearing their friendes, nor themselves, but most freely and impartially setting downe their owne faults and infirmities, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, testifying thereby, that in writing they were guyded by the Spirit of God, and of truth.</p>
   <p>Thirteenthly, the evi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ence of Gods Spirit, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> working in the hearts of his Children, assuring them that the Scriptures are the word of God, whereunto they may safely leane, without the least feare or suspicion of error.<note n="e" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.9.1.</note>
      <hi>We have a more sure word of Prophesie, whereunto you doe well that yee take heed, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Againe, The bookes of Scripture containe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> many mysteries above the reach of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, although not against reason, because wee may discerne a truth in them, and that by groundes and principles of reason. Againe, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> speeches of Scripture aime not at by respects, but simply and absolutely give and ascribe all glory unto God alone: and above all things perswade us to seeke the glory of God, making that the end and aime, and primary scope of all our actions.</p>
   <p>Againe, a reconciliation of <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> propounded in the Gospell, both which meete sweetly in Christ: <hi>Iustice</hi> (as it were) in a sort giving place unto <hi>Mercy.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Againe, the heavenly order set downe and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> observed in Scripture, shew them to be divine: there is in the Scripture a fourefold order. 1. <hi>Ordo naturae,</hi> 2. <hi>ordo coniugalis thori,</hi> 3. <hi>ordo histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, &amp;</hi> 4 <hi>ordo dignitatis:</hi> An order of nature, of marriage, of history, and of dignity; all which orders the Scripture marks, and for sundry rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons setteth one before another, first in setting down the Patriarkes, it observeth the order of nature, as they were borne: As first <hi>Reuben,</hi> then <hi>Simeon,</hi> then <hi>Levi,</hi> then <hi>Iudah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Secondly, there is <hi>Ordo coniugalis thori,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their birthes; and so the children of free women were set first. Thirdly there is <hi>Ordo dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis,</hi> so <hi>Sem</hi> is placed before <hi>Iaphet</hi> for digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, although hee were yonger: So in this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> observes this order (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.) <hi>Hee bringeth forth new and old;</hi> New is first in dignitie, although old first in time: so <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. <hi>Apostles and Prophets.</hi> Fourthly, there is an <hi>order of History</hi> observed also by Scripture: as in the first verse of the Gospell, <hi>The booke of the Generation of Iesus Christ, the sonne of David, the sonne of Abraham.</hi> Why is <hi>Abraham</hi> put last after <hi>David?</hi> because the historie is to begin at him. So 1 Chron. 3.5. <hi>Salomon</hi> is placed last a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his brethren, because the Historie was to begin at him: yea, if we shall marke the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly order that is amongst the Evangelists, they will shew us that the Scriptures are divine. Saint <hi>Marke</hi> beginneth at the <hi>workes of Christ:</hi> Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ascendeth higher, to the <hi>Birth of Christ:</hi> Saint <hi>Luke</hi> goeth higher, to the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Christ:</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> goeth highest of all, to the <hi>Divinitie of Christ, and his eternall Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Lastly, a constant and perpetuall testimonie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/>
      <pb n="3" facs="3"/> the Catholique Church, which wee call <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Tradition:</hi> the Church in all ages allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Bookes, as truly Canonicall, or as sure, certaine, and infallible rules of direction for our lives and conversations; yea, although the Papists themselves dispute of the authoritie and perfection of the Scriptures (whether they be perfect, and of themselves sufficient unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, without Tradition; or whether they have authoritie from themselves, and witnesse in themselves, or from the Church; and how we without the consent and testimonie of the Church, know them to be Scriptures) yet (to my knowledge) there is no learned Papist doth question the question in hand, viz. whether these Bookes of the Old and New Testament be the divine word of God or no? neither is there any controversie betwixt us and them in this particular, they with us agreeing, that the Old and New Testament, and every booke in either, <hi>were written by holy men of God, as they were inspired by the Spirit of God.</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.</note> And thus much for this first generall question. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond followes.</p>
   <p>
      <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>2</label> How are the Scriptures divided? I answer, Foure manner of wayes, <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
      </label> viz. first in bookes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall and Apocryphall. Secondly, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Bookes are divided into the Old and New Testament. Thirdly, the Canonicall bookes of the Old Testament into three parts, 1. Into the Law i. e. the five Bookes of <hi>Moses.</hi> 2. Into the lesser and latter Prophets. 3. Into the Bookes which the Grecians call <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, holy Writings. The Canonicall Bookes of the New Testament are also divided, 1. Into Bookes Historicall. 2. Epistles. 3. Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, as the Apocalypse.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, the last division of all the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Bookes both of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is taken from the summe of the whole Scriptures, and that is into the Law and Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell<note n="b" place="margin">Zanch de sacra script. f. <hi>22</hi>
      </note>. Having to handle this question else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where more largely, I passe here thus briefly by it. Thus much for this second generall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. Wee now come to consider of this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and first of the Title, <hi>The Gospel according <label type="milestone">
            <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>3</label> to Saint Matthew.</hi> Here first it may bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
      </label> what is meant by this word <hi>Gospell?</hi> Answer. For the true and full understanding of this question, wee have two things to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of, viz. the Name and the Nature of the Gospell: of which not apart, or severally, but together. For the Name shewes the Nature, <hi>Conveniunt rebus nomina sape suis.</hi> The Name is <gap reason="foreign">

   <p>And thus much for this question.</p>
   <p>Another question here will arise: Why the <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>4</label> Gospell or any Scripture was written? To this I <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>1</label> Answer first: for the helps of our knowledge, least that in processe of time, there should either have beene no remembrance, or a false remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, of our salvation and redemption by Christ: to prevent which God in much mercy and love, hath committed the life, death, resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and ascension of Christ unto writting, that the <hi>truth</hi> might remaine and bee knowne, for and unto all ages. The Lord would have us remember what Christ did for us, and what hee undertooke, and underwent for our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and therefore hee commandes that those things which are to bee remembred should bee written, least otherwise the memory of them should perish. The Lord would have our memories to retaine Truth, not lyes, and therefore commands the Gospell to bee writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that the truth may not be corrupted.<note n="o" place="margin">Luke 1.4, 5.</note>
   </p>
   <p>I answer againe, the Gospell was written for <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>2</label> the helpe of our faith, least it should have beene uncertaine. If the History of Christs concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, birth, life, temptation, sufferings, obedience, and the like, had only beene by tradition delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="4" facs="4"/> from Father to Sonne; in processe of time, we should have questioned the truth of it, and so our faith would have beene the <hi>more shaken,</hi> and <hi>lesse sure:</hi> to redresse which, the Lord commends all these things to writing, that so our faith might be <hi>firme</hi> and <hi>working,</hi> not <hi>fraile,</hi> and <hi>wavering.</hi> If the Gospel had beene related unto us by others, not by the Apostles, wee should have been prone to have called the truth and certainty of it in question: as the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who will neither receive nor imbrace any other Scripture, but onely the <hi>Pentatench,</hi> or five bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> because none were written by him, but them: and therefore the Lord will have the Gospel written, and the Canon and Rule of faith taught, confirmed, and sealed by his Apostles, who were <hi>eye</hi> and <hi>eare witnesses,</hi> of what they wrote,<note n="a" place="margin">1 John 1.3.</note> that wee might the more undoubtedly beleeve the infallible truth of it.</p>
   <p>
      <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>5</label> It may here further be questioned, what the Gospel and Scriptures doe containe? <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answer. </seg>
      </label> I answer; First, holy Histories to bee knowne: Secondly, Rules and doctrines of faith to be practised and beleeved. For the better understanding of this question and answer, observe: First, what is to expected? Secondly, what is to bee learned from the holy Scriptures? I. What is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Scriptures? First the truth of Historie; not of every historie and passage, but onely those that are necessary,<note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 20.21.</note>. Secondly, the summe also of all those things, which are to bee beleeved as necessary unto salvation.<note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> And therfore 1. they are to blame that say, the Scriptures are corrupted, and falsifyed by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques. 2. the Patrons and setters up of those <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>Vnwritten traditions.</hi> II. What is to be learned from the Scriptures? First, the doctrine of faith:<note n="d" place="margin">Collo 3.16.</note> and therefore 1. Papists are much to blame, who hold some things as articles of their faith, for which they have no warrant from the word of God, as is proved by Sir <hi>Humfrey Linde</hi> in his <hi>via tuta.</hi> 2 Ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons also are here very faulty, who will not studie the Scriptures, that <hi>thereby they may bee inabled to give an account of their faith, to every one that shall demand a reason of it</hi>
      <note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 3.15.</note>. 3. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so are blame worthy, that refuse to bee Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised and instructed in the principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, grounded upon, and taken from the holy Scriptures.</p>
   <p>Secondly, the truth of History is to be learned from the Scripture; because that is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith: and therefore it is necessary to heare, reade, conferre, and accustome our selves unto the study of holy writ: because for this end God commanded them to bee written, that wee by the frequent and daily meditating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, might understand what is necessary to bee knowne, &amp; what to be beleeved unto salvation. And thus much for the first word of the Title, viz. <hi>Gospel.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>6</label> It may yet bee demanded further concerning the Title of this Book, what this <hi>Matthew</hi> was? <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>1</label> To which I answer, for his person, hee was the sonne of <hi>Alphens,</hi> by name also called <hi>Levi,</hi> and it is probable, that hee was the brother of <hi>Iames</hi> the lesse,<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 10.9.</note>.</p>
   <p>I answer againe: for his function hee was a Publican, or a Tole-gatherer; a calling very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>2</label> unto the Jewes: First, in regard of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, because they conceived these taxes to bee imposed upon them unjustly, by the Roman government, under which they were now sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Secondly, in regard of the office, because for the most part they were unjust exacters, and oppressors, extorting more from them then their due: as <hi>Zacheus</hi> himselfe doth intimate, when he saith<note n="g" place="margin">Luke 19 8.</note>
      <hi>If I have taken any thing from any man unjustly, &amp;c.</hi> And hence Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts Publicans<note n="h" place="margin">Luke 3.13.</note>
      <hi>to exact no more then that, which is appointed unto them.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Lastly, I answer; for Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi> paines, <label type="milestone">

      </note>? I answer, it is very profitable, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovefull, for the patient or sicke person to have a Physitian, who hath had experience of his <label type="milestone">

         </gap>dam,</hi> or sometimes sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to preach unto those that yet are wicked, because they know best the nature of sinne, and how to apply fit corrosives and salves to every sinfull soule. Againe, I answer: this the Lord <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>2</label> doth to shew unto us, that when he doth <hi>forgive,</hi> he doth also <hi>forget:</hi> when once wee turne unto God <hi>by repentance never to bee repented of,</hi> hee doth as wholly put our sinnes out of his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, as though we never had offended him at all,<note n="k" place="margin">Ezek. 18 22.

   <p>Again, God doth this to encourage sinners to turne unto him, that having such presidents, they may bee certainely assured that hee who is <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>3</label> no respecter of persons, will thinke nothing too deare for them, whatsoever their former lives have beene, if they will but truely returne unto the Lord.</p>
   <p>Lastly, God doth this to demonstrate his <label type="milestone">

      </label> I answer, Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> was not the Author, but the Hand: for the holy Spirit was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: and therefore <hi>Castalion</hi> erres, who thus entitles this booke, <hi>The Gospel by the Authour Matthew,</hi> for it is more rightly called by <gap reason="foreign">

      <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>10</label> Concerning the <hi>Idiome,</hi> it will hee enquired, in what language this Gospell was written? <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>1</label> To this some answer, in Hebrew: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they give for this, is, because it was written first and principally for the Iewes. This was the constant opinion of these Fathers, <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> all of them giving the fore-named reason, that Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> being an Hebrew, writ in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew unto the Hebrewes; and <hi>Ierome</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this, tells us, that hee found an Hebrew Copy in the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Librarie: and <hi>Syrus</hi> the Interpreter is so confident herein, that hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixeth this Title to this Book, <hi>The Gospell which Saint Matthew preached in Hebrew in the Region Palestina.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>2</label> I answer (with reverence to so learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) that the exposition of the name <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, Matth.</hi> 1.23. doth shew, that either first <hi>Matthew</hi> did not write in Hebrew, for then he would not have expounded <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> which is an Hebrew word: or secondly, that hee wrot both in Hebrew and Greeke: or thirdly, that he wrot this Gospell in Hebrew, and that this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition unto <hi>Emmanuel (that is, if it be interpreted, God with us)</hi> was added by some Greeke Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter. Now which of these is the <hi>certaine truth, in truth is uncertaine.</hi> Indeed the Fathers were not so confident that it was written in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew; but <hi>Erasmus,</hi> and other learned Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, do as much question it, and their reasons for the contrarie opinions are these: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, if this Gospel were written first in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> then who translated it into Greeke? for none certainly can be produced to have done it: the maintainers of this opinion not agreeing herein among themselves. <hi>Theophilact</hi> thinkes that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist translated it: but <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> ascribes it to <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reason is, because all the other Pen-men of the holy Scriptures, both Apostles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists, writ in Greeke, which was the most vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and knowne tongue then, in those parts where they lived; and therefore it is not likely that onely <hi>Matthew</hi> would use a divers idiome, or language. The third reason is, because the proofe alledged by the Fathers, proves not their opinion: their proofe is, <hi>Matthew</hi> wrot in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, because hee was an Hebrew, and wrot to Hebrewes. This followes not, because the rest of the Apostles were Hebrewes, and yet they wrot and preached in Greeke: <hi>They are Hebrewes</hi> (sayth Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">2. Cor. 11.22.</note>) <hi>and so am I.</hi> The fourth reason is, because if we should grant, that this Booke was written by Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> in Hebrew, we must grant also, that wee have not the <hi>Fountaine</hi> of this Gospell, but a <hi>streame</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flowing from the <hi>Fountaine,</hi> and derived unto us (as <hi>Maldonate</hi> sayth) by some uncertaine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour: Now it is not to be admitted or gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that this Translation which comes wee know not from whom, should bee coupled with the rest of the Evangelists, and Epistles, whose fountaine (it is granted) wee have, that is, as they were written by them, and not translated by others. The fift reason is, because the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew words which Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> (for some causes) doth retaine in this Gospell, he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret, not into other Hebrew words (which is very likely hee would have done, if hee had writ in Hebrew) but into Greeke words, as <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> i. e. <hi>God with us. Eli, Eli, lammasabachtha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> i. e. <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me: Golgotha,</hi> i. e. <hi>the place of a skull: Abba,</hi> which is, <hi>my Father</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">Pareus s.</note>. I adde a sixt and last reason, which is taken from these words<note n="d" place="margin">Math. 5.18.</note>, <hi>one jot, or iota of the law shall not passe away, &amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>Iota</hi> is the least letter the Greekes have, and <hi>Iod</hi> the least of Hebrew letters: and therefore it being sayd there, not <hi>the least Iod,</hi> but <hi>the least Iota,</hi> seemes (if not a convincing, yet) a probable argument, that this Gospell was written in Greeke, not in Hebrew. These reasons consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I had rather thinke and conclude, that this Gospell was written by Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> in Greeke, and not at all in Hebrew. Thus much may suffice to bee spoken concerning the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi>

   <p>Concerning the name of this second volume <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>11</label> of holy writ, it may be questioned, why these Bookes are called by the name of a <hi>Testament? Answer.</hi> For the understanding, and better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>1</label> of this question, it is requisite to know, that this word <hi>Testament</hi> hath a divers signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, viz. I. First it signifies a <hi>Covenant:</hi> so with the Hebrewes, <hi>Berith</hi> (which signifies a <hi>Covenant,</hi> derived from <hi>Barath,</hi> which signifies to conclude, or <hi>make a Covenant</hi>) is taken for a <hi>Testament.</hi> So also the Greekes for this word <hi>Testament,</hi> have <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, or (as <hi>Aquila</hi> hath it) <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, which signifies an <hi>Agreement,</hi> or <hi>Covenant:</hi> so the Latines, they either call it <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamentum,</hi> or <hi>Pactum,</hi> a <hi>Testament</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> indifferently. II. Secondly, this word <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> signifies sometimes <hi>the will of the dead: where a Testament is, there must of necessitie be the death of the Testator</hi>
      <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 9.16.</note>. Sometimes againe it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, the covenant of the living, and in this latter sence the Scripture is called a <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> because it is a <hi>Covenant</hi> of mercie and grace, which God made with <hi>Adam, Noah, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram, Moses, David,</hi> and all his elect people. III. Thirdly, this word <hi>Testament</hi> doth ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily signifie a body of Bookes, containing the Historie of those people who were received by God into Covenant, that is, principally the Bookes of the Law and of the Prophets. IV. Fourthly, <hi>Testament</hi> sometimes signifies the bare promises which God made unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> seemes to understand the word<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3.15.16.</note>. V. Fiftly and lastly, most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly this word <hi>Testament</hi> signifies the body of all Canonicall Bookes, wherein is contained the Doctrine concerning Christ, who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited and given for a Redeemer of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde<note n="b" place="margin">Aretius. s</note>.</p>
   <p>I answer againe; these Bookes are called by <label type="milestone">

Thirdly, because all things which are required in a solemne <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament,</hi> are here in these books to be found: for the clearing whereof observe. A <hi>Will</hi> is either written by the hand, or direction of the Testator in his life time, or it is unwritten, and is called by the Lawyers; <hi>Testamentum nuncupativum, a Will declarative</hi> and such is the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament</hi> of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ; wherein there are principally these foure things. First, a <hi>Testator,</hi> which is Christ the Sonne of God, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this New Testament. Secondly, an <hi>Heire</hi> or <hi>joint-heires,</hi> which are all the elect of all ages: and hence the Scripture often calleth the Saints <hi>Heires and Coheires of Christ</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Tit. 3.7. Rom. 8.17. 1 Pet. 3.7.</note>. Thirdly, <hi>Legacies,</hi> or goods given to the Heires by the Testator, which are life eternall, remission of sinnes, the gifts and graces of the Holy Ghost, whereby we are enabled to performe (in some good measure) the Will of Christ, as to live holily, to adorne our profession, to be liberall towards the poore, to love one another, to beleeve in God faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to call upon him fervently, and the like. Fourthly, <hi>witnesses</hi> of the Will, and these were; I. First, the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Disciples</hi> of Chrst, who are by Christ called his <hi>Witnesses,</hi> and they themselves are not ashamed to bee so called.<note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 24.48. &amp; Act. 1.8. &amp; 2.32.</note> II. The holy <hi>Martyrs</hi> are Christ <hi>witnesses</hi> also, because they suffered their blood to be shed for the confession of this Testament. III. Thirdly, all good <hi>Ministers,</hi> who are interpreters of this Testament and propound the excellencies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto the world, are likewise Christs <hi>witnesses.</hi> IV. Fourthly and lastly, all the <hi>Godly,</hi> who labour to performe and fulfil the contents of this <hi>Will</hi> in their lives and conversations, are <hi>witnesses</hi> also of this New Testament.</p>

         <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>12</label> Concerning the addition, one question more may be propounded, and that is, why are these Bookes called <hi>New;</hi>
      <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
      </label>
      <hi>The new Testament,</hi> seeing that the substance of this volume is contained in the other, commonly called the <hi>Old Testament?</hi> I answer, these bookes are called <hi>New,</hi> for these reasons. I. First, in regard of the time wherein they were written, because in time they were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written then those of the other Testament: so we call those things <hi>new</hi> which in tyme are <hi>nearer</hi> unto us, and those things <hi>old</hi> which are <hi>further distant</hi> from our memorie and age. II. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are called <hi>New,</hi> in regad of the promises of <hi>a new kingdome</hi> which they containe: for in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> almost<note n="f" place="margin">I say al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, not altogether. 1. because the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament are in the Old, and those of the Old in the New; though the old hath them <hi>satis involutè, &amp; in Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis,</hi> but the New <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velate sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> 2 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Almost, serves to escape the foule error of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces (<hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </gap>ium de verit. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig. Christ. pag.</hi> 64.) And of <hi>Servetus (apud Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin. Instit. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>pag.</hi> 102. 105. <hi>&amp;</hi> 172.) And of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pseu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues in these times, <hi>domi forsan &amp; for as.</hi>
      </note> all the promises respect the kingdome of the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these conditions, that they should dwell safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, securely, and prosperously in that land, so long as they lived holily before the Lord; but the land should spue them out if they forsake the Lord. But this <hi>New Testament,</hi> hath the promise of <hi>a new kingdome,</hi> the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as also of the abolishing of death, of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, of bestowing righteousnesse upon us, and renewing our humane nature in us, for, and by, and through the merits and mercies of Iesus Christ. III. Thirdly these bookes are called <hi>New,</hi> for a new adoration or worship of God which is herein prescribed: In the <hi>Old Testament</hi> they were confined unto a place: they must worship at Ierusalem, in the <hi>New Testament</hi> God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to bee every where present and propitious unto all those that call upon him faithfully, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.23. IV. Fourthly, they are called <hi>New,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they speake with a new tongue, in a new language: the <hi>Old Testament</hi> was written in the old Hebrew tongue, the <hi>New Testament</hi> in a new, i. e. in the Greeke tongue; for this was a new thing, and never before accustomed, to have the Oracles of God divulged in any other language than Hebrew. There were three lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages consecrated in the Title of Christs Crosse, which was written by <hi>Pilat,</hi> the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greeke, and Latine tongue</hi> and therefore in this regard also these Books are called <hi>New.</hi> V. Fifthly, they are so tearmed also, because of a new Testator, or Mediatour of this Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was not <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>Christ.</hi> VI. Sixtly, they are also so called, in regard of their new witnesses, the Apostles and Disciples of Christ. Thus much for the Name, Authour, and Title. Divers other generall questions might be raysed, both from this Gospell, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so from the New Testament, which willingly I omit, for these three causes. First, because some of them (God willing) I shall handle elswhere: And secondly, because Doctor <hi>Mayor</hi> hath handled many in his learned Animadversions upon the whole New Testament: And thirdly, because neither my parts, nor wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>n raise up, or conjure downe all questions and difficulties, which may be made. I have also (in a manner) wholly omitted the objections, the childish and quarrelling exceptions, and impious wrestings of the Rhemists upon the New Testament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause both reverend <hi>Fulke,</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>twright,</hi> are to be had in English, who answer them suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. I come now to cleare and observe some things in particular from some particular verses of the first Chapter.</p>
