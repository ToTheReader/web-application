      <hi>2</hi> And if they will be content to impute to me all
<pb facs="8"/>
humane infirmities, they shall neede to faine nothing: I am, I confesse, obnoxious enough. My naturall impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience not to digge painefully in deepe, and stony, and sullen learnings: My Indulgence to my freedome and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, as in all other indifferent things, so in my studies also, not to betroth or enthral my selfe, to any one science, which should possesse or denominate me: My easines, to affoord a sweete and gentle Interpretation, to all profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of Christian Religion, if they shake not the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, wherein I haue in my ordinary Communication and familiar writings, often expressed and declared my selfe: hath opened me enough to their malice, and put me into their danger, and giuen them aduantage to impute to me, whatsoeuer such degrees of lazines, of liberty, of irresolution, can produce.</p>
   <p n="3">3 But if either they will transferre my personall weakenesses vpon the cause, or extend the faults of my person to my minde, or to her purest part, my conscience: If they will calumniate this poore and innocent worke of mine, as if it were written, either for <hi>Ostentation</hi> of any ability or faculty in my selfe; or for <hi>Prouocation,</hi> to draw them to an aunswere, and so continue a Booke-warre; or for <hi>Flattery</hi> to the present State; which, thogh my seruices be by many iust titles due to it, needs it not; or for <hi>exasperation,</hi> to draw out the ciuill sword in causes, which haue some pretence and colour of being spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall; or to get <hi>Occasion</hi> hereby to vncouer the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and lay open the incommodious and vndefensible sentences and opinions, of diuers seuerall Authors in that Church; or to maintaine and further a scisme and
<pb facs="9"/>
diuision amongst you, in this point of the Popes pretence to temporall iurisdiction: I haue no other shelter against these imputations, but an appeale to our blessed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and a protestation before his face, that my principall and direct scope and purpose herein, is the vnity and peace of his Church. For as when the roofe of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rent asunder, not long after followed the ruine of the foundation it selfe: So if these two principall beames and Toppe-rafters, <hi>the Prince</hi> and <hi>the Priest,</hi> rent asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the whole frame and Foundation of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will be shaked. And if we distinguish not between Articles of faith &amp; iurisdiction, but account all those su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-edifications and furnitures, and ornaments which God hath affoorded to his Church, for exteriour gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be equally the Foundation it selfe, there can bee no Church; as there could be no body of a man, if it were all eye.</p>
   <p n="4">
      <hi>4</hi> They who haue descended so lowe, as to take knowledge of me, and to admit me into their considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, know well that I vsed no inordinate hast, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation in binding my conscience to any locall Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I had a longer worke to doe then many other men; for I was first to blot out, certaine impressions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane religion, and to wrastle both against the examples and against the reasons, by which some hold was taken; and some anticipations early layde vpon my conscience, both by Persons who by nature had a power and superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority ouer my will, and others who by their learning and good life, seem'd to me iustly to claime an interest for the guiding, and rectifying of mine vnderstanding in these
<pb facs="9"/>
matters. And although I apprehended well enough, that this irresolution not onely retarded my fortune, but also bred some scandall, and endangered my spirituall re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>putation, by laying me open to many mis-interpretations; yet all these respects did not transport me to any violent and sudden determination, till I had, to the measure of my poore wit and iudgement, suruayed and digested the whole body of Diuinity, controuerted betweene ours and the Romane Church. In which search and disquisition, that God, which awakened me then, and hath neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me in that industry, as he is the Authour of that purpose, so is he a witnes of this protestation; that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued my selfe, and proceeded therin with humility, and diffidence in my selfe; and by that, which by his grace, I tooke to be the ordinary meanes, which is frequent prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and equall and indifferent affections.</p>
   <p n="5">
      <hi>5</hi> And this course held in rectifying and reducing mine vnderstanding and iudgment, might iustifie &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse my forwardnes; if I shold seeme to any to haue intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and vsurped the office of others, in writing of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and spirituall points, hauing no ordinary calling to that function. For, to haue alwaies abstained from this declaration of my selfe, had beene to betray, and to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and prostitute my good name to their misconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings and imputations; who thinke presently, that hee hath no Religion, which dares not call his Religion by some newer name then <hi>Christian.</hi> And then, for my writing in Diuinity, though no professed Diuine; all Ages, all Nations, all Religions, euen yours, which is the most couetous and lothest to diuide, or communicate with
<pb facs="10"/>
the Layety, any of the honours reserued to the Clergie, affoord me abundantly examples, and authorities for such an vndertaking.</p>
   <p n="6">
      <hi>6</hi> But for this poore worke of mine, I need no such <hi>Aduocates,</hi> nor <hi>Apologizers</hi>; for it is not of Diuinity, but meerely of temporall matters, that I write. And you may as iustly accuse <hi>Vitr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>uius,</hi> who writ of the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of building Churches, or those Authors which haue written of the nature of Bees and vse of Waxe, or of Painting, or of Musique, to haue vsurped vpon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Diuines, and to haue written of Diuinity, because all these are ingredients into your propitiatory medicine, the Masse, and conduce to spirituall and diuine worship: as you may impute to any, which writes of ciuil obedience to the Prince, that he meddles with Diuinity: not that this obedience is not safely grounded in Diuinity, or that it is not an act of Religion, but that it is so well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grau'd in our hearts, and naturally obuious to euery vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that men of all conditions haue a sense and apprehension, and assurednes of that obligation.</p>
   <p n="7">
      <hi>7</hi> The cause therefore is reduced to a narrow issue, and contracted to a strict point, when the differences betweene vs are brought to this; Whether a Subiect may not obey his Prince, if the Turk or any other man forbid it? And as his Maiestie in his Kingdomes, is Religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and prudently watchfull, to preserue that Crowne, which his Predecessors had redeemed from the rust, and drosse, wherewith forraine vsurpation had infected it; so is it easie to be obserued, that all the other Princes of Christendome, beginne to shake off those fetters, which
<pb facs="10"/>
insensibly and drowsily they had admitted; and labour by all waies, which are as yet possible to them, to returne to their naturall Supremacy and Iurisdiction: which besides many other pregnant euidences, appeares by <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ronius</hi> his often complayning thereof; both in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, when he sayes,<note place="margin">
         <hi>To. 11.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>That the Princes of this age do exercise so much Iurisdiction ouer the Clergie, that the Church suffers some scandall thereby</hi>: And in his Apologie of his owne writings,<note place="margin">

      </note> against the Cardinall <hi>Columna,</hi> where he notes, <hi>That the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals deputed for the hearing of those causes at Rome, are tired and oppressed in these later times, with the Messengers and Appeales of Bishoppes, which in euery Countrey complaine, how much the secular Princes iniure them.</hi> And this must of necessity be vnderstood of Countries, which professe the Romane Religion, because such as are Apostoliquely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, or are in that way, haue shut vp all waies of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations to Rome, or remedies from thence.</p>
   <p n="8">
      <hi>8</hi> And not to speake of the Kingdome of France at this time, because I haue sepos'd and destin'd a particular Chapter for that consideration, nor of the fresh Historie of the Venetians, maintaining their iust Lawes for this temporall Iurisdiction: which lawes <hi>Parsons,</hi>

      <pb facs="11"/>
to his Master the French King, about Cardinal <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> his instructions, when the Pope sent him to Venice for that purpose; nor to looke so farre backe, as to consider what the other States of Italy and of Rome it selfe haue done herein, which, as an Author which liued in profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that Religion,<note place="margin">

      <hi>that he is the only Prince, who bends all the sinewes of his power, and all the thoughts of his minde, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oppresse barbarous enemies of Christianity, but to containe christian Kings in their duetie:</hi> This Kingdome (I say) hath by all meanes, which it can, expressed how weary it is of that iurisdiction which the Pope exerciseth there, in these points which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of: though the Popes haue euer beene most readie to recompence these temporall detriments to those kings; as the Donations of the Indyes, and of the Kingdome of Nauarre, and of England, testifie at full.</p>
   <p n="9">
      <hi>9</hi> And yet if we consider, what all sorts of persons in that Nation haue done against this temporall power, wee cannot doubt, but that they trauaile of the same

      <hi>That many of the principall Authours of the Spanish nation, concurre in this opinion, that these exemptions and immunities of the Clergie,</hi> so much debated, are not <hi>Iuris diuini.</hi> And it is easie to obserue, what the Collection and resultanse vpon this conclusion will be; Since, if they bee enioyd by the fauour of Princes, though a conueniencie, and a kind of right grounded in the law of nature, haue moued Princes to graunt them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
