                 <title>The summe of the conference betwene Iohn Rainoldes and Iohn Hart : touching the head and the faith of the Church. Wherein by the way are handled sundrie points, of the sufficiencie and right expounding of the Scriptures, the ministerie of the Church, the function of priesthood, the sacrifice of the masse, with other controuerises of religion: but chiefly and purposely the point of Church-gouernment ... Penned by Iohn Rainoldes, according to the notes set downe in writing by them both: perused by Iohn Hart, and (after things supplied, &amp; altered, as he thought good) allowed for the faithfull report of that which past in conference betwene them. Whereto is annexed a treatise intitled, Six conclusions touching the Holie Scripture and the Church, writen by Iohn Rainoldes. With a defence of such thinges as Thomas Stapleton and Gregorie Martin haue carped at therein</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now fiue yeares almost, (gentle reader) since being occasioned by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our Vniuersitie to handle and defend these Conclusions in disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I was moued to make them cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnto many, that through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and consolation of the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture the church might reape some fruite of them. Howbeit as <hi>Apelles</hi> was wont to set forth his pictures at his stall, that, if any fault were found, he might amend it, before they were deliuered to such as they were drawen for: the like haue I done with mine, (though not like his,) by keping thē in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin at home as it were, that, if any thing were iustly blamed in them, it might be corrected, before I sent them abroad to English men. In the which respect, though I could hardly resist the importunate desire of sundry frendes, of whom some had translated them, requesting that I would translate them my selfe or suffer theirs to be printed: yet I resisted it, &amp; hope they tooke it in good part. But now being otherwise enforced to publish my conference with <hi>M. Hart</hi>: I haue cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended vnto their request, to do them into English, &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish them withall. The rather, because I haue proued herein, that <hi>the faith professed by the Church of Rome is not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith.</hi> The contrary whereof was the last point that <hi>M. Hart</hi> auouched. So that, seeing he brake off conference thereon, and would not put the faith of his church to that triall, to which he had put the Pope, the head of it: the godly, who will wish that also had bene handled to the confusion of all Poperie, may for want of larger repast take this sclende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
<pb n="744" facs="380"/>
as better halfe a loafe (men say) then no bread. And I am the bolder to set it before them: because <hi>Doctor Stapleton</hi> &amp; <hi>Licentiate Martin,</hi> who, as euill physicians to get themselues worke, doo praise vnholesome baggage aboue holesome foode, haue discōmended it. Chiefly, sith their dealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hath bene such, that they haue shewed greater stomake thē wisedome, as physicians of no value. For of foure pointes that I find reproued by the former of them, in <note n="a" place="margin">Thom. Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. princip. fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei doctrin. excus. Paris. 1582.</note> the last editiō of his doctrinall principles: one is, <note n="b" place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 6.</note> that <hi>I distinguish the militant and visible church from the Catholike, after a new sort, vnskilfully, and fondly.</hi> The <hi>distinction</hi> therof <note n="c" place="margin">In the second, fourth, and fifth Conclusions.</note> I groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the scripture: <note n="d" place="margin">1.

      <hi>new</hi> (it may be) to others, not to vs. But the <hi>Doctor</hi> saw that Babylon would fall if the <hi>distinction</hi> stoode. Wherefore if he had no stronger shot then this to discharge against it: I will beare with him; as in the rest of his tauntes also. Loosers must haue their wordes. An other point <note n="f" place="margin">In the fourth Conclusion.</note> he carpeth at, is mine exposition of <hi>holy catholike church.</hi> Which I hauing proued by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes themselues, that <hi>it must needes signifie the company of the chosen alone, not mixt with wicked ones, because (by their</hi>

      <hi>who say they are Iewes, &amp; are not, but are the Synagogue of Satan.</hi> Yet this is the soundest reason that he hath against my Conclusion; that <hi>the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church which we beleue is the whole company of Gods elect and chosen.</hi> For touching that he addeth that <hi>he hath disproued it, by shewing that the church is distinguished from hereticall assemblies by the name of Catholike:</hi> he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued it as soundly therby, as if he should say, that the <note n="p" place="margin">Epistola ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholica Iacobi &amp; Petri.</note>
      <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike epistles</hi> in the new Testament, were not so called, as generall, &amp; writen to no certaine persons, because that other writings are named catholike also to distinguish them from hereticall. The third point he taketh vpon him to confute, is an argument that I made to proue my third Conclusion. <note n="q" place="margin">Staplet princ▪ doctrin. lib. 12▪ cap. 16.</note>
      <hi>All the wordes of scripture be the wordes of trueth: some wordes of the Church be the wordes of errour. But he that telleth the trueth alwayes, is more to be credited, thē he that lyeth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. Therefore the holy scripture is to be credited more thē is the Church.</hi> And <hi>to this argumēt</hi> (saith he) <hi>I answere brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that no words of the Church are the words of error, that is, that no erroneus thing is euer taught, defined, or approued, by the Church in her Bishops &amp; Pastors teaching vniformly; in the decrees of Councels, chiefly of generall Councels; in that which the Fathers teach with one consent; in her head, the Pope, defining, &amp; deliuering any thing publikely; &amp; finally in the rule of faith which all the Church holdeth: though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally some Bishops may priuately erre in teaching; and one or moe Fathers may write some vntrue thing, or be in some er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

         </gap>or; and somewhat euen in Coūcels, without the decree it self, may be said or reasoned inconueniently; and (to conclude) the Pope may be ouerseene priuately in somewhat. But this must be certes imputed to the frailtie of men, not to the Church
<pb facs="381"/>
her selfe.</hi> Which speech of <hi>D. Stapletons</hi> if it be an aunswere vnto my argument: then can I tell him a very briefe way to aunswere my Conclusions all with one word. How? By graunting them all to be true. For though it were so, that <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops teaching vniformely might erre, nor Fathers consenting, nor Councels in decrees, nor the Pope in publike and definitiue sentence,</hi> which I both <note place="margin">In the thirde Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

As though <hi>the Church her selfe</hi> consisted not of <hi>men</hi>: and therefore must needes offend so through frailtie, the <hi>men</hi> offending so. The fourth and last point wherewith <note n="t" place="margin">Staplet. princ. doct. l. 13. c. 9.</note> he findeth fault, is, that <hi>amongst</hi>
      <note place="margin">In the fifth Conclusion.</note>
      <hi>the reasons why the Church of Rome is no sound member of the Catholike Church, I bring this, that, touching expounding of the Scripture, she condemneth all senses and meanings thereof, which are against the sense that her selfe holdeth, or against the Fathers cōsenting all in one.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in that he gathereth that I <hi>allow not the expositions of the Fathers,</hi> yea, that <hi>I affirme that it is a marke and token of a false Church to admitte the ioint-consent of the Fathers in expounding of the scripture:</hi> he dooth me great wrong. For, though by folowing too much breuitie in Latin, I fell into obscuritie, and said not so plainly that which I would, and should, as in the English now I haue: yet that which I said, dooth cleere me of his sclaunder, as <hi>D.</hi>

the praise that he hath geuen me therein. Nay, I was so far from noting that as faulty in the Church of Rome, that the faulte which I noted was her vile abusing the name of the Fathers against their iudgemēt in that point. For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared straight in the words ensuing, that first shee autoriseth thereby <hi>her owne practise, as the right sense and meaning of the Scripture, though contrarie to it selfe:</hi> next, she alloweth <hi>the puddles of the Schoolemen,</hi> &amp; wil haue thē taken for <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life</hi>: lastly, <hi>when some Fathers gainsay her,</hi> she reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, <hi>because they all consent not</hi> and admitteth <hi>them who doo make for her, as hauing hit the mark.</hi> Of the which branches the last importeth not that I refuse the <hi>Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting all in one.</hi> The former two import that I condemne the frensie of the Church of Rome, mainteining her <hi>Dunses</hi> and <hi>deedes</hi> against the <hi>Fathers.</hi> But <note n="y" place="margin">Conci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
