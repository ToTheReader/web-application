and worth commanded that addition of Honour, without which, let ambitious hastinesse imagine what it list, Princes cannot set their best Fauorites on a more substantiall Seate of glorious eminence: And thus much for the generall. For particulars, I was in those dayes beholding to your Table and Purse, and in a manner the third Officer of your <hi>Regiment</hi>; as it pleased you to grace and fauour me farre beyond my desert. All which considered, as I haue great reason to bee thankefull vnto you, so could I thinke of no better meanes, then this poore Dedication: First, because I am resolued it will out-last a Marble Toombe, and when Death hath vndertaken to obliterate our memories, yet shall after-ages demand, who this Earle of <hi>Clenricard</hi> was, and wish from their hearts, that the Noble men of their times would set you before them for a Mirror: Secondly, because it is the remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablest Story of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and a businesse so well knowne to your selfe, that I submit to your better iudgement, if I haue fayled in any thing: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because I am taught by experience, that there is no presenting of Bookes to any man, without a primordiall acquaintance, secret supportation, or (as wee call it) Court friendshippe. Last of all, and I hope the best of all, because it may stand
