   <p>IN our last Avisoes the 20. of <hi>August</hi> (which was devided into 2. parts) wee printed severall passages of the late good successe and Victories of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> against Monsieur <hi>Tilly,</hi> as wee received them from forreine parts, which was published by us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out addition or subtraction, &amp; might have given some credit to the same, and deserued a more favorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction from the most malevolently affected, yet from some it could receive no better approbation, than that all was lyes, and that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was kild, or taken Prisoner, and his Army utterly defeated, as at this houre some shame not impudently to maintaine both heere, and beyond sea at <hi>Antwerp, Bruxels,</hi> and else-where. Wherefore wee doe now publish (as wee have received them from better hands a confirmation of the Truth thereof with some circumstances not in our former, and against which, let the most barking curre open his mouth and say as formerly. God grant him the multiplication of the like victories and good successe untill all his Enemies be vanquished, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Peace setled in all the parts of <hi>Germany,</hi>
   </p>
