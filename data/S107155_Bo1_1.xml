                 <title>The doctrine of the Sabbath vindicated : in a confutation of a treatise of the Sabbath, written by M. Edward Breerwood against M. Nic. Byfield, wherein these five things are maintained: first, that the fourth Commandement is given to the servant and not to the master onely. Seecondly, that the fourth Commandement is morall. Thirdly, that our owne light workes as well as gainefull and toilesome are forbidden on the Sabbath. Fourthly, that the Lords day is of divine institution. Fifthly, that the Sabbath was instituted from the beginning. By the industrie of an unworthy labourer in Gods vineyard, Richard Byfield, pastor in Long Ditton in Surrey</title>

   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I touch upon this <hi>Antisabbato-Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Pamphlet to grapple with it, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site briefly to skan the title and sentences of Scripture prefixed; and to propose the case or question controverted.</p>
   <p>First▪ the Booke is intituled, <hi>A learned Treatise of the Sabaoth.</hi> What the Treatise affords shall bee seene anon, God willing: the Title savours of little learning, wherein for <hi>Sabbath</hi> is written <hi>Sabaoth,</hi> which signifieth, hostes, as in <note n="a" place="margin">Esay 1. 9.</note>
      <hi>Esay, Vnlesse the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a remnant.</hi> What hostes bringeth in this Treatise?

         </gap>e</hi> (saith he) <hi>these Dog-flies,</hi> (or Lice, as our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation readeth it, Exod. 8. 16.) <hi>such are unquiet men, which will not spiritually observe the Sabbath, that is, which will not study good workes, nor insist in reading and prayer.

      <pb n="4" facs="12"/> plyed to this Discourse, and therefore how prophanely abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Gods high dishonour appeareth, by setting other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to them, and applying them to the matter in hand. Take them thus:</p>
   <div type="part">
      <head>The first place.</head>
      <p>
         <hi>Prove all things, hold fast that which is good.</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 21.</p>
      <p>Ill applyed to try that reasoning, that blots out one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Decalogue: Oppose that Text;</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Whosoever therefore shall breake one of these least Commandements, and shall teach men so, hee shall be called the least in the Kingdome of Heaven: but whosoever shall doe and teach them the same, shall bee called great in the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> Matth. 5. 19.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <head>The second place.</head>
      <p>
         <hi>For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodnesse, and righteousnesse, and truth, proving what is acceptable to the Lord.</hi> Ephes. 5. 9, 10.</p>
      <p>Ill applyed against the worke of the Spirit in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the intent of the Lord. See those Texts;</p>
      <p>
         <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall bee my people.</hi> Ierem. 31. 33. Heb. 8. 11.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>The Lord is well-pleased for his righteousnesse sake, he will magnifie the Law, and make it honourable.</hi> Esay 42. 21.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <head>The third place.</head>
      <p>
         <hi>Holy Father, Sanctifie them through thy truth: Thy Word is truth.</hi> Ioh. 17. 17.</p>
      <p>Ill applied against the great things of the Law written by Gods owne finger. Looke to that Text;</p>
      <p>
         <hi>I have written to him the great things of my Law: but they were counted as a strange thing.</hi> Hos. 8. 12.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, now for the matter controverted: this learned Treatise hath in it the occasion, and the substance. We take the last first, that all may the better judge of every passage onely out of the first part, <hi>viz.</hi> the occasion thereof. The Case of Conscience questioned must be proposed to cleare the words of the whole Discourse, that the force of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments against it in this Treatise may bee seene, and the blunting of their edge if they have any, or the unsheathing
<pb n="5" facs="12"/> of them, that all may see they are but woodden Daggers, may be apparant to eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>y understanding. The Author of this Treatise states it thus, and so opposeth it as untruth.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <head>Breerwood. Pag. 3.</head>
      <p>THat for a servant to do light businesses▪ or any other worke on the Sabaoth day, although it were such worke as might lawfully be done on another day; and although he did it not of his owne disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only in obedience to his masters command; yet was a sinne and transgression of Gods Commandement touching the Sabaoth, and that he was not bound to yeeld, nay, that he sinned against God in yeelding obedience to every such commandement of his masters that day, which by the precept of Almighty God, was wholly precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consecrated to rest, and the service of God.</p>
      <p>This is the point oppugned by our Adversary, whose reasons shall be delivered in his owne words and confuted: I will neither adde nor diminish, but onely cut it into parts, that every part may receive its answer apart. This prefaced, I proceed.</p>
