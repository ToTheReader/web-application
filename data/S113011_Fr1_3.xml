   <p>Heere I present thee with a small Treatise of a large Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; it being one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Questions of Christian Religion, cōtrouerted at this day betweene the Catholike, and the Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist. It is written with intention to confirme thy Iudgment in so weighty a Point, being already rectified; to reforme it, being erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous; and therfore I expect a retaliation, charitably to entertaine my charitable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <p> If this little worke (the yong <hi>Samuel</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the long barren wombe of my Braine) may become profitable to any one, I haue my desire. As for the censures which will passe therof, I presage they will be as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as Mens iudgments are various; but heerin I am indifferent, for (how meane soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) it is, as it is, and of all the Elements I least pryze the Ayre<hi>:</hi> Yet heere by the way I must aduertise my ignorāt Protestant Reader (for to the more Learned this is needlesse) who euer dislikes, what is not so courteous, as to come within the reach of his narrow head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece, that I do looke, that he should charge these poore Leaues (especially the first Part heerof) with mayne Contrarieties, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions; Yet if his Pryde would vouchsafe to remember (or rather to learne) that all true Contradictions do euer consist in one and the same reference of Circumstances, and that such seeming heere, are reconciled by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Respects explicated in the marginal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations, he might well rest satisfied.</p>
   <p>Wherfore I do heere premonish all such, but particulerly them, who eyther by Pen, or
<pb facs="8"/> Tongue are become publike Patrones of the Sacramentarian Nouelty, not maliciously to insist alone in the said naked appearing Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnances, concealing their Illustrations; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically by this means, amplifying the strange supposed Paradoxes (forsooth) defended by vs Catholikes heerin: Which if they shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt (by diuorcing the one from the other) now after this conuenient forwarning, they are to be reputed, but as Men conscious of their owne bad Cause, and willing fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to abuse the weake Iudgments of their followers.</p>
   <p>I haue deuided this Treatise into two Parts. <hi>In the first,</hi> I proue, that it is possible (for the existence of any thing euer presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth a possibility of the same existence) that the sacred Body and Bloud of our Sauiour, may truly &amp; really be contayned vnder the formes of Bread &amp; Wine; and that though the effecting therof doth transcend Nature, yet doth it not ouerthrow Nature.</p>
   <p>This labour I am forced to vndertak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station with God heerin: for they maintayne
<pb facs="9"/> in their Wrytings with great estuation and heat of dispute (like <note n="a" place="margin">

      <hi>raging waues of the sea, foaming out their owne shame)</hi> that to be at once in diuers places, or to want all circumscription of place (besides many other difficulties oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in the Catholike doctrine of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist) are against the nature of a true Body, and therfore cānot be accomplished by God. In which point they partake ouer neere with the ancient Philosophers, though (perhaps) with their greater offence towards God, then it was in those Heathens; since in such cases that saying houldeth, <gap reason="foreign">

   <p>The reason why the Sacramentaryes do belieue the words of Christ in the doctrine of the Eucharist so little, is because they belieue their Sense therin so much: for they are resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that their outward sense shall heere euen prescribe Lawes to their faith; &amp; whatsoeuer may seeme to be incōpatible therwith (as the forme, the colour, the tast &amp;c.) the maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therof to be reputed as an exploded Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. In which kind of proceeding they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in my conceipt, to deale more niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the faith of Christ, then euer the
<pb facs="9"/>
      <note n="c" place="margin">Donatists.] August. de Vnitate Ecclesiae.</note>
      <hi>Donatists</hi> did with the Church of Christ; since they, though banishing the Church out of all the other partes of the World, yet were content to allot to it the whole Countrey of <hi>Africke:</hi> wheras these labour to withdraw our faith heerin from all the chiefe Powers of our Mind, and to confine it within the narrow compasse of the ball of the Eye, or the end of the tongue: So far off is the Soule (immersed in Sense) from apprehending truly this high and reuerend Mystery.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>The second Part</hi> heerof iustifying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties learned Iudgment heerin, deliuereth the diuine Authorities of both the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for confirmation of the <hi>Reall Presence:</hi> it contayneth the Prophesies of the ancient <hi>Rabbyns</hi> therof; it reporteth the Myracles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by God in warrant of the same; it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth the weaknesse of such testimonyes as are out of the Scripture obiected to the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; finally, it displayeth the innouation and first appearance of the Sacramentarian Doctrine. But because our Aduersaries do vse diuers circulations, and inflexions to and fro (for they most strangely detort the holy
<pb facs="10"/> Scripture, and insolently reiect the other proofes) therfore to draw them to a more particuler fight, I haue reduced the issue of this point to the iudgments of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers of the Primitiue Church, in whose <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>In whose wrytings.]</hi> See hereof the later end of the Marginall References of the first Chapter of the Second Part, at the letter (q).</note> Wrytings many of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries seeme to haue good confidence, and from whose Censures they cannot iustly appeale, since it is said: <hi>Non</hi>

         <hi>Non te praetereat.] Ecclesiast. cap.</hi> 8.</note>
      <hi>re praetereat narratio Seniorum; ipsi enim didicerunt à Patribus suis.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And so the mayne drift of that Part is to shew, that those Fathers vnanimously maintayned the now Catholike doctrine of the Reall Presence, and of Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which poynt being once proued, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth fully, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>repliably the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries in this Controuersie: both because it must of necessity be presumed, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did draw their faith heerin from the true exposition of the Scriptures; as also in that the tyme wherin they liued, was (euen by the generall acknowledgment of all) then, when the glorious splendor of Christs Ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was neuer hid from the Christians of
<pb facs="10"/> those Ages, still openly shyning without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Eclipse, or supposed darknesse; like the Sunne which in some Countreys, and for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne seasons neuer <note n="e" place="margin">
         <hi>Neuer setts.]</hi> The Sunne being in the Septentrionall part of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> neuer setteth for halfe of the yeare togeather, to those, to whom the North Pole is so eleuated, as that it becommeth to them their <hi>Zenith</hi> or Verticall Point. The reason hereof is, in that to the Inhabitants of such a Climate, the <hi>Horizon</hi> is coincident and one to the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> Circle; and therefore seeing euery Diurnall Circle, which the Sunne maketh, is to the eye paralell to the <hi>Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall,</hi> and consequently to the <hi>Horizon</hi> of such a Climate, it followeth that the <hi>Horizon</hi> doth not intersectany of the Diurnall Circles; and therefore the Sunne during all that tyme, neuer setteth to such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</note> sets, but continueth rolling about with great light in the eyes of the Inhabitants.</p>
   <p>GOOD READER, if thou be vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I could wish thee (resting thy selfe in the second Part, which is facile and easie) to passe ouer this first; since it will rather intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate thy iudgment, then iustruct it, it being therunto as strong Wines to weake braines. For it in treateth of diuers high and specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue Points, and such as are aduerse to a cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Vnderstanding, and therfore an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Man (whose Reason oftentimes is but his Sense) can hardly penetrate them. And though thou shalt find there all such difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes fully explaned, yet it is questionable, whether thou art able (presuming thee to be such an one, as heere I meane) to apprehend the Answeres as well as the Doubtes: for a weake and confused iudgment may suggest or conceaue difficulties, but it is a cleare Iudgment, that must resolue them. And the
<pb facs="11"/> reason of the disparity heerin is this▪ To take one thing for another, or to erre in the proper nature and essence of things (which is incidenr especially to the vnlearned) is the sourse of Doubts and Questions; but to be able to marshall togeather things of one nature; and to seuer and fanne things asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which carry a great likenesse one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother (for such resemblance of particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities euer begottes mistakings) as also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> know what essentially is agreeing to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any thing, and what but accessorily and accidentally accompanyeth the same, is a worke of the Iudicious: Wherfore it is no vulgar hand, that can euenly cut the small threed in such nyce speculations. Hence it is, that in regard of the manifold errours of this nature, wherunto the vnlearned are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, we hould, that in such abstracted diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as also in some others, beating only vpon some circumstance of the high Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes of Christian faith (so that our ludg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be implicitly at least resigned to the Church therin) an humble and vnaffected Ignorance is a safe and secure knowledge.</p>
   <pb facs="11"/>
   <p> This first Part then was written to giue satisfaction to those curious prying Wits of this Age, who euen mad with Reason (and may I not so terme them, who labour to wound him by force of Reason, who is the only Author and giuer of Reason?) do seeke to destroy the Catholike faith heerin, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayning the Power of him (euen of him, <hi>who hath</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">
         <hi>Founded the Earth.] Psalm.</hi> 28.</note>
      <hi>founded the earth vpon the seas, and established it vpon the flouds)</hi> within the narrow lymits of Philosophy; so making <hi>Aristotle,</hi> &amp; other vnbelieuing Philosophers to set downe certayne cancells; and bounds to his Diuine Maiesty, beyond which he must not passe: Thus do those, who vaunt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as the Children of Light, borrow their Light from the Children of Darknesse. And so these Men (being become learnedly ignorant) can hardly belieue any thing, which may seeme to carry repugnancy to the setled course of Nature, expecting indeed at our hands (though contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <note n="g" place="margin">
         <hi>The Apostles definition] Heb. c.</hi> 11. Where by the Apostle, Faith is defined to be, <hi>The substance of thinges hoped for; the euidence of thinges not seene.</hi> From which definition it appeareth, that our Sense cannot giue any square &amp; measure to our faith.</note> definition therof) a demonstrable faith. But against such as impugne faith by naturall Reason, we may well apply the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
<pb facs="12"/> of <hi>S. Augustine: Ecce</hi>
      <note n="h" place="margin">

   </p>
   <p>Now further in behalfe of our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrine in this great Controuersie, and to obtund and blunt in generall all reasons deduced from Reason, for the destroying of the same; I do heere auouch, that Mans Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding doth find a greater repugnancy in giuing an assent to those immediate, and necessary Inferences, which do ineuitably flow from the Protestants Principles, then in belieuing the most abstrusest Difficulties in the Eucharist<hi>:</hi> Which point (I grant) doth not ryse from any inexplicable or supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Mysteries, appearing in such their Illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (for since their faith is mainly <note n="i" place="margin">
         <hi>Maynly Negatiue.]</hi> For they deny Traditions, deny <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacy, deny Christs descending into Hell, deny Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Counsells, deny Purgatory and Prayer for the Dead, deny Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Works, deny Freewill<hi>:</hi> Finally (besides many other points) deny the Reall Presence of the Eucharist, and Sacrifice of the Masse.</note>
      <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi> consisting, for the most part, in annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, &amp; ouerthrowing the affirmatiue Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of the Catholike faith, it cannot be inuolued with any such obscurities:) but it proceedeth, in that their Doctrine doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily exhale, and breath forth such grosse, absurd, and exorbitant Conclusions, as that by belieuing them, they darken and cloud
<pb facs="12"/> euen the naturall Light of the Vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. I will instance this (as vnwilling to transgresse the bounds of an Epistle, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing the larger displaying of this point to such oportunity, as may (perhaps) heeraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter present it self to some one Catholike Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or other) in this one Assertion, first broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by <note n="k" place="margin">

      <hi>Luther</hi> himselfe, to wit, that faith alone is so potent in causing our Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that workes are not only not necessary, but hurtfull therto; and so the most perfect faith is the least spotted (in his iudgment) with good Workes.</p>
   <p>Now heere I would demaund, how it can enter into any brayne, but to weene, that faith in Christ should engender a life impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned by Christ? and belieuing in him, that dyed for the expiation of sinne, should be no small inducement to vs for to sinne? Or that Workes should be hurtfull to the great Worke of our Iustification? And thus if we credit these Men, we are commaunded by the <note n="l" place="margin">

Istud verò non est rei veritatem pie credere, sed importuna curiositate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum decernere.</hi> Thus <hi>Monfieur Casaubon</hi> in his Book to <hi>Cardinall Peron,</hi> besides many other like Passages.</note>
      <hi>Casaubon)</hi> do absolutely acknowledge a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and true being of Christs Body in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, far different from <hi>Caluins,</hi> and the Sacramentaryes meere representatiue, and typicall Presence therof; it therfore follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the said Protestants so belieuing, stand as full chargeable for the soluing of all the great Difficultyes therof, as we Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes doe; whether they concerne a body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at once in seuerall places, or a body to exist indiuisibly without any circumscription of Place, and the like (those only excepted which are both fewer, and lesse abstruse) as spring from the Question of Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which is but one branch (as respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb facs="13"/> only the manner of the Presence) of this great Question of the Eucharist. Hence then it ryseth, that such other Protestants, as disclayme from the doctrine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes in the point of the Reall Presence, by reason of so many Difficulties appearing therin, must also for the same respect, disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uow the doctrine of the former Learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants. And therefore I could wish them (since Humility exacteth so much at their hands) to submit themselues herein (though not to our Authorityes, yet) to the graue iudgments of our Soueraigne, &amp; their owne English Church, who for the more cleare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating of all such doubts, must needes admit the Catholikes Solutions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres.</p>
   <p>And now before I end, I am to admonish the Reader still to haue in his remembrance, whose and what Body it is, which we belieue to haue this supernaturall existence in the Eucharist. It is his Body, of whom in this dreadfull Mystery S. <hi>Hierome</hi>
      <note n="o" place="margin">
         <hi>Hierome saith.] Epist. ad Hedibiam. quaest.</hi> 2.</note> saith, <hi>Ipse est Conuiua &amp; Conuiuium: ipse comedens, &amp; qui come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur.</hi> It is also that Body, about the which
<pb facs="14"/> so many astonishing wonders haue at se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall tymes beene effected: A little before the Natiuity thereof (for we read, <hi>Conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto,)</hi> at the very instant of his Birth (for, <hi>natus est ex Maria Virgine,)</hi> some small tyme after his Death (for, <hi>tertia die resurrexit,)</hi> vpon his last departure from vs (for, <hi>ascendit ad Caelos,)</hi> Nature her selfe was in all these Passages, if not dissolued, yet at least suspended: Yea when he heere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed vpon Earth, was not that same Body sometimes <note n="p" place="margin">
         <hi>Nourished without eating.]</hi> To wit during Christs fast of forty dayes; He also did eate without nourishment, when he did eate with his Apostles after his Resurrection, for his body being then glorified, could not requeaue any nourishment by meate.</note> nourished without eating, at other tymes did eate without any nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therby? Did it not (euen remayning <note n="q" place="margin">

      </note> Visible) become Inuisible? Finally, did it not walke most firmly vpon the <note n="r" place="margin">
         <hi>The liquid Element.] Matth.</hi> 14.</note> liquid Element, so as the vnstable water then sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him, who supports the Heauens? If then Nature did subiect and humble herselfe so often to this sacred Body, how can we Christiās doubt of the infallible certainty of those words, <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum</hi> (in which as the chiefe Latin <note n="s" place="margin">
         <hi>Latin Father.] S. Augustine tract.</hi> 26. <hi>in Ioannem,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding those words: <hi>Panis quem ego dabo, caro mea est.</hi>

<pb facs="14"/> not Falshood, not Omnipotency Deficiency?</p>
   <p>AND thus (Good Reader) remitting thee to the perusall heerof (which I much wish, that it may be to thy spirituall Good) I take my leaue, earnestly entreating thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me, at the tymes of thy best Deuotions.</p>
