   <head>The Preface to the
Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi>
the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
of the <hi>Lacedemoniās</hi>
was a great
States-man, and obtained an
immortall glorie by the Lawes
and Statutes which he left unto
the <hi>Spartans.</hi> Yet I finde that
he was very faulty in pemitting
his Citizens to live in continuall
robberie; for what was this, but
to nourish the fire of dissention,
by which hee might have set on
fire his new erected Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;
and indeed there needed
the courage of <hi>Theseus,</hi> and
<pb facs="3"/>
the strength of <hi>Hercules</hi> to
purge a kingdome infected with
the swarme of such people, for it
is a poison which (as saith the
Poet)
<q>Latius &amp; latius vires acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
eundo.</q>
It is like unto rivers, which (the
farther they runne from their
fountaine) the more they swell
and inlarge themselves.</p>
   <p>But before I represent unto
you the divers stratagems which
these Rake hells usually put in
practise to gain their living; I wil
first shew you their originall, it
being no new thing since men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be wicked: and surely this
vice must be very old, since the
heathen gods sometimes exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the same trade: For <hi>Lucian</hi>
(in his Dialogue of <hi>Apollo)</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
and <hi>Vulcan)</hi> relates that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi>
was one of the subtillest
theeves that ever lived, for hee
was scarce out of his shell, when
hee stole away the tooles of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
he made what ever he found
in his way his owne: and one day
having overcome <hi>Cupid</hi> at the
Lute, as <hi>Venus</hi> came to imbrace
him, and congratulate his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
he slilie stole from her that
admirable girdle whereof <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
maketh such esteeme: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, he by the sweetnesse of
his musick so charmed <hi>Apollo,</hi>
whiles hee kept the Kine of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metus,</hi>
that he fell asleep, and in
the mean time stole away his herd,
(wherein you may note how blinde
the ancients were in their belief,
to worship a cow-herd and a theef
for gods) nay ever <hi>Jupiter</hi> could
not keep himself from the flights
of this theef, for he stole from
<pb facs="4"/>
him his Scepter, and would no
doubt, have carried away his
Thunderbolt had it not been too
hot: Wherefore <hi>Homer</hi> in the
Hymne which hee made in his
praise, calls him <hi>(Arcon Phily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teon)</hi>
the Prince of Theeves; and
indeed it is a thing very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that there is no vice which
hath not been authorised by gods,
to the end that the Ancients
might not be scrupelous in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
their actions, which was
the devils policie to draw men to
be his followers, by introducing
(by the means of false Gods) vice
in stead of vertue, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
making use of things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
sacred, to make his poison
to bee swallowed the more easilie;
for who would not have stole his
neighbours goods, since god <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi>
himself was of the trade, or
who was there among them, who
<pb facs="4"/>
esteemed it not an honour to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the steps of so brave a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion?
<q>
         <l>—cui fas per limen utrum{que}</l>
         <l>Solus habet geminoque facit
commercia mundo?</l>
      </q>
as saith <hi>Claudian,</hi> like Master,
like servant; such a Prince, such
a subject; If the Gods in times
past were Theeves, it must needs
bee that their worshippers must
follow their example: and wee
have seene the effects thereof; for
during the space of foure or five
thousand yeeres, since that <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
by an insupportable arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie
placed the first stone in the
tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> the world hath
been full of nothing but confusion,
murder, and theft. The <hi>Assyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
spoiled and ransacked all
their neighbour countreys, to lay
the foundation of their Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie;
but it proved no other then
<pb facs="5"/>
the preparation of a Trophee for
the <hi>Medes,</hi> who invading them,
spoiled them of all that which
they had ransaked from others:
The <hi>Medes</hi> injoyed for a time
their spoiles, but they were soone
stript by the <hi>Persians,</hi> thus one
nation robbed another, untill that
the <hi>Romans</hi> became Masters of
the whole. And what happened at
lèngth, even after revolutions of
ages, this great <hi>Collossus</hi> (whose
shadow strook a feare into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the remotest Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
was dismembred by peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale
and at length remained as
naked as <hi>Esops</hi> bird, and it was
according to reason, that the end
should bee correspondent to the
beginning; for seeing this famous
Republique had not its originall
and increase, but by theeveries,
rapes▪ and massacres under <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>
and others; there was no
<pb facs="5"/>
other likelihood but that it would
return to its first originall.</p>
   <p>But yet I finde some mention
of theeves before all these, for
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were the first af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the deluge that began to rob,
a custome which hath been so long
continued by this Nation, that
they are yet seen to run by troopes
from kingdome to kingdom▪ to
tell fooles their fortunes, &amp; were
it not that men looke more unto
their hands then their feet, they
would make a horrible havock in
villages and solitary houses.</p>
   <p>The barbarous <hi>Scythes,</hi> by the
report of <hi>Herodottus,</hi> were also
very subject to this wicked vice.
for they thought all goods to bee
common, both to men, and other
living creatures, but especially
food, for they made it no scruple
to intrude themselves into any
mans house, where they might find
<pb facs="6"/>
meat wherewith to satisfie their
hungry appetites.</p>
   <p>But the <hi>Lydians</hi> were yet
much more rude, for they held it
for an infallible Maxime, that it
was not fit that a man should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from any place without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
himself with something;
and it may well be said, that there
there are two many Collonies of
this race planted among us, for it
is too apparent, that the one half
of the world robs the other; the
greater theeves robbing the
lesse: For this is so miserable an
age, that the great ones rejoice at
the tottering of the lesse; and
many are seene standing under
the Gallowes to be as spectatours
of the execution of others, who
have more often deserved death
then they have committed
thefts: and though I might here
take occasion to speake much of
<pb facs="6"/>
the great theeves in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
yet considering, that
<hi>Quae supra nos nihil ad nos,</hi>
I will forbeare, and come unto
the lesse, with sorrow that I must
leave one of the Principall parts
of this Historie untouched: or,
know therefore, courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that for thy good I have set
forth this various, and pleasant
Historie, which will shew thee,
how thou mayest avoid many
dangers, and how others more
wickedly inclined, may (by the
punishments which these reap as
just rewards for their evill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
be led from the precipice of
perdition, into the safe way of
vertue and honestie.</p>
