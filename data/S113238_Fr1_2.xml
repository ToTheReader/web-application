   <head>TO THE RIGHT RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEREND
FATHER IN GOD,
RICHARD BY THE PROVIDENCE
of God, Lord Bishop of London, my
very good Lord.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Reuerend. The late no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Accident, that happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
your Lordship among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hath taken great paines
to examine, search, and sift
out the truth, hath bred sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
rumors, not onely in the
North, but also in the South parts of this Realme,
according to the seuerall humours of sundry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
some of them holding opinion, that all that
<hi>Action</hi> was true, and acted in deed by the <hi>Deuill</hi>
in the bodie of the <hi>Boy:</hi> and some others of the
wiser and more stayed sorte, remayning in a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense
what they should thinke of it: in so much
that diuerse of the latter sort, being persons of good
Note and Qualitie, (knowing that I was well
acquainted with the matter, as hauing been an
<gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> or Reader of the proofes collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and openly read in a very <hi>Honorable</hi> and
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Solemne</hi> assemblie) did deale earnestly with me;
that I would declare vnto them, euen <hi>in fide boni
viri,</hi> in the faith of an honest man, what I thought
thereof. And although I did truely and according
to their charming request, relate vnto them, how
plainely, euidently, and manifestly it was proued,
that the matter was a meere <hi>Imposture</hi> and <hi>Couse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,</hi>
yet could I by no meanes settle a resolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
in some of them, that I had dealt sincerely
with them therein: neither would they be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from the doubtfull humour which had vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
a predomination in them, but would remaine
still in the same, vntill they might vnderstand more
certaintie, of this my asseueration deliuered vnto
them. Which strong conceit (it seemeth) they
haue nourished and fostered in their minds, partly
vpon the extrauagant and extraordinarie Motions
and Gestures of the <hi>Counterfeit Cranke</hi> that acted
them, and partly vpon the <hi>Stoicall</hi> conuersation
and <hi>Holy life</hi> of the <hi>Chiefe Choragus,</hi> that brought
all those <hi>Actors</hi> vpon the <hi>Stage.</hi> To deliuer these
good minded people out of their error, it is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desired by many, and by some expected, as a
thing very conuenient, that the saide collected
proofes should be published to the world; so as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man thereby may see, what notable practises
haue been vndertaken: but to what end, I will not
iudge. In the meane while, I am bolde to present
vnto your view and censure, this little pamphlet,
containing a true <hi>Discourse</hi> of a matter of the like
<pb facs="3"/>
Nature, written and printed in the French tongue,
and directed to the <hi>French King:</hi> which alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into my hands <hi>tam oportune,</hi> in so fit a time, I
thought good to translate and publish to the world,
to the end it may be seene, that euen by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the best <hi>Phisitians</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> nothing was
acted by the <hi>Boy</hi> of <hi>Notingham,</hi> or this <hi>Mayde</hi> of
<hi>Romorantin,</hi> but might very well be performed
by the course of Nature, and without the helpe,
presence or assistance of a <hi>Deuill.</hi> I was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to haue prefixed an <hi>Aduertisement</hi> to the
<hi>Reader,</hi> wherein I might haue made an <hi>Apologie</hi>
for my selfe, by alleadging some speciall reasons
why I translated this discourse: to answere some
curious <hi>Carpers,</hi> that may peraduenture taxe mee
for setting forth the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Toyes,</hi> that
are commonly vsed and practised by the <hi>Popish
Exorcists</hi> in their <hi>Coniurations:</hi> in which respect
some haue alreadie taxed mee for the Booke of
<hi>Congo.</hi> But I stand or fall to <hi>my God,</hi> assuring my
selfe, that I haue neither here nor there done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, which is not auouchable by the <hi>Sacred
Scriptures;</hi> let them feed their own humour as they
list. I meant also to haue enterlaced some other hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
&amp; examples of former times, touching such
cunning &amp; counterfeit <hi>Possessions.</hi> But when I had
gathered them together, I found that if I should
haue followed that course, accordingly as that
cause had required, I should haue made the head
bigger then the body, and the shortnesse of the
<pb facs="4"/>
time would not haue permitted me to finish it in
fit oportunitie. And therfore I haue reserued those
<hi>Parralleles</hi> for a longer <hi>Treatise,</hi> which as my
leasure will affoord me, I meane by Gods good
leaue and fauour hereafter to publish. In the meane
time I beseech your Lordship to accept this
little in good part, and so in all humble
dutie take my leaue. From <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behith,</hi>
the 17. of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
1599.</p>
   <signed>Your Lordships assuredly at commaundement,
