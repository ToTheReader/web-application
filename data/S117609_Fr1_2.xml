   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVND LORD SHEFFIELD, LORD LIEVTENANT, AND President of his Maiesties Councell esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the North: Knight of the most noble Order of the Garter, &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is neither ambition nor coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes (Right Honourable) that moueth me to publish this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise to the view of all, which not long since I deliuered to the eares of a few, being then Lecturer in the Citie of <hi>Lincolne:</hi> but partly the motion of some friends, partly and chiefly the satisfying of some si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister spirits haue in a manner wrested from me that, whereto otherwise I had little affection. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit through writing bookes, is a thing of such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous hazard, by reason of the varietie of censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that it is doubtfull whether a man shall winne or lose thereby: Gaine also is so slender, as that, for a booke of a yeeres paines and studie, it will be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hard matter to attaine, if it were set to sale in
<pb facs="3"/> Pauls Church-yard, so much money as inck, paper, and light cost him that penned it: so as except a man should doate, hee must haue better grounds of publishing his writings, than either <hi>credit</hi> or <hi>gaine:</hi> especiallie considering the plentifull haruest of bookes of all sorts, amongst which there appeareth variable contention. In some it is questionable, whether wit or learning getteth the victorie: in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the strife is betwixt wit and the truth: some bewray dissentions betwixt conscience and policie: others contend after other fashions: All declare thus much, that except a man can adde something new of his owne, it is vanitie to write bookes: for otherwise a man shal sooner get mocks than thanks for his paines. Wherefore I doe professedlie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all ambitious affection of credit, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous desire of gaine: and betake my self to a better refuge, which is the cleering of my selfe from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust imputations and accusations. I haue beene strangely traduced for the doctrine I taught out of the Lords Prayer: I haue been vrged to answere in defence of the doctrine I deliuered touching that subiect, before the Magistrate ecclesiastical: as if so be I called in question the truth thereof. For the cleering of the truth I am bold to publish this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Treatise: wherein (I protest before the God of heauen, and before your Lordship) I haue truly set downe the substance of all that which I deliuered in handling the Lords Prayer. I must needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that it is not word for word the same (for that were impossible to me) yet to my knowledge it differeth not in any materiall circumstance: nay I
<pb facs="3"/> doe verily thinke that if I misse the truth, it is rather in the writing than in the preaching. Howsoeuer it be, I most humbly beseech your Honour to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe the patronage of this traduced Pamphlet: I must acknowledge it is presumption in me to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose vpon your Honour the scandall of countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing so suspitious a writing (for who knoweth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it shal gaine the approbation of the godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when it commeth to their censure?) but for that your Lordship had the managing of the cause of difference betwixt my accusers and me concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this occasion, and for that your Honour so wisely and charitably compounded the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie on both parts to the contentment of either of vs; your Lordship might iustly challenge a greater title herein, than any other whatsoeuer: wherefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it proue a troublesome burthen, I beseech your Honour not to refuse it: the rather for that the honourable interest which your Lordship hath in the affections and iudgements of men honestly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, will so farre preuaile, as to cleere your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the least spot of dishonour, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might accrew through the patronage of so dangerous a tractate: yet thus much I may be bold to assure your Lordship, that this Treatise passeth with approbation to the presse; and doth not shroud it selfe in <hi>tenebris,</hi> as if it either shamed or feared the light: which may be some reason to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your Honour the rather to receiue it into your Honourable protection: for my selfe I freelie confesse, there is in me no abilitie to declare my thankfulnes to your Lordship, otherwise than by
<pb facs="4"/> betaking my selfe by some such pamphlet to your Honours safe conduct: which if it shall please your Honour to affoord, I shall at all times acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my thankfulnes; and instantly pray for your Lordships continuance and increase in al true honor and happinesse.</p>
