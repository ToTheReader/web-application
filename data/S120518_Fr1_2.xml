afflicted <hi>London,</hi> mayest answere to them that see, and

Almightie hath brought thee now vnto aduersitie.
In which affliction I may speake with the Apostle,
<hi>wee are mindfull of your teares.</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 4.</note> And although as <hi>Paul</hi>
speaketh, we be absent in the flesh, yet are wee with
you in the spirit, <hi>Coll. 2. 5.</hi> kept from you for a season,
concerning sight, but not in the heart. <hi>1. Thess. 2. 17.</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
For we haue you in perfect memorie. <hi>Phil. 1. 3.</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
you in our hearts. <hi>2. Cor. 7. 3.</hi> And thus being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned
toward you, <hi>1. Thess. 2▪ 8.</hi> without ceasing,
God is my witnesse, (with the Apostle wee may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test)
we make mention of you alwaies in our prayers.
<hi>Rom. 9. 1. 10.</hi> Of thee ô <hi>London,</hi> with the Leuites of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
vnfeignedly I may speake, <hi>Psal. 137. 5. If I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
thee ô Ierusalem, let my right hand forget to play: If I doo
not remember thee, let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my
mouth.</hi> True it is, by the Riuers of <hi>Babel</hi> as it were wee
sit in a pleasant Countrey;<note place="margin">Ps. 137.</note> but neuerthelesse, here we
weepe, when we remember thee ô <hi>London;</hi> we hang
vp our harpes, and the pleasantnesse of the countrey
cannot stay our teares, remembring you that are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,<note place="margin">Heb 13. 3.</note>
as if we were afflicted our selues, weeping for
the Citie, as Christ did for <hi>Ierusalem, Luk. 19.</hi> and not
onely for you, but for our selues. <hi>Luk▪ 23. 28.</hi> How
could we feast, while the yron enters <hi>Iosephs</hi> soule in
the Citie? We are not <hi>Nero,</hi> singing and triumphing
when <hi>Rome</hi> is on fire, but as <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed for <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
and the Prophet for the peace of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> so
we for the peace of <hi>London.</hi> As for the Romish Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
the superstitious Papists, who reioyce at this
ours and your present calamitie, insulting ouer vs in
this land, and in others, preaching it vnto theirs pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
and muttering it priuately, that this deluge of
the plague is iustly broken through among vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we haue (as they speake) forsaken the religion
and profession of our forefathers; iustly we doo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
although it is falsely imputed to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
cause. What is this their accusation else, but
that old song of the superstitious Israelits, <hi>Ier. 44. 18. 19▪</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
Since wee left off to burne incense to the Queene of
heauen, we haue had scarcenesse of things, and haue
beene consumed by the sword and famine. Were not
also the good Christians in the time of <hi>Tertullian, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,
Arnobius,</hi> and others, in this manner vpbrayed
by the Heathens, who imputed to them the cause of
Pestilence, Warre, Invndations, Earthquakes, and
other troubles? But O yee blind sonnes of men, what
was the cause of the flood in the time of <hi>Noah?</hi> was it
the Religion of that time, or was it <hi>Noah</hi> the preacher
of righteousnesse? The Lord himselfe sheweth the
cause, <hi>Gene. 6. and 7. Chap.</hi> the sinnes of that age, and
the flood of iniquitie. For which like sinnes, both we,
and their professors also, as well as we at diuers times
haue felt this rod, and also at this present time in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
they doo taste of this smart-whip: which giueth
vs iust occasion to speake vnto them that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,<note place="margin">Iere. p 18.</note>
      <hi>Thine inuentions haue procured thee these things.</hi>
Remember O Lord the children of Edom (these su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Romanists) which speake,<note place="margin">Psal 137. 7▪ 8.</note> rase it, rase it to
the foundation thereof. <hi>O daughter of Babel worthie to
be destroyed.</hi> But from whence am I digressed? To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to the head of the race, where I first began, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to you my brethren with sighes, to whome, I
may vse the Apostles words,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2, 4.</note>
      <hi>In anguish of heart I write
vnto you with many teares.</hi> Of Prayer, of which this
treatise following doeth intreate: I may speake that
which <hi>Martha</hi> said vnto Christ, <hi>If thou hadst beene here,
my brother should not haue died.</hi> So likewise, if feruent
and humble prayer had beene amongst vs, we should
not haue suffered these things. But seeing wee are in
the flood, and that the waters are entred euen to our
<pb facs="4"/>
soules, <hi>Psal. 69. 1.</hi> Therefore behold, against this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
I send to you a delineation of the true Arke of
<hi>Noah,</hi> whereunto yee and we ought to flie to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
which is the name of <hi>Iehouah, Prou. 18. 10.</hi> the
little <hi>Zoar,</hi> and the Sanctuarie to hide and safegard
our selues.</p>
   <p>Two things beloued, may put you in minde this
yeere of two things. First, of <hi>Noah:</hi> Secondly, of <hi>Ionas</hi>
withered Gourd, vnto which your present calamitie
for diuers respects fitly may be compared.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first is, your great ioyes, preparations and
stately buildings in the beginning of the yeere, like
vnto the ioy, feasting, marrying, and building of those
who liued in the dayes of <hi>Noah, Matth. 24. Luke 17.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second is, the suddaine alteration which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
thereupon, like vnto the vnexpected flood and
deluge which came vpon the securitie of the olde
world. We liued before as in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> wee
are now as it were in the flood (the afflictions and
troubles of the sonnes of men being not vnfitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
vnto waters by the Kingly Prophet <hi>Dauid)</hi>
which prayer at this time London thou mayest make,
<hi>Saue me O God,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 69. 1.</note>
      <hi>for the waters are entred euen to my soule.</hi>
Seeing therefore, that thou with <hi>Ionas</hi> mayest say,
Lord, the floods compasse me about, what remaineth
but that we enter into the Arke to be preserued? Giue
me leaue beloued, by a comparison to shew you two
things, the flood wherewith ye are compassed about,
and the Arke which yee ought to enter.</p>
   <p>In the flood of <hi>Noah</hi> the holy Ghost noteth foure
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> things; First, the cause for which it was sent. Secondly
the time when it began. Thirdly, the cōtinuance of it.
<pb facs="4"/>
Fourthly, his decreasing. The cause of which, was
the sinne of that age, which was growen vp as a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
tree, producing diuers sower and deadly fruites.
The first was, the great securitie of the sonnes of God,
that is of those which made profession of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
eating and drinking, marrying and building,
<hi>Luke 17. 27.</hi> The second, their disobedience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Preacher of righteousnesse, and
of the long suffering of God,<note place="margin">Gene. 6. 1, 2.</note>
      <hi>1. Pet. 3. 20.</hi> The third,
their fornications, and vngodly alliances with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
and with that damnable race of <hi>Cain,</hi> without
respect either of family or Religion. The fourth, their
crueltie and oppression of their neighbours, <hi>Gene. 6.
11.</hi> and 13. Lastly, the corruption of their wayes, <hi>Gen.
6. 12.</hi> and because their wickednesse was great vpon
the earth. <hi>2. Sam.</hi> This is also the cause (to applie the
first to our selues) which hath mooued the Lord to
send this deluge of the Plague into the land, because
the selfe same sinnes did raigne among vs: and as it
was in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> so hath it beene in these
last dayes of the sonne of man:<note place="margin">Luke 27. 26.</note> and therefore seeing
a flood of iniquitie hath ouerwhelmed vs, hath not
this flood of the Plague iustly and suddenly ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vs?</p>
   <p>From the first let me leade you to the second, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
circumstance of the time, when the flood began, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the <hi>7. Chap. of Gene. ver. 11.</hi> In the second mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
the seuenteenth day of the moneth, which was
about the beginning of May, or as others say in April,
when all things did most flourish, and when it was
lesse expected, which suddennesse hath changed their
ioy into sorow. So likewise, to applie the second to vs,
<pb facs="5"/>
this deluge of the Plague began to encrease about the
beginning of May (as I haue noted) when all things
did flourish in the Countrey, and in the Citie, when
we were merrie as the sonnes of the old world, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
feasting, building, and erecting our armes tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vmphants,
when we lesse expected it, which hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
also our ioy into sorrow.</p>
   <p>And as <hi>Noahs</hi> flood caused them to flie vpon high
mountaines and trees that the waters should not
reach vnto them: So this deluge hath it not caused
thousands to depart into the Countrey farre and
neere to be preserued?</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> From the second I come to the third, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the flood, noted <hi>Gen. 7. 24. The waters couered,
and preuailed vpon the earth an hundreth and fiftie dayes</hi>
(which is about halfe a yeere) and then, in the end of
an hundreth and fiftie dayes the waters abated, <hi>Gene.
8. 3.</hi> which was in Nouember, reckning from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of them. To applie the third, our deluge
hath not yet preuailed an hundreth and fiftie dayes,
and I hope through the mercie of God, that it wil not
so long encrease and bee in his full strength and force,
(and yet O Lord, by the great flood of our iniquitie
we haue deserued a longer encreasing, <hi>But haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
vpon vs O Lord according to the multitude of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions,
Psal. 51. 1.)</hi> Let mee applie the fourth thing,
which is the decreasing of <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, noted <hi>Gen. 8. 5▪</hi>
and they decreased vntil the tenth moneth (which
was the moneth of December) this decreasing begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from Nouember, after the hundreth and fiftie
dayes. Our flood the Lord bee thanked, hath begun
reasonably to decrease in the moneth of September,
<pb facs="5"/>
and the Lord graunt that these waters from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
may not bee going and comming, but that
they may altogether decrease vntill the tenth month.
And as the tops of the mountaines which were coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
because of the flood, were seene in the tenth
moneth, <hi>Gene. 8. 5.</hi> which was in December: So the
Lord graunt, that the heads of the Citie, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and principall Citizens, which because of
this deluge haue beene couered, may be seene againe
in the Citie, the tenth moneth. Further, as on the
first day of the first moneth, <hi>Gene. 8. 13.</hi> the vpper part
of the ground was wholly drie, which was in March
and part of Aprill. So the Lord graunt that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
may in that moneth wholly bee dried vp, and
that there remaine not any reliques therof: if it please
him to remember vs in his mercie as hee did <hi>Noah,
Gene. 8. 1.</hi> Now that he may remember vs in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
let vs forsake the sinnes of the olde world, let the
flood of iniquitie which is broken through among vs
decrease, and wholly be dried vp. Great hath beene,
and extraordinarie (I doo confesse) the invndation
of the Plague this present yeere, and therefore let our
repentance bee great and extraordinarie. It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of many of the Aegyptians by <hi>Sozom, lib. 7. cap. 20.</hi>
that being terrified by the strange invndation of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
higher then the wonted maner thereof was, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
they condemned their ancient Idolatry, and
applied themselues to the worship of the liuing God:
So likewise, seeing that this deluge of the Plague hath
beene higher then the wonted maner, as the weekly
Bils doo shewe vnto vs, let vs bee terrified, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
our ancient iniquities, let vs applie our selues
<pb facs="6"/>
to humble and feruent prayer, a principall part of the
worship of God. And as the Arke in the flood rested
vpon the high mountaines of Ararat, <hi>Gene. 8. 4.</hi> So
let vs in this flood rest vpon the Lord, and vpon the
holy mountaine of Heauen; the power and mercie of
our God, are the mountaines whereupon the Arke
may finde rest; those are the holy hils whereon Sion
hath her euerlasting foundation.</p>
   <p>Hauing shewed to you the flood, I come to the
Arke. The holy Ghost in the description of the Arke
into which <hi>Noah</hi> entred, <hi>Gene. 6.</hi> and 7. noteth these
fiue things. The Arke it selfe. The persons entring.
The cause why. The time when. The end wherefore.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the Arke, into which wee must enter, it is
not an Arke made of corruptible wood, nor an Arke
heere beneath sloating and tossing in the sea of this
world, but the true Arke of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the name of the Lord, that strong tower where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
the righteous runneth by the feete of prayer,
<hi>Prou. 18. 10.</hi> an immortall, eternall, and incorruptible
Arke. I know no surer refuge from the tempest, as
<hi>Esai</hi> speaketh, no safer harbour, and receptacle, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to repose your wearied soules.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The persons entring, were <hi>Noah</hi> and his family.
<hi>Noah</hi> the righteous, or the Preacher of righteousnesse
as he is called, <hi>2. Pet. 2. 5. Noah</hi> and his little family, the
remnant of the earth, as the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> termeth
them. Let vs with our families enter into the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Arke, and although they consist more then of
eightie and eight soules, yea of infinite, they cannot
fill this Arke, neither hinder one another, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
in the bulwarkes and fortresses of mortall
<pb facs="6"/>
men; but let vs be righteous <hi>Noahs:</hi> for how can wee
be else preserued? If wee enter as an impious <hi>Cham,</hi>
perhaps we shall escape a temporall flood, but not the
deluge of Gods eternall wrath.</p>
   <p>The cause moouing <hi>Noah</hi> to enter, was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of God, <hi>Gene. 7. 1. Enter, &amp;c.</hi> the same
cause ought to mooue vs to enter, it is the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of the most high, the Proclamation of the
King of heauen, <hi>Psal. 50. 15. Cal vpon me, &amp;c.</hi> And as in
the time of the olde world hee ordained himselfe an
Arke for <hi>Noah,</hi> so he hath himselfe prepared, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and ordained himselfe as an Arke and refuge for
the righteous <hi>Noahs.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The time when, was in the flood, <hi>Gene. 7. 7.</hi> So <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
      <hi>Noah</hi> entred, because of the waters of the flood: Are
not we in the flood?<note place="margin">Psal. 6. 9. 1.</note> Are not the waters entred euen
to our soules? And is it not therefore high time to
keepe our selues within this Arke?</p>
   <p>The end wherefore, (that he might bee preserued,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
      <hi>Gen. 6. 18, 19.)</hi> For the same ende let vs enter beloued,
to bee preserued from a threefold deluge, from the
flood of iniquitie wherewith our soules haue beene
ouerwhelmed; from the deluge of the Plague, that
calling vpon the name of the Lord, and seeking his
pesence the land may be healed, <hi>2. Chron. 7. 14.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from the deluge of Gods eternall wrath. Follow
therefore the obedience of <hi>Noah, Gene. 7. 6.</hi> who did
according vnto all that the Lord commanded him,
and was also remembred, <hi>Gene. 8. 1.</hi> Enter therefore
O yee righteous soules, let your miserie speake for
audience. The waues doo now smite and tosse your
ship; and as the tempest arose, <hi>Matth. 8.</hi> when they
<pb facs="7"/>
were a sleepe: So likewise this present tempest where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we are tossed, did arise when wee are a sleepe,
but arise,<note place="margin">Matth 8.</note> arise from the sleepe of securitie, call vnto
Christ with the Disciples, <hi>Maister saue vs, or else wee
perish.</hi> Cast your eyes on high (as the Marriner in the
tempest) <hi>Ad stellam polarem,</hi> on the right North starre
Christ Iesus, who is also the bright morning starre,
<hi>Apoc. 22. 16.</hi> And in the sea of these afflictions, <hi>Quite
you like men,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 13.</note>
      <hi>and be strong,</hi> (tis the Apostles precept)
begin you to the ores of the Spirit, inuocations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions
to the liuing God, praying as the Apostle
exhorteth, <hi>Ephe. 6. 18. With all maner of prayer and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
in the Spirit, with all perseuerance.</hi> The arme of
flesh is too weake to beare vs out, and if our strength
were brasse, it could not helpe vs: These are my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the onely ores which are able to row our ship
through all the stormes of the sea, (these vessels of our
bodies and soules I meane) and if the bankes of the
land doo faile vs, that is temporall health, they will

      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Giue mee leaue brethren in the second place, to
amplifie vnto you another comparison, not vnfit for
this time, for the suddaine alteration and estate of this
yeere, doth put me in minde not onely of the flood of
<hi>Noah,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ion. 4.</note> but also of <hi>Ionas</hi> Gourd. To enter therein, first
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our Citie (as yee all know) hath long bene, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
in the beginning of the yeere for diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
a flourishing Gourd, and as a greene Laurell
tree, wee had builded a Tabernacle of pleasures, yea
Arches, and Theaters, and some of the workes like
Babel. Prosperitie as a Gourd was come ouer vs, we
were sitting vnder the shadow of it, euery one as the
<pb facs="7"/>
Prophet speaketh vnder his vine,<note place="margin">Mic. 4. 4.</note> and vnder his figge
tree, none making vs afraide; and perhaps, (what doo
I adde perhaps?) Without doubt many of vs in this
our prosperitie haue spoken with <hi>Dauid,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 30. 6.</note> I said in my
prosperitie, I shall neuer be mooued. Secondly, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
reioyced exceedingly for the Gourd: So likewise
haue we reioyced exceedingly for this our prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
witnesse our feastes, our braueries, preparations,
and triumphs, (would to God that it had beene in
the Lord.) And as <hi>Peter</hi> was reioyced to be vpon the
mountaine,<note place="margin">Matth. 17.</note> saying, <hi>Maister it is good to bee here, let vs
make here three Tabernacles:</hi> whereas hee was but a
stranger, and knew that there was not the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Citie,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note>
      <hi>Heb. 13. 14.</hi> So although we know we are
but strangers in this life, yet we haue said to our flesh,
as <hi>Peter</hi> vnto Christ, let vs make here Tabernacles.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
And therefore as the Gourd of <hi>Ionas</hi> suddenly withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and his exceeding ioy was changed into sorrow:
so our ioyfull songs haue beene changed into lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,<note place="margin">Lam. 1. 16.</note>
and our pleasure hath beene quite dasht; the
Lord hath made vs to say with <hi>Ieremie, For these things
I weepe, and mine eye casteth out water.</hi> Hee hath made
others to say of thee, O London, as <hi>Ieremie</hi> of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
how doth the Citie remaine solitarie that was
full of people, shee is a widow, shee that was great
among the nations, her Priests sigh, her virgins are
discomfited, and shee is in heauinesse, <hi>Lam. 1. 1.</hi> And
hereunto I may adde that in the fifth verse, it is for
the multitude of her transgressions, for which her
people is now in diuers places scattered, liuing as it
were in exile and banishment, and sighing (as the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
did in Babel) when they remembred thee O
London. But the Lord hath giuen, and the Lord
<pb facs="8"/>
hath taken away, and hee that had power ouer the
blessings, hath also had power ouer the plagues,
<hi>Apoc. 6.</hi> As <hi>Ionas</hi> little thought of so speedie an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
so did we little expect such a sudden change; but
it was feared and also prophecied of many (as I my
selfe haue heard) and behold the trueth of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie.
<hi>Nullum violentem perpetuum.</hi> Some haue died
through immoderate ioy, as <hi>Diagoras</hi> of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and
others, and we (I may say) haue beene sicke through
immoderate ioy, and some dead. The sonnes and
daughters of England in this their exceeding ioy, did
little thinke of this sorrow, as the sonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Iob,</hi> when they were banquetting, did not
once dreame of the wind that came from the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and smote the foure corners of the house. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
which was called tender and delicate, and the
Lady of kingdomes, <hi>Ephe. 4. 7.</hi> which assumed to her
selfe, I am, and there is none else: I shall not sit a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
nor know the losse of children; did not imagine
how neere they were, that came with a contrarie
newes <hi>(Thine ende is come, Iere. 51.)</hi> Neither London
tender and delicate which hath vsed the same voice,
did expect to bee a widow for a time, and to see the
losse of her children by thousands. You the Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
and Epicures of these dayes, yee that haue moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
your Prophets and watchmen, as they did, <hi>Ephe.
21.</hi> saying to them, (yee speake of iudgement) haue
yee not a time of sorrow and darknesse, as yee haue
had a time of light and delights?</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The time when the Gourd withered, was when
the morning, or the Sunne did arise, in the comming
foorth of the Sunne, when the shadow of it should
<pb facs="8"/>
most haue pleasured him: So in the rising as it were
of the Citie (which by the death of our late Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
had beene as it were laide downe in the bed of
sorrow) and in the comming foorth of a new Sunne,
whose beames were comfortable to the whole land
(and the Lord graunt that he may long shine ouer
vs) euen then, when prosperitie could not haue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
the Citie, and all her inhabitants, then the
Gourd withered, and the worme of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
came. And as Christ wept ouer Ierusalem in
the midst of his triumph, when the people cried,
<hi>Blessed is the King that commeth in the name of the Lord,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 38.</note>
      <hi>when the multitudes did reioyce, and spred their cloathes in
the way:</hi> So the Lord hath giuen vs cause to weepe
ouer the Citie, when we were almost in the midst of
our ioyes and triumphes, when euery one was reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
and made preparations for the triumph, against
the entire of him, of whom we may say, as the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
of <hi>Dauid, Psal. 118. 26. Blessed be hee that commeth
in the name of the Lord.</hi> Let the conclusion of this point
be, all thy iudgements O Lord are number and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
thou knowed best the time when it is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
to inflict them.</p>
   <p>The meanes or the instrument (which is the fifth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
thing to bee considered) which the Lord vsed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
<hi>Ionas,</hi> and which hee sent as a messenger from
heauen, to smite the Gourd, was first (a worme)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
secondly, the wind and the Sunne. The worme, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and a base messenger, with weapons of no power,
and yet giueth a mortall blow, he that could haue
sent a great wind to turne it vpside-downe, a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to haue blasted it, or a whole armie of wormes,
<pb facs="9"/>
sendeth but one little contemptible worme to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
that businesse: So the Lord to beate downe the
pride and immoderate ioy of our Citie, the flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gourd of our prosperitie, hath not sent whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
deuouring beasts, Earthquakes, fire or brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
from heauen, he sendeth only a pestilence, litle
Carbuncles, spots, and tokens in our flesh, which
seeme to bee nothing, or to haue no force, and yet
suddainely they beate downe the proudest and the
strongest. Ist not strange that a little botch or carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
hath such admirable force? Well may they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Gods tokens, for thereby he sheweth his strength.
Let this serue on the one side, to make vs to stand in
awe of the mightie power of God, and on the other
side, adoring this his power, to humble our selues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Maiestie; for how darest thou O sonne of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
lift vp thy selfe against that Lord, who can cast
thee downe with a little carbuncle? Let not the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of this life make vs secure, and sitting vnder the
couert of them; let vs not say, we shal neuer be moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
for they are but Gourds, and the Lord hath a
worme of iudgement. And what is the freedom from
the rod of God, our dauncing to the Tabert &amp; Harpe,
but a Gourd for a time? I call to witnesse young men,
yee lustie gallants,<note place="margin">Iob. 12.</note> some of you haue had your Gourd
to reioyce in, <hi>Eccle. 11.</hi> the dayes of your youth, the
cheerfulnesse of your hearts, the lustes of your owne
eyes; but the Lords worme, the pestilence, hath smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
downe some of you. Rich men, some of you, haue
had your Gourd, your purple and fine linnen your
delicious fare euery day, <hi>Luk. 16.</hi> But this is withered
with your selues, and some of you lie in the graue.
<pb facs="9"/>
The worme then which the Lord had prepared for
this yeare, to change our ioy into sorow, is as now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
teacheth, the Pestilence, the King of heauens
Pursiphant; and therefore wee may crie with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<hi>Apoc. 14. With a lowde voice, feare God, and giue glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to him, for the houre of his iudgement is come.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
instrument which the Lord vsed, was the wind
and the Sunne, good creatures, created both for an
other ende, to gouerne the day, to giue light to the
world, to purifie the ayre, &amp;c. and yet they receiue a
commandement to beate vpon the head of <hi>Ionas,</hi> the
principall part of the body, wherein is the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole creature: the seate of the minde,
from whence the senses and neerenesse take their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
So the Lord hath commanded his Angel to
infect the ayre, to hunt &amp; annoy vs, both good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
erected to another end, to preserue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
vs, and yet behold he hath commanded them to
beate the very head, the principall part of the body of
his kingdome, our Citie I meane beloued, the seate
and imperiall Chamber of the Realme, from whence
the other members receiue their maintenance, which
redoundeth to the danger of the whole body, for
which the members and the daughters haue smarted,
and yet doo sigh for; which argueth that our sinnes
make the good creatures of God to become our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Seeing therfore the Lord hath smitten you that
are the head, let not the effects which it wrought in
<hi>Ionas,</hi> bee seene in you. First, faint not, although the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
force of heate is great, be steadfast, and aboundant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in the worke of the Lord, <hi>1. Cor. 15. 58.</hi> And I
would not brethren haue you ignorant, concerning
<pb facs="10"/>
them that are a sleepe, that ye sorrow not euen as they
which haue no hope, <hi>1. Thes. 4. 13.</hi> Be not ashamed of
the testimonie of our Lord, <hi>2. Tim. 1. 8.</hi> but suffer as
good souldiers of Christ, <hi>2. Tim. 2. 3.</hi> The Lord hath
not cast thee downe without reuocation of his fact, he
afflicteth thee not in his furie, but in his mercie, to doo
thee greater honour and fauour in the time to come,
if this in iudgement mooue thee. Let this heate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
your hearts with the fire of Gods loue, that the
Lord say not of vs, <hi>Amos 4. I haue smitten you with bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
      <hi>and burning, and you returned not.</hi> Secondly, be not
angrie and impatient, wish not desperately to die,
grudge not, nor repine at the Lord, but let your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
mind be knowen vnto all men, <hi>Phil. 4. 5.</hi> to whom
doo yee rather owe the quietnesse and subiection of
your spirits, then vnto him, who giueth both his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
vnto vs, to teach how easily hee can bestow
them, and taketh them away, that we may know how
little wee deserue them: with <hi>Ionas</hi> out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which did compasse him, call rather vpon the
name of the Lord, follow him not in his anger, but in
his prayer.<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 15.</note> I haue brethren (to vse the Apostles
words) somwhat boldly after a sort written vnto you,
as one that putteth you in remembrance thereof,
through the grace which is giuen me of God: but yet
as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1 13.</note>
      <hi>Wee write none other things vnto you,
then that yee reade, or else that yee acknowledge. For this I
say not by commandement, 2. Cor. 8. 8.</hi> But this say we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you by the word of the Lord, <hi>1. Thes. 4. 15.</hi> you haue
already entred this Arke, for wee haue heard of your
fasting, prayer, and liberalitie to the poore, how that
yee haue charged them that are rich in the world to
<pb facs="10"/>
doo good, and to be readie to distribute, <hi>1. Tim. 6. 17,
18.</hi> And therfore, although we are absent in the flesh,
yet are we with you in the spirit, reioycing and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
(tis the Apostles saying) your order, and your
steadfast faith in Christ, waiting for his appearing, <hi>1.
Cor. 1. 7. So continue in the Lord,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Col. 2. 4.</note>
      <hi>Phi. 4. 1. And be not weary
in well doing, 2. Thes. 3. 13.</hi> And I am perswaded of this
same thing, that hee that hath begun this good worke
in you, will performe it, <hi>Phil. 1. 6. Follow the zeale of
Abraham in his prayer for Sodome;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gene. 18.</note> the longer hee talked
with God, the more he gained. And as <hi>Abraham</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had begun to speake once, twise, &amp; thrice
vnto the Lord, yet he continued: Behold I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to speake vnto my Lord, and am but dust &amp; ashes,
let not my Lord bee angrie and I will speake againe:
So although yee haue begun to speake vnto the Lord
for <hi>London,</hi> that the fire might be quenched (yee that
may speake with <hi>Abraham,</hi> we are but dust and ashes)
yet speake againe, pray continually, <hi>Rom. 12.</hi> For the
Lord will not bee angrie, as hee was not angrie with
<hi>Abrahams</hi> instant request, but as he gaue him a patient
eare and a gracious answere, <hi>Ver. 32.</hi> so the same God
will heare our prayers. It pleaseth the eares of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
to be long intreated; he that hath twise and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
together ingeminated the riches of his mercie,
<hi>Exod. 34.</hi> The Lord, the Lord is mercifull, gracious,
slow to anger, aboundant in goodnesse and trueth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
mercy for thousands, forgetting iniquitie and
sinne: what did he meane thereby, but that twise and
tentimes together we should crie for his mercie. And
as <hi>Abraham</hi> by his continuance, and ingeminating
prayer, brought the Lord from fiftie to fortie fiue:
<pb facs="11"/>
from fortie fiue to fortie: from fortie to thirtie: from
thirtie to twentie: and lastly from twentie to ten: So
continue and ingeminate your prayer, endeuour by
your continuance to diminish the number, and to
bring it from thirtie foure hundreth to thirtie: from
thirtie to two hundreth: from twentie to ten: from ten
hundreth to ten persons: and yet not then cease to
speake vnto the Lords as <hi>Abraham</hi> did: and what shall
not your prayer obtaine? I may speake vnto you that
which <hi>Zedekias</hi> said to the Princes of his land; <hi>The
King can denie you nothing.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iere. 38. 5.</note> So the King of heauen will
denie you nothing. <hi>Zedekias</hi> spake it in a seruile and
popular affection that hee bare to the Princes of his
land, but God speaketh it out of the aboundance and
riches of his mercie. And therefore O Lord let thy
mercie triumph against iustice, that both great and
small, the infant and dumbe beast, may sing of thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
kindnesse. With this wish I will end beseeching
brethren for our Lord Iesus Christs sake, and for the
loue of the spirit, that ye would striue with vs by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God, <hi>Rom. 15. 13. Praying also for vs, Col. 4. 3.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
beloued,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13. 11.</note> fare yee well (it is the Apostles fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
to the Corinthians) bee of good comfort and of
one minde: The grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, and
the loue of God, and the comming of the holy Ghost
be with you all, <hi>Amen.</hi>
