      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the principall beautie, and countenaunce of Architecture, consistes in outward ornament of lights, so the inward partes are ever opposite to the eies of the beholder, taking more delight in the beauty therof, being cūningly wrought, then in any other garnishing within the same. To which purpose, is set downe in this, variety of draughts, some, ordinary and plaine, others, curious &amp; pleasant, and although, it may seeme to those that are expert in glazeing, that some of these draughts are needlesse, being so plaine and in vse, not deseruing in this sort to be published, yet notwithstanding here I doe in friendly cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie admonish, that it is most needefull, giuing choice to the builder, both for price, and draught of worke, which by no vnderstanding can the Glazier so sencibly demonstrate his freat, as by showing his examples of draught, for by such show, the builders shall vnderstand, what to make choice off, for whose ease &amp; furtherance only, I haue published this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of glazeing, knowing the expert maister is not vnfurnished of these v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall draughts, though each workeman haue not all of them.</p>
   <p>And for the further benefit of the practiser, there is herevnto annexed dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apring on each draught, either to be wrought or left, as it shall please the builder, most pleasant to all that are willing to haue the same: Therefore haue it not in light regard▪ for the vse thereof, will giue you great delight, and worthy to be practised, as a speciall ornament to building, and will beautifie the Glaziers worke, be they neuer so expert.</p>
   <p>So by obseruing the order and rules here set downe, the maister or worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shall not only see a plaine way, to imitate and follow those draughts, in glazeing and painting on glasse: but the simplest, and vnskild prentice, shall reape full and perfect vnderstanding thereby: praying the Almighty, to blesse your labours in following the same.</p>
