      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I had read ouer this litle treatise (right worshinful,) finding it for the nūber of strāge and mery reports, very recreatiue &amp; pleasant. I thought it no labor euill bestowed, to occupie my selfe in the translation thereof. And being moued thereto the rather, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that in Fraunce many deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein, being turned into their tongue, I fully determined to bring my former pretence to end: Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that besides much mirth, here is also a true discription of the nature &amp; disposition of sundrie Spaniards. So that by reading hereof, such as haue not trauailed Spaine, may as well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
<pb facs="3"/>much of the maners &amp; custonis of that countrey, as those that haue there long time continued. And being now finished, I was so bold as to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the fruite of my simple labor vnto your worship, who both for trauaile, dallie conference with diuers nations, and knowledge in al forein matters is knowen to be such a one, as is well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to iudge, whether these reports of litle Lazaro be true or not. Wherfore I most humbly beseech your worship fauorably to accept this poore present, (as offered of one) who wisheth vnto you and yours, all health, wealth, long life, with increase of al veruse &amp; vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: Trusting that after your vvaigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and important affaires, to case your tedious exercises, you vvill recreate your selfe vvith reading of some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant part hereof.</p>
