   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>MAy it please you amongst other bookes, some good, some
bad, to peruse this my <hi>YOVTHES WIT,</hi> Or
<hi>WIT OF GREENE YOVTH,</hi> in such sorte as they
were woonte to suruey the Tables of <hi>Phidias,</hi> and the Pictures
of <hi>Prazitiles,</hi> that had before seene the excellent workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe
of <hi>Appelles,</hi> betweene whome and the other, though
there were as greate difference, as betweene the least twinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Starre, and the Sunne it selfe, yet did they both like
of the one as they had cause, and looke on the other when
occasion serued. The praise that <hi>Homer</hi> purchased by his
skill in Poetrie, was not so great, that it could quite disgrace the
doinges of his Inferiors: For <hi>Meuius</hi> and <hi>Bauius</hi> (though
not so excellent) yet were they allowed for Poets of manie: some
haue desired to heare an Orator of euill vtterance, to the ende
they might afterwardes take the more pleasure, when they hard
one pleade, that could pronounce his wordes distinctlie, and with
good discretion. <hi>Cato</hi> the wise man of <hi>ROME,</hi> was wonte
oftentimes to vaunte, that he learned no lesse good by conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with fooles, and spying their faultes, then he gote wisdome by
the wysest, and those of best behauiour: And therefore, I am
thus farre to intreate you for this my simple worke, that if it be
not in your conceates, worthy to be likened to <hi>Appelles</hi> Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornes,
ye will vouchsafe, at idle times, to gaze vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, as a table
of <hi>Phidias</hi> or <hi>Praxatiles.</hi> If it beare not the beautie of a sunne
beame, then liken it to the least starre that shineth. If it be not
comparable to <hi>Homers</hi> poesie, that was taken as a sufficiente
dowrie with his daughter in mariage: yet permit it to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of some, as were the verces of <hi>Bauius</hi> and <hi>Meuius,</hi> If it
taste nothinge at all of a good Orator, yet accepte of it, till a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
come in place. If it teache no wise conceate, yet esteeme of it
as a patterne of my foolish conceate, wherby such as haue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente,
may conceaue (if they will) a platforme of some wisdome.
Beare with me, I pray you, though I seeme in this linking of my
lines together, halfe to riddle with you, and accepte my good
will, For I haue beene as much troubled in contriuing these my
conceites, as they that buylde castles in <hi>SPAYNE</hi> (as the
French Prouerbe vnderstandeth it) Or, as a Henne with two
Chickens, And so fare ye well.</p>
