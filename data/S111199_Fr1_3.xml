   <head>THE PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> might seeme (gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to haue attempted a needeles work in setting forth sentences of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which (God be thā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) through daily reading and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching are nowe rife in euery mans mouth: but the causes mouing me thereto, are before alleaged in mine epistle. And in deede I haue set forth nothing but Scripture: gathering the places as the chapters and bookes are placed in the Bible: and in the same translation which is commonly vsed and by authoritie approued. Which places being well considered, may geue vs to vnderstand, that God of his goodnes, hath layd before vs through his diuine wisedom, not only our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towarde him, and right beleefe in him: but also in some part or other of the scripture, how we ought to deale
<pb facs="7"/> in worldely affayres, yea more then that, what dyet we ought to keepe in eating &amp; drinking, yea what maners we ought to vse both at the table and els where. So that the Bible may seme to containe all thinges necessary to be knowen of vs any maner of way. But may we not learne wisedome other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where then in the scripture? yes tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet so as S. August. writeth <hi>de doct. Christ. cap. vlt. Quicquid homo extra di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicerit, si noxium est, hic damnatur: si v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile est, hic inuenitur: &amp; quum ibi quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que inuenerit omnia, quae vtiliter alibi didicit, multo abundantius ibi inueniet ea, quae nusquam aliter inuenire potuit.</hi> And certes, in the reading of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Iesus Syrach, I founde di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sayinges, which be also red in prophane writers, as in the Prou. 22.<note place="margin">Prou. 22.</note> Teach a childe in his youth what way he should goe, &amp;c. The like is in the Poet Horace. <hi>Quo semel est imbuta re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens seruabit odorem testa diu.</hi> In Eccle. What manner of man the ruler of the<note place="margin">Eccle. 10.</note>
      <pb facs="7"/> citie is, such are they that dwel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in also. The same is alleaged by Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro out of Plato. <hi>Quales in republica principes, tales reliqui solent esse ciues.</hi> And in Eccle. 12. In heauines &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a man shall know his friende. The same is vsed of Cicero in Lelio. <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus certus in re incerta cernitur.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise may be sayde of a greate number moe. Whereby are vnderstande that the same God which gaue wisedome abundantly vnto Salomon, hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise powred some sparkes of wisdom into heathen mens hearts, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to if they had ioyned true knowledge of God, then had they bene wise men in deede. Yet are not they so greatly to be blamed as those Christians, at least wise by name, (though in deede much worse then heathen or Infidels) which reading and hearing the true wisedome of God, doe vtter in doing most deuilish policie. Nay many eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish<note place="margin">Anglus Italiatus.</note> men being Italianate, doe proue the prouerbe true to be deuils incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
<pb facs="8"/> hauing more delite in the prince of darkenes, set forth by Machiauell,<note place="margin">Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.</note> or his discourse leading headlong to hell, then in Gods word, which is the well of wisedome, or the euerlasting cōmaundementes, which are the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance vnto it. So that a man may see great difference in wisedome, which also is noted in Ecclesiasticus 19. after<note place="margin">Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticus 19.</note> this maner: The feare of God is all vvisedome, and he that is a rightwise man keepeth the law. As for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of wickednesse, it is no wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and the prudence of sinners is no good vnderstanding: it is but wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and abomination, &amp; blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of wisedom, which also is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the heathen Philosopher Plato: <hi>Scientia quae est remota à iusticia, callidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas potius quam sapientia est appellanda.</hi> Yet nowe a dayes, vice beareth the name of vertue. Subtiltie I say, hath the countenance of wisedom, yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those which (as men say) be no small fooles. But God in the ende, as
<pb facs="8"/> S. Paule witnesseth, Corin. 1. will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy<note place="margin">Corin. 1.</note> the wisedom of the wise, and wil cast away the vnderstanding of the prudent. For the foolishnes of God is wiser then men: and the weakenesse of God is stronger then men. God graunt that the wise of the world, may in the ende be as the foolish whom God hath chosen. Yea as Socrates &amp; Plato with some other of the best and wisest Philosophers, whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their mis beleefe, God of his infinite mercy hath recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to grace, as Iustine the Martyr, S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue iudged.</p>
