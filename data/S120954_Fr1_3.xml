   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore thou readest</hi> this small trauaile of mine,
(gentle Reader) I am a little to admonish thee, least other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise thou maist happen to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out of loue with my Booke, and so thinke it not woorthy the reading. Fyrst, thou art to consider, that the Ditties heerein contained, are made to seuerall set Notes, wherein no measure of verse can be obserued, because the Notes will affoorde no such libertie: for looke how they rise and fall, in iust time and order of Musique, euen so haue I kept course therewith in making the Ditties, which will seeme very bad stuffe in reading, but (I perswade me) wyll delight thee, when thou singest any of them to thine Instrument. Secondlie, though thou finde them not sette downe in excellent verse, as perhaps many are curious in sifting such matters, yet I am sure thou shalt finde in them sence sufficient, and matter woorth the reading: though not fantasticall, and full of loue quirkes &amp; quiddities, vet stored with good admonitions and freendly documents, so canst thou not say, that there is neither time not reason in them, but if thou marke them wel, thou shalt finde both.</p>

      <pb facs="7"/> Lastly, if any Dittie shall chaunce to lympe a little in the Note (as I doo not know that any one of them dooth, because they haue beene tryed by them of iudgment, and those that haue not a little esteemed of them) yet I pray thee condemne mee not, in that I haue no iote of knowledge in Musique, but what I haue doone and doo, is onely by the eare: for had I skill in Musique, they should haue beene farre better then they be. But I thanke God of that which I haue, it is not for euery man to goe to <hi>Corinth,</hi> therefore I content my selfe with that poore Talent which I haue, &amp; which is thine to commaund, so thou entertaine my labours with courtesie. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
