   <head>To the Protestant Reader.</head>
   <p>Be it very farre from the seruants of God that they should mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake me, or conceiue any sinister opinion of my indeuors, as if I dealt too fauorably with the Papists. For they ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of mine intent &amp; purpose, which is not to exasperate and prouoke them to anger, but to perswade thē, which I cannot do by bitter speeches, neither yet by burdening them with any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths. The spirit of meeknes doth best become Christ his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and the worde of God hath taught me to deale charitablie with all men, but especially to restore them which haue fallen, by gentlenesse, not to breake the brused reede, nor to quench the smoaking flax. That I am not of their mind this booke testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth sufficiently enough. That I do not make more fauourable constructions of their Doctrine than truth and veritie doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, their doctrine it selfe doth shew. How much I discent from them, my Sermon doth witnesse which I preached at S. <hi>Paules</hi> Crosse about eight yeares since and published in print, wherein I shewed that the state of the Papacie was Antichrist. In it I set downe, as I hope, though a briefe, yet a full and perfect state of the question; what was wanting in words, by reason of the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of time, was supplied in substance, I answered all obiections out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Sanders</hi> which were of moment, that it might be an helpe to others which should aferward deliuer the same againe in more wordes, and larger volume. The God of al wisdome and knowledge direct their harts and mindes to the true knowledge of his worde through Iesus Christ our Lord. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
