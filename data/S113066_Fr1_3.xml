   <p>BEcause sundry supposed these Collections might be offensiue to the Lord chief Iustice of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and the Prelates: the Authour (though after diligent paines therein taken) would not publish them. They therefore comming to my handes by occasion, I thought it a great iniurie to suppresse them, and so the godly to bee depriued of that benefite which no doubt may come by them. Not that I would be more careles in offending then the Authour, but that I presume the right Honorable L. chief Iustice will take no offence to be admonished and rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a matter so highly touching not onely the good name of one man, but euen the credit of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, and the glory of Christ him selfe: and wherein his L. hath had and is to haue an especiall stroke, but as yet by the iniurious dealing of some of the Prelates (especially the L. B. of Lond.) hath not fully nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently heard the same. Hoping the rather of his L. patience heerein, for that his H. (since the last hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the matter at Lambeth on Whitson eve last) namely in his circuit in Suff. did heare euidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto him, that a Maid there was handled and tormented very grieuously, in many things as <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> and the rest were. Whether it may be called Possession or Obsession, or any other proper name, I for my part will not strive, (neither is it materiall) but will leaue it to bee decided by the learned. Onely this may suffice, that they were fearfull and straunge vexations of the Devill in Gods displeasure against vs, whiche could not possibly be done by any humane
<pb facs="6"/>
wayes or means whatsoeuer: which is the very maine point in controversie. For the further and more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest clearing whereof, and for the satisfying of all such as are indifferently carried in this cause, I haue thought good to adde to the ende of this Treatise, a brief Narration of those accidentes which befell the said Maid in Suffo. Wherein neither M. Dorr. nor any of his friendes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ad dealing, and therefore the more materiall for their clearing in their cause.</p>
   <p>Presuming therefore on the lawful fauour of that Honorable &amp; worthy Iudge, I am withall the rather imboldned to publish these Collections. First, because (being my self an eare-witnes at Lambeth on Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son eve last, when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>llegations in this Treatise mentioned were obiected against M. Dorrell, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither with an indifferent minde to be satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the truth (yea rather I protest mistrusting M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Dorr. then otherwise) I heard and saw to my great grief, that he co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ld not be permit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed (although very humbly &amp; earnestly he intreated the same) to make his particular defences to the said allegations as they were laid to his charge: but was still fro time to time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ut off by the L. B. of London especially, in the very materiall &amp; maine pointes which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ended to his clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring yea also in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se which the L. chief Iustice (ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honorably) seemed desirous to be satisfyed in. Who would now &amp; then giue him leaue to speak yet could not heare him to any purpose, being still interrupted by the L. B. of Lond who fed him with these wordes, <hi>Staye, heare another matter, you shalbe heard at large anon. &amp;c.</hi> and yet not then ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffred him to make his apologie, saue only to an obiection or 2. Which was to so good purpose, &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="7"/>
so directly to his clearing in the waightiest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters against him, that I doubt not if he had bene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to proceede in the rest, he would haue satisfied or at least giuen cause of suspense vnto the H. and Wor. there assembled. But being in the chief ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ter and that which touched the quicke, the L. B. of Cant. or Lond. interrupted him saying, My LL. I thinke i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> not fit he should be suffered thus to goe on. For what cause, I doubt not but those of discretion both did and can iudge well enough.</p>
   <p>Another reason and that (not the least) mooving me to publish this Treatise, is because I heare that the L. of Lond. is writing a booke against M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dorell. Now I doubt not these Collections will in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure (though briefly) answer all the obiections of any moment which he shall publish. Onely we doubt that he will, as he did at the said last hearing, curt all the Depositions of such persons as by reexamining may seeme in some things to make against M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Dorell, (which yet in some thinges being layde togeather doe make much for him) leaving out altogeather that which by the same Deponents might serue to cleare him any way. Which thing if he doe againe, it will proove but a trick of his <note n="*" place="margin">In his booke of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>ting &amp;c.</note>wonted dealing, and will do him small pleasure or credit in the end. And I doubt not M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Dorell will (if he may be permitted) suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently defend him selfe at large, if occasion require. In the meane time this smal discourse may serve I trust, in some steed, sith he being a Prisoner, can not do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> what he would, or in reason he should. Septemb. 30. 1599.</p>
