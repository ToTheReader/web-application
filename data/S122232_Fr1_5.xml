   <head>The Authors Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough <hi>Strabo</hi> doo write, that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges touching matters of <hi>Persia,</hi> had alwaies but small credit euen vntill his time: and therefore it may seeme likely, that I, who haue taken vpon me to wryte such thinges as haue happened in those cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ries within the space of nyne yeares, ought greatly to feare lest these my writinges should haue the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same successe, that they had: yet I haue thought it necessary to aduertise the reader, that for that respect I did not surcease, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to publish this my history, (though indeed for dyuers other wantes and defectes it may seeme peraduenture not soe worthy to appeere before the learned persons of this present age:) But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen for the selfe same cause, it may rest assured, that without manifest wrong &amp; iniury it cānot be despised or discredited. For if those former <hi>Historiographers</hi> (if algates they were euer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that name) haue deserued, that little credit should be yelded vnto them: this default was imputed vnto them not for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite or reproch, but in iustice and in reason: because (as <hi>Strabo</hi> himselfe saith) they louing more to delight then to profit, inserted many fictions &amp; many fables in the truth &amp; purity of the History. And so the things that happened in deed, being mingled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused with such as were cogged and fained, they that read them, could not be so truly enformed of those aduentures and actions, as
<pb facs="7"/>
they desyred, and peraduenture as they had great neede at that time to be instructed in. But I haue written this history, with a full and sound resolution, neuer to decline from the truth, &amp; not to suffer, that vpon any occasion whatsoeuer, any thing should bee discoursed therein, but that which eyther I my selfe haue seene, or possibly could vnderstand to be true. Wherein, although I haue found many difficulties and vsed great labours, (aswell through the ignorance of the people, who being not able to tell me any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name of the Cittyes, of the cuntries, of the fieldes, of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, &amp; of the hilles, but onely the barbarous names of them, they made the certaine knowledge of those places, wherein these battells were foughten, to be very difficult vnto me: As also because it was very requisite, that I should haue an eie to the seuer all qualities of dyuers nations, who are sometimes giuen to lying, and by whom many thinges are wont to bee spoken, and many thinges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, for their owne particular respectes.) Notwithstanding I haue endeuored by all the best meanes I possibly could, to discharge my duty therein, ouercomming these &amp; such other difficulties, with continuall conference among dyuers men in dyuers places, to the end I might find them agree together in their reportes, and expecting withall, that Tyme it selfe would at last bring forth the truth. Neither did I euer content my selfe with the first or second aduertisement deliuered vnto me, but alwaies iustified the first with the last, by conferring together the testimonies of both sides. And lastly, without regard of danger, of expenses, or of labour, I haue enformed my self of euery particularity, that possibly I could, by such men, as were esteemed no liers, but men of great authority, who were present for the most part at al these actions. Which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and resolution of myne, was greatly fauoured and assisted by three priuate &amp; extraordinary meanes. First, by the credit and authoritie of <hi>Theodoro Balbj,</hi> and <hi>Giouanni Michele,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the right honorable Consulles in <hi>Soria</hi> for the Venetian
<pb facs="7"/>
Senate, two most noble, prudent, and valorouse subiectes of the State of <hi>Venice:</hi> who most magnificently without sparing of any costes did fauour me herein, &amp; in all my other studies, where, vnto I applyed my selfe in those countries. Secondly by the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar conuersation which I had with one <hi>Christoforo de Buonj,</hi> cheefe Interpreter to the said most honorable Lordes, a person of great valour, well frended and beloued among those nations, and aboue all, of singular faith and dexterity. Thirdly, by my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Phisicke, which I was not squemish to practise among those people, to the end I might the better, &amp; without ministring any suspition to any man, enter into their most secret &amp; important aduertisementes: and so by this meanes to purchase familiarity in the principall howses of those Citties, wherein for the space of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most seuen whole yeares together, I liued and was entertayned. And of thus much it shall be euen sufficient to haue aduertised the readers, who without any other Apologie or iustification of mine, mayrest contented and satisfied with my desyre, which hath beene to represent vnto the world Accidentes, that haue happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so far off, so strange, and so important, that thereby they may reape great profit both in peace and warre. Which satisfaction if I shall obtaine of their gratitude, I shall thinke my selfe to haue gayned enough, in lieu of all the trauelles, of all the dangers, &amp; of all the expences, that I haue susteyned, &amp; I shall rest assured that I haue not beene an vnfruitfull labourer herein.</p>
