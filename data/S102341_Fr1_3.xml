                 <title>The fal of Babel : By the confusion of tongues directly proving against the Papists of this, and former ages; that a view of their writings, and bookes being taken; cannot be discerned by any man living, what they would say, or how be vnderstoode, in the question of the sacrifice of the masse, the reall presence or transubstantiation, but in explaning their mindes they fall vpon such termes, as the Protestants vse and allow. Fvrther in the question of the Popes supremacy is shevved, how they abuse an authority of the auncient father St. Cyprian, a canon of the I Niceene counsell, and the ecclesiastical historie of Socrates, and Sozomen. And lastly is set downe a briefe of the sucession of Popes in the sea of Rome for these 1600 yeeres togither; ... By Iohn Panke</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> That hitherto bin your courses (poore se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Bretheren) by the charge that your Masters haue laid on you, to refuse all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of conference with vs, or to read any of our treatises or books, that do any way tend to the crossing of your opinions; which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose as it taketh away all sounde iudgement which may anie way come vnto you; so it hath given me for my part a ful &amp; a resolute determination never to beleeue, but that by that policy they only would vphold the drift of their religion, &amp; that they feare it woulde fal, if it shoulde come to trial. To meete with this mischiefe on your part, I haue taken a labor not vsual, to win you if it be possible to reading; I haue laide almost forty of your owne writers togither, some our owne countrymen here at home, others the best of your side that ever wrot: The Catologue of their names and editions of their books (that so you be not deceiued) I haue noted vnto you in the next pages following; I haue compared them in three of the principal questions betweene you and vs. <hi>The sacrifice of your Masse; Reall presence, or transubstantiation, and Popes supremacy,</hi> and do protest I never did, nor yet do thinke any man living is able to take those authors, and proue any of those points by them, or can draw out a plaine and simple forme of speech how they would bee vnderstoode in any of those questions. I am not ignorant, neither do I make your teachers so simple, but you and they can say,
<note place="margin">This they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue in grosse</note>
      <note place="margin">1</note>
      <hi>you offer vp the sonne of God to his father, and that is your Masse;</hi>
      <note place="margin">2</note>
      <hi>you haue him really present, and so you eate him, and that is your sacrament. And</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <note place="margin">3</note>
      <hi>that the Pope is Christs Ʋicar, and that is your beliefe;</hi> All this I beleeue you can say, but this is not that which you ought to seeke at your teachers hands; For come to explane, what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement your Masse hath with that which Christ did at his last supper, the night before he suffered: And what that was, which he did at his last supper, and what the morrow on the crosse; And what your Masse is to either, or both. When we aske discourse vpon this, here they stagger and turne like madde men, as though it did belong to them only to affirme what they lusted, and yeeld no account of what they say; or indeed as though they knew not what to say:
<note place="margin">Harding. What wordes are there, and what termes, are not there? Stapleton. Not as vpon the Crosse, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plane and proue. How is it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy? The Rhemists say, that the same bloud that Christ shed on the Crosse, is in the chalice, at Masse. Dureus saith, the sacrifice of the Masse, is not without bloud in it; but is offered with out shedding of bloud. Cōt. Whit. rat. 4. fol 183. what shoulde the bloud do ther if it be not shed? How the Pope claimeth his supremacy, is doubted of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</note> Being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded where be the words of scripture by which the Priest hath power to offer vp Christ to God his father, they answere <hi>there be words that set forth an obligation in act and deede, but no termes expressed,</hi> a solution to a question, much like the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction givē by a Miller to a passenger; who bid him leaue the bottome, and ride the lower way betweene the two hils. What difference is there betweene word and tearms? Can any man distinguish? The Church offereth a daily sacrifice, not as vpon the crosse, but the selfesame thing that was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the crosse. The thing offered is one selfe same sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; <hi>but in the manner of doing, because it is vnbloudy,</hi> it is in the remembrance of it. A real presence, they and you are sure of; but what Christ did at his last supper to force that real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, none of you know. What he tooke, what he blessed, what he brake, what he gaue, whereof he spake, whē he said, <hi>Take eate, this is my body,</hi> that you know not, nor are ever able with al the wits you haue to explane. In the Popes suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, you do the like; no man amongst you whatsoeuer, is able to determine, whether he claime his <hi>superioritie and rule iure divino</hi> by Gods Law, yea or no; because some of you say yea, and some no; or whether he may called <hi>vniversall bishop. Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi> denieth it, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alloweth it, which shall we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue? So that refusing our bookes, if you wil but read your owne, you shal content me. Reade them, fift them, compare<pb facs="7"/>them, if not with ours, yet one with an other, try whither I be an Impostor or; if you finde them constant, plaine and sincere, follow thē on Gods name, I wil neuer perswade you otherwise; but if you perceiue them inconstant, intricate and darke, so that you vnderstand not their meaning, think they may deceiue you, thinke that their words in conference are more cunningly placed, then their arguments are in dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when they are driven to proue; in the one they saie to you, what they please; and in the other they must proue what they can. I do freely protest vnto you, I impute not this to the disability of the men; if they had a right cause in hand, they could easily make it good, but as
<hi>Lactantius</hi> saide of <hi>Tully,</hi>

I wil not bee found in this impudently to belie anie of your writers, with more then is to bee found in the verie pages of their bookes, (as your men deale by vs) but what I laie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thē, be ye sure there to finde it.

But how are both these articles of private masse, and halfe communion, proued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst B. <hi>Iuell</hi> and vs, by one example; of what a silly boy did giue to a <hi>sicke</hi> mā at his house in a case of necessity; The boy, because the Priest was sicke, brought from him a little of the sacrament and gaue it the old man? Do not these men lacke the practise of the Church for their warrant, that wil obtrude such examples? The story is to be read in <hi>Eusebius</hi> in Greeke, Latine, and English, and therfore there can be no mystery in it, except men desire to be abused. What saith <hi>Eckius</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb facs="9"/>praier vnto Saints departed, which doctrine is of great moment in the church of Rome, <hi>Explicitè non est praecepta san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum invocatio in sacris literis?</hi> The invocation of Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted is not expressed in the holy scriptures;
<note place="margin">This inuocatiō of Saints can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proued net her by the old Testamēt, nor by the newe.</note> Not in the old Testament (saith he) for the Iews were prone to Idololatry; and vnder the Gospel, it was not commanded, least the Gē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that were converted and beleeued, should thinke, they should bee brought againe to the worship of Earthly Gods. Further, (saith he) if the Apostles &amp; Evangelists had taught the Saints had bin to haue bin worshipped, it would haue argued great arrogancy in thē, as if they had sought renowne after death; therfore the Apostles would not by the expresse scripture teach the calling vpon Saints. Thus far <hi>Eckius.</hi>

<hi>Saunders</hi> reako<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this amongst other things to be the words of God,

In the first age of the world, as God gaue Laws to our Fathers without wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, so hee gaue them memories which serued in steede of books; the defects of that kinde of teaching, being knowne vnto him he relieued it by often iterating of one thing, &amp; by putting thē in minde of onething often. After this grew the vse of writing as meanes more durable to preserue the laws of God from oblivion and corruption, as the liues of men grew the more to be shortned: therfore is
<hi>Moses</hi> said to write al <hi>the words of God,</hi> and vnto the Evangelist S. <hi>Iohn</hi> expresse Charge is giuen <hi>Scribe,</hi>

If this part of the doctrine of the Church of Rome <hi>in praying to Saints</hi> be without al warrāt of holy scripture as <hi>Eckius</hi> and
<hi>Saunders</hi> do allow; how much to blame are they,
<note place="margin">Dureus Conf.

If it were an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual thing with the Iews to pray vnto Saints: how said <hi>Eckius</hi> that the Iewes had it not in vse, because they were prone to idololatry, and to whom should they pray? The fathers of the old testament, (saith he also) were in <hi>Limbo,</hi> in hel; The Iews that said Christ called on
<hi>Elias,</hi> did deride &amp; mocke him: &amp; so do the Papists abuse vs,
<note place="margin">Matth. 27.47.</note> that alleadge the holy scriptures to such purposes; But into how many shapes, wil they turne this one parcel of scripture and make it serue more waies thā one?
<hi>Saunders</hi> alleadgeth it for the service in an vnknowne tongue, because the Iews seemed to mistake Christ.
<note place="margin">De visib. mon. l. 7. fo. 679. for the seruice in an vnknowne tongue</note> How neere that speech of Christ on the crosse commeth either in favour of <hi>praying to Saints: or to the service in an vnknown tongue,</hi> I wil not sticke even now to make themselues iudges.

<hi>Alphonsus</hi> doth <hi>Polidore Virgill</hi> confirme out of
<hi>Fisher,</hi> who was bishop of Rochester, in these words: No Divine doth at al doubt (saith he) whether there be purgatory, but yet among the ancient fathers, there is no mention at al of it, or very seldome, yea euen the Greekes to<pb facs="10"/>this day beleeue it not, for so long as there was no care for purgatory <hi>nemo quaesivit indulgentias, no man sought after pardōs,</hi> for vpon that dependeth all the credit of <hi>Pardons.</hi>
      <note place="margin">No purgatory no pardons.</note> So may they both be left, as having no ground in the word of God.

<note place="margin">3</note> and damne them to the pit of hel, not suffering them to read one of them.

<note place="margin">4</note> by written notes of their owne gathering;
<note place="margin">5</note> if they chance to admit them to the prints, they shal then haue such prints, as they haue newly set for the purpose; the ancient copies being altered. Then they haue a devise to shew them counterfait writings of the Fathers and Doctors, such as they never wrote, insteed of true; and therefore learned and vnlearned,
<note place="margin">6</note> scholler or not scholler had need take heed to them in that. And whē they are hardly pursued, out comes the
