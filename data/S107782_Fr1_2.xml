   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE present state of
these our dayes, and
the honourable, and
reuerent loue, that
euery one of vs sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes
oweth to so
gratious a Prince, as
GOD in mercy hath
set ouer vs: hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
this small worke
to be persented vnto
thee (gentle Reader.) For, it carrieth in it selfe,
and bringeth vnto thee a ripping vp, and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foulding
of that seditious BVL of <hi>Pius Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius,</hi>
that was set vp and published by FELTON, a
rebellious traitour, in the twelfth yeare of hir Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
raigne, to withdraw thee from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and loue that thou owest to hir Maiestie, to
hir Lawes and godlie proceedinges, and to this
Realme thy deare Countrie.</p>
   <p>To whiche is also adioined an other Treatise of
the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> Wherein is shewed thee the
<hi>authoritie,</hi> and the <hi>profit,</hi> and the <hi>pleasure,</hi> and the
<hi>necessitie</hi> of the <hi>word of God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Both these, the reuerend Father in GOD, D. IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WEL,
late Bishop of SARVM, deliuered to that
<pb facs="3"/>
Church and people: in the great care he had to do
his Maisters seruice, &amp; to keepe the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his charge, from incurring such offence
to GOD, or vndutifulnes to hir <hi>Maiestie,</hi> or their
own euerlasting damnation. His meaning herein
was good toward thē: &amp;, not doubt but they reapt
the comfortable fruit of his godlie trauailes. The
like mayest thou gather to thy selfe, by direction
of the same his speeches thus drawn into short and
compendious forme: if thou wilt reade them with
diligence and iudgement.</p>
   <p>If thou learne to humble thy selfe before GOD,
and to seeke wisdome of hym: if thou searche the
<hi>scriptures</hi> and make them thy guides to leade thee
through the desert and wide sea of this life, as thou
arte aduertised by the <hi>later:</hi> thou shalt soone espie
the daunger of all such practises towardes disloial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
aud rebellion, whereto the BVL driueth thee,
which is disclosed in the <hi>former.</hi> For, it is not only
sayde by the wise man,<note place="margin">Prou. 1.</note>
      <hi>The feare of the Lorde is the
beginning of wisedome:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ierem. 8.</note> but also set down by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;
<hi>They haue reiected the word of the Lord, and what
wisedome is in them?</hi> that is, therefore men become
foolish, and do such things as are vnmeete, because
they care not for the word of God: and therefore
<hi>Dauid</hi> in his experience so confesseth,<note place="margin">Psa. 119.</note> that <hi>by the
commaundemēts of God he was made wiser than his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and had more vnderstanding than al his teachers:
because the testimonies of the Lord were euer with him,
and he did meditate them.</hi> If thou settle thy heart to
like and do those things which please God, if thou
haue the loue of his word, hee wil teache thee the
way wherein thou shouldst walke in obedience to
<pb facs="3"/>
him, and in dutie to hir Maiestie our dread Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
his seruant.</p>
   <p>I trust thou wilte take good instructions out of
these twoo Treatises to thy <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>zeale</hi> to them
both: and be thankful to God for that learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who hath lefte a light vnto thee, both in ex-example,
and by these and other his workes. whose
steppes if thou shalt follow, thou shalt liue godly,
and die with comforte, as a good seruaunt of thy
mercifull GOD and <hi>Father.</hi> The benefites of his
great trauailes taken in time of his life, are thine.
And vnto the ende, he ceassed not to continue in
the faith whiche he before professed. For (as I, one
of many yet liuing, can testifie) in the daye and
night before his departure out of this worlde, hee
expounded the <hi>Lordes prayer,</hi> and gaue short notes
vpon the 71. <hi>Psalme,</hi> to such as were by him. He
thought good to say somwhat at that time, of his
Bookes written by him, and set forth in Print; and
also of his Preaching. In both which seruices done
by him to the glory of God, and thy comfort: he
made protestation of his good conscience, whiche
euen then, as he declared, witnessed and shoulde
witnesse with him before God, that he dealt sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and plainely: hauing God only before his eies,
and seeking the defence of the Ghospel of Christ,
and that the truth thereof might bee opened and
maintayned. And farther gaue thankes to God
that made him his seruaunt in so greate a worke;
and then visited him by this messenger of death,
whiles he was doing the message of God, in visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Dioecese: that then hee called him to reste
from his labours, when his weake body was spent
<pb facs="4"/>
and worne out in setting forth the glory of God,
for which he many times prayed, it woulde pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
God to let him be offred in sacrifice.</p>
   <p>Hee was at that time verye feruent in <hi>Prayer:</hi>
which he poured out before the Lord aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in great faith: crying often, <hi>Lorde let thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
now depart in peace. Lord let thy seruant now come
to thee. I haue not so liued, that I am ashamed to liue:
neither am I afrayd to die, for we haue a gratious Lord.
There is laide vppe for mee a crowne of righteousnesse.
Christ is my righteousnesse. Thy will be done ô Lorde,
for mine is frayle.</hi> With many other suche godlye
speehes. In the extremitie of his disease he shewed
great pacience, and when his voice fayled that hee
lay speechelesse, hee lifted vp his handes and eyes,
in witnesse of his consent to those prayers whiche
were made. Thus, being vertuously occupied, and
wholly resting himselfe vpon the mercies of God
through Ies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s Christ our sauior, he rendred vp his
soule to God, the 23. of <hi>September.</hi> 1571.</p>
   <p>Be thou thankful to God for giuing his Church
so worthy an instrument of his glorie: and bee
carefull to follow the good doctrine, which he left
behinde him, not only in this that commeth forth
at this present, but in all other his Bookes, whiche
haue beene set forth before, or shall be put foorth
hereafter to thy benefit, and increase of godlinesse.</p>
