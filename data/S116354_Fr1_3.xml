   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He children of this world are in their generation wiser then the children of light.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk. 16.8.</note> The truth hereof may appeare in the Papists; who discerning that their bookes of Controuersies, stuffed with manifold vntruths, fallacians, and corruptions, were not able to gaine sufficiently (though small gaine be too great for such merchants) to their Babylonish kingdome,<note place="margin">Reuel. 18.15.</note>
      <note place="margin">Iam. 3.6.</note> haue set themselues and others on worke (being all set on worke of Hell) to penne certaine treatises, tending to insnare and intangle the minds of ignorant and simple Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, in the corrupt and filthie puddle of Popish deuotion. In this respect I perswade my selfe, it is come to passe (not without the gracious prouidence of God) that the author hereof hath been incouraged in himselfe, and by others, to write these Christian directions, as a counterpoyson to all such inchauntments of Papists, who would by these meanes beare men in hand, that al true deuotion dwelt amongst them▪ and were inclosed and tyed to their Cels and Cloysters: In which vncleane cages it is vnpossible for any true spirituall and holy meditations to haue their abiding: for as much as euen the very mindes and consciences of such vncleane birds,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> are defiled with damnable errors, and Idolatries. Wherefore I would earnestly aduise, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely intreate thee (Christian Reader) to imbrace this booke, wherein thou shalt finde good precepts, and holy directions, not deliuered by rote (as from a Parrat) out of the bookes and writings of other men: but confirmed by the singular experience of one, who hath long laboured the conuersion, and confirmation of many other; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the mortification and quickning of his owne soule and conscience: one, whom indeed I haue euer esteemed another <hi>Greenham:</hi> and herein more happie then he; because he hath liued to penne, and peruse his owne labours, and may yet liue (by the mercie of God) to correct and amend whatsoeuer slip of his penne (for in a long worke one may happily take a nap, two, or three) shall be shewed vnto him. Reade it therefore (beloued Christian) and that with diligence: and thou shalt finde (I doubt not) more true light and direction to a true deuout and holy life, then in all the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the Iesuiticall Father <hi>Parsons</hi> (though neuer so refined, as a brick newly washed) or meditations of Frier <hi>Granatensis,</hi> or any Popish Directories whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And so I commend thee and all thy holy labours in this and all other good bookes, especially in the booke of bookes (I meane the holy Bible) to the rich and mercifull blessing of God our Father in Iesus Christ.</p>
