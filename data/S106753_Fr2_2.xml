      <hi>RIght honorable hauing newly finished a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise</hi> of the long Voyages of our Nation made into the <hi>Leuant</hi> within the Streight of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> &amp; from thence ouer-land to the South and Southeast parts of the world, all circumstances considered, I found none to whom I thought it fitter to bee presented then to your selfe: wherein hauing begun at the highest An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities of this realme vnder the gouernment of the <hi>Romans;</hi> next vnder the Saxons; and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly since the conquest vnder the <hi>Normans,</hi> I haue continued the histories vnto these our dayes. The time of the <hi>Romans</hi> affoordeth small matter. But after that they were called hence by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

And this most memorable voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into <hi>India</hi> is not onely mentioned by the aforesayd <hi>Malmesburie,</hi> but also by <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Wigorniensis,</hi> a graue and woorthy Author which liued before him, and by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers since, and euen by M. <hi>Foxe</hi> in his first volume of his <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi> in the life of king <hi>Alfred.</hi> To omit diuers other of the <hi>Saxon</hi> nation, the trauels of <hi>Alured</hi> bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> through <hi>Hungarie</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and so by <hi>Asia</hi> the lesse into <hi>Phoenicia</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and the like course of <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> not long afterward Abbot of <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> set downe particularly by himselfe, are things in mine opinion right worthy of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. After the comming in of the <hi>Normans,</hi> in the yeere 1096, in the reigne of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and so downward for the space of aboue 300 yeeres, such was the ardent desire of our nation to visite the Holy land, and to expell the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great numbers of Erles, Bishops, Barons, and Knights, but euen Kings, Princes, and Peeres of the blood Roiall, with incredible deuotion, courage and alacritie intruded themselues into this glorious expedition. A sufficient proofe hereof are the voiages of prince <hi>Edgar</hi> the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of <hi>Edmund Ironside,</hi> of <hi>Robert Curtois</hi> brother of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> the great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolence of king <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. and his vowe to haue gone in person to the succour of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> the personall going into <hi>Palestina</hi> of his sonne king <hi>Richard</hi> the first, with the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualrie, wealth, and shipping of this realme; the large contribution of king <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels of <hi>Oliuer Fitz-Roy</hi> his sonne, as is supposed, with <hi>Ranulph Glanuile</hi> Erle of <hi>Chester</hi>

      </gap>es and children, induced with a Zelous deuotion and ardent desire to protect and dilate the Christian faith. These memorable enterprises in part concealed, in part scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and for the most part vnlooked after, I haue brought together in the best Method and breuitie that I could deuise. Whereunto I haue annexed the losse of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> which although it were originally written in French, yet maketh it as honourable and often mention of the English natiō, as of any other Christians that serued in that most violent siege. After which ensueth the princely promise of the bountifull aide of king <hi>Henry</hi> the 8 to <hi>Ferdinando</hi> newly elected king of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> against <hi>Solyman</hi> the mortall enemie of Christendome. These and the like Heroicall intents and attempts of our Princes, our Nobilitie, our Clergie, &amp; our Chiualry, I haue in the first place exposed and set foorth to the view of this age, with the same intention that the old <hi>Romans</hi> set vp in wax in their palaces the Statuas or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their worthy ancestors; whereof <hi>Salust</hi> in his treatise of the warre of <hi>Iugurtha,</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in this maner: <hi>Saepe audiui ego</hi> Quintum maximum, Publium Scipionem, <hi>praete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea ciuitatis nostrae praeclaros viros solitos ita dicere, cum maiorum imagines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerentur, vehementissimè animum sibi ad virtutem accendi. Scilicet non ceram illam, ne{que} figuram, tantam vim in sese habere, sed memoria rerum gestarum flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam eam egregijs viris in pectore crescere, ne{que} prius sedari, quàm virtus eorum famam &amp; gloriam adaequauerit.</hi> I haue often heard (quoth he) how <hi>Quintus maximus, Publius Scipio,</hi> and many other worthy men of our citie were woont to say, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the images and portraitures of their ancestors, that they were most vehemently infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto vertue. Not that the sayd wax or portraiture had any such force at all in it selfe, but that by the remembring of their woorthy actes, that flame was kindled in their noble breasts, and could neuer be quenched, vntill such time as their owne valure had equalled the fame and glory of their progenitors. So, though not in wax, yet in record of writing haue I presented to the noble courages of this English Monarchie, the like images of their famous predecessors, with hope of like effect in their posteritie. And here by the way if any man shall think, that an vniuersall peace with our Christian neighbours will cut off the emploiment of the couragious increasing youth of this realme, he is much deceiued. For there are other most conuenient emploiments for all the superfluitie of euery profession in this realme. For, not to meddle with the state of <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor that of <hi>Guiana,</hi> there is vnder our noses the great &amp; ample countrey of <hi>Virginia;</hi> the In-land whereof is found of late to bee so sweete and hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some a climate, so rich and abundant in siluer mines, so apt and capable of all commodities, which <hi>Italy, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> can affoord, that the Spaniards themselues in their owne writings printed in <hi>Madrid</hi> 1586, and within few moneths afterward reprinted by me in <hi>Paris,</hi> and in a secret mappe of those partes made in <hi>Mexico</hi> the yeere before for the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> (which originall with many others is in the custodie of the excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician M. <hi>Thomas Hariot</hi>) as also in their intercepted letters come vnto my hand, bearing date 1595. they acknowledge the In-land to be a better and richer countrey then <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Nueua Spania</hi> it selfe. And on the other side their chiefest writers, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martyr ab Angleria,</hi> and <hi>Francis Lopez de Gomara,</hi> the most learned Venetian <hi>Iohn Baptista Ramusius,</hi> and the French Geographers, as namely, <hi>Popiliniere</hi> and the rest, acknowledge with one consent, that all that mightie tract of land from 67. degrees
<pb facs="320"/>
Northward to the latitude almost of <hi>Florida</hi> was first discouered out of England, by the commaundement of king <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth, and the South part thereof before any other Christian people of late hath bene planted with diuers English Colonies by the royal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of her sacred Maiestie vnder the broad seale of <hi>England,</hi> whereof one as yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, for ought we know, aliue in the countrey. Which action, if vpon a good &amp; godly peace obtained, it shal please the Almighty to stirre vp her Maiesties heart to continue with her fauourable countenance (as vpon the ceasing of the warres of <hi>Granada,</hi> hee stirred vp the spirite of <hi>Isabella</hi> Queene of <hi>Castile,</hi> to aduaunce the enterprise of <hi>Columbus</hi>) with transporting of one or two thousand of her people, and such others as vpon mine owne knowledge will most willingly at their owne charges become Aduenturers in good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with their bodies and goods; she shall by Gods assistance, in short space, worke many great and vnlooked for effects, increase her dominions, enrich her cofers, and reduce many Pagans to the faith of Christ. The neglecting hitherto of which last point our aduersaries daily in many of their bookes full bitterly lay vnto the charge of the professors of the Gospell. No sooner should we set footing in that pleasant and good land, and erect one or two conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Fortes in the Continent, or in some Iland neere the maine, but euery step we tread would yeeld vs new occasion of action, which I wish the Gentrie of our nation rather to regard, then to follow those soft vnprofitable pleasures wherein they now too much consume their time and patrimonie, and hereafter will doe much more, when as our neighbour warres being appeased, they are like to haue lesse emploiment then nowe they haue, vnlesse they bee occupied in this or some other the like expedition. And to this ende and purpose giue me leaue (I beseech you) to impart this occurrent to your honourable and prouident cōsideration: that in the yere one thousand fiue hundred eighty and seuen, when I had caused the foure voyages of <hi>Ribault, Laudonniere,</hi> and <hi>Gourges</hi> to <hi>Florida,</hi> at mine owne charges to bee printed in <hi>Paris,</hi> which by the malice of some too much affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to the Spanish faction, had bene aboue twentie yeeres suppressed, assoone as that booke came to the view of that reuerend and prudent Counseller <hi>Monsieur Harlac</hi> the lord chiefe Iustice of <hi>France,</hi> and certaine other of the wisest Iudges, in great choler they asked, who had done such intollerable wrong to their whole kingdome, as to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed that woorthie worke so long? Protesting further, that if their Kings and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state had throughly followed that action, <hi>France</hi> had bene freed of their long ciuill warres, and the variable humours of all sortes of people might haue had very ample and manifold occasions of good and honest emploiment abroad in that large and fruitfull Continent of the West Indies. The application of which sentence vnto our selues I here omit, haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the summarie recapitulation of other matters contained in this worke. It may please your Honour therefore to vnderstand, that the second part of this first Treatise containeth our auncient trade and traffique with English shipping to the Ilands of <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, Candie,</hi> and <hi>Sio,</hi> which by good warrant herein alleaged, I find to haue bene begun in the yeere 1511. and to haue continued vntill the yeere 1552. and somewhat longer. But shortly after (as it seemeth) it was intermitted, or rather giuen ouer (as is noted in master <hi>Gaspar Campions</hi> discreet letters to master <hi>Michael Lock</hi> and master <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Winter</hi> inserted in this booke) first by occasiō of the Turkes expelling of the foure and twentie <hi>Mauneses</hi> or gouernours of the <hi>Genouois</hi> out of the Ile of <hi>Sio,</hi> and by taking of the sayd Iland wholie into his owne hand in Aprill, 1566. sending thither <hi>Piali Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha</hi> with fourescore gallies for that purpose; and afterward by his growing ouer mightie and troublesome in those Seas, by the cruell inuasion of <hi>Nicosia</hi> and <hi>Famagusta,</hi> and the whole Ile of <hi>Cyprus</hi> by his lieutenant Generall <hi>Mustapha Basha.</hi> Which lamentable Tragedie I haue here againe reuiued, that the posteritie may neuer forget what trust may bee giuen to the oath of a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> when hee hath aduauntage and is in his choler.</p>
   <p>Lastly, I haue here put downe at large the happie renuing and much increasing of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
<pb facs="321"/>
trade in all the <hi>Leuant,</hi> accomplished by the great charges and speciall industrie of the worshipfull and worthy Citizens, Sir <hi>Edward Osborne</hi> Knight, M. <hi>Richard Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and M. <hi>William Hareborne,</hi> together with the league for traffike onely betweene her Maiestie and the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> with the great priuileges, immunities, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours obteyned of his imperiall Highnesse in that behalfe, the admissions and residencies of our Ambassadours in his stately Porch, and the great good and Christian offices which her Sacred Maiestie by her extraordinary fauour in that Court hath done for the king and kingdome of <hi>Poland,</hi> and other Christian Princes: the traffike of our Nation in all the chiefe Hauens of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Egypt:</hi> the searching and haunting the very bottome of the Mediterran Sea to the ports of <hi>Tripoli</hi> and <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> of the <hi>Archipelagus,</hi> by the Turkes now called <hi>The white sea,</hi> euen to the walles of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> the voyages o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer land and by riuer through <hi>Aleppo,</hi> Birrha, Babylon and Balsara, and downe the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian gulfe to <hi>Ormuz,</hi> and thence by the Ocean sea to Goa, and againe ouer-land to <hi>Bisnagar, Cambaia, Orixa, Bengala, Aracan, Pegu, Malacca, Siam,</hi> the <hi>Iangomes, Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheu,</hi> and euen to the Frontiers of the Empire of <hi>China:</hi> the former performed diuerse times by sundry of our nation, and the last great voyage by M. <hi>Ralph Fitch,</hi> who with M. <hi>Iohn Newbery</hi> and two other consorts departed from <hi>London</hi> with her Maiesties letters written effectually in their fauour to the kings of <hi>Cambaia</hi> and <hi>China</hi> in the yere 1583, who in the yeere 1591. like another <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> returned home to the place of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, with ample relation of his wonderfull trauailes, which he presented in writing to my Lord your father of honourable memorie.</p>
   <p>Now here if any man shall take exception against this our new trade with Turkes and misbeleeuers, he shall shew himselfe a man of small experience in old and new Histories, or wilfully lead with partialitie, or some worse humour.<note place="margin">

Or who is ignorant that the French, the Genouois, Florentines, Raguseans, Venetians, and Polonians are at this day in league with the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and haue beene these many yeeres, and haue vsed trade and traffike in his dominions? Who can deny that the Emperor of Christendome hath had league with the Turke, and payd him a long while a pension for a part of <hi>Hungarie?</hi> And who doth not acknowledge, that either hath trauailed the remote parts of the world, or read the Histories of this later age, that the Spaniards and Portugales in <hi>Barbarie,</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and elsewhere, haue ordinarie confederacie and traffike with the Moores, and many kindes of Gentiles and Pagans, and that which is more, doe pay them pensions, and vse them in their seruice and warres? Why then should that be blamed in vs, which is vsuall and common to the most part of other Christian nations? Therefore let our neighbours, which haue found most fault with this new league and traffike, thanke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and their owne foolish pride, whereby we were vrged to seeke further to prouide vent for our naturall commodities.

All these and other particularities are plainly and truely here deliuered by one <hi>Thomas Steuens</hi> a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Englishman, who in the yeere 1579 going as a passenger in the Portugale Fleete from <hi>Lisbon</hi> into <hi>India,</hi> wrote the same from <hi>Goa</hi> to his father in <hi>England:</hi> Whereunto I haue added the memorable voyage of M. <hi>Iames Lancaster,</hi> who doth not onely recount and confirme most of the things aboue mentioned, but also doth acquaint vs with the state of the voyage beyond Cape <hi>Comori,</hi> and the Isle of Ceilon, with the Isles of <hi>Nicubar</hi> and <hi>Gomes Polo</hi> lying within two leagues of the rich Island <hi>Samatra,</hi> and those of <hi>Pulo Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naom,</hi> with the maine land of <hi>Iunçalaon</hi> and the streight of <hi>Malacca.</hi> I haue likewise added a late intercepted letter of a Portugall reuealing the secret and most gainefull trade of <hi>Pegu,</hi> which is also confirmed by <hi>Caesar Fredericke</hi> a Venetian, and M. <hi>Ralph Fitch</hi> now liuing here in <hi>London.</hi>

   <p>And because our chiefe desire is to find out ample vent of our wollen cloth, the naturall cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of this our Realme, the sittest places, which in al my readings and obseruations I find for that purpose, are the manifold Islands of <hi>Iapan,</hi> &amp; the Northern parts of <hi>China,</hi> &amp; the regions of the Tartars next adioyning (whereof I read, that the countrey in winter is <hi>Assi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fria como Flandes,</hi> that is to say, as cold as <hi>Flanders,</hi> &amp; that the riuers be strongly ouer-frozen) and therefore I haue here inserted two speciall Treatises of the sayd Countries, the one beginning pag. 68, the other, pag. 88: which last discourse I hold to be the most exact of those parts that is yet come to light, which was printed in Latine in <hi>Macao</hi> a citie of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> in China-paper, in the yeere a thousand fiue hundred and ninetie, and was intercepted in the great Carack called <hi>Madre de Dios</hi> two yeeres after, inclosed in a case of sweete Cedar wood, and lapped vp almost an hundred fold in finc calicut-cloth, as though it had beene some incomparable iewell.</p>
   <p>But leauing abruptly this discourse, I thinke it not impertinent, before I make an end, to deliuer some of the reasons, that moued me to present this part of my trauailes vnto your Honour. The reuerend antiquitie in the dedication of their workes made choyse of such patrons, as eyther with their reputation and credite were able to countenance the same, or by their wisedome and vnderstanding were able to censure and approoue them, or with their abilitie were likely to stand them or theirs in steade in the ordinarie necessities and accidents of their life. Touching the first, your descent from a father, that was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Pater patriae,</hi> your owne place and credite in execution of her Maiesties inward counsailes and publike seruices, added to your well discharging your forren imployment (when the greatest cause in Christendome was handled) haue not onely drawen mens eyes vpon you, but also forcibly haue moued many, and my selfe among the rest to haue our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours protected by your authoritie. For the second point, when it pleased your Honour in sommer was two yeeres to haue some conference with me, and to demaund mine opinion touching the state of the Country of <hi>Guiana,</hi> and whether it were fit to be planted by the English: I then (to my no small ioy) did admire the exact knowledge which you had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of those matters of <hi>Indian</hi> Nauigations: and how carefull you were, not to be ouertaken with any partiall affection to the Action, appeared also, by the sound arguments which you made <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> of the likelihood and reason of good or ill successe of the same, before
<pb facs="322"/>
the State and common wealth (wherein you haue an extraordinarie voyce) should be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engaged. In consideration whereof I thinke my selfe thrise happie to haue these my trauailes censured by your Honours so well approued iudgement. Touching the third and last motiue I cannot but acknowledge my selfe much indebted for your fauourable letters heretofore written in my behalfe in mine honest causes. Whereunto I may adde, that when this worke was to passe vnto the presse, your Honour did not onely intreate a worthy knight, a person of speciall experience, as in many others so in marine causes, to ouersee and peruse the same, but also vpon his good report with your most fauourable letters did warrant, and with extraordinarie commendation did approue and allow my labours, and desire to publish the same. Wherefore to conclude, seeing they take their life and light from the most cheerefull and benigne aspect of your fauour, I thinke it my bounden dutie in all humilitie and with much bashfulnesse to recommend my selfe and them vnto your right Honorable and fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble protection, and your Honour to the mercifull tuition of the most High.</p>
