In the Court there was an Altar of brasse: in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary there was an altar of gold: but in the most holy place, there was an holy Oracle, sounding the blessed will of God from aboue the propitiatorie: To the which Oracle nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the brasen Altar nor the golden Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar could bee compared: yea, both heauen and earth is not worthie to bee compared vnto the Oracle, and word of the Lord. Euen so (good Christian Reader) vnderstand, that when the history leadeth you to a consideration of the mystery of iniquity: then you shall see a beginning, and a progresse of vngodlinesse, vntill in end the Antichrist is permitted to sit in the temple of God, and to extoll himselfe against all that is called God, or is worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. <note place="margin">2.
