   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen great blessings breed security,
and prophanesse, wee must looke for
sodaine iudgements. These are <hi>begun</hi>
and haue <hi>increased</hi> in the land, so much
the more <hi>fearefull,</hi> because they are <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
spiritual</hi> and the rather <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi>
because they are <hi>lesse discerned,</hi> or,
<hi>discerned onely with a carnall eye,</hi> which
conceiuing them <hi>natural and ordinary,</hi>
yeeld them onely carnall and ordinary respect: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uery man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides
for his owne, but the house of the Lord, lyeth waste: And
so we flatter our selues that all is well, when nothing can bee
well, it going ill wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> the principall, <hi>we may sowe much but reape
little, and what wee gather is put into a broken bagge, because the</hi>
Lords house lyeth waste, and euery man lookes to his owne. <hi>Our
great deliuerance</hi> from that diuelish plot of the poulder treason,
as it was wonderfull, so it hath passed as <hi>a dreame,</hi> or as a nine
daies wonder. And behold now we are awoke, <hi>we are a hunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
pinched with famine <hi>both of body and soule:</hi> The bird was in
the snare, but we haue let her loose. <hi>A blessing</hi> was offered, but
the <hi>messe of pottage</hi> hath bene preferred: <hi>Benaydad</hi> findes fauour,
and is become a <hi>broken reed to Israell:</hi> and may not our hands bee
pierced therwith? <hi>Yea the whole heart is sick and the head is heauy:
&amp; from the crown of the head vnto the sole of the foot,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
whole therin: &amp; which is the greatest misery, though there
be <hi>bakon in</hi> Gilead <hi>yet the hurt of the</hi> Virgine Israel <hi>is not healed.</hi>
Because <hi>the dead flyes doe corrupt the pretious oyntment
of the Apothecary,</hi> and the hurt of the daughters of Gods people,
is healed <hi>with sweete words, crying peace peace</hi> so that we, <hi>looked
for peace, but behold trouble,</hi> because the <hi>Arme of flesh</hi> hath decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vs, and we haue not rested vppon <hi>the strong Tower:</hi> yet the
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>liueth</hi> and <hi>is good vnto</hi> Israel, <hi>euen vnto those that are true of
heart.</hi> The wise man <hi>seeth the vally of</hi> Achor, and entereth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as <hi>into the doore of hope:</hi> And though the plague deuoure but
the hindermost part of the hoast, yet <hi>he sees the plague</hi> with
the eyes of faith, and feare, <hi>and so hides him-selfe, by departing
from euill:</hi> that so not being partaker in the sinne, hee may not
share in the iudgement: yet <hi>must iudgement begin at the
house of God,</hi> that so the faithfull being tryed may find rest,
while the pit is digged for the wicked. And whosoeuer seekes
vnto the Lord God of <hi>Israel</hi> in his affliction, hee is found of
him: <hi>The more</hi> Israel <hi>is oppressed,</hi> the more it increaseth, and by
this we know that the Lord fauoureth vs, because he suffreth
not our enemies to triumph ouer vs: Oh that wee could try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
ouer them in the remembrance of that <hi>wonderfull deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
that our God hath wrought for vs! How might we by
this haue triumphed, if we had <hi>pursued that victory</hi> and rooted
out <hi>Ameleck,</hi> that would haue rooted out vs: but al for the best.
<hi>Ameleck</hi> must remaine as <hi>a pricke in our sides,</hi> to <hi>let out our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and prophane blood;</hi> our enemies must yet be further meanes
of our purging and preparing: that when the stones are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
squared, Gods house may bee perfectly aduanced: And the
setting vp of the <hi>Arke</hi> will be the finall ouerthrow of <hi>Dagon.</hi>
In patience therefore (deere bretheren) committee wee our
selues into the handes of our faithfull Creator. That his hand
is not shortned, we may see in that <hi>wonderfull deliuerance.</hi> In
memoriall whereof, I haue now the <hi>third time,</hi> tendred those
meditations, that I might <hi>pay my vowes</hi> vnto the Lord, for the
sanctifing of that generall deliuerance by a <hi>speciall deliuerance</hi>
vnto me: &amp; the rather, because the Lord hath euen now of late
<hi>deliuered</hi> me out of the <hi>horrible pit, and restored vnto me the Ioy
of his saluation,</hi> that I might declare the wonders of the Lord in
the land of the liuing: <hi>The Lord hath renued me as an example
vnto them which shall in time to come beleeue this wonderfull
worke.</hi> And yet, (blessed be our faithfull God) this is a day of
good tidings. The <hi>bush is not consumed the scepter of</hi> Antichrist
<hi>is broken,</hi> his <hi>sinne repenteth,</hi> and the <hi>Lord raigneth,</hi> and <hi>hell is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.</hi>
And why should I hold my peace? Surely if my sight
<pb facs="5"/>
fayle me not, I see in that deliuerance, <hi>Amelecks</hi> vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw:
Oh that <hi>Moses handes may be held vp still,</hi> that <hi>Ameleck</hi>
may be destroyed from vnder heauen, for the better strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of my weake knees and feeble hands to the due meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that wonderful deliuerance! I haue spared some few hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
from my publicke studie, and spent them in the meditation
of <hi>a like wonderfull deliuerance</hi> of the <hi>Church of God</hi> in former
times. <hi>Very malitious</hi> was the <hi>enemie</hi> when nothing would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
him but the vtter rooting out of the <hi>Church of God.</hi> And
surely much more malitious our enemies, that had plotted the
extreame ouerthrow both of <hi>Church and common-wealth.</hi> 2.
<hi>Very patient and wise was the Lord</hi> in giuing the aduersary so
far his desire, as euen to haue brought his mischiefe to the
poynt of execution; to make his confusion the greater, and the
<hi>Churches deliuerance</hi> more admirable &amp; comfortable. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that our <hi>Aduersaries</hi> had brought their <hi>plotte</hi> within lesse
then eight houres execution after two yeares secure contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
and ripening thereof: This as it magnified the admirable
prouidence of the Lord in ordering the actions of the wicked,
so it tended tò the greater astonishment and confusion of Gods
enemies, and, notwithstanding the carelesse security of the
<hi>Atheist,</hi> yet hath, and shall make, to the eternal comfort of the
true beleeuer. 3. <hi>Wonderfull was the Lord</hi> in disapoynting the
practize of <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>deliuering</hi> of <hi>his Church:</hi> but that the
enemie was <hi>cast in the pit,</hi> which he had digged for others. Oh!
how did this <hi>magnifie the iustice of God,</hi> how did it <hi>confirme
the faith of the afflicted?</hi> And surely did not the Lord shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
much more wonderfull <hi>in our deliuerance?</hi> Was it a small
matter to deliuer vs as a prey out of the snare of the Fowler, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
also our aduersaries were consumed with the poulder
which they had prepared to blow vs vp, by an ouer-ruling hand
of the Almighty?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>This was the Lords dooing, and it ought to be maruailous in thy
eyes:</hi> And marke what I tell thee? <hi>Neuer looke to see the face of
God in glory for thy final release out of all thy troubles, vnlesse thou
dost see the especiall loue of thy God in this deliuerance: and so still
desirest to see further; to the increase of thy most holy faith; that so
<pb facs="6"/>
beleeuing thou maist see greater things then these: yea best able to
see a farre off, euen the finall deliuerance of the Church</hi> out of all
her troubles. For thy further direction and prouoking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to this <hi>Christian duty,</hi> In the feare of God make vse of this
<hi>history</hi> which I doe tender thee as a glasse, wherein thou maist
dayly view that wonderfull deliuerance. I haue as the Lord
hath inabled me, considered thy weakenesse, and prouided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly:
That thy edge may be still sharpened, and the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof preuented. I haue deuided the story in it parts:
tendering thee onely for a taste, some briefe obsruations on
the two first Chapters: which containe onely the preface and
the preparation to the history: yet furnished and especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
dy the diuine dispensation, with such fit variety of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as may serue thee well for a full enterview of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the deliuerance of Princes and Kingdomes from trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and conspiracies. Here for the time I make my <hi>first pause:</hi>
studying breuity, because this <hi>wanton age</hi> cannot indure long
discourses, and my <hi>health</hi> will not indure long studies: if thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
be sharpned, pray for <hi>health,</hi> and liberty of the Gospell:
and (so thou <hi>lust</hi> not after <hi>quailes</hi>) thou maist shortly by Gods
mercy haue more variety. For the present consider my weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and magnifie Gods power: let the <hi>Printer</hi> beare his owne
burthen, and yet as he hath prouided, so ease thy selfe, and him,
and me: Read with <hi>prayer, appetite,</hi> and <hi>humility:</hi> So maist thou
attaine the <hi>kernell:</hi> And for the <hi>shell</hi> neglect it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> it speake
<hi>the language of Canaan:</hi> let it guide thee to our <hi>common Citty
which is above:</hi> whether I am hasting: and to this end, tender
thee this light, that wee may happily meere there. The
Lord hasten <hi>his worke,</hi> confound <hi>Antichrist,</hi> perfect
the gathering in <hi>of the first borne,</hi> set vp <hi>his standerd
and glorifie his sonne, in all his Sayntes.</hi>
So be it.</p>
