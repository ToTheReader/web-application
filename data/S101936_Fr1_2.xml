   <head>The Authour to the <hi>Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>IT is sayde of Solomon (who had no small experience in the course of al things) <hi>that much reading is wearinesse vnto the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Eccles. 12.</note>
      <hi>flesh;</hi> but it is most true, euen in our owne experience, that to deale with the vntamed and vntaught reason of man, is a vanity &amp; vexation of spirit, vnto those who loue the truth. For what cunning shiftes and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site variety of subtleties haue they, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the mighty strooke of the word of God? And it is no maruaile, if we poore dullardes be not only made blunt, but almost worne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye with encountring with such tough ware. The onely comfort we haue is, that when the diuell disputed, yea, continued dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting so long with the Son of God him self, hee was at the length made to retire with those milde, and yet most powrefull wordes: <hi>The Lord rebuke thee Sathan.</hi> Which<note place="margin">Iud. 9.</note> most auncient example, as it hath greatly sustayned me in this toyle of this tedious time, wherein I haue had occasion to goe bare-foote through this quicke-set hedge of thornes, which the aunswerer to the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
hath set in our way: so it doth not a little grieue me, that I am iealous ouer my selfe, that I haue not followed in such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure as I ought, that moderation which the sonne of God; <hi>The prince of Angels</hi> kept, when he encountred with the deuil, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, I deale (as I hope) with a brother. My comfort is, that it shall be manifest, that in steede of taking occasion where it was not giuen, I haue swallowed downe that, as sweet, which is most loathsome and bitter: I haue also stayd my course within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the first treatise, and the daungerous appendix annexed to the same; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I suppose he wil not abuse so much the Scripture, as to wrest the defence of plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Ciuill offices, in Ministers of God his word, of sole excommunication (which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready handled in this treatise by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) and partly because the rest will for the most part pertaine properly to the worthye Lawyer, who hath begun this controuersie, and shall by the grace of God see a good end of the same. The Lord bring vs all to be of one minde and hart in the truth.</p>
