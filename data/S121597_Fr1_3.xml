   <head>TO THE Right Honourable and Excellent Lady the Duchesse of Feria her Grace.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bene long my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire (right ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nourable and vertuous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) euer sins I did first see and know the right Noble and most worthy Duke your Graces late Husband, to be able to doe some seruice, or to shew some token of duetie to so wise and so worthy a Personage as his Grace was. Whose vertues were such, and his noble Qualities so great
<pb facs="3"/>
and so wel knowen vnto al (who neither for sinister affectiō were blinded, nor for ignorāce, vnapt to esteme and see the same) that I may wel saie and doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Nobilitie of bloud and parentage (which was very high and auncient) were greater in him, or els the vertues and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of his minde, the whiche alone had bene meete and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to haue made him suche, if he had not ben thereto borne by kind and noble Race. For if true Nobilitie consist in the gifts of vertue, wisedome and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse, adioyned with some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie of famous and worthie Progenitours: I nede not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the truth hereof to any that knew his Grace but a litle, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were not abundantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with al the same. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie of his renowned Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and Ofspring, the late Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="3"/>
of Naples and Spaine do ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifestly witnesse to the worlde. His liberalitie and passing Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in succouring poore Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and other in necessitie (the memorie wherof is yet fresh in the mindes of many so succou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him) his Religious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion toward God and his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Churche, his faithful coūsel to his Prince, his true and readie seruise in publike affaires at sundry times employed, his valour and prowesse in Martial feates wel tried: all these Noble Qualities of his Grace being so wel knowen and witnessed to the world, must nedes confirme and prooue, that he was a very worthy and true Noble-man in deede.</p>
   <p>For whiche cause (as I said before) seeing and knowing all these high giftes of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be so plentifully in him,
<pb facs="4"/>
I did euer thinke my self bound to be ready to serue him, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him and to beare that loyal affectiō toward him, which true Nobilitie doth of right require of al true honest hartes.</p>
   <p>But now wheras it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, so sone to bereaue your Grace of so Noble and so deare a Husband, and al good men of so great and so hable a Patrone in their necessities, and that now the best seruise we can do him, is to praie hartily for him: yet that former desire of mine is not thus quenched, nor dead with him, but from him is deriued to such as be leaft behinde him, being most nere and deare than vnto him, and leaft now to vs as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereon stil to exercise our former seruise and duetie.</p>
   <p>And this very cause it was, which moued me of late, that whereas I had newly set forth a
<pb n="2" facs="4"/>
brief Latin Chronicle (printed before at Paris) and had somwhat augmēted it my self, and emong other things, made mention of the most honourable Duke of Feria, both of that he did in England a litle before and after the death of Good Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and now last, of his owne death, in departing out of this worlde in so good and so Godly Christian wise: al that part of my labour therein, I haue dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto that Noble Impe your Graces moste deare and onely Sonne, leaft now vnto you for a very paterne and comfort of his no lesse dere, than Noble Father. Which when I had done, yet was I not so satisfied, but tooke it to be against all good maner, if in shewing some seruice and honour to the Sonne, I should leaue alone the Mother not so much as saluted.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>And therefore, whereas I had also translated out of Spanish a short Treatise cōteining a brief fourme or Doctrine of Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which hath seemed to the learned and vertuous of our Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion here a thing very necessarie and profitable, specially at this time in so great corruption both of true faith, and good life: it came also to mind, that I should doe right wel, to dedicate the same smal labour of mine vnto your Honour, for a further te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of my foresaid affectiō and duetie, not only vnto that moste honourable Duke, who now (no doubte) is gone from this transitorie honour, to liue in eternal Glorie with God. but also vnto your Grace, vnto whō I beseke our Lord to send suche continuance and increase of worldly honour, and such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to mitigate the dolour of
<pb facs="5"/>
his departing hence, that you may liue bothe together againe in that life and glorie that neuer shall decaie nor haue end: and in the meane time suche good health and fortitude to beare patiently this losse and lacke of him, that those Noble vertues, which are in your Grace, be not letted thereby, but may be so exercised together with your Sonne, and in training him vp in his Fathers owne steppes, that as long as the Mother or Sonne shal liue here, the worthy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of the Father shall neuer die in mens hartes. </p>
