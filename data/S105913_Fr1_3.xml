   <head>To all true Christians, and to all them that call themselues Catholikes, at this daie in the Church of England: Grace, mercie and truth, with continuall ioy in the Holie ghost.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat notable discourse of <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (beloued in the Lorde,<note place="margin">Clem. lib. <hi>1</hi> Stromat.,</note>) is verie forcible to moue all those that be learned in Iesus Christ, to put forth their labours in print. <hi>If the godlie should not write bookes: wherefore were let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters inuented? It is lawfull for the Epicure to write dishonest things: therefore much more for a Christian, such things as bee profitable. And euery man hath a care, to leaue children behinde him of his bodie: but bookes are the fruites of the minde.</hi> And againe, <hi>We call them fathers, that doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct vs:</hi> And <hi>wisdome is no niggard, she makes her selfe common to all, she is a louer of mankinde: And our Sauiour wil call all his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to account, which haue receiued any talent of him. None must hide his talent in the ground.</hi> And he puts downe also the endes, whie all bookes should bee written. <hi>Not rashlie, but with deliberation: not for malice of any man, nor for vaine glory, nor for hope of rewarde, but for the profit of our brethren:</hi> Thus farre <hi>Clemens.</hi> Here wee may note, that they are reprooued, that will not set forth their workes in print; to the benefit of others. <hi>Such put a light vnder a bushell.</hi> And some such lightes, haue we at this daie; which wil not suffer their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent labours to bee published, least others should bee partakers of them:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Epistola.</hi> 6.</note> Whereas euen <hi>Seneca</hi> a heathen hath this notable sentence. <hi>For this ende I do desire to learne, that I may teach others. Neither any thing delightes me; be it neuer so excellent, nor so profitable, that I my selfe shoulde knowe alone. Nay, if wisdome her selfe were giuen mee vppon this condition, that I shoulde keepe her fast shut vppe, and shoulde not publish her abroad, I woulde refuse her.</hi> And this is a principall cause why the Church of Rome at this daie s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>mes so glorious in the eies of many, because that in her all those that haue the best gifts, as <hi>Granatensis, Stella, Ferus</hi> and such others, whatsoeuer they haue don
<pb facs="5"/> they haue published and communicated to others. But in the church of Christ there are verie manie which are endued with singular giftes and gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>s of the holie spirit: who wil not be perswaded to publish any thing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> make their most excellent labours common to the benefit of others. The which if they would do, as the church hath now very many not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to any of those: so she should haue a far greater number that woulde exceed them. But to let passe <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Seneca,</hi> and the practise of the Romanistes: much more forcible is the reason that <hi>Saint Iude</hi> here vseth in this Epistle. <hi>Putting a difference</hi> (saith hee) <hi>deale mercifully with some: and others saue with feare. pulling them as it were out of the fire.</hi> Meaning no doubt, that wee should not onely by brotherly conference, winne simple seduced Christians: but also euen by the handes of our writings, or by any other meanes what soeuer, drawe such as bee obstinate from the flame and fire of heresie. Who seeing his brother in the fire, will not pull him out? And surely so nowe the case standes in our daies. The doctrine of Antichrist flameth like a fire, and therefore it beguiles, and euen consumeth many. They will not sticke to spend all their reuenewes, so that they may continue in poperie. The great fiery zeale of the Iesuites, the eloquence, and as it were a shining light of some papists stiles, defending their causes, deceiues them. But let all true Catholiques marke heere what <hi>S. Iude</hi> teacheth, <hi>That some are to be pulled out of the fire.</hi> Though the teachers be as hot in zeale, as forcible in perswasion, as glorious in eloquence, as fire: yet if they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace not the catholike doctrine contained in this epistle, embrace them not, beleeue them not. And all good christians, if this fire haue caught hold of any such; are bound with all diligence, to helpe to pull them out.</p>
   <p>And here let vs note the excellencie of this epistle: In it not only the chiefe points of Antichristian heresie; but as in a briefe mappe also, the chiefe principles of christian and catholike religion are contained. Wilt thou then be free from all danger of heresie? Wilt thou be established in the true catholik faith? Read this epistle. The labor is not great. Wouldst thou doe good workes in deede? Doe then those, which <hi>S. Iude</hi> here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth. <hi>Build yee one another in your most holy faith.</hi> Here is the first and principall worke of all true christians and catholikes, To build themselues in their most holy faith: And that is by hearing, reading, and meditating of the holy scriptures. For so <hi>S. Paul</hi> teacheth, that this building is by the word of God: <hi>And now brethren, I commend you to God,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 20.32.</note>
      <hi>and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you farther, and to giue you an inheritance, amongst all them that are sanctified:</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/> Here wee may plainely see, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> against those rauening wolues, <hi>which shall succeede him</hi> (of whome also he speakes in the verse going before) <hi>and shall teach peruerse doctrine:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Verse 29 30.</note> he committeth all true chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and catholikes to the word of God, as to a most sure looking glasse, whereby to espie their deceits; and as to a most faithfull square &amp; rule, to build and frame their faith by: And shall we not then giue heede vnto it? And in another place he saith:<note place="margin">Col. 3. v. 16.</note>
      <hi>Let the word of Christ dwell plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously amongst you in all wisedome, teaching and admonishing one another.</hi> As though he should say to all christians: haue not onely the word of God in your houses, but also in your hearts, that you may be able to teach and admonish one another. And this no doubt is the building <hi>S. Iude</hi> here meaneth, See what knowledge of the word of God he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in euery christian: that they should be able euen to teach and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue: which cannot be done without great knowledge.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Secondly</hi> (saith <hi>S. Iude) pray in the holy ghost,</hi> that is, as the holy ghost shall direct and inflame your harts,<note place="margin">Theod. in Rom. 8.</note> as <hi>Theodoret</hi> expoundes this phrase: <hi>By the grace of the holy spirit we being stirred vp, we are pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in heart: being inflamed by it, we pray more cheerfully, and call vpon God with vnspeakeable sighing.</hi> Why then all christians must be perswaded that they have the holy ghost: then they must pray with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and knowledge. They must know what they pray: The holy ghost is light, and in it is no darkenesse at all. And how agrees this with the popish latine praiers which they haue vsed?</p>
   <p>Thirdly saith <hi>S. Iude, Keepe your selues in the loue of God:</hi> Be ye assured that God is your father, that hee loueth you and careth for you. Let this bee as a staffe in your handes, to passe ouer the Iordane of this world with all, with <hi>Iacob:</hi> and the ioy of your harts though sathan buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet you neuer so much, as he did <hi>Paul:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gen. 32. v. 10.2. Cor. 12. v. 9.</note> whom the Lord taught this les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and in him all christians: <hi>My grace,</hi> my loue, <hi>is sufficient for thee.</hi> What needes thou then feare the waues of this world, nay nor all the buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting and afflictions of sathan?</p>
   <p>Lastly saith <hi>S. Iude, waite for the mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ, to eternall life:</hi> not trusting in your owne merits, but only in his mercie: euer remembring your manifold imperfections and sinnes, and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your selues to be vnprofitable seruants. Here are the duties plainely set downe of all Gods faithfull seruants, &amp; of al true catholikes towards God. That is, <hi>continuall study and meditation of the scripture, daily praier in the holy ghost, assurance of the loue of God towardes them; and a waiting for the mercy of Iesus Christ to saluation:</hi> These are the
<pb facs="6"/> workes of the true catholique Church, and of all true catholikes. Those which doe not these workes; what soeuer they doe else, God shall not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them for his serua ts.</p>
   <p>These points of christian religion, euery christian is daily to meditate vpon▪ these workes he must lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ke that he doe with the strength of this small cake,<note place="margin">1. King. 19 v. 8.</note> and with the comfort of this little water, no doubt with <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> he shall go euen to Horeb the mountaine of God. The Lorde Iesus plant these vertues in euery Christians heart, and grant euery one grace diligently to doe these workes, and make them hunger for this bread and thirst for this water: and at last bring them to his heauenly Horeb and mountaine.</p>
   <p>To conclude (gentle Reader) if in this discourse any thing doe iustly mislike thee (as perchance something may doe) for as <hi>Saint Iames</hi> saith.<note place="margin">Ia. 4.2. Gal. 6.2. Ia. 2.8.</note>
      <hi>In many things we offend all;</hi> remember that royall law of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>That we ought to be are one anothers burthen.</hi> And if any thing seeme to thee heerein to bee ouer sharpelie and bitterly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;<note place="margin">Luke 10.34.</note> surely the grieuousnesse of the woundes required it: remember how the Samaritan poured in, <hi>not only oyle but wine also, into the wounds of his neighbour.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 26.18. Act. 1.20.</note> If in the quotations any thing haue escaped, call to mind how our Sauiour sends his Apostles <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>to a certaine man,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> alleadging <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>It is written in the booke of Psalmes,</hi> neither quoting Psalme nor verse, and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>One of themselues, euen one of their own Prophets, said, the Cretians are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies lyars.</hi> And loath not the plaine handling of the points of doctrine herein contained,<note place="margin">Psal. 78.30.31.</note> requiring quailes for thy dainty appetite as did the Israelites, which died with the meat in their mouthes: Such delicates profits not the soule, but rather embrace the heauenly manna, <hi>which was a small round thing vpon the face of the wildernesse;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Exod. 16.14.</note>
      <hi>small as the hoare frost on the earth.</hi> And remember these two notable lessons which <hi>S. Paul</hi> knits vp in two words,<note place="margin">Ephes 4.15.</note>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: <hi>Let vs seeke after truth in loue:</hi> And so farewell in the Lord Iesus,<note place="margin">2. Tim 2.7.</note>
      <hi>who giue thee a right vnderstanding &amp; iudgement in al things.</hi>
