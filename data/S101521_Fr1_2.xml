   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was a question prophetically asked of those times, wherein the Church and truth of God should suffer greatest persecution and opposition, <hi>why doe the Heathen rage,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psa. 2.</note>
      <hi>and the People imagine a vaine thing? The Kings of the Earth set themselves, &amp; the Rulers take counsell together against the Lord, and against his Christ, saying: Let us breake theire bands asunder, and cast theire cords from us.</hi> But for all these forces and devises of men, who are not Iewes indeed, Christians indeede, but Gentiles and Heathen. Yet, saith God, <hi>have I set my King upon my holy hill of Syon;</hi> and that as he saith, to have <hi>the Heathen for his inheritance,</hi> and <hi>the ends of the Earth for his possession:</hi> eyther to rule them by <hi>the rod of his power,</hi> by the revealed word, or to <hi>break them in pieces like a Potters vessel:</hi>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>or it had beene s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>yde, <hi>He shall judge among the Nations.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Isa. 2.</note> Well therefore is it added, <hi>Be wise now therefore o ye Kings, be instructed ye Iudges of the earth: Serve the Lord with feare,</hi> &amp;c. For as the Church of God in generall, so every true member of it, will be ready to say,<note place="margin">Chap. 33.</note>
      <hi>The Lord is our Iudge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King;</hi> and that therefore it were a happy thing, if Princes and States would be pleased to consider, that they are onely Lords over men properly and directly, as they are theire sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and not as they are Christs Disciples, Christians, and spiritually his subjects; withall, that God is not pleased with
<pb facs="3"/> unwilling worshippers, whereby neyther Christian societies are bettered, nor the persons themselves: For while all are compelled to a conformitie, especially if it be in things not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God, many haveing presently theire Religion in respect of mans authority, &amp; not of Gods, become Hypocrites, Timeservers, and a kinde of Atheists: &amp; which is worse, such men, by theire formalitie, though they have litle else in them, doe oft attaine authority in such Churches, and thereby get dominion over mens faith in other things. For though in the primitive times, the Bishops of Rome had no such ample power, yet the fi st step to it was that of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing conformitie in things devised by men, &amp; by them coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted indifferent and innocent, if not proffitable and necessary; which power beeing graunted them, they soone got authority over all Ministers and People; and then so much over Kings, that in verie pollicie, they thought it theire best course to hold all theire subjects, in matters of Religion, to the obedience of the Church of Rome, rather then to adventure the danger of her displeasure; whereby they brought both themselves, and theire subjects into a far worfe thraldom, then that of the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian bondage.</p>
   <p>What reason then is there, that this power, thus Popishly taken up, should still be maintayned against the poore subjects? From the beginning it was not so. For the Ancients finding the burden imposed by Heathen Tyrants to be intollerable, sayde,<note place="margin">Tertull.</note>
      <hi>that it is no propertie of Religion, to compell to Religion: which ought to be taken up freely; that no man is forced by the christians against his will,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lactanc.</note>
      <hi>seeing he that wants faith and devotion is vnserviceable to God:</hi> and that <hi>God, not beeing contentious, would not be worshipped of the vnwilling.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And in deede after he had manifested his whole truth, &amp; the new Ierusalem, his true church, if these things would
<pb facs="3"/> not serve to convince men, he saith. <hi>He that is vniust, let him be vniust still, and he that is filthie,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rev, 22.</note>
      <hi>let him be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still.</hi> Yet doe I not denie all compulsion to the hearing of Gods word, as the meanes to worke religion, &amp; common to all sorts good and bad; much lesse excuse civill disobedience, palliated with religious shewes and pretences, vsed by Annabaptists &amp; others, or condemne necessarie restraint of publik idolatrie, &amp; the excercise of all erronious religions: So as these rules of reason be held inviol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ble: That the bond betweene Magistrate and subject is essentially civill; but religious accidentally only, th ugh eminent: So that he is only to hinder and punish that which God would have hindred and punished; and to cherish that only which God would have cherished; and not by the cunning of prevaricators, who serve not the Lord Iesus, but theire owne bellies, to be drawne either to hold them guiltie that follow Gods Testament, or those guiltlesse, <hi>who erre in theire hearts</hi> &amp; practises, <hi>because they have not known his waies;</hi> nor indeede will know them; whence it may come to passe, that he that persecutes the chu ch of Christ, &amp; defēdeth the Synagogne of Satan may thinke he doth God service; when he hath rather cause to feare that he helpeth his grand ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie the devill. I have therefore endeavoured to shew these things in the fall of Babylon; and withall, that as the christian Magistrate hath his power of Magistracie from God, which his Christianitie serves to sanctifie and direct; so vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is to vse it for God and his honour, and that in his true worship in which he is espetially honoured, and only against the contrarie. The world doth ring of three complaints.</p>
   <p n="1">1. When a State professeth the reformed Religion, &amp; hath Churches governed by Elders, as neere as it can to the practise of the primitive Churches; yet by a tolleration, or connivance gives leave to Annabaptists, Arminians, Lutherans, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
<pb facs="4"/> and others, to have Churches in the same Cities.</p>
   <p n="2">2. When a State is of the Popish Religion, and maintaynes it, yet both gives absolute tolleration to the reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and contemnes it, as in France.</p>
   <p n="3">3. When a State professeth the Protestant Religion, and withall a hierarchie, traditions and Ceremonies, which are Romishe, commanding all to a conformitie in them, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding all confutation of them, and of some other Popish &amp; Arminian tenets and practises, much connived at.</p>
   <p>In the two first, men say, if Sathan have a Synagogue or Throne in the one ende of a Citie, yet Christ hath a Throne in the other; his Temple is open, and his Servants have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to serve him, as the primitive Churches did; neyther is any man compelled to other; they may freely preach &amp; write against all errours; This cannot be sayde of the third; and therefore, if a poore Christian, that would flie out of Babylon, be forced to dwell in one of them, let him learne by Christs word, in which he ought to take up his habitation.</p>
