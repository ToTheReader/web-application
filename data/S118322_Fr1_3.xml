      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cōplaint of all ages, and of all men, that the times are bad, they most finding fault with it, by whose corruption it decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and waineth in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: But indeed, if euer
<pb facs="7"/>
vertue her selfe had cause to put on widdowed gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and mingle her constancie with lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is in our daies to see her selfe thus forsaken and abandoned, being sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome entertained for her reall worth, without some secondarie respect of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applause and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which though shee rarely attaine for her owne sake, yet great Ones are content in her likenesse, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to serue their owne
<pb facs="7"/>
appetites, then when they appeare nakedly clad in their owne Deformitie; which is the cause we mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the grounds, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of Honours, how they alter, and (as it were) vnnaturize the dispositions and manners of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when indeed they cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly disguising and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with false seemings, their cankred and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inclinations, steale to their aspired height, which once growne Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="8"/>
of, they pull off their Visor, and armed with their greatnesse, feare not to please themselues with the manifesting their vices. This I thinke, as it moued the Printer to aduise me to the publishing of these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations and Prayers, so aboue all hee entreated to haue a care, they were not long or tedious, lest the people (who measure it with their eye) might take a surfet of it before it came to the stomack: Like men,
<pb facs="8"/>
willing, for their recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to walke a mile to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themselues, but if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily inforced to any longer iourney, growing wearie before they set one foote abroad; I haue, I thinke, satisfied the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters desire, and the humour of the people, rather die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely necessarie, then ouer-charging their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to a satietie, till by these they shall be enabled (vertue gathering strength
<pb facs="9"/>
by practice) to feed on lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Discourses for their weale and saluation: to which to draw thē more, by setting forth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of prayer, there can be, I hope, nothing better, or more knowingly spokē, then that often and earnest precept of our Sauiours, commanding vs to <hi>Watch</hi> and <hi>Pray continually, lest we enter into temptation:</hi> which ioined with his own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (made precious by his vnparaleld and vnimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="9"/>
loue to vs) cannot but melt the most frozen and hardened carelessenes, making it apt to receiue so blessed an impression. That his life was nothing but a Diuine Rapture, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Meditation of high and excellent Mysteries, is no way to be doubted; and that he did vsually breathe them forth in zealous and most deuoute prayers, the holy Scripture testifyeth, how often and humbly in the accomplishing of his
<pb facs="10"/>
Miracles, how often and feruently before his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and at the instant of his betraying, and taking, when the blessed Apostle and follower S. <hi>Peter,</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently rauished with the extremitie of loue to so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Lord, tooke out his sword, and with it cut off one of the eares of the Ministers, hee rebuked him, saying, <hi>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and hee will giue me more then twelue Legions
<pb facs="10"/>
of Angels?</hi> euer intimating vnto vs, the excellencie and efficacie of prayer, as the onely meanes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vertuous purposes.</p>
   <p>For the set times of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call prayers (heauenly and short eiaculations being at all houres to be vsed) it hath been thought fit, by many learned and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fathers, to be diuided into Morning, Noone, and Euening, it being most fit to offer the Immortall and high Deitie, our first
<pb facs="11"/>
thoughts, that season'd with the knowledge of him, we may with the more care &amp; attention behaue ourselues the day following; recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our selues at Noone to desire strength for the continuance and perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in holy and good purposes; and closing and shutting vp all actions and transitorie thoughts in the Euening, with thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing for the blessings of that day, and an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of our sins and
<pb facs="11"/>
transgressions, committing our selues to his Fatherly protection the ensuing night, that awaking in the morning, wee may finde a wel-pleasing rellish of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts timely and maturely digested.</p>
   <p>For the better compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our selues at the time of prayer, we ought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, duely and earnestly to consider his Greatnesse and Immensitie to whom wee pray, the necessitie and height of what
<pb facs="12"/>
we pray for, and our own vnworthinesse to obtaine a grant &amp; accomplishment of our petitions, that being truely humbled and cast down in our selues, it may please the Lord of heauen and earth, to haue the more pitie &amp; compassion on vs.</p>
   <p>And if men that appeare to speake before an earthly King, seriously prepare and examine themselues, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling euery word to a iust weight and measure, strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taking care of the lest
<pb facs="12"/>
gesture; How ought we in the presence of so great, &amp; aboue all comparisons, infinitely excelling a Lord, be sollicitous and heedfull, that nothing passe from vs vnworthy, or il-beseeming his Diuinitie &amp; purenesse?</p>
   <p>Thus praying, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our selues, we shall (no question) finde to our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-dying comfort, the euer-liuingnes of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our iust petitions, being made witnesses of
<pb facs="13"/>
the dissolution of heauen and earth, &amp; the vanishing away of all things transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie at the command of his Word, one iot or tittle whereof shall not be taken away or diminished, but remaine pure and perfect, in the iustification of his Elect, clothing them with eternitie and immortality; to which state of happines our blessed Sauiour send vs all, for his holy Names sake.</p>
