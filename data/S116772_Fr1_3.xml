      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Ambition of <hi>Princes</hi> hath many good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shrouds and disguisements; it vsually borrowes the false beautie of apparences to bleare vulgar eyes, and to elude or pacifie Opinions: But among the rest it hath none either more potent to this effect, or more malicious than when it gilds it selfe with the colour of Religion, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes the couerture of Pietie. For this is to write God himselfe the Author of all their vsurpations, and to cast vpon that <hi>Infinite Iustice</hi> the patronage, the shame and dishonour of all their publique Robberies, Oppressions, and Violences. The <hi>Pagan</hi> Tyrants of old, though they were not more iust, yet they were more modest: They had a more venerable conceit of their <hi>Gods</hi> (such as they were) then to entitle them to their owne vniust actions And therefore when by plaine force or fraud, they tooke from lawfull <hi>Princes</hi> their Crownes and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> they professed ingenuously herein to neglect Piety and Iustice,
<pb facs="6"/> hence that Maxime of theirs—<hi>regnandi causâ violan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum est ius, In caeteris rebus pietatem colas.</hi> But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs <hi>Christians</hi> (to the great blemish of our most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Faith,</hi> and the scandall of <hi>Infidels,)</hi> wee haue Two great
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> the one a <hi>King,</hi> the other a <hi>Bishop,</hi> who vnder the faire pretence of Piety haue already inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a great part of the World, and in their hopes deuoured it all. The former vnder shadow of Conuerting the <hi>West-Indies</hi> hath depopulated them, baptized those poore <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims</hi> in their owne bloud, and to make them
<hi>Christians,</hi> hath made them no men. And no doubt it was meerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects of Conscience and pure zeale for the Church against Heresie, that moued him to seaze vpon <hi>Nauar, Sicily,</hi> &amp;c. to imbroile all
<hi>France</hi> with that (damned) Holy <hi>League,</hi> and now lately to depriue the <hi>Grisons</hi> of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline,</hi> and that most Noble <hi>Prince Palatine</hi> of his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Inheritance. For it seemes it is a part of their <hi>Gospell</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that the
<hi>Catholique Faith</hi> cannot subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Catholique Monarchy.</hi> And it seemes they are aliue againe, whom that noble
<hi>Britaine</hi> of old in <hi>Tacitus</hi> called—<hi>raptores Orbis—quos non Oriens non Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens satiaucrit—auferre, trucidare, falsis nominibus Imperium, atque vbi solitudinem faciunt pacem ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant.</hi> I am sure whosoeuer lookes vpon the present mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Face of <hi>Europe,</hi> euery where mourning and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnder his Armes or Artifices, will confesse that if he
<pb facs="6"/> aduance his <hi>Conquests</hi> a little further (though euery good man will abhor the <hi>Omen,</hi> and humbly pray the <hi>Lord God</hi> to auert it,) he will quickly lead all <hi>Europe</hi> in triumph, make the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe become his <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,</hi> turne all <hi>Kingdoms</hi> into his <hi>Prouinces,</hi> &amp; Plant them with Colonies of <hi>Moores</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> all <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> to be petty Officers of his House, and send the meane people to dig in his Mines, or to fish Him some Pearles in <hi>America.</hi> The worst is, he preuailes not so much by his owne Vertue, as by our sinfull security, who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>,</hi> fallen from the innocence, wisdome, and courage of our <hi>Auncestors:</hi> if betimes we looke not to it, our <hi>Posterity</hi> will haue occasion to curse vs for betraying their <hi>Liberty.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Hosts</hi> goe out with the
<hi>Armies</hi> of our most religious and worthy <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> and send him <hi>Counsell</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> and good
<hi>Successe</hi> in these his iust and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary <hi>Warres,</hi> so as all that hate Him may flee before Him.</p>
   <p>For the Other who qualifies himselfe the Catholique Bishop, its a pitty to reade how he inchanted the <hi>World</hi> in former times with the formidable names of <hi>S. Peters Keyes</hi> and his <hi>Swords,</hi> of the <hi>Romane Succession</hi> and <hi>Apostolique See;</hi> his infallible <hi>Iudgement</hi> and vnlimited <hi>Iurisdiction.</hi> How by degrees he plucked vp all ancient Pales and Boundaries, extended his
<hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/> all ouer the <hi>Earth,</hi> and at length inclosed all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome</hi> within the walls of <hi>Rome.</hi> His first attempt to this purpose was to depresse his <hi>Concurrent</hi> of
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> in spite of so many <hi>Canons</hi> of ancient
<hi>Generall Councels,</hi> so iealous of their <hi>
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>, Ecclesiasticall limits,</hi> and so often assigning to those Two Prime <hi>Patriarches, <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>,</hi> equall Honour and Authority;) which he easily compassed by fauouring the <hi>Treasons</hi> and
<hi>Parricides</hi> of that vsurper <hi>Phocas,</hi> receiuing from Him in recompence the Title (so much detested by <hi>Gregory 1.)</hi> of
<hi>Oecumenicall Bishop.</hi> After this he contended with all <hi>Catholique Bishops</hi> in that quarrell about Images, and against them all gained his Processe in that ridiculous Packe the second <hi>Synod</hi> of
<hi>Nice.</hi> At last, being encouraged with this great successe, his Arrogance still prompting Him <hi>
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>,</hi> he fell to contest with <hi>Emperours</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, in apparence for
<hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Inuestitures, in truth for Soueraignty: Confounding all <hi>Europe</hi> with horrible ruines, tumults, and bloudshed, firing all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries with his <hi>Excommunications &amp; Interdicts,</hi> which were indeed but <hi>Igues fatui,</hi> neuer penetrating (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the lightning of <hi>Heauen)</hi> but where they found no resistance, and receiuing all their heat and vigor from the cold patience and weaknesse of the <hi>Times,</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming to himselfe a vaste power to dethrone
<hi>Kings</hi> at
<pb facs="7"/> his pleasure, and to tosse their
<hi>Crownes</hi> like so many <hi>Tennis-Balles:</hi> Till, in conclusion, he was saluted <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus Deus noster Papa, <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>,</hi> no more a Mortall, and had seised himselfe as in fee of all
<hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> all <hi>Bishops</hi> being now his
<hi>Curates,</hi> and all <hi>Kings</hi> (in his account) his
<hi>Vassals</hi> and <hi>Homagers.</hi> With such lewd impostures and holy trum peries he cheated our innocent <hi>Forefathers,</hi> hauing first blindfolded them by withdrawing the diuine light of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and by planting a fatall ignorance of all good <hi>Letters,</hi> which (together with the superstition which followed) so amused and enfeebled all
<hi>Spirits,</hi> that they were rendred capable of any (absurdest) impressions. But it exceeds all wonder that he should yet still continue to put his iugling tricks upon this <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> and
<hi>Learning,</hi> wherein he hath beene so often convicted and stigmatized for a <hi>Coozener:</hi> Vnlesse haply his <hi>lani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> the
<hi>Iesuites</hi> make Him beleeue that they haue subdued all
<hi>Peoples</hi> under his <hi>Blind Obedience,</hi> and taught them (like uncleane Beasts or like Themselues) to swallow his morsels without chewing, to receiue his Commandements without disputing. If He nourish any such impudent hopes, the stout <hi>Venetians</hi> (as appeares in this History) will helpe to disabuse Him, and lend Him spectacles (if He be not starke blind) to see his Error. Besides, those Excellent Wits of that <hi>Republique</hi> (all
<pb facs="8"/> collected in the Latine by <hi>Goldastus)</hi> which vpon this occasion canuased the <hi>Controuersies,</hi> haue so learnedly nullified these <hi>Papall</hi> pretensions and
<hi>Censures,</hi> that hereafter his wisest course will be to play these parts vpon the stages of <hi>Iapan</hi> or <hi>Mexico</hi> among his new silly <hi>Conuerts,</hi> not in <hi>Europe</hi> where an
<hi>Asse</hi> is easily knowne from a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and his
<hi>Rodomantades</hi> in this kinde will finde as much credit as
<hi>Lucians</hi> true Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. In one word, We are told in this History (pag. 117.) by an <hi>Oracle,</hi> our late blessed Soueraigne of Immortall Memory, (and it is a truth as cleare as if it were <hi>Solis radio scriptum,</hi> in the Prouerbe of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> written with a Sunne-beame,) that the onely pride of this <hi>Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> hath bred and fomented all <hi>Contentions</hi> in point of <hi>Religion,</hi> miserably difioynted the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> into so many fragments and pieces, and still keeps fresh the bleeding wounds and ruptures of
<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome;</hi> Whilest he is obstinate in despite of
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> to erect his absolute <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and to that end urges euery <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Trent Councell</hi> more rigorously than any part of <hi>Canonicall Scripture,</hi> and all those new <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the fourth his <hi>Creed</hi> more then the old ones of the <hi>Apostles:</hi> Whilest be disdaines to acknowledge his <hi>Humanitie</hi> by exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Himselfe from
<hi>Error,</hi> obtrudes vpon the <hi>World</hi> euery fantafie of his
<hi>Court</hi> for a <hi>Catholique</hi> veritie,
<pb facs="8"/> and presumes (as if he had the keeping of the
<hi>Booke</hi> of <hi>Life)</hi> to raze out of the <hi>Communion</hi> of
<hi>Saints</hi> all that are not of his <hi>Schismaticall Congregation,</hi> as if <hi>Fides Catholica</hi> were now nothing but <hi>Fides Vrbica,</hi> or
<hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bana,</hi> and as if they had no part in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> who are not in the part of <hi>Pope Vrban,</hi> iust the old iargon of
<hi>Donatus,</hi> one of the Patriarchs of <hi>Popery.)</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now for these broyles at <hi>Venice,</hi> it had beene a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle (far exceeding all that euer were wrought by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Xauier,</hi> or any of his Comperes in the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West Indies,)</hi> if the <hi>Iesuites</hi> had not beene tampering with their bellowes in this fire. Although in the euent, (by the iust prouidence of <hi>God)</hi> all the smoake was blowne into their owne <hi>Eyes,</hi> and their owne
<hi>Nests</hi> by this fire consumed. For this wise <hi>Republique</hi> obseruing the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious humor of these wicked <hi>Spirits</hi> meerely incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the Peace of any <hi>State)</hi> thought best to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure them out of their <hi>Dominions,</hi> and accordingly by an irreuocable
<hi>Decree</hi> (which will not be so easily demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished as that
<hi>Pyramide</hi> erected once at <hi>Paris</hi> to their infamy) banished them for euer: Grounding their Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon this euidence (pag.
<hi>138.)</hi> that the <hi>Iesuites</hi> haue beene the sole Authors of all discords, disorders, and miseries in this Age thorowout all
<hi>Kingdomes</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> And certainly few parts of the Habitable Earth haue escaped their bloudy and violent Practises; neither
<pb facs="9"/> is it possible in <hi>Europe</hi> to name that Countrey (saue only <hi>Spaine</hi> and the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> their great Patrons) wherein those restlesse <hi>Furies</hi> haue not beene kindling Combustions, and plotting the diuision (and consequently the desolation) of the <hi>State.</hi> Without question, when they goe to their owne place, the Deuill is wise enough to pin vp these Broüillons in some close dungeon by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, for otherwise they would disturbe <hi>Hell</hi> it selfe, and <hi>Satan</hi> should haue no peace in his owne Kingdome, which (as our Sauiour tells vs) if it be diuided cannot stand. Nor doe they onely act but teach <hi>Sedition;</hi> giue rules of disloyalty, periury, and parricide; make their Disciples beleeue that
<hi>Rebellion</hi> is a vertue, and the murthering of a <hi>Prince</hi> a merit; that a <hi>Clarke</hi> cannot be a <hi>Traitor,</hi> because he is no Subiect; and that a King ought not to raigne or liue if he serue not the
<hi>Pope,</hi> who hath (directly or indirectly, it matters not) all Power in Heauen and Earth. These are the <hi>Maximes</hi> of their <hi>Cabale;</hi> aboue <hi>30. Iesuites</hi> of late haue beene openly challenged by the
<hi>Vniuersity</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> (in the name of all the others of
<hi>France)</hi> to haue published these execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrines, tending to the ruine of Mankinde. And lest they should want <hi>Actors</hi> for any of their <hi>Tragedies</hi> in time of need, they haue their <hi>Chambers</hi> of
<hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which are clearely so many <hi>Seminaries</hi> of
<hi>King-</hi>killers and <hi>Assassins:</hi> wherein their weake or wilde
<pb facs="9"/> Nouices are first frighted out of their Wits, and so anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prepared for any (the most desperate) enterprises. Neuer was Sect so iustly and vniuersally hated and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: All Nations detest and suspect Them, yet still they prosper. So strangely, that whosoeuer seriously eyes their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Practises,</hi> will see they doe but equiuocate with their owne <hi>Masters,</hi> the
<hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Spaine:</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to be their <hi>Factors</hi> and Instruments, but indeed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their right eye vpon Themselues. So that if the World do not quickly resolue to preuent Them by an vtter abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this pestilent <hi>Vermin,</hi> the next Age will see the
<hi>Iesuites</hi> plant both the <hi>Catholique Crownes</hi> vpon the Head of their Generall. In the meane while we sleepe, and which is worse, we sinne; Neuer more need we had to be at peace with <hi>God,</hi> and well vnited among our selues, being threatened with so many dangers and Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. What then can wee iudge of so many new <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> in the
<hi>Church,</hi> so many old sinnes in the <hi>State,</hi> but that they are certaine symptomes (and indeed Causes) of our approaching ruine, which in all humane iudgement cannot be auoided, vnlesse the <hi>Lord</hi> as he is wont) work some <hi>Miracle</hi> in our preseruation. He hath long wooed vs with innumerable vnparalell'd mercies, and of late scourged vs with a furious Mortality: but our dull &amp; dead hearts are still stupid and insensible, we do not turne to him that smiteth vs, we doe not meet our
<hi>God</hi> by Repentance,
<pb facs="10"/> we returne nothing but insolence and ingratitude. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise his Mercy, and defie his Iustice; we scoffe at Holinesse in stead of honouring and imitating it, we laugh at sinne, in stead of lamenting it, and those are called <hi>Manners</hi> with vs, which our honest <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> would haue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Vices.</hi> Our
<hi>Atheisme, Sacriledge, Luxury, Excesse, Pride, Vnthankfulnesse,</hi> open <hi>Prophanenesse, &amp;c.</hi> crie downe vengeance vpon our heads, and will doubtlesse make vs the example of
<hi>Gods</hi> indignation to all the World, (as we haue beene formerly of his loue,) the pity of our Friends, the hissing and reproach of our Enemies round about vs. <hi>Tunc votorum praecipuus locus, quum spei nullus.</hi> All you that loue and feare <hi>God,</hi> and that tremble vnder the expectation of his wrath, giue him no rest, stand vp in the breach, and <hi>quasi manu factâ Deum ambientes,</hi> assault him with your prayers, helps to quench this fire of his anger with your teares of sorrow. Giue not ouer weeping, repenting, and praying, till you haue receiued a gracious answer, till the sinnes of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be pardoned, his imminent iudgements auerted, his ancient fauours recouered; till he haue rebuked <hi>Satan,</hi> and trodden him vnder our feet, till he haue frustrated the bloudy hopes and desires of the Enemies of his Truth, till he build vp the breaches, raise the ruines, binde vp the wounds of his <hi>Sion:</hi> Saying with <hi>Daniel, O Lord God</hi> which art great and fearefull, which keepest coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb facs="10"/> and mercy towards them that loue thee and keepe thy Commandements: We haue sinned, and committed iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and haue done wickedly, we haue rebelled and haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from thy Precepts, and from thy Commandements. For wee would not obey thy Seruants, thy Ministers which spake in thy Name, to our <hi>Kings,</hi> to our <hi>Princes,</hi> to our
<hi>Fathers,</hi> and to all the People of the Land. <hi>O Lord</hi> righteousnesse belongeth vnto thee, and to vs open shame and confusion of face, as appeareth this day. Yet compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and forgiuenesse is with the <hi>Lord,</hi> albeit we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled against him. Now therefore, <hi>O Lord,</hi> heare the prayers of thy seruants and their supplications, and cause thy Face to shine vpon thy Sanctuary, that lyeth waste for thy Names sake. <hi>O Lord</hi> heare, <hi>O Lord</hi> forgiue, <hi>O Lord</hi> consider and doe it, deferre not for thine owne sake, <hi>O my God,</hi> for thy Name is called vpon thy City, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy People.</p>
