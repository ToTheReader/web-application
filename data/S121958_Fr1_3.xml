   <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>I</hi> Hadde purposed (gētle reader) at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to haue printed againe, the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of a Christian lyfe, composed by D. loar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, &amp; trāslated (not lōg since) into our lōgue: as may appeare by the preface folovveing. And albeit I minded to adde certaine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and treatises vnto the same: yet ment I not, but to retayne so muche as therin vvas done before, esteeming it so vvell done (as in deed it is) as no alteration needed therein. But yet notvvithstanding, vvhen I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> dovvne an other order &amp; method to my sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, than that booke folovveth: and had begūne this first booke of resolution: vvhereof no parte is handled in that treatise: I founde by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rièce, that I could not vvell ioyne that vvith this: to satisfie, ether the order or argument by me cōceyued: &amp; therfore vvas I inforced, to resolue vpon a further labour, than at the first I intended: vvhiche vvas, to dravve out the vvhole three bookes myselfe: not omitting any thing, that is in the sayd Exercise, or other like bookes, to this effect VVhich thing by gods holy assistance, I meane to doe, as ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, healthe &amp; libertie shall permit me.</p>
   <p>Novv I am constrayned to breake of, for the presēt, &amp; to send <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> onelie this first booke of resolutiō: vvhich I beseeche our Lord may so
<pb facs="3"/>
vvorke in thy hart by his heauenlie grace, as I maye beīcouraged therby the sooner to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pache the other tvvo. God for our better triall permitteth many difficulties, disturbances, lettes, &amp; hynderāces, in euerie thing that is takē in hād for his seruice: but yet, alvvayes after, he helpeth vs out agayne: as I knovv he vvill doe from tyme to tyme: the cause being his: and much more importing hym than vs. The onelie thing that he desireth at our hādes is, that vve should once resolue our selues throughelie to serue hym in deede: &amp; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quētlie cast our selues vvholie īto his holy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: vvithout reseruatiō of any one iote that vve haue, vnto our selues: &amp; then should vve see, hovv good and mercifull a lord he is: as novv also vve proue dailie beyond all deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, or expectatiō. Our lord blesse &amp; preserue thee (gētle reader) &amp; enriche thee vvith the guyftes of his holie grace: &amp; vvhen thou art amiddest thy deepest deuotiōs, I beseeche thee to haue some memorie of me also, poore sinner: as I shall not be forgetfull of thee, But aboue all others, lett vs bothe be myndfull to praye for our persecutors: vvho finallie vvill proue to be our best freēdes: being in deed the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers vvhich beate and polish vs, for makyng vs fytt stones, for the buylding of gods nevv Ierusalem in heauen.</p>
