   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is for al sorts of men in the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church to try their estates whether they bee true Christians or no, may appeare by the expresse charge giuen in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="2" facs="9"/> concerning it. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth men to <hi>examine themselues whether they be in the faith, and whether Christ Iesus be in them, vnlesse they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, 2. Cor.</hi> 13. 5. And the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> would haue all Christians, <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to make their Calling and Election sure, 2. Pet.</hi> 1. 10. And the like comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement lay vpon men in the Church of the Iewes in the old Testament, as may appeare by that exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Lam. 3. 40. Let vs search and try our wayes, and turne againe vnto the Lord:</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in this
<pb n="3" facs="9"/> case, chargeth men to <hi>commune with their owne hearts, Psal.</hi> 4. 4. How can men <hi>draw neere vnto God in the full assurance of faith,</hi> if they will not bee at the paines to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. Or how shall wee euer <hi>know that wee are of God,</hi> or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto any <hi>confidence of faith,</hi> as we ought to do? 1. <hi>Ioh. 5. 19. Ephes.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
   <p>How fearefully this point of sound tryall is neglected, and how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably most men are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for want of it, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by this obseruation, which may vsually bee
<pb n="4" facs="10"/> made of men in the most places, <hi>viz.</hi> that many that are carnall men, say they are godly; and many that are godly men, say they are but carnall: Besides that a multitude of men, both good and bad, liue in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; the one not caring to get out of so woefull an estate; and the other not regarding the riches of Assurance.</p>
   <p>The causes of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable security, may bee obserued and noted both in wicked &amp; in godly men.</p>
   <p>In wicked men these things may bee easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
   <p n="1">
      <pb n="5" facs="10"/>1. A lothnesse to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine<note place="margin">Why wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men neglect the triall of their estates. 1. Because they are afraid all is not wel.</note> themselues and try their estates exactly, for feare lest they should find that they are not in a good estate: Their hearts secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemne them, and they thinke, if they should take particular notice of their owne condition, it would be found, that they haue indeed no true grace in them; and therefore they rather choose to liue in that doubtfull estate, then to bee put out of doubt, and made to know, that they haue yet no right to the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; neuer considering
<pb n="6" facs="11"/> that the knowledge of our misery may be one degree to get out of it.</p>
   <p n="2">2. In such as see all is<note place="margin">2. They are sloth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full.</note> not well with them: the cause is <hi>slothfulnesse,</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with horrible <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption;</hi> they had rather weare out their daies in danger, then bee at the paines to vse the meanes for their owne repentance and reformation: They will wretchlesly put it to the venture.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Others will aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">3. They rest vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hope</note> vpon their <hi>common hope of mercy:</hi> They haue certaine generall confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed apprehensions of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="7" facs="11"/> in God, vpon which they wilfully engage their hopes, without care of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular warrant of their hopes from the Word of God, and so miserably perish: their hopes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but <hi>as the house of the spider;</hi> and, the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mercy failing them, they die either as stockes, without sence; or as <hi>Iudas,</hi> in horrible despaire.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Others rest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues<note place="margin">Or 4. vpon their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Religion.</note> vpon their outward <hi>profession of Religion,</hi> and some generall things wrought in them, and the good opinion others haue
<pb n="8" facs="12"/> of them, and so being somewhat <hi>neere the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to rest there, as the Israelits did neere <hi>Canaan,</hi> though they neuer posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it. Wee see many thinke, there needs no more to be sure they are in a good condition, then to heare Sermons, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from grosse out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward prophanenesse, and to bee well reputed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the godly, &amp;c. plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselues with the <hi>shew of godlinesse,</hi> though as yet they <hi>deny the power of it,</hi> as hauing attained no other righteousnesse,
<pb n="9" facs="12"/>
      <hi>then the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharises.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="5">5. In multitudes of<note place="margin">Or 5. they haue euill opinions about As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance.</note> men there are seated euill opinions about assurance: They thinke either it is <hi>impossible</hi> to be had, or it is <hi>needlesse,</hi> or it is <hi>presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to seeke it.</p>
   <p n="6">6. All wicked men are hindred by their <hi>beloued</hi>
      <note place="margin">6. They are letted by their belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued sinnes</note>
      <hi>sinnes,</hi> which they are not willing to part with, but of purpose forbeare the care of heauen, that they may the more securely liue in sinne.</p>
   <p>Thus of wicked men: It is true also, that many godly Christians haue
<pb n="10" facs="13"/> beene, and are extremely<note place="margin">Why some that are godly, neg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lect, the triall of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states.</note> faulty in neglecting the triall of their estates, and their Assurance: and the causes of this negligence in them are diuers: As</p>
   <p n="1">1. Some are so much<note place="margin">1. Euill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</note>
      <hi>mis-led</hi> by the surmises of their owne hearts, that they thinke that Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance would breed secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that it is a better way to keepe their owne hearts humble, to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtfull: not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that vnbeleefe is the chiefe cause of slothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and security; and that the assurance of faith is the chiefe meanes to
<pb n="11" facs="13"/> purge the heart, and quiet the soule, and workes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually in all the duties of loue.</p>
   <p n="2">2. In the most, <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> of their owne gifts and Gods promises, is the cause: for if Christians did see distinctly, how far the Lord had brought them by his grace, and withall did behold the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of their faith, and hope in Gods promises, they could not faile of comfort, &amp; establishment of heart.</p>
   <p n="3">3. <hi>Smothering of doubts</hi>
      <note place="margin">3. Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of doubts and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> and temptations, is a great let in many: Diuers Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
<pb n="12" facs="14"/> are secretly, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assaulted with certaine strange doubts; which if they did propound, and get sound answer vnto, their hearts would heale within them, and the work of faith prosper.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Some Christians are<note place="margin">They are wicked o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch.</note> kept without Assurance, through the ouermuch <hi>viewing of their owne daily infirmities</hi> in all parts of Gods seruice: They <hi>are wicked ouermuch;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they would study those Scriptures, that shew how graciously the Lord stands inclined toward his people, notwithstanding
<pb n="13" facs="14"/> their daily wants, their hearts would bee much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and their minds cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolued to trust vpon the euerlasting mercies of their God.</p>
   <p n="5">5. In some, the cause is<note place="margin">5. Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</note> found in the disease of their bodies: <hi>Melancholy,</hi> when it is growne to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, is a most stiffe and pertinacious aduersarie to Comfort and Assurance: It doth fill the heart with so many sad conceits and fancies, and is a humor so vnteachable, that comfort for the most part is as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spilt vpon the ground: And the more difficult it
<pb n="14" facs="15"/> is to remoue this let, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause vsually the parties possest by this humour, are so far from seeking helpe, that they will not bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that they are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with any such disease.</p>
   <p n="6">6. Some Christians are<note place="margin">6. Passions</note> hindred by their owne <hi>Passions;</hi> they are so fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and vnquiet in their dispositions, that their hearts are daily lifted off from the benefit of settled Assurance by their owne habituall discontents: Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse is a mischieuous distemper, that weakens both body and minde; and assurance and strength of
<pb n="15" facs="15"/> faith, seldome dwels in an vnquiet minde.</p>
   <p n="7">7. Others want assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,<note place="margin">7 Neglect of the meanes.</note> because they <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the meanes of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:</hi> they do not <hi>try all things, and keep that which is good;</hi> or <hi>they call not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God</hi> daily, feruently, and constantly, to giue them the <hi>spirit of reuelation,</hi> to shew them <hi>the hope of their Calling,</hi> and their glorious Inheritance, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. 18, 19.</p>
   <p n="8">8. <hi>A barren life</hi> is an<note place="margin">8. A bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren life.</note> vncomfortable life: and contrarywise, to <hi>abound in</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 58.</note>
      <hi>good workes,</hi> hath stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and a secret rest of heart, as an vnseparable
<pb n="16" facs="16"/> companion of it.</p>
   <p n="9">9. The <hi>loue of earthly</hi>
      <note place="margin">9. Too much loue of earthly things.</note>
      <hi>things</hi> is another great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment: many Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors haue their thoughts and cares so eaten vp with worldlinesse, that they cannot seriously seek Gods Kingdome, nor constant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly hold out in any course for the attainement of Assurance: This degree of faith requires some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the contempt of the world.</p>
   <p n="10">10. In some, there lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth<note place="margin">10. Secret sinne.</note> some <hi>secret sinne,</hi> which they know, and do not iudge themselues for, and doth daily preuaile in
<pb n="17" facs="16"/> them; and this either keeps out faith, or keepes it downe in the cradle, that it can get no strength. When I say <hi>secret sinnes,</hi> I mean secret from others, not from themselues. For sinnes of meere ignorance God doth not scourge in his seruants so, as to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his graces from them.</p>
