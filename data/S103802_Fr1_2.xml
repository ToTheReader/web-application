      </gap>fer had these hoggishe Papistes and cruell persewers of the gospell &amp; of the professours therof, to haue dwellinge still in their dioceses chirches and regions many legions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uylisshe rytes, supersticiose ceremonyes, dirtye tradicions and heythen ydolatrye, then Christ and his pure worde shulde on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce sette in fote amonge them frely &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be preached. And why? Chryst hathe drowned their swyne, say they. And if he shulde tary lōge emonge vs he wold drowne vs to, say they. Siche an answere made some polytyke gredy Gergesens of late possessed verely of legions of deuyls dryuinge thē yet hedlongs into the meare of almaner of mischeif, murther, lechery, dronkenes, glotony pryde ambicion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye &amp;c. refrayned with no shame no reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, with no feare nor lawe nether of god nor man, lyke mad wylde men cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge out in their pulpits and comon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus. That yf this newe lerninge and Lutherane gospell (for so call they gods holy worde) shulde come in frely to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, oh what an innouaciō, commocions &amp; mutaciōs wold it make in this realme▪ What sediciōs, tumults and hurle burlis shuld we haue a none in this now so peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a regiō? Beter it were therfor eche of vs all were still possessed and laden with
<pb facs="3"/>
legions of deuyls, fetered still in all idola<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>try and false religion, then that Iesus Chryst withe his worde shulde here tary any longer.</p>
   <p>Hereof may ye se what a preposter feare and sinister iugement there is nowe in this worlde. Men to be more afrayd of Chryst &amp; his gospell of saluacion to dwel with them, then of a legion of deuyls redy to rende them in peses. Be you (oh papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes) sewerer (thynke ye) vnder the deuyl then vnder Chryst: Do ye promyse your selues to be more quyet in Satans seruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce thē in Christs peaceable religiō? What harme (I pray you) hath our lorde Iesus Chryst &amp; his gospell done to you, so that yf ye walke in his wais and receyue his gospell, ye shulde feare any suche perels of batail sedicions and tumults to fall vpon you? He hath drowned our swyne (say you) he is not the autor of euill say I. He came to drowne and to mortifye your swynisshe filthynes &amp; bestly affectis and to blesse you and yours with encrease. He is the autor of peace and not of sedicion batail and tumult. Your selues thrustinge him and his worde awaye from you so truelly persecuting him in his preachers and professours be the very autors &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of all batail sedicions trouble morin of your beastis derthe famyn and pestelēce.
<pb facs="4"/>
And forbecause you feare so sore these euils to fall vpon you for receiuinge and retayninge Chryst with his gospell, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ye sewer, all these heuey heapes of calamities and yet greter &amp; grenoser pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges shorteli to be powered forth vpō you.</p>
   <p>But here obiecteth the vnfaythfull cruell Gadarens sayinge. We se it day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that where this newe lerninge is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, there foloweth myche trouble, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes tumult sondri sectes diuerse opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Truth it is. For neuer was the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad of gods worde sow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e &amp; begane to ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, Satan beinge a sleape. And therfore trede downe this blessed sead with your filthy feet, suffocate it, burne it, thrust it from you with swerde and fyer, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risshe still emonge you rather a legion of deuilis cōpellinge men to recant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye the truthe openly &amp; oft preched, orels burne them. Compell them to sayt. This is a realme of rightwijsenes where in is ministred all inste execucion and uo perse cucion. For where the heade and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner professeth Chryst there can be no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secucion. Nether is Chryst (tell it thē) per secuted but emonge the Iewes and genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. Unto this I answer. That the gospel preched is the worde of the crosse, Paul to witnes. i. Cor. i. And the true preachers therof, Chrystsendeth as lombes emonge
<pb facs="4"/>
wolues, Matth. x. Wherfor where as ye haue chased awaye &amp; suppressed the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of the crosse there can be no persecuciō therof, &amp; where as be no lōbes sent emon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge wolues, there cā not the wolues deuou re any lombes. And thus breifly by your owne factis and recantacion wordes, you haue properly proued your selues nether to haue the gospell nor any true prechers sent amonge you purely and frely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache it, which as it is the most euident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of gods heuey wrath to take awaye his worde and preachers from you, so is it the present token of his fauor to sende vs thē. Also where so euer is Christ our head, there are his members. And what the worlde and Satan did to our head and father of the houshold, the same do thei<note place="margin">Mat▪</note> yet still to his members and faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. If the highe preistes and bisshops Caiphas and Annas with the pharisais persecuted our heade Chryst so shall their successours persecute his members, for persecucion is as comon to the body as to the heade. And therfore sayd Paul, Col. i▪ I nowe reioyse in myne afflicciōs for your sakis. For I supple that at yet remayneth and shall euer endure in the affliccions of Chryst in my fleshe for his bodye whiche is the chirche. Here is it playn, Chryst in his members to suffer persecucions vnto
<pb facs="5"/>
the worldes ende vntill his aduersaries be slayne with the breath of his mouthe, wherfore take awaye persecucion out of Englond, and so take ye awaye the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of the crosse euen the gospell, the chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Christ &amp; all true preachers. Which all gone, there must the persewers &amp; thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters out of Chryst and his worde be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with legions of deuyls. For neuer was there any chirche so litle, so hole and perfit, but it had an aduersarye to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it. Chryst was euer to many mo a stomblinge stone and a signe to be agene<note place="margin">Luke. ij.</note> sayd, then to be beleued &amp; to ryse at hym. Then beginneth Satan to rustle when a strouger armed inuadeth his realme. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els what shuld he do but lydowun &amp; laugh or sleape to se his realme in tranquilyte and in a paceable possessiō? Caiphas An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas the bishops, scribes &amp; pharisais we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re holy religiouse gostely fathers (but no lordes) till Chryst begane to preache and reueled hym self very god and man, and the beleuers in him onely to besaued.

These bisshops whiche shulde kepe defende and edifye the walles of Hierusalem, are become very theues and cruell murtherers of the chirche of Chryst, takinge awaye hir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste garments, euen the holy Bybles, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments the worde of our faithe and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion, storuinge the pore Hongrye sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis with famyn, verefyinge the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of Amos.

The scriptures, the prophetis as Daniel &amp; the Apocalypse paynt forth christes chirche in farre other blody colours of affliccion &amp; persecucion then do our wealy proud bulls of Basan whiche as they neuer felt trouble for the truth, so knowe they not what the chirche of Chryst is. There is nothing that so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che displeaseth god, as when wealy idle men sittinge in securite and ease, pite not the persecucion of the pore chirche, as Amos complayneth sayinge.

   <p>I meruell of what lerninge and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion these bisshops be, that graunte the gospell to be in Englond, and not to be persecuted. The scripture techeth play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely, Matth. xvi. that emonge men, there was, and shall be euer, diuerse and sondre opinions of Christe and his religion and the worde of god euer to be agene sayd &amp; persecuted as longe as this worlde stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Who resisted Moses bringinge gods message and gospell into Egipt but the preistes of Egipte? In Israel, Helias prechynge gods worde, had he not the preistes of Baal his aduersaries and per sewers? The false prophetes resisted Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remye▪ The Pharisais persecuted Chryst.

<pb facs="10"/>
there semed to be a good quiete concorde of the chrysten religion, as longe as men beleued in the pope to be head of Chrysts chirche, receyued his false doctryne, ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes cere, tradicions, pardons, satisfacciōs, merits, prayd for the dead and to sayuts, and for the souls in purgatory, pelgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, worshipped stockes and stones, and his misse as a sacrifice for the syunes of the quike and dead. Whiche was euē the same that Chryst sayd in his gospell. As longe as the strong armed kepeth his fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re courte and castel gates, all thinges are in peace and salf gard that he hathe. For where Satan hath the rule and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer the comon doctryne and techers there taketh he diligent heed lest any or many externe dissensions or tumults ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, nether stereth he vp there many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spes, no not in the Turkes nor Iewes chirches in these dayes, because he hath them sewer at his pleasure beinge lorde head and kinge openly ouer their religiō. And euē so, in the popis kingedom hathe he kept &amp; pet dothe he kepe his fore cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le gates, that those thinges whiche he yet possedith myght continewe in peace. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Satans peaceable possession haue our bisshops brought, orels entend they to bringe ageyue their chirche of Englōd lo, so that nowe, thanked be their father

Satan, all is in peace without persecuciō (say they) turned into iuste execucion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theyr owne crafty construccion and execrable exposicion.</p>
   <p>But when the stronger armed cometh vpon hym, then rustleth Satan his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

So that there is no certayner argument and more euident token of the gospell to be vtterly oppressed, &amp; of Satan to raigne in peace, as to se the publike concorde of, and in the religion. And there is no tokē so certayn manifest and euident of the worde of god arysing and cominge forth into syght, as when ye se a comon publike discorde in, and of the religion. For and yf euer men shuld haue loked and trusted for any open and generall concorde of, &amp; in the religion in the worlde, at the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge and open prechinge of the gospell, it shuld haue ben at that tyme when our lorde Iesus Chryst him selfe reueled and preached it emonge the Iewes. He is the sone of god by whom al things were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, no aposte, nor prophete to be compa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

forth with great honour and created the prince of all Egipt. Iob loste all his good but double was restored him. Dauid was caste out into exile of Saul, but yet was he called home agen and exalted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the regall maiestye. Daniel was cast in to the lyons, and a non made the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Persians. And as ye se, that if our god in this worlde promoueth his, out of affliccion and persecucion into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye honor and felicite, miche more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slateth he his derely beloued chosen out of these miserable and heuey present per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secucions into that heuenly perpetuall ioye and felicite in the other worlde. And the lenger it is differred the more sweter it is when we haue it, our lorde god yet counfortinge vs with his assewered pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises sayinge. I shall delyuer mi people frō all their tribulaciōs. Soner shall heuē and erth passe awaye then mi wordis to passe vnfulfilled, hills and mountayns shal be shakē down but my mercy shal not go fro me, &amp; the couenāt of mi peace shall not be moued saith the lorde god moste mercifull. Loke vpon Christe the sone of god whiche aftir he was deiected vnto the dethe of the crosse, was he not exalted into the moste hyghe honor &amp; glory, &amp; had geuen him a name aboue al names so that in the name of Iesu euery since boweth

downe bothe in heuen erthe &amp; in hell? and what is done in the head shall not the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me be done in the mēbers? Wherfore the more affliccion and persecucion the worde of the crosse bringeth to vs, the more feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and greter ioye abideth vs in heuen. But the worldly peace, idle ease, welthey pleasure and this present transitory feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyte which the vngodly imagin to procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re them selues here by persecutinge and thrustinge awaye the gospell, shal be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned here into their owne trouble bataill (as ye now this daye see it) and at laste into the horrible destruccions and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of their realmes, and aftir this (if they repent not) into ther own perpetual infelicite, perdicion and dampnacion. And if our lordely prowed bishops wolde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and measure the state of the christen chirche by the actes of the Apostles, they shuld see in howe greuouse persecucion it was, when the moste nowmber of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples<note place="margin">Act. vi.</note> encreased. Agen if they wolde read the storyes ether of the holy or haithen, they shulde see that when the chyrche was in moste welthe and ease, the prelats in idlenes aspiringe for riches and honor, then entred into it, the most pestelēt poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and destruccion of all godly doctrine, then encreased all ydolatry heresyes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persticion, and mens deuilyssh tradicions

So that where as is no persecucion of Christes religion but all in securite and reste there is that chirche lykely not to continewe longe in the trwe faithe.
