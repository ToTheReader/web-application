   <head>TO THE REDERS. ❧To the gentill reders and syncere louers of truthe.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou shall haue here, gentill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, a small dialoge betwene the Lawyere &amp; Diuine: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if there lacke suche eloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, suche dryfte of argumentes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance of reasons, as parauenture ware requisite, and as ye shall desyre: yet we shall moste entierly pray you, that where we be nat sufficient to supplye the same, to content your selfe with this our rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, declarynge the pure truthe alone: whiche you shall be right sure to fynde in this poore treatyse. For here haue you no newe allegatyon of mans inuention or imaginatiō: but onely taken of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of god, of the counsels and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the churche vniuersall, of mooste auncient popes and other holy doctours wryttinges, with the factes and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryties of blessed men besyde, withoute wrythinge or wrestynge of any of them: beyng taken of whome and of none other I am sure you will say it is to be estemed
<pb facs="3"/>
for a most assured truthe. Prayenge you most benigne reders that tho some wolde saye that they be nat truely alleged, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to gyue credence to so many appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vniuersities whiche affirme our alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to be true: than to the asseuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other, specially of some fewe affectionate persones, whiche do or may endeuour to denye the same. And nowe therfore to tell you the very truthe, this same is the grounded cause why this ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell worke beareth his name, whiche is the Glasse of truthe. For it is plainly the same clere glasse, within the whiche ye shall see and beholde (if ye loke well and leysurely in it) the playne truthe of our mooste noble and louinge princis cause: whiche by vnmete and vnkynde hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge hathe hytherto had so ouerlonge a staye. The whiche doutlesse if we well considre, is moche more our hynderance than his. For his lacke of heyres male is a displeasure to him but for his life tyme: as lackinge that whiche naturally is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syred of all men to haue childerne. But our lacke shall be permanent so longe as the worlde lasteth: excepte that god pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide.
<pb facs="3"/>
For tho we haue a female heyre, whiche is bothe indued with moche ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue &amp; grace in many dootes and gyftes, yet if a male might be atteyned it ware moch more sure, if we well perpende and pondre many vrgent &amp; wayghtie causes. Amongest whiche this one, is depely to be forsene, that if the female heyre, shall, chaunce to rule, she can nat cōtinue longe without an husbande. whiche by goddes lawe, muste than be her gouernour and heed, and so finally shall directe this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme. But who that shulde be, with the contentement of the subiectes, me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, it were harde to excogitate. For proximitie of blode, is to great a lette to some, otherwise mete for that purpose, except we wolde be so beestly to put our necke eftsones in the snare of this erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious prohibited errour, whiche is, and hathe ben alwayes detested by the moste parte of all the famous clerkes of christen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome. The punisshement whereof, were to terrible to be suffered, and also to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable to be harde of, emonges chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten folke. On thother side, to other some, it were daungerous, leste we shulde
<pb facs="4"/>
make thē superiours to vs, ouer whome, we clayme superioritie, seynge the manne must rule the woman. Others outwarde mete personages our sklender wittes can nat comprehende. And as touchinge any mariage within this realme, we thinke, it were harde to deuise any condigne and able person, for so highe an enterprise, moche harder, to finde one, with whome the holle realme wolde &amp; coulde be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to haue him ruler and gouernour. Wherfore we thinke the establysshement of titles is nat so surely rooted nor yet so entierlye mainteyned by the female as by male. Whiche well consydered syns the vnion of all titles do remayne and be collocate in him onely, we oughte of duetie (if oure wittes may thereto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende) to excogitate all wayes to vs pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, howe we might atteyne the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of heyres male. And that way ones founde, erenestly with celerite to putte in vre: in no wise sufferinge this wayghtie &amp; vrgent cause to be lenger differred or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, by those whiche do but vsurpe to them selfes an honoure and vayne glory contrary to many generall counsels and
<pb facs="4"/>
their owne lawes also: as more playnly shall appere in this litell treatise of truth. For els accordynge to an auncyent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe,<note place="margin">

Farthermore you shall in this Glasse see, howe that nowe it ought to be ordred after our simple iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gementes: so to haue a good and perfitte ende, moste for his honour and quietyng of conscience, for oure great welthe, &amp; for the prosperite of this his noble realme. And nowe this same is the truth, of whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che scripture saieth.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Magna ueri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tas, et forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or prae oīb{us}, non est cum en quic{que} ini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quum.</hi> 3.

This is the sole truth lefte vntill her selfe. Without all vayne ostentation, without inuentinge or borowynge of ydell titles and inscriptions, withoute colourynge dissemblynge, pretense and all outwarde paintynge. Ye shall fynde here the mere truthe (as we truste) withoute all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignyng, rayling gestyng and detractynge

of them, that of truthe no suche haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued: the whiche it may be your lotte to see and here some where els. Moche more we might induce to sette forthe and adourne this Glasse of truth before you, saue that the processe folowyng shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently and moche better perfourme the same, to the which I hooly remitte you: euermore mooste hartely prayenge you godly myldly &amp; without all yll affection to emprynte well in youre hartes this mere and syncere truthe, and so to folowe it that you may do a thinge acceptable to the pleasure of almyghtie god, and contentation of our souerayne and prince. And thus fare ye well in god lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing brotherne.</p>
