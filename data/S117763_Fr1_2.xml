                 <title>Honour and vertue, triumphing over the grave : Exemplified in a faire devout life, and death, adorned with the surviving perfections of Edward Lord Stafford, lately deceased; the last baron of that illustrious family: which honour in him ended with as great lustre as the sunne sets within a serene skye. A treatise so written, that it is as well applicative to all of noble extraction, as to him, and wherein are handled all the requisites of honour, together with the greatest morall, and divine vertues, and commended to the practise of the noble prudent reader. By Anth. Stafford his most humble kinsman. This worke is much embelish'd by the addition of many most elegant elegies penned by the most accute wits of these times</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Fame of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Heroick Vertues invites me to present to your gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance this Treatise, of which Honour is the Theam. Indeed
<pb facs="3"/>
to whom more fitly can shee make her addresse, then to your Lordship, through whose Veins she runs, from whose Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som shee flows, in whose Actions shee shines, and by whose Protection shee is secured from the insolent Affronts of the Vulgar? Being distressed, shee makes You her faire Sanctuarie, being wounded, she makes you her soveraigne Balme. Nay, (which draweth neere to a wonder) many put their Honour into Your hands, esteeming it more safe there, then in their owne. This is the first cause of my Dedication; The next is, that the true Child of Honour (the deplored Subject of this Book) was a Debtor to Your Lordship for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, whose Advancement in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Honour, and Estate; You made the greatest part of Your Studie. And,
<pb facs="3"/>
to say the Truth, where could such a Guardian be found for him as Your Lordship, since between the renowned Ancestours of You both, Vertue, and Bloud hath long since engendred a strict Friendship, and between whom there was a neare similitude of good and evill Destiny, both having amply shared of Infortunity, and Glory? I may adde, that there cannot be a more lovely Sight, then to behold an ancient, lofty Cedar sheltring with his Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the Rage of weather, a Young one of the same Kinde, aspiring to the same Height; had not the Frost of Death, immaturely nipt this Noble Plant, it were an Heresie to doubt that he would have flourisht under the care of a <hi>Lord,</hi> whose Vertue is too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense for one Region to containe, and
<pb facs="4"/>
whose Perfections are so many, and so transcendent, that they are able not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to adorn these more Polisht Parts of the World, but to civilize also the more Barbarous, and to make an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> of <hi>Madagascar.</hi> The Oblation of my Teares, and Supplications to God, not availing to keep him here, J have sent my Vowes after him, and have given him a Funerall Equipage consisting of the Testimonies of brave, good, and knowing Men, which will eternize him on Earth, as his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse will in Heaven. I, confesse freely, I was unwilling to leave him to the Mercy of some grosly ignorant <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologer</hi> of the Times, in whose Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish, Posteritie might unhappily have found him lying more ruin'd then his glorious <hi>Predecessours</hi> were by the
<pb facs="4"/>
Tyranny of Time, or the Cruelty of Princes. Now in the last place, I must most humbly beseech Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to take notice, that his whole Name have made an affectionate, but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent Choice of me to be their weak Oratour, to render Your Lordship sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive, and due thanks for the Good You did, or intended him, and withall to make You a Religious Promise of their Prayers to God, and their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; to Men, as in particular, I doe of the vowed faithfull service of</p>
