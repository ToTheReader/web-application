                 <title>A plaine confutation of a treatise of Brovvnisme, published by some of that faction, entituled: A description of the visible Church : In the confutation wherof, is shewed, that the author hath neither described a true gouerment of the Church, nor yet proued, that outward discipline is the life of the Church. Whereunto is annexed an ansvvere vnto two other pamphlets, by the said factioners latelie dispersed, of certaine conferences had with some of them in prison. Wherein is made knowen the inconstancie of this sect, what the articles are which they still maintaine as also a short confutation of them. There is also added a short ansvvere vnto such argumentes as they haue vsed to proue the Church of England not to be the Church of God</title>

Honorable) the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

profit, the councell of
Salomon is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,

vs to receiue admonition by his holie wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
In regard whereof, though hereticall
pamphlets are dailie dispersed, yet the wise are
loth to answer thē: as also lest that in answring
the fole according to his follies, they might seem
like vnto him: yet when silence hath hardned
the factious, and emboldned them to adde new
supplies, we learne that the foole is to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto his follies, lest he seeme wise in his own
conceit. This burden I haue taken vpon me, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
presumptuouslie; but finding on the one
side the learned vnwilling to deale with so sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
<pb facs="3"/>
a schisme, and on the other side, that small
learning wil be sufficient to ouerthrow so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rāt
a sect, I haue bin the more bold in this mine
attēpt: for I preiudice not the wise herein, who
refuse this labor, nor yet giue cause of discontēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the simple, for whose sake onely I haue
done it: if those with whom I deale find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
grieued, I regard it not; onely if I may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
the censure of rash presumptiō in publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this rude treatise vnder your honorable ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
I shall obtaine my desire. I haue presumed
to present it to your H. not for that I am able to
bring forth anie thing worthie your H. accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but that I might obtain a defence for my
self, &amp; your H. might be moued to go on in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
the Lordes building. So shall God by
your meanes be glorified, his church comforted,
and euerie member thereof shall haue iust cause
to continue their heartie praiers vnto God for
your H. prosperitie, with the increase of all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
giftes &amp; graces of his spirit in this life,
&amp; for the assurance of your euerlasting ioy in
