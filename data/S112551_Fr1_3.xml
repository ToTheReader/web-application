   <head>THE EPISTLE TO the READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, it is about foure yeeres since I promised, as my first worke done in this kinde should be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to put out some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of like nature vpon other mysticall and darke places of the holy Scriptures. Now I cannot but acknowledge my selfe herein a debter vnto thee for thy good acceptation, both of that, and of some other Bookes of mine also, and therefore as my weaknesse would giue me leaue, and the manifold distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of sicknesses, remouings, worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrances, and ministeriall Offices lying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="10"/>me permit, I haue prepared another part of the intended Treasury which thou here seest. Not as haply is expected, vpon the Epistles of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> which are next in order, but vpon the seuen smaller and more neglected Epistles and the Reuelation. For I obserued that faith without relying vpon workes for iustification, is not so needfull to bee pressed now adaies, which is a chiefe thing insisted vpon in the Epistles of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> but true loue and works flowing here-from, together with an holy and vnblamable life, to stirre vp vnto which, if we speake of the first, the Epistles of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> are excellent; of the second, the Epistle of Saint <hi>Iames;</hi> and if of the third, those of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> Againe, there are few that haue written vpon these Epistles in comparison of the other, and therefore for a supply of this defect, I thought it would be more acceptable, seeing I cannot doe all together, to doe some thing first here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. Lastly, because of all the Bookes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Reuelation is least vnderstood, and therefore is least read and meditated vpon, and yet most necessary comforts in these tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous times are to bee fetchted here-from, as singularly pointing at them, and a finall
<pb facs="10"/>deliuerance of the Church of God from all her troubles, my speciall aime in anticipating the proper time of it hath beene, that thou mayest not be longer left without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this common place of comfort, but be stayed and stablished in an assured expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ioyfull and blessed end, through the certaine and speedy downfall of the Romish Antichrist, and the vniuersall preuailing of the truth that then shall be, and the great triumphs that shall be made amongst the faithfull in all places therefore. In this Worke I haue not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted barely to explicate the difficulties of the Texts vndertaken, laying onely together what I finde in my Authors, and briefly concluding vpon my Exposition imbraced. But in the seuen Catholike Epistles which are handled accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the method of my former worke, I haue supplyed, which was there wanting: First, a Preface to each Epistle. Secondly, an Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis of each Chapter. Thirdly, choice Latine sentences opposed in the margine. Fourthly, a confutation of those Expositions which I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not. Fiftly, a paraphrasticall Exposition of the verses comming betweene Text and Text, wherein there is some, but lesse obscurity.
<pb facs="11"/>Sixtly, some short Annotations at the end of euery Text. Touching the Reuelation, because after the three former Chapters it is all most obscure:<note place="margin">Hicronim. Epist. ad Paulim.</note> for according to <hi>Ierome, Quot verba sunt tot sunt mysteria,</hi> there are as many myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as words; I haue therefore altered my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before vsed, handling it thorowout by Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, as <hi>Augustine</hi> sometime did many parts of the Scriptures.<note place="margin">Augustine.</note> And because, if I should here haue brought in my Authors speaking, the worke would haue growne too great, the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries to bee expounded being so many, and the Expositors so many, I haue spared this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and onely shewed the diuersity of their expositions, so proceeding to examine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine about euery question. And whereas in my determinations I haue sometimes gone from such Authors, as many of good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and zeale doe approue of, and sometimes from all, venting mien owne <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, as M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Fox</hi> dis his,<note place="margin">Fox.</note> I must intreat the friendly Reader to pardon me in so doing. For I hold it vaine for any man to write vpon any place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if he propoundeth to himselfe to square all his Expositions according to that which some other haue done before him,<note place="margin">Ansel.</note> as <hi>Anselme</hi> is a
<pb facs="11"/>strict follower of <hi>Augustine</hi> in all things, and <hi>Gorran</hi> of <hi>Thomas Aquinas;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gorran.</note> though <hi>Anselme</hi> be for this vsefull, because hee hath collected his expositions out of diuers workes of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> and fitted them so to the Epistles which he hath written vpon, that hee hath thereout made a iust Comment vpon them. The liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty taken by that Greeke Expositor,<note place="margin">Oecumen.</note>
      <hi>Oecumenius</hi> liketh mee better, who though hee followeth <hi>Chrysostome</hi> much, yet hee spareth not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to frame a different sense of his owne, as the Latine Interpreter, <hi>Marlorat,</hi> hath also done. It is a true saying,<note place="margin">Marlorai.</note>
      <hi>Bernardus non vidit omnia.</hi> No man, how intelligent soeuer, but may bee weake sighted in some things, and therefore the Lord hath appointed by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.29.</note> that when some Prophets haue spoken, others should iudge, and after their prophesyings ended, if God hath reuealed any different mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to them, to speake also. Now though wee haue no Reuelations in these times, yet being by our calling <hi>Lights of the world,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 5.14.</note> the Spirit lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not such as study and pray with assiduity without illuminations, by the benefit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of diuers in diuers ages haue giuen great light to many obscurities, many yet remaining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiently
<pb facs="12"/>cleared, that still in these times there might not be wanting doubts, about the dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing whereof we might bee exercised. And it is not to be condemned in vs (though much inferiour to the Worthies that haue gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs) if hauing, beside the assistance of the same Spirit of Light, the helpe of their labours, and of more experience by reason of the time wherein we liue, wee in all modesty refusing some of their Expositions, deliuer something new and of our owne, so that we haue alwaies respect to the analogy of Faith, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the holy Scriptures, as Saint<note n="*" place="margin">August.

      <hi>Augustine</hi> excellently directeth saying, When wee reade the Bookes of God, amongst so great a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of true Expositions, which goe vpon few words, and are warrantable by the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Catholike Faith, let vs choose that Exposition chiefly which shall certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be his meaning that wrote it. But if there be no such certainty, then that which the circumstance of the place hindreth not, and which agreeth with sound faith, but if from the circumstance of the place it cannot be discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, then that onely which the sacred Faith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth. For though the meaning of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="12"/>be vncertaine, yet it is not vnprofitable to frame an Exposition agreeable to sound faith. For mine owne part, I am so conscious to my selfe of mine owne weaknesse and want of iudgement, that howsoeuer, that which I haue written seemeth to mee most probable of all other Expositions in these darke and doubtfull passages, yet I force it not vpon any man, but now that I haue aduentured it to the publike view, I doe in all humility submit all to the iudgement of the learned, crauing (for the good successe of that which is here done, and for the seasonable and most sufficient perfecting of that which is further to bee done in this kinde) the helpe of thy most feruent and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prayers.</p>
