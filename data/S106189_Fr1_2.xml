No sooner I heard who it was, but I had <hi>Donne:</hi> left of vntiring my selfe, and wisht rather to tire al my powers, then he should want a welcome. I am now therefore ready againe, but so vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ready, as I was inforced to rubbe mine eyes to put off drowzinesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could fit my selfe to giue him entertainment. Tis you, deare Sir, that after a soaring flight of many yeeres, haue now lighted vpon a faire Tree,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

To your friends I was heretofore bound in dutie,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obligation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands duty.</note> and (in our youthfull societie) to your selfe in loue. But as the times are now, I reioyce that I shal haue cause to shew you both my loue and duty. Flatterie be farre from me, as I wish my soule from Atheisme. Yet I must ingenuously confesse,<note place="margin" type="runSum">To obserue, is a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="4"/> my dutie, it becomes me to meet you with humilitie, as one of the Churches Seruants: and to shew my Loue, I haue thought fit to prouide for you such a present, as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, I was able to giue, and I know you doe loue pure, and vndefiled <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</hi> In respect of my weakenesse, you may call it an Aprill Daisie, in the Lap of Winter, quickly blasted: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of my aspiring Loue, and your affecting Goodnesse, I hope it shall be receiued and welcomed as a Rose at Christmas, the New-yeeres gift of Art and Nature.<note place="margin" type="runSum">
