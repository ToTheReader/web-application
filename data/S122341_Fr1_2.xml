   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, this
ensuing Treatise hath
lien by mee a long time,
penned, but in a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and undigested man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as I gathered it, practised, or found
it out by industry and experience. It
was not in my minde to have as yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it to the publique view: but being
sollicited by the intreaties of some, and
those not a few, to impart to each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
person what his <hi>Genius</hi> most affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
I was enforced as well for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
of their requests, as for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydance
<pb facs="3"/>
of many inconveniences, to
dispose in some order such Experiments
as for the present I was content to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
Expect no elegancy of phrase, for
my time would not afford that, (nor
indeed my selfe to be the transcriber.)
I endeavored as much as I could, to
write in plaine termes, that in regard of
the easinesse thereof it might suit with
the meanest capacity. The whole book
consisteth of foure parts: The first
whereof treateth of VVater-workes.
The second of Fire-workes. The third
of Drawing, Painting, Graving, and
Etching. The fourth and last part trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of severall Experiments, as well ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
as delightfull: which because
they are confusedly intermixed, I have
entituled them <hi>Extravagants.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now my chiefest ayme and end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the generall good, I could wish a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb facs="3"/>
acceptance, but that is too uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to expect: I will content my selfe
that I am already certaine that these my
first and weak endeavours will finde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
with some, and I hope also
with all honest and indifferent Readers;
as for others, hap as hap may me, it is
not to be doubted, but that I shall scape
as well as many my betters have done
before me. Farewell.</p>
