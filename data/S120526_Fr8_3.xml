      </hi> Remember how heartily the Apostle prayed for his good friend <hi>Onesiphorus,</hi> who had ought refreshed him, and was not ashamed of his chaine, <hi>2</hi> Tim. <hi>1. 16, 18. The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus;</hi> and againe; <hi>The Lord grant that he may finde mercy of the Lord in that day</hi> Now whither that good man were willing to have his name, and his goodnesse made knowne to the world, J cannot say, (very likely his modest hashfulnesse would not seeme to desire it;) But who
