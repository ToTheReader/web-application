   <head>TO THE RIGHT
NOBLE, THE SONNES
of the most High, his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Brethren by the best,
that is, the second
Birth.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ruly Honorable, whose
Father is God, and
whose Inheritance a
Kingdome; the diuers sparks of
holy fire, which haue issued from
the Spirit that baptizeth with
fire, I haue gathered together;
by their vnited heate, to kindle
a flame where is none, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it, where it is alreadie
kindled. This blessing must
come from God, and therefore
of God haue I desired it. And
<pb facs="3"/>
surely the best, as ye well know,
haue turnes of winter, euen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their hottest zeale, and then
woe to him that is alone, for how
should he haue heate? Therfore
if in the time of cooling, some
spirituall worke be ioyned to the
heart, it may bee warmth will
grow betweene them. So haue
I often from <hi>Elisha</hi> applied,
euen some Prophet of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
life; and I wish, that
some quickning may proceede
also from this worke; which in
all writings is more or lesse, as
the Spirit therein more or lesse
speaketh.</p>
   <p>These Meditations are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
diuers in their matter,
being diuersly borne, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of time and occasion; yet
tend they to one ende, and this
profit often comes from variety,
<pb facs="3"/>
that some one thing among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
fitteth euery one, and giues
an answere to the particular
question of his heart. The glorie
of God by your benefite, is that
which I seeke, desiring also to be
holpen by you, both in prayer
and exhortation. As for an idle
name, made vp still, of perishing,
and often of corrupt breaths, I
leaue it to them for an end, to
whom God is not an end suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
But let our chiefe ioy and
glory be to glorifie God, and by
being written in heauen, to bee
admitted vnto the beholding of
his glory. To that mark, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
let vs steadily aime, and
sending our hearts before vnto
Christ, let vs goe on lustily
to ouertake them. Let vs
draw hard vp the hill toward
heauen: and though the flesh
<pb facs="4"/>
presse downe, the world and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
draw backe; yet strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Spirit, incouraged by
the word, and fortified with the
mutuall and vnited force of
mightie loue, let vs carry the
Arke of God, euen the soule
(wherein Gods Image dwells,
and his will is written) from the
Countrey of the Philistims, to
the Land of promise. And
though heere our fleshly bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>Ismael</hi> and his heires,
mocke and despise vs, though
<hi>Esau</hi> with his foure hundred
men looke big vpon vs: yet are
we sure that their time is short,
and but for life; whereas wee
haue an inheritance eternally
glorious. Thither the sonnes of
the flesh, though with long pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degrees,
and large treasures, can
neuer enter; but sitting without,
<pb facs="4"/>
where is weeping and gnashing
of teeth, they shallsee despised
holinesse, triumph vpon magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
and powerfull wickednes.
God our strength, whose cloud
and pillar guided Israel to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,
guide vs to the heauenly
Ierusalem, by the grace of his
Spirit. This I humbly desire
through Christ his first borne,
the purchaser of our inheritance
and doore of all the mercy
that issueth from God
vnto man.</p>
