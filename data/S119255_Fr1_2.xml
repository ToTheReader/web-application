      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen as thies two ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that great lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rned and right godlie minister of gods worde Theoder De Besza were broght vnto me, to be trāslated out of fren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che into englishe, gētle, Reader for that of certen yeres before I knew y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> man to be of so great knowledge and specially so greatly fearing God, I was driuen with a great desyre to reade them, and after that I had redde them, with a more feruent desyre, was I rapt (whatsoeuer other busynes I had to do being layd asyde) to trāslate them. Not onely for that they flow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed from suche a notable instrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of God, but also specially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that in the name and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
<pb facs="3"/>
and assent of so many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and godlie learned ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, they were pronounced, and that in suche a famouse and moste honorable audience. The matters conteined in the same orations, be maters of oure religion &amp; suche as at this present be in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, and therefore moste nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be knowen vnto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of oure cuntrie, the faithfull I mean that be but of simple kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wledge &amp; yet be desyrous to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. Aswell because thereby they may by vertue of gods word esta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blish their consciences in the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uth of these maters, as also for that they may there summarelie haue in a redynes, oute of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holie Scriptures, good and sufficient auctorities, to defend them selues in the same, against the malicious
<pb facs="3"/>
soldiors of Satan the Papistes and lykewise to confounde them with all their sophisticall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable reasons: whiche haue not onely of a long season moste craftely seduced many, but also moste crewelly suppressed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied many of the faithfull with the name and auctoritie of the Churche whiche they moste wro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ngfully and iniuriously arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them selues, when as in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dede they were, and be no thing els but the horrible and filthie Synagoge of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> deuill, as by their stinking and detestable maners and theire blasphemous and moste pestilent doctrine (whiche be their frutes) may moste eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appere vnto all them whiche haue any knowledge in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worde of God. For without any
<pb facs="4"/>
lawfull calling, by diuerse vnle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes boeth against Gods law and mans law, haue they intruded them selues, into the Churche of God, and in stede of the liuely worde of God they haue taught their owne doctrine and dreames: and the holy Sacram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes, with their away taking, that whiche the Lorde Iesus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, and commanded, and with their to putting, many things whiche the Lorde Iesus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer commanded, they haue alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether altered and contamined. So that in stede to haue God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, and the people of God ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified taught strengthened and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, they haue dishonored and blasphemed the Maiestie of God and to their vtermoste discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and destroyed his people.
<pb facs="4"/>
But the chief maters herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, be thies. The Churche and what it is, the marcks of the true Churche, what aucthoritie it haeth, &amp; whether it may erre. If it please thee gentle Reader with iudgement of a sincere heart to consider thies orations, thou shalt finde the same boeth godlie and learnedly declared to the praise of God, and edefieng of his faithfull people.</p>
