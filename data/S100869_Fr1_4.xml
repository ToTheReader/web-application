   <head>TO THE FRENCH
CHVRCH ASSEMBLED
together at Dort.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no exercise (most deare
and worthie Brethren in the
Lord) more needfull, nor
more conuenient for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
man, then to call vpon
his Creator and Sauiour. For
sith that hee receiueth from
his hand all manner of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
aswell for this present life, as for that which is
to come, he is therefore bound continually to inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
and call vpon him for aide,<note place="margin">Iames 1. 17.</note> who is <hi>the Father of
lights, from whom commeth downe euery good giuing,
and euery perfect gift.</hi> Beside, it is also that marke by
which the children of light are discerned from the
children of this world, who, as it is written in the 14
Psalme, haue no care to call vpon the Lord. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
it is one of the parts of that Christian ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement,
whereby wee make profession to
beleeue that <hi>God is, and that he is a rewarder of them
that seeke him,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> as the Apostle witnesseth in the 11.
Chapter to the Hebrewes, and sixth verse. It is a
sweete communication and a familiar discourse
with God, whereby wee freely declare to him our
<pb facs="5"/>
necessities, and beseech him to returne an answere
to our petitions in due time. It may also be called
an ambassage, or a trusty Post, which swiftly moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp to heauen, knocketh at the gate of Gods pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
there to present before him all our requests.
Finally, it is the very soule of our soules, and like as
our bodies cannot liue, nor subsist without our
soules; so likewise cannot our soules perseuere in
the faith and hope of the grace of God, which is the
fountaine of life, without the exercise of prayer.
Which point the Fathers of the old Testament
considering, ere they betooke themselues to any of
their affaires, began them euermore by calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the name of God,<note place="margin">Psal. 124. 8.</note> saying, <hi>Our helpe is in the name
of the Lord which hath made heauen and earth.</hi> Which
also the Iewes from the godlinesse of their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hold yet vnto this day, and obserue it so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
that they addresse their prayers to none, but
to that sole Creator of all things. Wherein these ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
people, which neither know the Sonne, nor
the Father, shew themselues farre more wise and
religious, then the Papists, which call themselues
Christians and Catholikes, and yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
are so blockish and superstitious, that in stead
of addressing themselues to the only God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
&amp; immortall, they implore the aide of the dead,
and their Idols, not considering what the Lord
speaketh by his Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> in the 42. chap. and 8.
verse,<note place="margin">Esay. 42. 8.</note>
      <hi>that his glorie he will not giue to another, neither
his praise to grauen Images.</hi> But what? the diuell
(sworne enemie against the honour of God, and
mans saluation) hath with such an efficacy breathed
this impiety into the hearts of those lying Doctors,
<pb facs="5"/>
that albeit they are conuicted by an infinit number
of sentences of holy Scripture, by which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
forbiddeth vs not to worship any but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
yet they obstinately maintaine the contrarie,
and that oft times against the feeling of their owne
consciences, withholding the truth in vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and shutting their eyes and eares against this
admonition of the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13. 8.</note> chap. 13. vers. 8. <hi>That wee
cannot doe any thing against the truth, but for the truth.</hi>
Which (Truth) although that in these latter daies,
it is represented vnto vs more cleerer then euer it
was; yet notwithstanding of many it is vnknowne
and abandoned, which follow on apace the foolish
deuotion of their blind leaders, and who to please
and obey them, rather then our Soueraigne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
and Master Iesus Christ, will not vouchsafe to
take so much paines, as to informe themselues of
this truth, by reading of the holy Scripture, but like
better to depend wholly vpon the Traditions of
their Teachers, despising through their voluntarie
ignorance the exhortatiō which the Apostle. S <hi>Iohn</hi>
giueth vnto al Christians in his first epistle, 4. vers. 1.
<hi>Dearely beloued,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Epist. chap. 4. vers. 1.</note>
      <hi>beleeue not euery spirit, but trie the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
whether they are of God: for many false Prophets are
gone out into the world.</hi> Now, the more furiously the
Truth is assaulted by Satan and his slaues, so much
the more couragiously ought it to be maintained
and defended by the zealous louers of pure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
but especially by the Ministers and Pastors of
the holy Gospel, who according to that rule which
the Apostle S. <hi>Paul</hi> prescribeth them in his Epistle
to <hi>Titus,</hi> 1. 9, ought to employ themselues diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="6"/>
to exhort with wholesome doctrine those which
are willing to bee instructed, and to improoue the
gainsaiers. I then being called by God into the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of his holy Ministerie, haue employed my self
amidst you (according to that talent which it hath
pleased him to bestow vpon me) for the space of
sixteene yeeres on these two parts of my vocation;
and hauing respect to the multitude, and sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of my predecessors, who haue taken penne in
hand to instruct the ignorant, and to refute false
Teachers by their writings, I haue contented my
selfe hitherto to follow their traces in my publique
Sermons and priuate Conferences, with such as
were desirous to profit with me in knowledge of
the fundamentall points of our Christian faith, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the occasions which were presented.
But of late hauing seene an Epistle written by a
certaine Doctor of the <hi>Augustins</hi> Order, touching
the inuocation of Saints, sent vnto one of my Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
to seduce thereby the sheepe which our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
Shepheard Iesus Christ hath recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to me; I held it my dutie to returne it backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to <hi>Leige</hi> with my answere, to satisfie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of one of his disciples; by whō the said Doctor
hauing receiued my answere, promised him that
shortly after he would write back vnto me againe,
and that effectually. But seeing there are almost two
yeeres past since he held my refutation, and that in
all y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> time he could not make some small Treatise to
fulfill and accomplish his promise, his silence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
me to thinke, that he hauing considered well,
examined and weighed the arguments of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie,
hath repented himself for his foolish boasting,
<pb facs="6"/>
and that (if his conscience be not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eared) he feeleth
himselfe alreadie checked by the truth that shineth
in my Refutation; which in the meane time I haue
amplified, and now published with his Epistle, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the counsell of some excellent learned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages,
with hope that I shall see it bring foorth
some fruite, if not in the abouesaid Doctor, or in
some of his obstinate scholars, yet at least in such as
are teachable, and especially in you my most deare
and worthie brethren, of whom I haue conceiued
this hope, that whereas heretofore ye haue willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heard me to entreat of this subiect aswell in my
Sermons, as in my familiar discourses with you, so
ye will now take no lesse delight in hearing me to
discourse of it in this small booke, which here I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
you as appertaining vnto you by a double
right. For first of all being consecrated to your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
from the beginning of my ministerie, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie
of euery instruction (which through Gods
grace I propound vnto men) is wholly yours. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
seeing that the intention of my dispute is, to
shew the difference between a true, and a false ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and to perswade euery man by all possible
meanes to stand fast in the true, and to reiect the
false; to whom could I better appropriate it then to
you, to whom aboue all things I am bound to teach
the first point and fruit of our faith, which is, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ in
spirit and truth, and to call vpon none but him in
our necessities? Whereunto, as I seeke to giue you
some helpe by this present Treatise, so doe I giue
thankes to the Lord, for that alreadie ye are so well
grounded and instructed in this principle of true
<pb facs="7"/>
religion, assuring my self that he which hath sowne
this good seed in your soules, wil make it abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to grow vp, and to fructifie in such a sort, that
thereby his name shall be glorified, your neighbour
edified, and your hearts fortified against all manner
of tentations. Finally, if I perceiue that this small
Treatise, which I publish vnder your names, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
and pleasing vnto you, your courtesie will
serue as a spurre to pricke me more cheerfully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in my commenced Career, and one day here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to entreat more at large vpon this subiect,
through the grace of our blessed God and heauenly
Father: to whom I recommend you, beseeching
him with all my heart, that it will please him (most
deare and worthy Brethren) to maintaine you euen
to the end in the profession of his truth, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish
you with his temporall and eternall
blessings, for the aduancement of his
glorie, and the saluation of your
soules. <hi>From my Studie this
4. of August,</hi> 1607.</p>
