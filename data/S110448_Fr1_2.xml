Ver had banished the
bytter stormes of Hyems,
and geuen Flora liberty with
her gallant mantle of greene
to garnishe the whole face of
the earth: I was drawne by
desire throughly to consider the sundry pleasures, and
diuerse commodityes that she most curtuouslye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to worldly inhabitauntes, and finding occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fyt for my purpose, I tooke my waye for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past
into the fieldes, where I found the barren ground
fruitfull, proffering foorth plentifullye her increase,
and the naked trees fullye pollished and couered with
leaues: in the braunches wherof the chrping birdes,
the more to augment my solace, rendred foorth their
well tuned concords, the sillye Larke mounting aloft
towardes the fyrmamente, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ndred foorth his rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
noates of ioye, the Thrustle coake, the Mauice,

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>omely harmonye. And thus as on rapt or rauished
with ioye, Syr Phaebus with his trampling steedes
<pb facs="3"/>
rainging through the Christaline skies, in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Phaaeton, making his asendent to the top of the
hiest Spyhre, I was constrained partly through wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse,
and partly the heate of the daye increasing, to
sit me down vnder a Betch tree, the braunches wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
semed a Fortresse to shielde me from the partching
gleames of tryumphing Tytan: But as my glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
eyes beganne to suruaye the nature and effectes
of gallaunt Aestas, so also did I call to memory how
Boreas bustering blastes and Hyems hoarye froastes,
conuerted those present pleasures that Ver brought
foorth, to nothing, and in fine defaced them as though
they had not bene▪ so that both those seasons I gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
did presayg vnto me the ficklenesse of our cours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
tyme and the shortnesse of our transitory dayes,
the flowrishing flowers which long had bin shrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the bowels of the earth, beganne not onelye to
prognosticate to me our estates lyuing her in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ollitie:
But also set foorth aptlye in theyr kindes, howe and
whereto we were subiected, the pollished trees serued
as a scoolemayster, to publishe vnto mee, our hard
and heauy hazardes in this terrestriall vale of mysery
and immortalitye, the lesson that by them I learned
was worthye to be considered: For the marke they
bad me ame at was Death, and yet after Death, as they
through the sweete deawes and sauory showers, did
florish and prosper againe after they were wythered
away: so also gaue they intelligence to me, that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of death and graue by the myghty prouidence
of GOD, all creatures should arise from theyr slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="3"/>
and come before the trybunall seate of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
where the faythful should be rewarded with
eternall lyfe, and the vnbeleeuing recompenced with
endlesse torments. But as I sat discoursing these cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Sol hasting with speedinesse towardes the Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
Tyme gaue me charge to repayre towardes my
lodging, whiche attayned: I entred into my former
Muse, and tooke my penne in hand, mynding to haue
written some Pamphlet in these my former discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:

messinger of Iubiter, arested myne eyes with Sopor.</p>
