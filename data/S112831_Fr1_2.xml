What moued mee to meddle with this <hi>Gagger:</hi> In what sort I thought fit to arrest him: wherefore I haue dealt with him in such sort. And first for the first, be pleased to know</p>
   <p>That I coped not with him voluntarily: nor thrust my self forward of my own accord, out of a desire to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I haue other employments, of much more behoof, to better purpose, &amp; my greater benefit euery way; or, if I had none, <hi>pater ā has h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>r as non sic per dere,</hi> I professe, I would neuer be so idle, but could more pleasingly
<pb facs="3"/>
and profitably spend my time, then in catching or kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Flyes. But be pleased to heare a story, <hi>Reader,</hi> which put me on this posture, and performing. And thus it was.</p>
   <p>About some two yeares since, as I remember, some of our Catholique Limitors, had beene roming and rambling in the Countrey, and brake into my pale secretly, at my Parish of <hi>Standford-Riuers</hi> in <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex:</hi> and according as commonly their custome is, (that you may know of what companions Saint <hi>Paul</hi> entended, <hi>his Leading silly women captiues)</hi> fell in with some, one at least, of the subordinate and weaker sexe: indeauouring to make Proselytes of my neighbours wiues. Now you know their ordinary <hi>onsets,</hi> with great <hi>Out-cries</hi> of <hi>Damned Heretickes, out of the Church. No Seruice: no Sacraments: no Ministery: no Faith: no Christ: no Saluation.</hi> Terrible Shawe-fowles to <hi>skarre</hi> poore Soules, that haue not the facultie of discerning Cheese from Chalk. Horrible affrights and mormolyceues, to put young children out of their wits, that cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish a visnomie indeed from a visour.</p>
   <p>So it fell out, that a neighbour of mine, with whom in this sort they had beene tampering, became not a little dismayed, and perplexed with these bug-beares of great names and thunderings in her eares; till it came at length vnto my knowledge what was done. I let her know, they were but scarr-crowes: meere words and wind, bragges and boastings, and so setled her disquieted thoughts againe. But yet it seemeth, they left not so. The Diuell hath a name, <hi>Belzebub,</hi> the <hi>God of flyes,</hi> expressing his nature, like a flye, insolent,
<pb facs="3"/>
importune, pressing on; though he fall off to day, hee will re-enforcce to morrow, though he faile to day, he will assay to morrow, and still hope to preuaile at last. So <hi>These,</hi> as <hi>He,</hi> came on againe, though euer by owle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. For they came to steale, and therefore feared <hi>blaunchers.</hi> I could not come to God-speed, nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front them.</p>
   <p>But this I did: When next you meete with these Romish Rangers, commend me to them, said I vnto my neighbour. Tell them, I much desire to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them. I was borne, &amp; bred, and brought vp, &amp; professed in the Religion of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> which I hitherto haue thought to be the truth: held and taught as the truth: if I haue beene deceiued, and haue deceiued others, I am sorry for it: my desire is to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>professe</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> to <hi>waue heresie,</hi> to <hi>quit error,</hi> to goe out of <hi>schisme,</hi> to finde out the <hi>true Church of Christ,</hi> and become <hi>a member</hi> of it; and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, by all possible meanes <hi>to saue my Soule.</hi> If then their intention be such sincerely, as they pretend it is, <hi>To saue Soules;</hi> they may doe a meritorious deed to come and saue mine, the rather, because they may goe compendiously to worke, in gaining mee to the side, who am like enough to draw you, my Parishioners, with me, at least to make you more seasable, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise you would be for them.</p>
   <p>But it seemed <hi>canebam sur dis,</hi> &amp; I beleeue, if the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made, as I think it was, they gaue no great credit to my words, or had lesse hope of their <hi>performance.</hi> For the truth is, the most of these <hi>Limitors</hi> are but poore <hi>Ignaroes:</hi> take them out of their beaten paths,
<pb facs="4"/>
they cannot hold pace.) Wherefore, seeing I could not tell where to finde them, and they would not finde me, where they might haue me: I thought to send af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them to know their mindes, to vnderstand their opinions, and see what they would say, to winne mee vnto their <hi>Catholiqne faith. So</hi> I tooke pen and paper, and wrote, as I thought fit, three Propositions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising conformity vpon resolution, to this effect, and I suppose, in these tearmes.</p>
   <p n="1">1 <hi>If any Papist lining, or all the Papists liuing, can proue vnto me, that the present Roman Church, is eyther the Catholique Church, or a sound member of the Catholique Church, I will subscribe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="2">2 <hi>If any Papist liuing, or all the Papists liuing, can proue vnto me, that the present Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>is not a true member of the Catholique Church, I will subscribe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="3">3 <hi>If any Papist, &amp;c. can proue vnto mee, that all those points, or any one of those points which the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>maintaineth against the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>were or was, the perpetuall Doctrine of the Catholique Church: the concluded Doctrine of the representatine Church in any generall Councell, or Nationall approued by a Generall: or the dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall resolution of any one Father, for 500. yeares after Christ, I will subscribe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And to these seuerally I set my name, which I did to try their sufficiencies: or abate their insolencies: and to settle the wauering vpon those goodly pretenses of <hi>Antiquity, Vniuersality,</hi> and <hi>Conformity.</hi> I am sure I come home to them, and touch them in their <hi>freehold,</hi> as they
<pb facs="4"/>
claime it: I giue them scope enough to insist vpon. If they can performe this, I will not eate my words. I make it now publicke, which I then said in priuate, <hi>let them performe it, I will subscribe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>These three Propositions, thus conceiued, &amp; signed, I then deliuered vnto my neighbour, the partie that should haue beene <hi>proselyted:</hi> intreating her, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them vnto those her <hi>perswaders,</hi> if they came again, as she thought they would. This she promised, and at their next meeting, accordingly performed, within few dayes. I expected, I confesse, some great vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, and some mighty opposition, to purpose, in points of that Nature, which touched them so neere, and came vp to the head of their Catholique cause; and so began to compose my selfe against expected aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of some performance at least. But many weekes, many months passed, eighteene at least, and I heard no noise of those <hi>Hereticke-quellers,</hi> my great Masters, who cease not yet to call for disputation. At length, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much expectation, vpon the fifth of <hi>October</hi> last, the same partie premised, presenteth mee at once with two seuerall presents. The one, <hi>two sheets of Paper,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in haste, not fully out, with two seuerall hands. The Scribe was some puny-nouice in euery point of Scrib-ship. For neither could hee tell how to vse or dispose his points: nor yet how to spell his words. I haue the <hi>Originall</hi> by mee, to shew. Any man that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, will many times be to seeke, to make sense, or English of it. The Dictator, (if yet the Author and writer were diuided) subscribed himselfe <hi>yours in Christ Iesus, A. P.</hi> a silly man God knoweth as euer talked
<pb facs="5"/>
idly of the <hi>Catholique Church:</hi> the <hi>head of the Church:</hi> the <hi>Masse, Confession,</hi> and <hi>Purgatory.</hi> For his discourse (beside some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>artnesse, of my Worship, Doctorship, &amp;c.) smattered a little, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poorely, and at randome, vpon these points: but concerning, or vnto, my Propositions; <hi>

         </gap> my quidem Lucilianum?</hi> the Innocent meant mee no hurt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he bit not.</p>
   <p>Marry he had a cleanly put-off for that, thus. Hee <hi>desireth me at my going to</hi> London, <hi>to repaire vnto Master</hi> May <hi>his house</hi> (these are my friend <hi>A. P. s</hi> own words) in <hi>Holburne,</hi> in <hi>Partridge-alley.</hi> A man, that I neuer knew, nor saw, nor heard of, <hi>albus an ater,</hi> I cold not tell, nor happily should haue knowne in hast, but by his relation. From him I haue it: that, <hi>Hee was not long since a Minister, but is now become a Catholique.</hi> In good time: through discontent perhaps, or ambition; or some such ordinarie motiue of such Turne-coates. My imployment thither, was for Satisfaction: if yet I had beene sure thereof. For I had some cause of doubt, in that which followeth. <hi>If hee will not satisfie you, at least he will procure some body else.</hi> If he will not: but what if he cannot? Then from <hi>Partridge-ally,</hi> I might happily bee posted to <hi>Woodcocke-walke:</hi> and thence flushed to <hi>Fooles-wharfe:</hi> and so returne home, as wise as I went out.</p>
   <p>But secondly, to preuent or supply the worst, beside, and with his two sheets of Paper, my good friend <hi>A. Pe.</hi> out of Curtefie, addressed vnto me, for my better Edification, a pretty little <hi>whip-iacke,</hi> of lesse then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary assise, in a <hi>blew iacket;</hi> marked in the fore-head, with <hi>A Gagge, for the new Gospell:</hi> whose worship, vntill
<pb facs="5"/>
then, was as little knowne to me <hi>de nomine,</hi> as was <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es of <hi>October,</hi> vnto me.</p>
   <p>Thus briefly, as I could, I haue related the occasion of my engagement, in this gagling, with the <hi>Gagger.</hi> Those <hi>Papers</hi> I answered presently as I thought fit, and left the answere to be returned vnto <hi>A. P.</hi> who promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to call for it within three dayes; but came not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in threescore, as I am informed, &amp; if yet he haue come for it, I cannot tell. The <hi>Gagge</hi> I tooke to taske, vpon my returne vnto my bookes, at Windsor: as meere a <hi>gaggler</hi> as euer grased vpon a greene. Many idle Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets in this very kinde, haue I seene in my dayes; but a verrier <hi>idiota</hi> saw I neuer any. With a strange <hi>opinion</hi> of their owne worth, are these <hi>Catholicks</hi> possessed. This poore silly Creature thought Himselfe <hi>somebody,</hi> and his Performings no ordinary <hi>Aduenture:</hi> else sure hee would not so haue proscribed his pamphlet, the <hi>Gagge of the new Gospell:</hi> which necessarily implyeth thus much, Hee hath stopped the months of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants for euer: the proudest of them dare not <hi>hiscere</hi> hereafter against <hi>Himselfe,</hi> or any one of his <hi>Lagg:</hi> but, as <hi>geese,</hi> when they goe in at a barne dore, or are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb facs="6"/>
on by night, a long staffe or pole being held ouer them, goe without noise or reluctancy, holding downe their heads: so the appalled Protestants, being <hi>crest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen,</hi> and cast downe for euer, must goe as this Gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will dispose of them. My friend <hi>A. P. sic mulus mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum scabit,</hi> was well perswaded of this mans perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and irresistable ability, when hee sent him to me to <hi>conuert</hi> me, being assured I could say little to him, no not so much as <hi>bough to a Goose,</hi> as for, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere him,</hi> it went beyond my possibility. For this, set the <hi>iury</hi> consider: but for <hi>Conuersion,</hi> no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I <hi>assure</hi> him: his <hi>assurance</hi> hath failed here. I am more confirmed, then euer I was in my <hi>Protestant</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, through his insufficiency. Nay, had I not been a <hi>Protestant,</hi> he would haue made me one through his poore performing of what he had vndertooke, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on view.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Whatsoeuer</hi> he intended, <hi>whatsoeuer</hi> he hath said, was by <hi>Him,</hi> and <hi>His,</hi> addressed, not against <hi>Iohn a Noke,</hi> and <hi>Iohn a Style,</hi> this man and that man of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> partie: not against <hi>priuate tenents,</hi> and <hi>peculiar o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</hi> For what hath the world to doe to take pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique notice of them? as they are <hi>singular,</hi> so let them stand or fall: <hi>Salus Ecclestae, non vertitur in istis,</hi> the Church will stand and subsist without them: but hee driued directly at the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that moate in the eyes of Romish Priests and Iesuites. For though he set his booke to saile, with generall commendations, <hi>A briefe abridgement of the errors of the Protestants of our times:</hi> and so may seeme to enclose our neighbours abroad: yet his drift was directly against vs at home: against the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>Church.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="6"/>
he wrote in the English tongue alone. Therefore his addresse is to <hi>The Protestants</hi> that are in <hi>England</hi> onely. Therefore he talketh of our English translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in precise words instituteth his Refutation, by <hi>Expresse words of our owne English Bibles:</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine his <hi>Gagge</hi> to vs alone, that are of that Church for, <hi>English Bibles,</hi> belong to <hi>English</hi> men: Strangers haue their owne, in their owne Mothers tongue: they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not ours, which concerne them not at all.</p>
   <p>Now in point of carriage against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> in his Refutation of our <hi>Churches</hi> errors: in <hi>gagging</hi> vp our mouthes for defence thereof for euer; see the small honesty, little sincerity, and petty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of this <hi>Gagler.</hi> In all Churches that are, or haue beene vnder heauen: euen in the Chutch of <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe at this day, notwithstanding the conclusions of the Councell of <hi>Trent:</hi> the Decisions and Edicts of Popes: the inquisitors of Heresie, and such like inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions to the contrary. There are <hi>publique Resolutions</hi> held of all, and <hi>priuate opinions</hi> maintained by some, by men particular in their owne Conceits: and Societies in a more generall agreement in things indifferent, not <hi>de fide,</hi> or if yet of a looser and lower tye, and alloy. As those are proposed, resolued, maintained, tendred and commanded: So the other are free, and disputed and questioned, not enioyned as <hi>de fide,</hi> or Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, because Problematicall, and no more. If a man should collect the priuate <hi>opinions</hi> of priuate men, which are differences in <hi>Schooles</hi> among <hi>Schollers:</hi> nay, of the <hi>Master of Controuersies,</hi> or of <hi>sentences,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them vnto the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> the <hi>Faith of Rome,</hi> this <hi>Gagger</hi> (if hee know what to doe) and his <hi>gagle,</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
would refuse them, disclaime them, thinke themselues wronged, proclaime themselues belied, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth often in the like case. <hi>Ex aequo &amp; bono,</hi> and <hi>more maiorum,</hi> we may doe the like. Yet see the honesty of this Imposter against vs in this his poore pamphlet.</p>
   <p>He hath <hi>collected</hi> together, out of <hi>C. W. B.</hi> and such companions: and <hi>disposed</hi> as it hapned, without order or method <hi>xlvii.</hi> seuerall propositions. All pretended <hi>errours</hi> of the <hi>Church of England:</hi> because <hi>all contrary to expresse words of our owne Bibles:</hi> and repugnant to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> in the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>Fathers:</hi> so to <hi>fasten Noueltie,</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Impietie</hi> vpon our <hi>Church.</hi> Of these <hi>xlvii.</hi> onely <hi>viii.</hi> or <hi>ix.</hi> are the Doctrines of our Church. 6. 13. 15. 18. 30. 36. 42. 44. and yet not all these, as they are by him abused, embeasted, confounded, and circumscribed. The rest are partly left at libertie by the Church: not determined for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines either way. Many imposed by him on the Church, are directly disclaimed, abandoned, oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Church, and the flat contrary to them commended and commanded. And accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, practised, and maintained against oppugners. A maior part are the meere opinions, priuate fancies, peculiar propositions of priuate men: many of them disclaimed by the very Authors: some falsely impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Authors: some raked together out of the lay-stals of deepest Puritanisme, as much opposing the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that whatsoeuer is in this <hi>Gagger,</hi> is, or childishly fancied, or ridiculously mistaken, or wilfully peruerted, or slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derously imputed, or maliciously proposed, or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guously conceiued, or not iustified any way: as may

euidently appeare in the particulars in my answere ensuing: In which,</p>
   <p>Whatsoeuer is to be owned by the Church; as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, and tendred, and subscribed in the authorised <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Practise</hi> thereof, is by mee iustified fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and shall be maintained against his betters, as not contrary to Antiquitie, in the Tradition of the <hi>Church,</hi> much lesse vnto <hi>Scriptures</hi> in our <hi>owne Bibles.</hi> What is inuolued by him malitiously, to procure enuy to the side, is explicated and asserted to the proper te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, and termes, it is shewed how farre the Church of England resolueth, where, and what things are left free and vndetermined, for men to hold with them or against them. Priuate opinions, are left vnto their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and Abettors, olde enough, and able enough to speake for themselues: In a publique cause (as is, the Faith of Gods Church) peculiar interests, that I know, haue no such share, at least ouer-awing, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vndertaking against opponents.</p>
   <p>In answering of whom, to come vnto my course ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued with him, which I thought fit in conueniency to let the Reader vnderstand, for my owne excuse, and iustification, I haue gone along with <hi>him,</hi> cap a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pee, and point per point: first, for his <hi>Scriptures,</hi> both <hi>expresse</hi> and <hi>to be seene;</hi> then, for his Fathers, that <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the same,</hi> that is nothing to purpose, as little as his <hi>Scriptures</hi> did, as I could finde them quoted, or could guesse at them, by imagining where they mought be probably spoken withall, or where I could remember to haue some time left them. For our <hi>Catholiques Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish,</hi> secure no question of the goodnes of their cause, or rather relying vpon the tractablenesse of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb facs="8"/>
Proselytes, so they can make a dumbe shew with scoring vp Fathers, doe not much trouble themselues with caring, where or what they say. So this <hi>Gagger</hi> stood affected it is more than apparant. For I was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten left to goe <hi>blowe the seeke,</hi> for his Fathers. For, poore man, he tooke them vp as hee could finde them by tale, without weight or triall. Some few perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, in the country abroad: but the maior part by farre, out of <hi>C. W. B.</hi> What he is, I cannot tell: and as hee hath them, truely or falsly quoted, rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred, or mistaken, so in euery poynt are they in the <hi>Gagge,</hi> vnlesse worse. Such supine negligence, secure discoursing, childish disputing in such a <hi>Master in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> Such infant-like performance in such a <hi>Goliah,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whose head the <hi>Philistines</hi> haue set vp their rest (I speake no more in effect, than I haue heard of him since I vndertooke him) who can beare? Beside the scurrilous fellow, according to his breeding, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation it seemeth, sure I am fitting enough his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition commeth in with <hi>Coblers,</hi> and <hi>Bakers,</hi> and <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and <hi>Tapsters:</hi> and <hi>Hosts</hi> and <hi>Hostesses,</hi> and <hi>bottles,</hi> and <hi>bottle-ale.</hi> Insulteth vpon <hi>poore Protestants, Out of their wits, sicke in their wits.</hi> Prateth of <hi>Horses</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses praying,</hi> and such like stuffe, out of his Coblers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, or Hostesses ale-bench no doubt. And who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to possesse his Soule, or containe his pen in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: that hath to doe with such Impostors, Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bankes, and Buffones? such rake-shames, and rake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hels, as these ramblers are? I confesse, that subiects of this nature, should, aboue all, be moderately, calmely, and quietly handled: but so, if wee meete with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, with quiet men, with temperate, honest, and
<pb facs="8"/>
discreet men: with men not proiected, prostituted, and giuen ouer, vnto lying, calumniating, traducing of all that concurre not with them; as this compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his comerades are: who haue no intent to make vp any ruines or decayed places in the <hi>Church:</hi> to heale the sores, cure the wounds, mollifie the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, cleanse out the empostumations in the mysticall body of Christ: that ayme not at <hi>peace,</hi> nor would procure <hi>vnity,</hi> nor any way indeauour that <hi>those who professe Gods holy name, may agree in the truth of his holy word, and liue in vnity and godly loue,</hi> but make their <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, their whole indeauour their speciall study day and night, by all kinde of iniquity, to keepe a faction on foot, and maintaine opposition, euen where it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not. Such are to be <hi>curryed</hi> in their kinde: and to be <hi>rubbed</hi> as they deserue: in no case to be <hi>smoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed</hi> or <hi>sleeked</hi> ouer, lest they please themselues too well in their impiety.</p>
   <p>It was euer held lawfull to <hi>call a spade a spade.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gaue not <hi>Elimas</hi> any gentle termes: nor did Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speake butter and hony vnto <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> Our Sauiour himselfe, that <hi>man of meekenesse,</hi> called <hi>Herod</hi> a Fox, and <hi>Iudas</hi> a Deuil, when they deserued it. I confesse, I haue dealt with this man, as I would not haue dealt with euery one, nor so as happely, my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and calling would in some mens opinion require: but sure, as he, and such as he deserue to be dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. For shall I suffer him, to rayle vpon to blaspheme, to calumniate, to belye so impudently the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as he doth, beside his Tapster-like phrases of <hi>Ale,</hi> and <hi>Hostesses,</hi> and not make him heare of it <hi>on both his eares,</hi> but <hi>guild</hi> him ouer with good language?

Let himselfe, or his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or any Papist in the packe, goe honestly, sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, soberly, scholler-like to worke: Let him set affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, faction, partiallity, sinister ends apart: Let him come home to the poynts controuerted, without row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, rambling, rauing: ioyne issue instantly with the Question where it lyeth. I am for him, no man more ready, more willing, more submisse, more desirous to goe calmely and sedate to worke, for Gods glory, the Churches tranquilitie, the good and benefit of my selfe and others. To learne, to heare, to be aduised, to yeeld to euidence, and conuicting proofe, out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, out of Fathers, the <hi>totall Tradition of the Church:</hi> No otherwise willing to deale with moderate men, then I haue and doe, with that worthie <hi>Baronius,</hi> in his kinde. But for this man, those that thinke otherwise must pardon me; As a wise man is to be heard with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, so <hi>a foole must be answered according to his folly.</hi> And so haue I answered this goodly <hi>Gagger.</hi>

   <p>Thus Curteous Reader, hauing giuen thee an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my comming vpon this employment, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly of my carriage of it, with the reason of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanure in it, I come to the <hi>Gagger,</hi> to <hi>cope</hi> with him, leauing thee to the Protection of the Almighty.</p>
