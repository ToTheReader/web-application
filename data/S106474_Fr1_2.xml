      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ove</hi> (saith the Wisest of<note place="margin">Cant. 8. 6.</note> men) <hi>is as strong as death,</hi> the importuning whereof hath made me breake open those bars and once more awaken the spirit of M. <hi>Bolton,</hi> by exposing to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke view these papers of his, written with his owne hand, for the convincing of the world of that profitable and wealthy sinne of <hi>Vsury;</hi> wherein though he and others have bestowed much paines: Yet so sweet is the gainefullnesse of that craft, as that it will never receive a finall convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on till the generall judgement.</p>
   <p>This small Tract was written to one <hi>M. S.</hi> a man of no great note, and of lesse learning, occasioned upon a quarrell <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="3"/>
tooke at a Sermon of his preached against Usury, which afterward brake forth into a set battell, though it proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>impar congressus</hi> to <hi>M. S.</hi> who by challenging M. <hi>Bolton,</hi> thrust himselfe upon the greatest infelicity of warre, as first to bee disarmed, and afterward to bee kill'd in the field with his owne weapons.</p>
   <p>The gaine that <hi>M. S.</hi> made by that <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
      <note place="margin">Acts 19. 24.</note>
      <hi>shrine,</hi> whetted his invention to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by humane argument, what hee was loath to part with by divine commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
   <p>Had this Author lived, it was his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to have made this <hi>little Tract</hi> of <hi>Vsury</hi> a compleate Treatise, by stating the Question, by distinguishing it from other contracts and bargaines that are common amongst men (which though they equall that other contract by Vsury in point of gaine, yet doe not participate with it in point of Crime) by handling the many cases of conscience touching the point of restitution, wherein I know
<pb facs="3"/>
hee was acquainted with many rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s.</p>
   <p>But death which determined his daies, put an end to this labour. So that I now present it to the Reader as I finde it in his owne coppy without addition or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which can hardly bee done to any thing of his without wrong to the Worke. Neither should I (had it beene feosable) have given way unto it. For I had rather put any imperfect worke of his upon the <hi>Charity</hi> of the world, which it usually affoords to such interceptions by death, then abuse it, or the trust reposed in me, by publishing under his name any counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit stuffe.</p>
   <p>In this little Worke I desire to put the Reader in minde of one or two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in this Author. The earnest indignation of his spirit against any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sinne, especially grosse sinne as this of <hi>Vsury.</hi> And then his sweet melting and compassionate heart in freeing men from it, which if all other instances which might be given of him in this kind should be lost
<pb facs="4"/>
and perish. This one passage of his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the last worke that ever he put out, and uttered a little before his death would make it good. For having in that booke<note place="margin">Instructions for comforting afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. pag. 108. &amp;c. <hi>us{que}</hi> pag 130.</note> proposed twenty considerations to keepe men from sinne (the best that ever I read) He thus in conclusion breaths out his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate spirit, page 130. <hi>Now my most thirsty desire and earnest entreaty is, that every one into whose hands by Gods providence this booke of mine shall fall, after the perusall of them, would pause a while upon purpose that he may more solemnely vow and resolve, that ever hereafter when he shall be set upon and assaulted by allurement unto any sinne, he will first have recourse unto these twenty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations I have here recommended to him to helpe in such cases, and with a punctuall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousnesse let them sinke into his heart before he proceed and pollute himselfe. I could bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, if it were pleasing unto God, that these lines which thou now readest were writ with the warmest blood in my heart, to represent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thine eye the deare affectionatenesse of my soule for thy spirituall and eternall good, so</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>that thou wouldest be throughly perswaded, and now before thou passe any further sincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise so to doe.</hi> So that I may as truly say of him as was once said of <hi>Anselme, Nihil</hi>
      <note place="margin">De vita An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selmi lib. 2. in Oper Ans.</note>
      <hi>in mundo quantum peccare timebat,</hi> Hee feared nothing in the world so much as sinne.</p>
   <p>Compare these times and the want of such a man in them, and then count how invaluable his losse is. For so highly was he esteemed in that Countrey where he bestowed his Ministeriall paines, that many of his hearers who beheld his <hi>white haires</hi> could point at him, and say with that famous <hi>Leontius, That when</hi>
      <note place="margin">Sozem. Hist. Lib. 3.</note>
      <hi>that Snow melted there would bee a flood:</hi> And so it prooved; For I dare boldly write it, There was not a Minister in <hi>Norhampton-shire</hi> that ever lived there more desired, or dyed more lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
   <p>I will looke no further into his quiet grave, I onely desire <hi>my Reader</hi> kindely to accept of this worke for the Authors sake who meant it much better.
<pb facs="5"/>
And for my sake who meerely for the Readers good have undergone the paines to present it as it is. This is but Iustice and all the reward I looke for,</p>
