      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT the Lord saith, touching the revealing
of the <hi>Man of sinne,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Thes. 2, 8.</note> and the consuming of him
<hi>by the brightnes of Christs comming:</hi> We may
see (blessed be God for it) now accomplished
in a great measure. For whereas in times past,
many of the <hi>Professors,</hi> have used both their
tongues and pennes, to plead for their <hi>Parish-Churches,
Ministerie and Worshipp;</hi> They now
(beeing of sounder mindes, and better informed) let those things
fall: Insomuch, as there are few (if any) except <hi>Formalists and
Familists (virtutem qui verba putant, ut lucum ligna,</hi> as <hi>Horace</hi>
speaketh) and men of corrupt minds, <hi>vvho suppose that gaine is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines;</hi>
That will appeare in the defence thereof. So that in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
for the time to come, there wilbe little use, for any man, to
write any more, against that <hi>Church-state, Minister ie, Worship</hi> &amp;
<hi>Government,</hi> seeing the falsnes thereof, is now seene and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
of the honester and better sort every where.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding as <hi>Pharoah</hi> used sundry meanes, to stay <hi>Israell</hi>
still in <hi>Egypt,</hi> after he saw them desirous to depart▪ So doth <hi>Satan</hi>
labour what hee can, to hold Gods people in <hi>spirituall thraldome,</hi>
after he perceives they are willing to obey Gods call, and
come out of it.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
And that he may bring to passe what he desireth, hee useth most
<hi>effectuall delusions</hi> &amp; <hi>deep deceits:</hi> Well knowing that the snares
which he laid in our forefathers blind and ignorant dayes, are now
out of date, and will not serve the turne, to beguile many people
withall; But he must more <hi>transforme himselfe into an Angell of
Light;</hi> I say, use more artificiall and craftie devises, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
he hath done.</p>
   <p>It is said of <hi>Praxiteles</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">Clemen: Alex <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>in protrept.</note> the Painter, that hee made the sillie
people worship the <hi>Image</hi> of his strumper, under the title and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Venus.</hi> Now sure I am, in those dayes, there are some,
who under the name of <hi>Gods vvorship,</hi> doe cause many people to
worship Satan and Antichrist; And that men may the easier and
sooner be perswaded to it; they set forth their lies and vanities
in as plausible &amp; faire away as can be.</p>
   <p>What man would seeme to deale so plainly as a <hi>Iugter:</hi> Hee will
strike up his sleeves and make bare his armes, and open his hands
and fingers, and lay all things before thee, and bid thee behold,
and thou wouldst thinke him to be a man of a faire carriage, and
not imagine thou couldst possiblie be deceived; And yet indeed,
his whole skill and seeking, is nothing else but to deceive, and the
more simplie and plainly he would seeme to deale, the sooner and
easier he doth beguile thee. For thou shalt thinke thou seest all,
and seest nothing; Feelest it senceablie with thy fingers, holdest
it fast, canst not loose it, and yet shall open thy hand and finde
nothing.</p>
   <p>The passages of some men, in points of Religion, are carried
much after such a sort: For one would thinke, to heare the smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of their tale, and what integritie and plainnes they doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse;
That it is all Gospell they speake, and that their cause, is
cleare, and nothing is to be said to the contrarie: Notwithstanding
when another comes forth, and replies against them, rips up their
tale, weighs their reasons, discloseth the errour and weaknes of
their pleading. Men wonder at their owne simplicitie and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and that ever they should be so fond as to beleeve them.
But seeing I am now to deale only in the point of <hi>hearing of false
Ministers:</hi>
I will not therefore step out of the beaten way to take
in any by-discourse; Only I thinke good to certifie, that I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
that such men who walke not as we doe in <hi>Church-way,</hi> but
thinke us to censorious and <hi>over just:</hi> Why they doe not publickly
answer our grounds and arguments published to the world, and so
prove their <hi>nevv Principles</hi> in as faire and open a way; that either
<pb facs="4"/>
we may come to them, finding them to walke more agreeable to
the Scriptures, or shew our reasons to the contrarie.</p>
   <p>For the matter here in controuersie: That the <hi>Reader</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
the more by it, there are 5 things, which J desire him to doe.
1. When thou settest thy selfe to read, set thy selfe as in Gods
presence, looke on with a single and impartiall eye; weigh the
arguments well on both sides, not by shewes and shifts, but by the
just Ballance of the incorruptible and unchangable Word of God;
In judging, judge I beseech thee righteous judgment; and let the
truth be deare to thy soule; and doe not side with any side, because
thy minde gives thee, it leadeth most to ease, credit, profit plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or such wordly respects, but to that which most tendeth to
the glorie of Gods great name, the purity of religion, and to the
most comfort and peace of thy own conscience.</p>
   <p>2. I would have thee to <hi>live by thy owne faith,</hi> and not build upon
anothers fancie, it is a great fault in some, in that they see nothing,
but by other mens eyes. What this man, or such a man holdeth, that
is their beleife; And besides this, they can give no more reason
for what they hold, then the Parrat of her speaking. I need not
goe farre for proofe; The point in controversie cleares it sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For as one<note n="‡" place="margin">Galen: Clas. 2. lib. de cuiusq: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimi pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat▪ notitia at que me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dela.</note> well saith: <hi>That which a credible person telleth, is
easilie thought credible by such as are well perswaded of him.</hi> What
hath drawn many unto this practice of <hi>Hearing unlawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters?</hi>
But taking the thing upon trust, without due triall and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
Sure I am, had men measured it by the <hi>Goulden Read</hi>
of the Scriptures, they would soon have perceived, that it was
never set apart by Gods appointment, for the <hi>spirituall building.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>3. <hi>Be not wise in thy ovvne eyes.</hi> But rather deny thy selfe in thy
own <hi>judgment, vvill, affection, reason,</hi> &amp;c. And be contented to bee
guided by the alone Word of God. What is the reason that some
men doe seeke after the truth, as a coward doth his enemie, loath
to find him? But because loving their owne conceit (as <hi>Apes</hi> their
yong ones) beyond measure, they are not willing to heare of any
thing that is said against it.</p>
   <p>We see in nature, he that will heare well, must stopp his breath;
It is so in things spirituall: if a man will not <hi>keep in his breath,</hi> I
meane set aside <hi>conceitednes</hi> &amp; <hi>selfe-love,</hi> &amp; be willing to embrace
the truth, though it be contrarie to that which he formerly held he
shall not profit by any thing, he heareth or readeth, but like <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roahs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
kine</hi> remaine lean &amp; ilfavored still.</p>
   <p>Things in the earth will grow as they find roome; A Light in
the dampes of mines, goeth out: Thus stands the case with men,
<pb facs="5"/>
when any good helpe is pur into their hands: If their hearts then,
be free of selfe-love, spirituall pride, personall prejudice, base desire
of vaine glorie and humaine applause, &amp;c. They will profit by
it; Contrariwise if their hearts, like a <hi>deepe hole,</hi> be full of those
filthy <hi>Foggs</hi> &amp; <hi>Mists,</hi> the truth then (how clearely soever it shine)
will dampe &amp; quench in them, as a light in the mines of the earth.</p>
   <p>4.<note place="margin">Civile dig. 4. de legib. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus{que} consult:</note> Whereas the <hi>Civil Lavv</hi> saith, <hi>it is uncivil for any man not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vveighed the vvhole Lavv, to give advice or judgement some one
parcel of it, alone proposed.</hi> I doe therefore intreat the Reader, to
forbeare his Censure, till he have read the whole booke over. And
if it be so, that he thinkes, in some point I have erred (as who liveth
&amp; erreth not) I would not have him, for such a particular fayling
to condemne the whole. But let that beare its owne burden, and
let the rest be received, as (after due trial) the same shalbe found
agreeable to the Word of God.</p>
   <p>I speake not this, as beeing privy to any known crime this way;
But because I am privy to many known wants &amp; great weaknesses
in my selfe. Besides, it is the manner of some, if they can spy some
thing not well handled in another mans writing, to take such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
as hereby they seeke to bring the whole under reproofe
and condemnation. Of this shalbe all their talke, at this they will
gird and jest; not beeing able in the meane time to take away the
force of any one of the maine arguments. Neither indeed dare to
attempt it, but like the snaile keepe in their hornes.</p>
   <p>5. I thinke good to speake here a little concerning the manner
of this answer. And that no man may be offended as it; I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
in the Word of truth, that it hath much greeved me all along
the discourse, to speake so much of the <hi>Treatiser,</hi> whose learning I
doe much reverence; But the cause beeing the Lords, and I seeing
how much it lay upon me, to take away the <hi>Maskes</hi> and <hi>visards,</hi>
whereby many have been deceived, I have done my best to shew
the absurdities, contradictiōs, unskilfulnes &amp; daungerousnes of that
<hi>Treatise.</hi> And for this <hi>not sparing</hi> but speaking home, I have had
some reasons for it, as partly here follow.</p>
   <p>1. Because the Booke containes a pernitious &amp; most hurtfull er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
and by how much it is caried forth, under a colourable shew
of a <hi>pious and godly practice,</hi> by so much the more hath it caused
many greevious &amp; long lasting miseries. I know there are many
viler errours dayly maintained; But if we respect mens walking
in the <hi>Holie Order of the Gospell,</hi> this is a main stumbling block &amp;
barre in the way to it: There are some humours, which some
where placed in the body, are quiet and doe little hurt, but in
<pb facs="5"/>
other places, specially in the passage, they doe much mischiefe. This <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi>
is as a <hi>corrupt humour,</hi> fallen into the <hi>passage</hi> of the bodie, the
Church; and therefore it must needs be the more perilous.</p>
   <p>2. I have spoken the more plainely against it, because they say, there
are manie in England and in other Countries, who hold it unlawfull to
be present at their <hi>divine service,</hi> and to receive the Sacraments in the
<hi>Parish-Churches;</hi> and yet thinke it lawfull to heare the Ministers of that
Church. Now, if such men have (as had <hi>David)</hi> tender hearts, and
hearts that will smite them for a little; They will surely come off from
this too. Seeing I have here proved, that the ground they build on, is
very sand, and their pleading for it, wants both Religion &amp; reason.</p>
   <p>3. Such a general fame is gone forth of the booke, as to be so learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; absolutely done, that it gives all men satisfaction (some few riged
spirits only excepted) &amp; that no man would ever be able to make any
sound reply to it. And for my selfe, I have been by name chalenged
(as it were) to answer, with much base insulation, as if I d urst rather
eate my pen, then put my pen to write against it. And this both before
my thoughts were setled on thing, and since too. Now, whether the
worke be according to the praise of it, let all indifferent men judge.</p>
   <p>4. Seeing it is given out (but me thinkes it should not be true) that
there are some learned men, which plead for the <hi>Hearing of false Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters;</hi>
and upon the <hi>Treat.</hi> grounds; I have therefore discovered the
sleightnes of it (to say no worse) the more: That such (if there be any
such) may see their errour; If not, reply if they please &amp; when they wil.</p>
   <p>But for the person, or persons that shall reply; These 3 things I desire
may be considered: 1. That they change not the state of the question;
which is not, whether it be lawfull to heare the <hi>Ministers of the church
of England,</hi> or of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of any Church; But taking it granted, <hi>a
Church to be false, &amp; the Ministerie Antichristian; vvhether Hearing in
such a case be lawfull;</hi> For the question now stands thus, &amp; no otherwise.</p>
   <p>2. J exspect an answer, in a more honest &amp; fairer way, then I had the
last time namly, by a <hi>sort of gnats,</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">It hath beē objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as I heare, that I should answere <hi>dead mē▪</hi> now how so ever it is wel known that my former booke was both finish ed and at the <hi>Presse,</hi> before <hi>Dr. Ames</hi> death: yet say I had writen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death: doe not all mē know, that in points of differē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the matter it self, &amp; no to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side holding the same▪</note> whom I felt but never saw: the Law
of God and Light of Nature teacheth.</p>
   <q>Quod tibi vis fieri, hoc facias &amp; alteri.</q>
   <p>Indeed it is a very unbeseeming thing, that men who doe professe
Religion &amp; learning, should disgrace other mens worke, behinde their
backs, shunning in the meane time the open light, whereby their deeds
might be made manifest. As for such <hi>Replyers,</hi> whose arguments are
<hi>Trencher-squibs,</hi> and reach only as farr as to the end of the table<note n="‡" place="margin">Not soe farr as to pen, Inke &amp; paper, to answer in a faire &amp; honest way.</note>; well
they may satisfie men of the same humours; But with men fearing God
they shall finde no acceptance.</p>
   <p>3. I exspect plaine dealing; Truth is like the <hi>glassie sea before the throne,</hi>
which is bright, cleare, not a clouded bodie or covered with the vailes
of mens fond fantisies &amp; dreames. Let such Childish toyes be kept for
Children. <hi>I require the voyce of the Shepheard, read it me out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb facs="6"/>
shew it me out of the Psalmes, read it out of the Law or Gospell.</hi> For
without this mens judgments have no credit.<note n="*" place="margin">Ego vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris requiro, lege haec mihi de Prophetis, lege de psalmo; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cita de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge; recita de Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cita de Apostolo. <hi>August. de Pastorib. cap.</hi> 14.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Before I end my speach, I thinke good to mention <hi>you my Brethren,</hi>
with whom I am in speciall communion, &amp; <hi>over vvhom the Holy Ghost
hath made me overseer.</hi> This answer will serve to cleare us, from such
untrue reports, as some malitiously have raysed up, as if we were <hi>decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from our ancient profession,</hi> Now, what we hold concerning the
<hi>fallacies &amp; fantasies</hi> newly broached, I desire all the Churches of God,
here to take knowledge off, for our clearing &amp; justification.</p>
   <p>I thought when J first began with this <hi>Treatise,</hi> in ending of it, to
have ended with publick controversies; and so have followed a more
quiet kind of studie; But seeing, what the <hi>truth</hi> suffers in regard of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
to it on both sides, the love of God constraineth me not to be
silent, but according to that measure which the Lord hath dealt unto
me, &amp; as my smal abilities are, <hi>to cōtend for the faith,</hi> against <hi>dexteriores
&amp; sinesteriores,</hi> adversaries on both hands, &amp; to deliver it from the evill
report which both have sought to bring upon it.</p>
   <p>And as I have made way now for Gods people, to enter into the sweet
order of the Gospell &amp; covenant o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> the Lord; So J purpose very speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to publish something for their stay and preservation therein.</p>
   <p>You know (my Brethren) <hi>for the divisions of Reuben are great thoughts
of heart.</hi> Lord, how are we spoken of in <hi>Gath &amp; Askalon,</hi> for the <hi>rents</hi> &amp;
Schismes amongst us. In truth, I doe not know, for what our profession,
is beholding unto, in respect of some men, but only to be dispised &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
for their idle &amp; giddle courses<note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>Of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits it is said:</hi> Illis quieta movere magna merces videbatur. Salust. They thought the very disturbāce of things quietly established an hyre sufficiently to set them on worke.</note> But that the truth of God
may no longer suffer, but the sinne &amp; shame lie where it ought; I will by
the good hand of God assisting me, cleare our Religion, as that it leads
not to Schismes &amp; Church-breakings; but such things are <hi>rootes of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes</hi>
&amp; cursed <hi>taires,</hi> planted &amp; sowed by the <hi>Envious man,</hi> in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
hearts of ungodly people; Besides, I purpose to shew from the
Word of God, why men ought to keep themselves with true Churches.
Howbeit, in their opinions very corrupt, &amp; how. Againe, how farre
particular men have libertie to deale with a Church; &amp; when they are
to rest, &amp; how, a why; Moreover, how farre a Church-Covenant binds
every member of the body to that bodie; &amp; wherefore there must not
be divisions, neither from, nor in the bodie. Againe, in case there be a
division in Church, I wil shew by what signes &amp; tokens, the Church may
be known from the Schismaticks. In a word, I will shew how farre the
<hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Eldership</hi> extendeth in matter of <hi>Government;</hi> and how
farre obedience is due unto them of the people. These things &amp; many
more of the like nature, you shall shortly see them handled; For J pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to publish a large Treatise of <hi>Ecclesiasticall Politie,</hi> even the whole
<hi>externall regiment</hi> of the Church of God. And thus commending you
to God, J take my leave; and will during life alwayes rest</p>
