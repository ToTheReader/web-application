      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F euer any men had reason to be in loue with the face of a forraine entertainment, those are they, which were admitted to the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the truly Generous and Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Lord <hi>HAY,</hi> your most noble Sonne, in his late Embassage to <hi>France;</hi> in which number my vnworthinesse was allowed to make one; who can therefore well witnesse, that no man could ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther receiue more honour from a strange Countrey, or doe more honour to his owne. What wanted there that might make men confesse themselues more welcome than strangers? Neither doubt J, but that after many ages, <hi>France</hi> it selfe will wonder at the bountifull expressions of her owne fauours. But whiles o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were inioying the noble courtesies of the time, my thoughts entertained themselues with searching into the proofe of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Trauell, wherewith I saw men commonly affected; which J must needs confesse, the more I saw, the lesse I liked. Neither is it in the power of any forraine munificence, to make me thinke ours any where so well as at home. Earthly commodities are no part of my thought: I looked (as J ought) at the soule; which I well saw, vses not only to gather no mosse in this rolling, but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the best graces it hath to moulder away insensibly in such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarie agitation. J haue now beene twise abroad: both times (as thinking my selfe worthy of nothing but neglect) J bent my eies vpon others, to see what they did, what they got: my inquirie
<pb n="668" facs="351"/> found our spirituall losse so palpable, that now at last my heart could not chuse but breake forth at my hand, and tell my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the dangerous issue of their curiositie. J meddle not with the common iourneyes to the minerall waters of the <hi>Spa;</hi> to which many sicke soules are beholden for a good excuse: who whiles they pretend the medicinall vse of that spring, can freely quaffe of the puddle of popish superstition; poysoning the better part, in stead of helping the worse. These J leaue to the best Physitian, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie; which, if it may please to vndertake the cure, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps saue as many English soules from infection, as that water cures bodies of diseases. J deale onely with those, that professe to seeke the glory of a perfect breeding, and the perfection of that, which we call Ciuilitie, in Trauell: of which sort I haue (not without indignation) seene too many lose their hopes and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the way; returning as emptie of grace, and other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as full of words, vanitie, mis-dispositions. J dedicate this poore discourse to your Lo: as (besides my daily renued obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) congratulating to you the sweet libertie and happy vse of your home; who like a fixed starre may well ouer-looke these planets, and by your constant settlednesse, giue that aime to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour eyes, which shall bee in vaine expected from a wandring light. The God of heauen, to whose glory J haue intended this weake labour, giue it fauour in the sight of his Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne it backe, but with this good newes, that any one of the sonnes of <hi>Iaphet</hi> is hereby perswaded to dwell euer in the tents of <hi>Sem.</hi> Ʋnto that diuine protection, J humbly betake your Lo: iustly vowing my selfe</p>
