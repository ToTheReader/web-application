   <head>THE VVORDES OF MAISTER THE SAME CHALENGE AND offer and imputing to the catholikes of vnha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes to defend their doctrine, vttered by M. Iuell in other places of his booke, as folovveth.</head>
   <p>MY offer vvas this <hi>(he meaneth in the sermon vvich he made in the courte)</hi> that if any of all those thinges that I then rehearsed,<note place="margin">In the first an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svver to D. Coles letter. fol. 4.</note> could be proued of your syde by any sufficiēt authoritie other of the scriptures, or of the aunciēt Councelles, or by any one allovved example of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue churche, that then I vvould be content to yelde vnto you. I saye you haue none of all those helps, nor scriptures, nor councelles, nor doctours, nother any other antiquitie, and this is the negatiue. Novv it standeth you vpon, to proue but one affirmatiue to the contrary, and so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre my promise. The Articles that I sayde could not be proued of your parte, vvere these. That it can not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re by any authoritie other of the olde doctours, or of the auncient Councelles, that there vvas any priuate Masse in the vvhole churche of Christ at that tyme: Or that there vvas then any communion ministred, etc. <hi>the articles reke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there it foloweth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And if any one of all these articles can be sufficiently proued by such atuhoritie as I haue sayde,<note place="margin">Fol. 5.</note> and as ye haue borne the people in hand ye can proue them by: I am vvell content to stand to my promise.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">After in the first ansvver to D. C. fol. 6. In the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de there. fol. 7.</note>I thought it best to make my entree vvith such thinges, as vvhere in I vvas vvell assured, ye shuld be able to finde not so much as any colour at all.</p>
   <p>But to conclude, as I begane, I ansvver, that in these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles I hold only the negatiue, and therefore I looke hovv you vvil be able to affirme the cōtrarie, and that, as I sayde afore, by sufficient authoritie, vvhich if ye doo not, you shall cause me the more to be resolued, and others to stand
<pb facs="7"/> the more in doubt of the rest of your learning.</p>
   <p>In my Sermon at poules and els vvhere, I required you to bring forth on your part eyther sum scripture,<note place="margin">sn the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svver to D. C. fo. 13</note> or sum old doctour, or sum aunciēt councell, or els some allovve example of the primiue churchē. For these are good grovvndes to buyld vpon. And I vvould haue marueiled that you brought nothing all this vvhile, sauing that I knevv ye had nothing to bring.</p>
   <p>As truly as god is god, if ye vvold haue vouchesaued to folovv either the scriptures, or the auncient doctours,<note place="margin">In the 2. ansvver. fol. 15.</note> and councelles, ye vvold neuer haue restored agayne the Su{pre}<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of Rome, after it vvas once abolished, or the priuate Masse, or the communion vnder one kinde etc. Novv if ye thinke ye haue vvrong,<note place="margin">There fol. 17.</note> shevv your euidence out of the doctours, the councels or scriptures, that you may haue yout right and reentre. I require you to no great paine. one good sentence shall be sufficient.</p>
   <p>You vvold haue your priuate Masse, the bisshop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes su{pre}macie, the commē prayer in an vnknovven tonge:<note place="margin">Fol. 18.</note> and for defence of the same ye haue made no small a doo. Me thinketh it reasonable ye bring sum one authoritie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syde your ovvne, to auouche the same vvith all. Ye haue made the vnlearned people beleue, ye had all the doctours, all the councelles, and fiften hundred yeres on your syde. For your credites sake, let not all these great vauntes comme to naught.</p>
   <p>Ye desyre ye may not be put of,<note place="margin">Fol. 18.</note> but that your suite maye be consydered. And yet this half yeare long, I haue desyred of you, and of your brethren but one sentence, and still I knovv not hovv, I am cast of, and can gete nothing at your handes.</p>
   <p>You call for the special proufes of our doctrine,<note place="margin">Fol. 21.</note> vvhich vvould require a vvhole booke, vvhere as if you of your part could vouchesafe to bring but tvvo lines, the vvhole matter vvere concluded. VVe only tell the people, as
<pb facs="8"/> our devvtie is, that you vvithstand the manifest truth, and yet haue neither doctour, nor councell, nor scripture for you, and that ye haue shevved such extremitie, as the like hath not bē seene, and novv cā giue no rekening vvhy. Or if ye can, let it appeare.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Fol. 23.</note>You are bovvnde ye saye, and maye not dispute, etc. But I vvould vvish the quenes Maiestie vvould not only set you at libertie in that behalfe, but also cōmaunde you to shevve your grovvndes. VVhere as you saye, you vvould haue the sainges of bothe parties vveighed by the balance of the olde doctours, ye see, that is oure only request, and that in the matters ye vvrite of, I desyre euē so to be tried. But vvhy throvv you avvaye these balance, and being so earnestly requyred, vvhy be ye so loth to shevv forth but one olde doctour of your syde? ye make me beleue ye vvould not haue the matter comme to tryall. etc.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">26</note>VVhat thinke ye is there novv iudged of you, that being so long tyme requyred, yet can not be vvonne to bring one sentence in your ovvn defence?</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Fol. 26.</note>I protest before God, bring me but one sufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in the matters I haue requyred, and aftervvard I vvil gentilly and quietly conferre vvith you farther at your pleasure. VVherefore for as much as it is goddes cause, if ye meane simply, deale simply, betraie not your right, if ye maye saue it by the speaking of one vvorde.</p>
   <p>The people must nedes muse some vvhat at your silence, and mistrust your doctrine, if it shall appeare to haue no grovvnde, neither of the olde councelles, nor of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, nor of the scripture, nor any alovved example of the primitiue churche, to stand vpon. and so fiften hundred yeres, and the consent of antiquitie and generalitie, that ye haue so lōg and so much talkte of, shall comme to nothing. For thinke not that any vvise man vvill be so much your frend, that in so vveighty matters, vvill be satisfied vvith your silence.</p>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <p>Here I leaue, putting you,<note place="margin">In the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of the 2. ansvver to D. C. fol. 27.</note> eftsones gently in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, that being so ostē and so openly desyred to shevv forth one doctour, or Councell etc. in the matters a fore mencioned, yet hitherto ye haue brought nothing: and that if ye stand so still, it must needes be thought, ye doo it <hi>conscientia imbecillitatis,</hi> for that there vvas nothing to be brought.</p>
   <p>You saye vve lacke stuffe to proue our purpose.<note place="margin">In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to D. Coles last letter. fol. 43.</note> O vvould to God your stuffe and oures might be layed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, then shuld it sone appeare, hovv true it is that ye saye, and hovv faithfully ye haue vsed the people of God.</p>
   <p>Me thinketh bothe reason and humanitie vvould,<note place="margin">Fol. 44.</note> ye shuld haue ansvvered me sumvvhat, specially being so oftē and so openly required, at the least you shuld haue alleaged Augustine, Ambrose, Chrysostome, Hierome. etc. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a man hath nothing to saye, it is good reason, he kepe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as you doo.</p>
   <p>You knovv that the matters that lie in question betvvē vs, haue ben taught, as vve novv teache them,<note place="margin">Fol. 53.</note> bothe by Christ him self, and by his Apostles, and by the olde do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, and by the auncient generall Councelles: and that you hauing none of these or like authorities: haue set vp a religion of your ovvne, and built it only vpon your selfe. Therefor I may iustly and truly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>nclude, that you novv teache and of long tyme haue taught the people, touching the Masse, the Supremacie, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men prayers, etc. is naught: For neither Christ, nor his Apostles, nor the olde Doctours, Tertulliane, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priane, S. Hierome, S. Augustine, S. Ambrose, S. Chrisostom etc. euer taught the people, so as you haue taught them. Not vvithstanding your great vavvntes that ye haue made, ye see novv ye are discomfyted,<note place="margin">Fol. 62.</note> ye see the field is almost lost, vvhere ar novv your crakes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, and councelles? VVhy stampe ye not your bookes
<pb facs="9"/> vvhy comme ye not forth vvith your euidence? Novv ye stand in nede of it, novv it vvill serue and take place, if ye haue any.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Fol. 65.</note>As I haue offred you oftentymes, bring ye but tvvo lines of your syde, and the field is yours.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Fol. 110.</note>Hilarius sayeth vnto the Arians, <hi>cedo aliud Euangelium,</hi> shevv me some other gospell, for this that ye bring, helpeth you not. Euen so vvill I saye to you, <hi>Cedo alios do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctores,</hi> shevv me some other doctours, for these that ye bring, are not vvorthy the hearing. I hoped ye vvould haue comme in vvith some fressher bande. It must nedes be some miserable cause, that can fynde no better patrones to cleaue vnto. I knovv it vvas not for lacke of good vvill of your part, ye vvould haue brought other doctours, if ye could haue fovvnd them.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Fol. 112.</note>O Master Doctour, deale simply in Gods causes, and saye ye haue doctours, vvhen ye haue them in dede: and vvhen ye haue them not, neuer laye the fault (of not allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to the defence of your doctrine) in your recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisaunce.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Fol. 114.</note>But alas small rhetorike vvould suffise, to shevv hovv litle ye haue of your syde to alleage for your selfe.</p>

      </gap>ent authoritie, for prouf of your partie, and yet hitherto can obteine nothing. VVhich thing I must nedes novv pronounce simply and plainely, because it is true, vvith out if, or and, ye doo <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientia imbecillitatis,</hi> because as ye knovv, there is nothing to be brought.</p>
