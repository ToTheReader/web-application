   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVL, And well accomplisht <hi>Gentleman, master</hi> Hugh HAMMERSLEY <hi>Sheriffe of</hi> LONDON, <hi>and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident</hi> of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery Society.</hi>
   </head>
   <head>TO THE WORTHY, and valorous, Captaine BING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM, <hi>their vnderstanding Leader. AND</hi> TO ALL THE REST <hi>of that famous Societie, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,</hi> Assistants, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, professing and <hi>exercising Armes.</hi>

      <salute>WORTHY GENTLEMEN,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He vse of <hi>Musicke</hi> in the warres, is partly to direct the <hi>Souldier,</hi> partly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him. Such I wisht
<pb facs="5"/>this <hi>Sermon</hi> when I preacht it. Beside the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it for the fighting of spirituall battailes; That it might be as <hi>Musicke</hi> to encourage you in your other warlike preparations, and to breathe some little life into your generous spirits, though already brauely actuated with resolution and valour.</p>
   <p>It was yours from the beginning, and againe I make it yours. Yours in the bud, and yours in the fruit; in the seed yours, and yours in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest. What you left scattered in the first reaping, you may now gleane vp againe, and not loose an eare in a surrow, if any way seruiceable for your vse.</p>
   <p>Of your fauourable acceptations I doubt not, comming from one that wishes a great deale of honour and happines, to euery member of your Societie, and to all your worthy designes. The poore <hi>Paynter</hi> could write vpon his <hi>Table,</hi> when he had embellisht it with the pictures of many rich Iems, <hi>Vellem &amp; haec.</hi> My <hi>velle</hi> is the same with his. I wish I could adde <hi>reall</hi> encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to these <hi>verball</hi> that I giue you. But it must suffice me to do as some <hi>Grecians</hi> were said to do, in their sacrifices to <hi>Hercules.</hi> They should
<pb facs="5"/>haue offered to him, <hi>Oxen</hi> and <hi>Sheepe.</hi> Wanting at that time, they were faine to offer <hi>Melons</hi> and other fruites, cutting them into the shapes of <hi>Sheepe</hi> and <hi>Oxen,</hi> and fixing to their bodies little stickes of wood, artificially representing legs and feete; Such were the testimonies of their deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and zeale, and such the ieiune oblations, with which here I present you.</p>
   <p>In what euer they be defectiue, I shall endeuour to supply it, by my praying to God for you, as <hi>Moses</hi> prayde for the <hi>Israelites;</hi> Alwayes when they <hi>went forward</hi> in the Campe, that he would <hi>rise vp</hi> before them; alwayes when they <hi>rested</hi> that he would <hi>returne</hi> to them. So may he alwaies <hi>rise</hi> and alwayes <hi>returne</hi> vnto you both in your <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings</hi> &amp; in your <hi>restings.</hi> And the Lord make you all; (<hi>Captaines</hi> &amp; <hi>Souldiers, Leaders</hi> and <hi>Followers</hi>) such as the good <hi>Centurion</hi> was in the <hi>Gospell;</hi> such as the good <hi>Cornelius</hi> was in the <hi>Acts,</hi> deuout men, fearing God, &amp; full of faith &amp; good works. Then shall fiue of you be able to chase a hundred of your enemies, and a hundred of you to put ten thousand to flight.</p>
