   <head>Too the Reader.</head>
   <l>I Would not wish the simple sort offended for too bée,</l>
   <l>When in this booke the heathen names of feyned Godds they sée.</l>
   <l>The trewe and euerliuing God the Paynims did not knowe:</l>
   <l>Which caused them the name of Godds on creatures too bestow.</l>
   <l>For nature beeing once corrupt and knowledge blynded quyght</l>
   <l>By <hi>Adams</hi> fall, those little séedes and sparkes of heauenly lyght</l>
   <l>That did as yit remayne in man, endeuering foorth too burst</l>
   <l>And wanting grace and powre too growe too that they were at furst,</l>
   <l>Too superstition did decline: and draue the fearefull mynd,</l>
   <l>Straunge woorshippes of the liuing God in creatures for too fynd.</l>
   <l>The which by custome taking roote, and growing so too strength,</l>
   <l>Through Sathans help possest the hartes of all the world at length.</l>
   <l>Some woorshipt al the hoste of heauen: some deadmens ghostes &amp; bones:</l>
   <l>Sum wicked féends: sum wormes &amp; fowles, herbes, fishes, trées &amp; stones.</l>
   <l>The fyre, the ayre, the sea, the land, and euery roonning brooke,</l>
   <l>Eche queachie groue, eche cragged cliffe the name of Godhead tooke.</l>
   <l>The nyght and day, the fléeting howres, the seasons of the yéere,</l>
   <l>And euery straunge and monstruous thing, for Godds mistaken wéere.</l>
   <l>There was no vertue, no nor vice: there was no gift of mynd</l>
   <l>Or bodye, but some God thertoo or Goddesse was assignde.</l>
   <l>Of health and sicknesse, lyfe and death, of néedinesse and wealth,</l>
   <l>Of peace and warre, of loue and hate, of murder, craft and stealth,</l>
   <l>Of bread and wyne, of slouthfull sléepe, and of theyr solemne games,</l>
   <l>And euery other tryfling toy theyr Goddes did beare the names.</l>
   <l>And looke how euery man was bent too goodnesse or too ill,</l>
   <l>He did surmyse his foolish Goddes enclyning too his will.</l>
   <l>For God perceyuing mannes peruers and wicked will too sinne</l>
   <l>Did giue him ouer too his lust too sinke or swim therin.</l>

   <l>That all theyr Goddes with whoordome, theft, or murder blotted bée.</l>
   <l>Which argues them too bee no Goddes, but woorser in effect</l>
   <l>Than they whoose open po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

   <l>Or else the suttle <hi>Mercurie</hi> that beares the charmed rod</l>
   <l>Conueying neate and hyding them would take him for a God?</l>
   <l>For if theis faultes in mortall men doo iustly merit blame,</l>
   <l>What greater madnesse can there bée than too impute the same</l>
   <l>Too Goddes, whoose natures ought too bee most perfect, pure and bright,</l>
   <l>Most vertuous, holly, chaast, and wyse, most full of grace and lyght?</l>
   <l>But as there is no Christen man that can surmyse in mynd</l>
   <l>That theis or other such are Goddes which are no Goddes by kynd:</l>
   <l>So would too God there were not now of christen men profest,</l>
   <l>That worshipt in theyr déedes theis Godds whose names they doo detest.</l>
   <l>Whoose lawes wée kéepe his thralles wée bée, and he our God indéede.</l>
   <l>So long is Christ our God as wée in christen lyfe procéede.</l>
   <l>But if wée yéeld too fleshlye lust, too lucre, or too wrath,</l>
   <l>Or if that Enuy, Gluttony, or Pryde the maystry hath.</l>
   <l>Or any other kynd of sinne the thing the which wée serue,</l>
   <l>Too bée accounted for our God most iustly dooth deserue.</l>
   <l>Then must wée thinke the learned men that did theis names frequent,</l>
   <l>Some further things and purposes by those deuises ment.</l>
   <l>By <hi>Ioue</hi> and <hi>Iuno</hi> vnderstand all states of princely port:</l>

   <l>With all such vayne and deulish artes as superstition bréede.</l>
   <l>By <hi>Satyres, Syluanes, Nymphes</hi> and <hi>Faunes</hi> with other such besyde,</l>
   <l>The playne and simple country folke that euery where abyde.</l>
   <l>I know theis names too other thinges oft may and must agrée</l>
   <l>In declaration of the which I will not tedious bée.</l>
   <l>But leaue them too the Readers will too take in sundry wyse,</l>
   <l>As matter rysing giueth cause constructions too deuyse.</l>
   <l>Now when thou readst of God or man, in stone, in beast, or trée</l>
   <l>It is a myrrour for thy self thyne owne estate too sée.</l>
   <l>For vnder feyned names of Goddes it was the Poets guyse,</l>
   <l>The vice and faultes of all estates too taunt in couert wyse.</l>
   <l>And likewyse too extoll with prayse such things as doo deserue.</l>
   <l>Obseruing alwayes comlynesse from which they doo not swarue.</l>
   <l>And as the persone greater is of birth, renowne or fame,</l>
   <l>The greater euer is his laud, or fouler is his shame.</l>
   <l>For if the States that on the earth the roome of God supply,</l>
   <l>Declyne from vertue vntoo vice and liue disorderly,</l>
   <l>Too Eagles, Tygres, Bulles, and Beares, and other figures straunge</l>
   <l>Bothe too theyr people and themselues most hurtfull doo they chaunge,</l>
   <l>And when the people giue themselues too filthie life and synne,</l>
   <l>What other kinde of shape thereby than filthie can they winne?</l>
   <l>So was <hi>Licaon</hi> made a Woolfe: and <hi>Ioue</hi> became a Bull:</l>
   <l>The tone for vsing crueltie, the toother for his trull.</l>
   <l>So was <hi>Elpenor</hi> and his mates transformed intoo swyne,</l>
   <l>For following of theyr filthie lust in women and in wyne.</l>
   <l>Not that they lost theyr manly shape as too the outward showe.</l>
   <l>But for that in their brutish brestes most beastly lustes did growe.</l>
   <l>For why this lumpe of flesh and bones this bodie is not wée.</l>
   <l>Wée are a thing which earthly eyes denyed are too sée.</l>
   <l>Our soule is wée endewd by God with reason from aboue:</l>
   <l>Our bodie is but as our house, in which wée woorke and moue.</l>
   <l>Tone part is common too vs all, with God of heauen himself:</l>
   <l>The toother common with the beastes, a vyle and stinking pelf.</l>
   <l>

      </gap>one bedect with heauenly giftes and endlesse: toother grosse,</l>
   <l>Fraylie, filthie, weake, and borne too dye as made of earthly drosse.</l>
   <l>Now looke how long this clod of clay too reason dooth obey,</l>
   <l>So long for men by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>

   <l>But if wée suffer fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>shly lustes as lawlesse Lordes too reigne,</l>
   <l>Than are we beastes, wée are no men, wée haue our name in vaine.</l>
   <l>And if wée be so drownd in vice that féeling once bée gone,</l>
   <l>Then may it well of vs bée sayd, wée are a block or stone.</l>
   <l>This surely did the Poets méene when in such sundry wyse</l>
   <l>The pleasant tales of turned shapes they studyed too deuyse.</l>
   <l>There purpose was too profite men, and also too delyght</l>
   <l>And so too hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e euery thing as best might like the sight.</l>
   <l>For as the Image portrayd out in simple whight and blacke</l>
   <l>(Though well proportiond, trew and faire) if comly colours lacke,</l>
   <l>Delyghteth not the eye so much, nor yet contentes the mynde</l>
   <l>So much as that that shadowed is with colours in his kynde:</l>
   <l>Euen so a playne and naked tale or storie simply told</l>
   <l>(Although the matter bée in déede of valewe more than gold)</l>
   <l>Makes not the hearer so attent too print it in his hart,</l>
   <l>As when the thing is well declarde, with pleasant termes and art.</l>
   <l>All which the Poëts knew right well: and for the greater grace,</l>
   <l>As Persian kings did neuer go abrode with open face,</l>
   <l>But with some lawne or silken skarf, for reuerence of theyr state:</l>
   <l>Euen so they following in their woorkes the selfsame trade and rate,</l>
   <l>Did vnder couert names and termes theyr doctrines so emplye,</l>
   <l>As that it is ryght darke and hard theyr méening too espye.</l>
   <l>But béeing found it is more swéete and makes the mynd more glad,</l>
   <l>Than if a man of tryed gold a treasure gayned had.</l>
   <l>For as the body hath his ioy in pleasant smelles and syghts:</l>
   <l>Euen so in knowledge and in artes the mynd as much delights.</l>
   <l>Wherof aboundant hoordes and heapes in Poets packed béene</l>
   <l>So hid that (sauing vntoo fewe) they are not too bée séene.</l>
   <l>And therfore whooso dooth attempt the Poets woorkes too réede,</l>
   <l>Must bring with him a stayed head and iudgement too procéede.</l>
   <l>For as there bée most wholsome hestes and precepts too bée found,</l>
   <l>So are theyr rockes and shallowe shelues too ronne the ship a ground.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="11"/>Some naughtie persone séeing vyce shewd lyuely in his hew,</l>
   <l>Dooth take occasion by and by like vices too ensew.</l>
   <l>Another beeing more seuere than wisdome dooth requyre,</l>
   <l>Béeholding vice (too outward shewe) exalted in desyre,</l>
   <l>Condemneth by and by the booke and him that did it make.</l>
   <l>And willes it too be burnd with fyre for lewd example sake.</l>
   <l>These persons ouershoote themselues, and other folkes deceyue:</l>
   <l>Not able of the authors mynd the méening too conceyue.</l>
   <l>The Authors purpose is too paint and set before our eyes</l>
   <l>The lyuely Image of the thoughts that in our stomackes ryse.</l>
   <l>Eche vice and vertue seemes too speake and argue too our face,</l>
   <l>With such perswasions as they haue theyr dooinges too embrace.</l>
   <l>And if a wicked persone séeme his vices too exalt,</l>
   <l>Estéeme not him that wrate the woorke in such defaultes too halt.</l>
   <l>But rather with an vpryght eye consyder well thy thought:</l>
   <l>Sée if corrupted nature hane the like within thée wrought.</l>
   <l>Marke what affection dooth perswade in euery kynd of matter.</l>
   <l>Iudge if that euen in heynous crymes thy fancy doo not flatter.</l>
   <l>And were it not for dread of lawe or dread of God aboue,</l>
   <l>Most men (I feare) would doo the things that fond affections moue.</l>
   <l>Then take theis woorkes as fragrant flowers most full of pleasant iuce.</l>
   <l>The which the Bée conueying home may put too wholsome vse:</l>
