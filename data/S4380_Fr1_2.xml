   <head>The Preface to the matter.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE auncient Lawes of this Realme hauing always had a speciall regard, vnto the continuall studie &amp; care that Kings and Princes haue in great and waightie affaires of matters of Common weale, for the good of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes: whereby they are often times wearyed with the toyle of the same: and in respect thereof, the same lawes haue giuen vnto them diuers royall prerogatiues of most noble and princely pleasures to recreate themselues withal, to put away from them the remembrance of their laboursome toyle. Amongst which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues, the royall prerogatiue of the libertie of a Forest is not the least: For, a Forest both is and hath beene alwayes accompted a franchese of such noble and Princely pleasure, that it is not incident vnto any subiect of this Ralme to haue the same, but onely vnto the Crowne and royall dignitie of a Prince. And therefore there haue beene alwayes certain particular lawes differing from the Common Lawes of this Realme, that were onely proper vnto a Forest, belonging to the same for the continuance of it.</p>
   <p>And it doth seeme that Forestes haue beene of long time, and that they are very auncient things, although, peraduenture, not in that nature that they are now vsed heere in this Realme of England. For it doth appeare, that there were Forestes, yea, euen in the verie tyme of king <hi>Dauid:</hi>
      <note place="margin">King Dauid in his 50. Psalm. ver. 10.</note> For he saith in his 50. Psalme these wordes, <hi>O Lord, I neede not to offer vnto thee burnt Sacrifices of beastes: for all the wilde beastes of the Forest are thine, and so are the Cattell vpon a thowsand Hilles:</hi> Then <hi>Ergo</hi> there were Forestes of wilde beastes in his time. And it doth also appeare by sundry auncient Histories, as in <hi>Concordantia Historiarum</hi> &amp; others,<note place="margin">Concordan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Historiar.</note> that Forestes haue beene alwayes in this Realme, from the first tyme that the same was inhabited.<note place="margin">Gurguntius.</note> And also you may read there that <hi>Gurguntius</hi> the sonne of <hi>Belyn</hi> being a king of this lande, did make certaine Forestes for his delight and pleasure in Wilshire: and so haue diuers other kings also since his tyme in other places meete for that purpose: VVhich Forestes the Kings and Princes of this Realme haue alwayes mayntained and preserued, (with diuers Priuileges and Lawes appertaining to the same,) for places of pleasure and delight for their recreation.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>And if it did happen that any offenders did enter into those priuileged pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, &amp; that they did any trespas therein, then they were punished with verie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>rp Lawes &amp; punishments according to the lawes that then were in force, which were sharply executed, &amp; which lawes were then altogether vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: and the offenders were punished at the Kings will &amp; pleasure, &amp; not by any law certaine: and those lawes &amp; punishments were duely executed &amp; continued by the Kings of this Realme,<note place="margin">Canutus, a Dane, was king here in England, in Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini 1016.</note> vntil that <hi>Canutus</hi> a Dane came to be king of this land, which was about the yeare of our Lord <hi>1016.</hi> who taking as great delight &amp; felicitie in Forestes as other most noble Princes of this Realme had done before his time: He for the better preseruation &amp; mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of those priuileged places of pleasure did establish certaine Lawes and Canons onely concerning Forests, which Lawes I haue here placed first of all in this hooke: for although that they haue beene raked vp a long time in the Embers of obliuion, yet they are worthie to be remembred againe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that they are the most auncientest lawes that I can find concerning Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restes, therfore I haue placed them first of all before any others, to thend that those that shall read this booke, may both see &amp; know what lawes there were in the beginning, concerning Forestes, and how they haue altered &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from time to time: and to that end I haue here set downe all the Statuts concerning Forestes that haue beene made since the time of the making of the said lawes, because that it may thereby appeare the more plainly how any one of them hath abrogated another, or any part thereof: by reason whereof, that which is lawe and in force at this day may the more easier be decerned and knowen.</p>
   <p>It appeareth by the Lawes of <hi>Canutus</hi> the Dane king in his Canon the <hi>30.</hi> that before his time, all wild beastes &amp; birdes were onely the kings: and that no other person might kill or hurt them.<note place="margin">Canutus Canon. 30.</note> For the king by his royall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, his right and priuilege was such in England, that all such things that none of his subiects could challenge any propertie in, they were then said to be the Kings: as wilde beastes, byrds, &amp; such like, in whose lands or woods soeuer they were found. Wherefore the same king made this law, <hi>Volo vt omnis liber homo pro libito suo habeat venerem siue viridem in planis suis super terras suas sine Chacea tamen, et deuitent omnes meam vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque eam habere voluero,</hi> which is: that from hencefoorth, I will (saith the king) that euery free man may take his own Ʋert &amp; Venerie or hunting that he can gett vpon his owne ground, or in his owne feelds, being out of my Chase. And let all men refraine from my Venery in euery place where I
<pb facs="3"/> will haue the same.<note place="margin">The booke of the Lawes of Saint Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Confessor.</note> And also it appeareth in the booke of S. Edward the confessor, which booke is the verie roote and originall ground of all the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Lawes of England, that the same king Edward the confessor did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the same Law in these vordes: <hi>Volo vt omnis homo sit venatione sua dignus in nemora campo &amp; dominico suo &amp; abstineat omnis homo a venarijs meis vbicunque pacem eos habere volo super penam vitae.</hi> And so it appeareth, that both the said kings did graunt and make this Law, that after that time it should be lawfull for euery subiect to enioye the benefite of his owne hunting that he could any way take in his owne lande or in his owne woods or feeldes, so that euery man should refraine from hunting the kings wilde beastes in his owne Forests and priuileged places for them: vpon paine of the losse of life of such an offender.<note place="margin">William the Conqueror.</note> Which Lawes <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> did afterwards in his time confirme, as it doth appeare in the said booke of the said Lawes, chap. <hi>47.</hi> And also he did continue the samae all his life time.<note place="margin">William Rufus.</note> And after his death <hi>William Rufus</hi> his sonne in like sort continued those Lawes during his life, vntill he was slaine in new Forest as he was in hunting. And after the death of the saide <hi>William Rufus</hi> without issue of his body king <hi>Henry</hi> the first his brother succeeded him as next heire vnto the Crowne of this Realme,<note place="margin">Henry the first.</note> by his Charter did confirme all the said Lawes of the Forest of Saint Edward the Confessor, as it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the redd booke in the Excheker called <hi>Liber Rubus, cap. 1.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Liber Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brus cap. 1.</note>
      <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum suarum,</hi> and also in the second Charter of the said book of the Lawes of the Forest in these wordes, <hi>Forestas vero Communi assensu omnium Baronum meorum in manu mea sic retinuo sicut pater meus eas reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit.</hi> And then afterwards in the <hi>18</hi> Chapter of the said Booke, the plees of the Forest are there specified and rehearsed in these wordes, <hi>Placita quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Forestarum satis sunt in commoditat' valliat' sicut de assertis de Cessione de venatione de cumbustione &amp;c.</hi> VVhich Lawes of the Forest afterwardes did more and more increase, and so did continue during all the life of the said king <hi>Henrie</hi> the first. And after his decease,<note place="margin">King Steuen.</note> king <hi>Steuen</hi> by his Charter did confirme all the said Priuileges, Lawes, &amp; Customes made and graunted by Saint <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, and also by king <hi>Henry</hi> the first his vncle, as it appeareth in the booke of the said Lawes. All which said Lawes and Customes the said king <hi>Stenen</hi> did continue all his life. And after his decase king <hi>Henry</hi> the second succeeding him as next king of this Realme,<note place="margin">King Henry the second.</note> by his generall Charter did confirme the said Lawes of the Forest in most things, &amp; principally concerning the beginning of <hi>Carta de Foresta.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>For in the first booke of his Lawes made in the <hi>19.</hi> yeare of his raigne, Chap. <hi>16.</hi> he rehearseth and declareth the Lawe of the Forest, and the very nature of that, and doth farther shewe there, how that the Lawes of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest do varie and differ from the Common Lawe of this Realme, as it doth appeare in the said redd Booke in the Excheker in these wordes, <hi>Sane Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starum, lex, ratio pena quoque vel absolutio delinquentium siue pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaria fuerit siue corporalis scorsum ab aliis regni ludicijs secernuntur &amp; folius regis arbitrio seu cuiuslibet familiaris ad haec specialiter depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati subijcitur, legibus quidem proprijs subsistit, quas non lure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni sed voluntaria principum Institutione subnixasse debent, adeo vt per legem eius factum fuerit non Iustum absolute, sed Iustum secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum legem Forestae dicatur, quia in Forestis penetralia regum sunt &amp; corum maximae deliciae ad has quidem venandi causa Curis quando{que} accedunt, vt modica quiete recreentur.</hi> And afterwards in the twelfth Chapter of the same booke, there doth followe another sentence concerning the lawes of the Forest in these wordes, <hi>In singulis Comitatibus Foresta regis non est, sed in nemorosis vbi ferarum latibula sunt &amp; vberior pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stura, nec interest cuius sunt nemora siue enim regis siue regni procerū liberos tamen &amp; indemnes habeat ferae Circum{que} discursus:</hi> So that by those texts before rehearsed, it doth appeare how the Lawes of the Forest were taken and vsed in times past, and by those wordes, <hi>Nec interest, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius sunt nemora &amp;c.</hi> It is plainly shewed that the king then might &amp; yet may also make a Forest in euery place where he pleaseth, aswell in the landes and inheritance of any of his subiectes as in his own demeasne lands and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, which was a great losse and hinderance to those that were owners of those lands that were so afforested. For after the same was so afforested, their pastures and profits of their lands was deuowred by the wilde beastes of the king without any recompence for the same to be made vnto them. And this lawe of afforesting of the landes and inheritance of other men did then daily so increase, that the same was thought a very extreme heauie burthen, aswel vnto noble men and gentlemen, as also vnto the poore comminaltie of this Realme to beare: for that they might not inclose their land, nor improue the same to their best profite that was so afforested by the king. But they were forced to suffer their said lands aforested to lye open and not inclosed. And if any of them did chaunce to offend against the Assises or Lawes of the Forest, the punishment was sometimes verie great for a small offence: and the
<pb facs="4"/> forfeitures for the same, according to the will and pleasure of the king, and not according to the quantitie of the trespas, nor yet according to the course of the Common lawe of this Realme. And this law did continue during the life of king <hi>Henry</hi> the second. And after his decease, the same conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued likewise during the raigne of king <hi>Richard</hi> the first. And then after his desease, likewise during the raigne of king <hi>Iohn.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Richard the first. King Iohn</note> And euery one of the saide kings did daily increase and make more newe Forestes and more in the lands of their subiectes, to the great hinderance and impouerishing of their subiectes.</p>
   <p>And this mischiefe was not at all remedied vntill the making of the Charter of the liberties of the Forest,<note place="margin">Henry the third.</note> which was made by king <hi>Henry</hi> the thirde. And afterwardes the same Charter was confirmed and enlarged by king <hi>Edward</hi> the first his sonne: which Charter was made for the pacifying of the Comminaltie of this Realme that then were much agreeued at this mischiefe.<note place="margin">Edward the first.</note> And therefore the same Charter called <hi>Carta de Foresta</hi> euen in the verie first Article of the same did prouide a remedie in that behalfe in these wordes, <hi>Omnes Forestae quas Henricus auus noster aforestauit videantur per bonos &amp; legales homines et si boscum aliquem alium quam suum dominicum afforestauerit ad damnum illius cuius boscus ille fuerit statim deaforestentur &amp;c.</hi> By which branch of the said Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you do see, that all Forestes that king <hi>Henry</hi> the third had made of the lands of any of his subiects, which were not the kings owne demeane landes, are here appointed to be disaforested againe.</p>
   <p>And againe, in the third Article of the said Charter of the Forest, there is the verie like remedie and prouision, that all such Forestes which king <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the first and also king <hi>Iohn</hi> had aforested and made of the landes or woodes of any of his subiectes, being not the demeasne landes of the Crowne, that then all those landes and woods should be disaforested againe: For these three kings, that is to saye, king <hi>Richard</hi> the first, king <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the thirde had then newly aforested so much of the landes of their subiectes, that the greatest part of this Realme was then become Forest.</p>
   <p>And because the mischiefes, inconueniences, and burthens that were then layde vpon the Comminaltie of this Realme, were verie great and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, by the meanes of the Lawes of the Forest: therefore the said Charter of the Liberties of the Forest, hath now moderated the extremenesse of those Lawes in a more mylder order, as you may perceiue by the same.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>For he that doth attentiuely read and examine the whole Charter of the Forest, and euery Article therein, may thereby partly perceiue how harde and sharpe the lawes of the Forest were in tymes past before the graunting of the same Charter: And also what inconueniences the inhabitants in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restes did then indure &amp; suffer, by reason of the Forest lawes: all which are now prouided for, and in a measurable maner remedied, as you may perceiue by the examination of euery Article of the said Charter. And whereas the same Charter did allow or suffer any thing that hath since that time beene thought to be ouer harde or sharpe: the same hath since againe beene mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, as you may here perceiue by those Statutes that haue beene made since that time: So gracious and mercifull haue the Noble Princes of this Realme beene towardes their louing Subiectes: So that now at this day, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the lawes of the Forest are of themselues verie mylde, gentle &amp; mercifull lawes towards the Subiects of this Realme, ouer that they haue beene in times past. Yet notwithstanding, we do at this present liue vnder the gouernement of so gratious and mercifull a Queene, that her clemencie in the execution of those lawes, is much more greater than the fauour &amp; cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of the Lawes themselues: VVhose long life, prosperous raigne, and most happie dayes, GOD of his mercifull goodnes grant long to continue, to the great comfort of all good Christian Subiectes. Amen.</p>
