   <head>THE PREFACE, VVHEREIN THE AVTOR DECLARETH HIS INTENTION IN THIS TREATISE, AND THE CAVSE why he wrote the same, and why the Apology concerning Edward Squyre being written three yeres since, was not published vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til now.</head>
   <p>IT is now more then three yeres, gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, since that one Edward Squyre,<note place="margin">Edvvard Squyre exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for a fayned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, and the author of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyse charge therevvith.</note> hauing bin sometyme prisoner in Spayne, and escaping thence into England, was condemned and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for a fayned conspiracy against her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestyes person, wherto my self &amp; some others were charged to be priuy; &amp; for as much as it seemed to mee that this fraudulent manner of our aduersaries proceeding against Catholykes, by way of slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and diffamations, authorised with shew of publik Iustice,<note place="margin">The reasons that moued the author to vvryte an Apology in his ovvne defence.</note> and continued now many yeres, did beginne to redound not only to the vndeserued disgrace, &amp; discredit of particular men wrongfully accused, but also to the dishonour of our whole cause, I thought it cōueniēt to write an Apology in my defēce, &amp; to dedicate the same to the Lords of her Maiesties priuy counsel, as wel to cleare my self to their honours of the cryme falsly imputed vnto mee, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to discouer vnto them the treacherous dealing of such as abuse her Maiesties autority and theirs in this behalf, to the spilling of much innocent blood, with no smalle blemish to her Maiesties go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and the assured exposition of the whole state, to the wrath of God, if it be not remedied in tyme.</p>
   <p>This Apology being written by me in Spayne,<note place="margin">The Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy stayd frō the print, in hope of some toleration of Catholyke religion in England.</note> and made ready for the print (now almost 3. yeres past) it seemed good as wel to
<pb facs="4"/>
me as to other of my friends, to stay the impression of it, vntil we should see the issue of the treaty of peace betwyxt England and Spayne then expected, with no smalle hope conceaued of many, that liberty of conscience, or at least some toleration of religion might ensue therof to the Catholikes of Englād, &amp; therfore seeing my principal intention was no other, but with the occasion of my owne purgation to seek remedy of the wrongs donne vnto vs, by discouering to the lords of the councel the vnchristian and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious proceeding of our cheef persecutors, it seemed to mee that yf the desyred effects of toleration, and consequently our remedy did follow of the treaty, the labour &amp; charges of printing my Apology should be needlesse.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Hope of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</note>And although after many moneths expectation, and the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the commissioners at Bullen, there appeared no lykely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood at all, eyther of peace betwyxt the two kingdomes, or tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Catholyke religion in Englād (in which respect it seemed conuenient to some that my apology should be published) yet for as much, as so long tyme was then ouer past, that the matter of Squyre seemed to bee forgot, and that therfore the defence of my innocency might eyther be to litle purpose, or at least seeme out of season, I resolued to suppresse the same,<note place="margin">Squyres mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter seemed to be forgot.</note> and the rather for that I vnderstood that howsoeuer some simple men might be deceaued in Squyres cause, yet the wysest considering the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and inualydity of the proofes, and his denial of the fact at his death, did take it for an inuention, and a stratageme of state,<note place="margin">Squyres mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter held by the vvyse for a stratagem of state.</note> conforme to dyuers other of like quality, which many wyse men amongst the protestātes themselues haue noted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>

E. and the other written very lately by a puritan, as it seemeth, calling himself Thomas Diggs, I haue determined to set out my apology for the ful satisfaction of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different men in this poynt;<note place="margin">The authors determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō to set out his Apology.</note> wherto I am moued the rather, for that I haue also sufficiently treated therin some other matters handled by O.

      </note> is iustly to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to their treasonable attēpts, besydes that he is not ashamed to
<pb n="2" facs="4"/>
affirme, that none haue bē put to death in all her maiestyes raigne for matter of religion, which impudent assertion of his, I haue so sufficiently confuted in my sayd apology, as no more needeth to be sayd in that matter.</p>
   <p>Neuertheles vpon this new occasion giuen by him, I haue thought good to prefix this treatise to thesaid Apology to giue thee good reader some more particular satisfaction concerning this point, and first to answere sincerely and truly vpon my owne knowlege an other slanderous and malitious conceit of his tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the il affection as he supposeth of diuers principal Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lykes to their country, and therefore for as much as I intend also, vpon occasions that may be offred, to debate and discusse in this treatise some pointes of Catholyke religion now in controuersy, and withal to cleare our doctrine in those pointes from certaine malitious slanders of our aduersaries, I haue thought good to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tytle the whole, <hi>A defence of the Catholyke cause.</hi> Wherein I make no doubt but that thow wilt easely note (good reader) amongst many other thinges, the inconsideration of our aduersaries in that they are not content only to wrong vs in our goodes and persons, by extreme iniustice vsed towards vs, but also to wound vs so deeply in our fame by their calumniatious and slanderous lybels, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes, that they force vs much against our willes to lay open to the world their shameful and vnchristian proceedings, in defence of our owne innocencie, and for the honor of our cause, which not only all lawes of God nature and nations do allow and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, but also conscience vrgeth and byndeth vs vnto in this case. For although priuate men may somtymes with great merit suffer themselues to be slaundered without contradiction, when no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der detrimēt ensueth thereof, then the losse of their owne fame or their particular hurt, yet when the same is ioyned, with other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes harme or with a publyke damage, espetialy of religion, they cannot without offence to God neglect or omit their owne iust defence. Therefore I hope no man wil blame mee or other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholykes in lyke case for offring iust purgation of our selues and our cause though it bee with the reproch of them that slander vs, <hi>vt obstruatur os loquentium iniqua,</hi> that the mouthes of calumniators may bee stopped.</p>
   <p>And whereas the same may seeme to redound to some disgrace or dishonor of the state by reason of the publyke authority &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of her maiesties seruice, wherewith our aduersaries do co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb facs="5"/>
couer and colour all their malitious actions, I purpose for my parte, to vse in this my defence, such due respect to the state &amp; to the supreme gouernours thereof (I meane her Maiestie and the honorable Lordes of her counsel) that I hope to auoyd all iust cause of offence; and giue ample testimony of the loyalty of a moste dutiful subiect discouering to her Maiestie and their honors by way of humble complaint, the great abuse offred by our aduersaries, no lesse to them, then to vs, as wil more particularly appeere in my Apologie directed and dedicated to the Lordes of the councel.</p>
