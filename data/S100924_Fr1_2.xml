   <head>To the Christian reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo severall treatises (good reader) have been formerly published by several men in answer to Mr Bernards book, yet have I thought it meet to adde a third, not as able to speak more then they, but intending something further: namely, an examination of the particulars one by one, that so in all points the salve might be answerable vnto the soare; applying my self therein to such a familiar and popular kinde of defence, as Mr B. hath chosen for his accusations, where the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer answers onely intended a summary discovery of the insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of his probabilities to disswade from, &amp; reasons to disprove the things he opposeth.</p>
   <p>The zeal Mr. B. manifesteth here and every where both in word and writing is exceeding great, as all men know. And surely fervent zeale in Gods cause is a temper wel befitting Gods servants: neyther is there any more bastardly disposition to be found in a Christian, then indifferency in religion. It makes no matter of what religion the man is that is indifferent in it: <hi>for Christ vvill spue out of his mouth</hi> (as loathsome) <hi>the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvarm,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 16.</note> whether wine, or water.</p>
   <p>Yet as the case of religion is most weighty, so is the affection of zeale in it most dangerous, if it be eyther pretended onely, &amp; not in truth; or preposterous and not according to knowledge.</p>
   <p>And therefore as there is singular vse of this fyery zeal for these frozen times of ours, so are we to take great heed that our fyre be kindled at the <note n="†" place="margin">Levit. 9. 24. 1 King. 18. 38.</note>
      <hi>fyre of the altar vvhich came from heavē.</hi> For as Luke. Act. 2. 23. speakes of <hi>fyery tongues vvhich came from heaven,</hi> so doth Iames, 3. 6. speak of <hi>a tongue vvhich is set on fyre of hell.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And this we are the more carefully to mynd, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
almost all men have taught theyr tongues in the generall to speak goodly words, and that zealously also for advantage, but more specially and with respect to the busines in hand, for that many of the weaker sort have theyr tender harts rather affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the truth of the Lord by the deep protestations and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations of their guids, then any way stablished in those perplexed pathes (wherein they walk) with them, by sound reasons.</p>
   <p>Now as the Lord is to be intreated for those people, that he would vouchsafe them wise and stable harts, that they may <note n="†" place="margin">

         </gap>1.</note>
      <hi>try all things and hold that vvhich is good,</hi> and neyther suffer themselves to be withheld nor withdrawn from the truth by any such semblances of zeale, or other passion, though never so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and seeming never so sincere, so for theyr better direction herein I have thought it not amisse to commend vnto their godly harts two or three considerations, by way of caution, in this case.</p>
   <p>First therefore it must be considered that there are some<note place="margin">I.</note> of that hoysterous and tempestuous disposition that they can doo nothing calmly or a litle, theyr vnruly affections which should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after leysurely do force on so violently theyr vnderstanding will, and whol man, as there is no stay with them, but in all their motions they are like vnto those beasts, which for the vnequall length of theyr hinder leggs cannot possibly goe but by leapes. Such a stormy nature, with a very litle zeal amongst, may make a great stir in the world, but is iustly to be suspected. And that especially (which is the 2. caution) in such men, as are suddaynly<note place="margin">II.</note> caryed, and as it were transformed from one contrary to another without eyther competent tyme or means. A suspitious course; for all thing ordinarily whither in grace, or nature, are wrought by degrees, and the passage from one extreme to another without due means, as it can hardly be sound, so can it not possibly be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suspected. Now ther are many men to be found which are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent in all things but constant in none. And though all things
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
be with thē as the figs in Ieremyes <note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. 2. 3. two baskets</note>
      <hi>tvvo baskets, the good very good and the evill very evill,</hi> yet are they ever shifting hands out of the one basket into the other. Today they will lift vp and advance a cause and person to heaven, and to morrow they will throw downe both it and him to the lowest hell. It is good to have such men in a godly iealousy, and there zeale with them. And that chiefly (which I desyre may be observed in the third<note place="margin">III.</note> place) when this theyr zeale rises and falls as the tymes serve. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all men will at tymes manifest zeal, but the most have this gift withall, that they wilbe sure to take the strongest syde, or that part at least, which hath some hope of prevayling. And so whylst there remaynes hope of bearing things over at the breast, they are very forward and fervent in there courses; but when that hope shaketh, theyr edg is of, and they turne theyr backs shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vpon the truth, yea and oft tymes theyr faces agaynst it.</p>
   <p>And herevpon it comes to passe that many (formerly great advauncers of the cause of reformation) have of late tymes not onely fouly forsaken, but violently opposed the same both in us and them also amongst themselves, which doe in any measure desyer it, publishing theyr books vnto the world so filled with empty words and swelling vanityes, as they not onely bewray the weaknes of theyr cause, but the evill and corrupt disposition of theyr hearts, as rather striving to manifest theyr servil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> affections for insinuations into the favours of the myghty; then to bring any thing of weight for the conviction of the adversary. The application of this I leave to the godly and wise reader, as he shall see iust cause.</p>
   <p>And so leaving those things which are more generall, I desyre in particular, and for the present purpose that the christian reader take knowledg of this one thing, that as the pretence of zeale in the forward Ministers against all corruptions is as a thick mist, holding the eyes of many wel mynded from seing the truth;
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
so the person with whom I now particularly deal, trusts to this insinuation above all others, conveyghing himself vnder this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour into the harts of the simple, and hereby making way most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, not onely for his sage-seeming <hi>counsels</hi> &amp; <hi>advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> for the quenching of their affections towards the truth: but also for his idle guesses and <hi>likelyhoods,</hi> with such perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall comparisons, and imputations, as wherewith his book is sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to alienate mens harts from it.</p>
   <p>But the godly reader is to consider that <note n="†" place="margin">Prov. 24. 23.</note>
      <hi>to accept the person in judgement is not good,</hi> especially in the cause of the Lord, and that <note n="*" place="margin">

            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>m. 2. 1.</note>
      <hi>the faith of our glorious Lord Iesus is not to be held in respect of persons:</hi> but that the naked and simple truth is to be inquired after, with an vnpartiall affection. And then the Lord which gives a single heart to seek after it, will give a wise hart to find it out. Math. 7. 7. Onely let men take heed they be not as Pilate, asking <note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 38</note>
      <hi>vvhat is truth?</hi> and turning their backs vpon it when they have done: nor having found it as Orpah did to Naomi, forsaking her weeping.<note place="margin">Ruth 1. 14.</note>
   </p>
   <p>And for my self as I could much rather have desired to have built vp my self and that poore stock over which the holy Ghost hath set me in holy peace, (as becōmeth the house of God, wherein <note n="†" place="margin">1 King. 6. 7</note>
      <hi>no sound of axe or hammer or other toole of iron is to be heard,</hi>) then thus to enter the lists of contention, so being iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called to contend for the defence of that truth vpon which this man amongst others layes violent hands, I will endeavour in all good conscience (as before God) so to free the same, as I wilbe nothing-lesse then contentious in contention, but wil count it a victorie to be overcome in odious provocations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches both by him and others.</p>
   <p>And so desiring as earnestly the Christian reader into whose hands this my defence shal come, to manifest vnto me such errours in the same (if by the word of God they may so be found) as to receive from me such truthes, as are therin cōt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>yned, I leave the due trial to that alone touchstone, &amp; cōmit the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the Lord who alone giveth wisdom, &amp; is able to make wise to salvatiō.</p>
