      <hi>because by the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vidence of God, the argument vvas treated of in your Honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. Secondly, for that your godly wisdome, and learning was therein v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with exhortations, councels, &amp; graue advertisements. Thirdly, because the doubts moved, were in writing exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to your own hands.</hi> Such like reasons as these prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that learned <hi>Austen,</hi> wherefore he writ his book to an Earle called <hi>Valerius,</hi> and the same partly in themselues, partly by his example, haue thus farre drawne me forward to this present businesse. VVhat acceptance it may haue I know not, my conscience is the touch-stone, &amp; to the glory of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter due examination, I finde it clearely abides triall. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort whereof (as touching my selfe) I passe very little to bee iudged of any, whose selfe-will is their set controuler.

      </gap>tion of sorrow shall be deepest, theirs, or mine, that either I haue writ amisse, or they mistake. VVell I am advised when God called me to speake in publike, which I did many houres in a cathedrall Church of good note, and expected by the audience to say farther in such points, as some made doubt of my labors returnd not altogether in vain. Satisfaction grew apace. so God wrought in weaknes, and by weake meanes. Since which time I haue beene dealt with by speciall good friends (whom I must regard) to waite the Lords leisure, and the operation of his gracious spirite, how it may worke more, when it hath more liberty to come abroad in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like view. VVhich if so it shall (and I rather wish it may not, specially in a scribling age as this is) pardon me that I seeke your Lordships favourable countenance. Your speciall loue to me ward, having a principall interest therein: for beside so many forcible inducements already mentioned, I professe my selfe particularly bound vnto your honour, since the Almighty wrought in your heart a good liking towards mee, by a generall report spred of my poore labours else-where in a well gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Cittie of good accompt. In which respect as since my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into your Diocesse, I haue great cause to giue praise, &amp; thankes to God &amp; shall much forget my duety, if I forget that taske of devotion. Heartily glad what others may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as due vnto God, without flattring of mens persons of your singular holy desire, you had to giue men satisfaction in their doubts, who privatly dissented frō the present state &amp; government of the Church. Many daies for a whole yeare, &amp; vpward spent by you for that purpose, and among the rest vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my knowledge <hi>3.</hi> daies togither imployed in godly, learned conferences: the first of the <hi>3</hi> from <hi>9.</hi> of the clocke in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to one in the afternoone, without any the least discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
