      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His worke of mine, which (if my hopes and desires faile mee not) time may hereafter make great, I haue presumed both to dedicate in whole to your Highnesse, and to parcell out in seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls vnto subordinate hands. It is no maruell if Bookes haue this freedome, when we our selues can and ought to be all yours, while we are our owne, and others vnder you. I dare say these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, how rude soeuer they may fall from my Pen, in regard of their subiect are fit for a Prince. Here your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse shall see how the great patterne of Princes, the KING of HEAVEN, hath euer ruled the World, how his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes, earthly Kings, haue ruled it vnder him, and with what successe either of glorie or ruine. Both your Peace
<pb n="804" facs="419"/> and Warre shall finde here holy and great examples. And if Historie and obseruation be the best Councellors of your youth; what storie can bee so wise and faithfull as that which God hath written for Men, wherein you see both what hath beene done, and what should be? VVhat obseruation so worthy as that which is both raised from God, and directed to him? If the proprietie which your Highnesse iustly hath in the VVorke, and Author, may draw your Princely eyes and heart the rather to these holy Speculations, your Seruant shall bee happier in this fauour, then in all your outward bountie; as one to whom your spirituall progresse deserues to bee dearer then his owne life; and whose daily suit is, that God would guide your steps aright in this slippery Age, and continue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce all good hearts in the view of your gratious procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
