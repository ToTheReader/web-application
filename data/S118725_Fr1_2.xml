   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S of all the blessinges that vve
receue here in earth there is
none that doth so liuely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Gods inward fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
man as cōuersion from
sinne, so truely there is none so dreadful a
signe of his heauy reuenge as falling from
fayth. Mark but the history of the people
of Israel and you shall finde that ther fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
frō the lawe of God, as it was the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test
sin which they cōmitted, so was it the
greatest plague that euer they had. Their
sickenes and pestilence was nothing, their
dearth and famine was nothing, the losse
that they endured by warre was nothing,
their captiuity and death was nothing in
comparison of reuolting from God, who
had chosen them for his people. This was
a plague of al plagues. Likewise if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of Gods benefites towards them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their deliueraunce out of the land of
Egipt, neither their safe conduct into the
land of promise, neither their well gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
common wealth, nor all the victories
obteyned ageinst their enemies may ons
<pb facs="4"/>
be compared with that, that it pleased him
to turne their hartes from sinne and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
to the trewe honoring of his name.
This was a blessing of al blessings. So that
in these two poyntes chiefly, is set foorth
vnto vs both Gods iustice and mercy. His
mercy in cōuerting vs from sinne, his ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
in leauing vs to our selues. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there are perilous examples of renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
and denying a professed treuth. The
tragicall histories of <hi>Frauncis Speyra</hi> and
<hi>Iudge Hales</hi> are able to make a christiā cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciēce
to tremble. No doubte it is cōmonly
sene (&amp; it is a iust plague) that who so with
his mouth belieth his conscience, the same
with his hand destroyeth him selfe. Here
I deny not but that God hath his secrete
working beyond the reason and capacitie
of man, as by the pitifull discourse of this
booke may easely appeare. This mans fal
was great, his fact was detestable, his mouth
blasphemous, his hart trayterous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious
to the blud of Christ: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
al this, did not God suffer him to
sincke down into the pitte of dispeire, but
did rayse him vp ageine by the operation
of his holy spirite. Vndoutedly this is a
<pb facs="4"/>
rare exaumple, like vnto the which many
haue not ben seene in the church of God.
Therfore I would wish all such as are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the testimony of the trewth, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
how grounding hereuppon, they do
tempt god in hope of the like fauour. Let
that hel and torment of conscience which
they do here plainely see in this man ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
thē likewise frō denying the trewth</p>
   <p>He was sometime one of the chief mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the reformed church in <hi>Orleance,</hi>
and because I knew him my self and haue
hard him preach ther sundry times, I was
the more willing at my frendes request to
putte his booke into english, hoping that
all Christen men will reioyce as much at
his penitent conuersion, as they haue cause
to be grieued at his reuolt. I doubt not but
there are that will scoffe at this matter and
saye that he can not be of a sounde religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that hath turned his coate so ofte. Of
what religion then are these our men, that
haue turned alwayes with the time? Let al
turners with tyme learne of this man to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turne
a right. It may be that some seke to
shew now a more stedfastnes in error then
in deed they haue▪ to gaine therby the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
<pb facs="5"/>
of constancy. But alas, it can not be
called constancy to abyde in euil, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
in Idolatry, to stick fast in ignorance.
This is obstinacy. They shall neuer be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of wauering that come out of <hi>Babel</hi>
to dwell in <hi>Sion.</hi> If this poore man had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
still in the waye of perdition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
Christes veritie, and betraying
of Christians to Romish wolues, oh, what
a heauy damnatiō had he procured to him
self: but God in his rich mercy hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prouided for this loste sheepe. Let
all those therefore which are touched in
harte with the care of gods trewth, and do
bewayle the ruinous decayes of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
iudge rightle hereof. To conclude we may
all see in this booke the liuely paterne of
a trewe remorse, here may we see how Saul
doeth become Paul. VVhy should not
the teares and mourning of Peter argue
and declare the conuersion of Peter? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what a worthi father of our time
(when he came to the Fyre to be brent)
did to his hand that had subscribed to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trewth.
The like maye wee hope of thys
man,<note place="margin">Cranmer</note> that when tyme shall serue, he vvill
make both hand and tongue, body &amp; life,
<pb facs="5"/>
yea and all that he hath to feele the smart
of that his deloyaulty. Therefore (good
Reader) be not hasty in condemning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but pray to God to strengthen thy
selfe that thou mayest not fall, and if thou
doe fall that thou mayest ryse agayne, to
the glorye of GOD, the edifying of hys
Church, and thyne owne saluation.</p>
