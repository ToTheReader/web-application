   <head>TO THE RIGHT honourable sir <hi>Thomas Egerton</hi> knight, Lord <hi>Keeper of the great seale</hi> of England, and one of her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties honour able priuie counsell, my</hi> very good Lord: health and <hi>prosperitie with increase of all</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall graces in this life, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall happinesse in the life to come.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING HAD through your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable bounty, a part of the Lords Vineyarde allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto mee his most vnwoorthy woorkeman, by your Honour his most woorthy steward, to the end I should plant and water, purge and prune it, I thought it my parte not onely to performe my dutie in this behalfe, in such measure as God
<pb facs="3"/> enableth me, but also to present vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your honour the first fruits of my labor which haue yet offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to publike view, to the end that I might thereby both shew my selfe not altogeather negligent in our great Lord and maisters busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and also giue some token of most obliged duty and humble thankefulnesse to you his honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble steward, by whose appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I haue obtained a place wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I may imploy my paynes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwise I should eyther haue stood idle in the market place, or els beene compelled to haue digged in another mans ground, with great labour &amp; little fruit. If these my first fruits seeme vnpleasant in your most learned and iudiciall taste, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impute it to the immaturitie caused by their short time of grouth and small-experienced skill of the vintager, or els consider that they
<pb facs="3"/> are destinated to a physicall vse for the purging away of choller, and therefore though they be not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in tast, yet may they be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in operatiō. Such as they are (in all humilitie, crauing pardon for my bouldnes) I cōmend them to your honourable patronage and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and your selfe to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, most hartily beseching the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and great Lord of the vinyard long to continue you his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full steward amongst vs, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his glory, the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of his vine, and the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding comfort of his poore contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned labourers.
