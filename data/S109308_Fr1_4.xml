   <head>TO My worthy Friend M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>William Davenant;</hi> upon his Poem of <hi>Madagascar,</hi> which he writ to the most Illustrions Prince RUPERT.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>I Am compell'd by your commands to write</l>
      <l>I'th Frontis-peece of this, and sure I might</l>
      <l>With quaint conceirs, here to the World set forth</l>
      <l>The merit of the Poem, and your worth;</l>
      <l>Had I well fancy'd reasons to begin▪</l>
      <l>And a choyce Mould, to cast good verses in:</l>
      <l>But wanting these, what pow'r (alas) have I</l>
      <l>To write of any thing? will men rely</l>
      <l>On my opinion? which in Verse, or Prose,</l>
      <l>Hath just that credit, which we give to those</l>
      <l>That sagely whisper, secrets of the Court,</l>
      <l>Having but <hi>Lees,</hi> for <hi>Essence,</hi> from Report.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="5"/>And that's the knowledge which belongs to mee;</l>
      <l>For by what's said, I guesse at Poetrie:</l>
      <l>As when I heare them read strong-lines, I cry</l>
      <l>Th'are rare, but cannot tell you rightly why:</l>
      <l>And now I finde this quality was it,</l>
      <l>That made some Poet eite mee for a wit:</l>
      <l>Now God forgive him for that huge mistake!</l>
      <l>If hee did know, but with what paines I make</l>
      <l>A Verse, hee▪ld pittie then my wretched case;</l>
      <l>For at the birth of each, I twist my Face,</l>
      <l>As if I drew a Tooth; I blot, and write,</l>
      <l>Then looke as pale, as some that goe to fight:</l>
      <l>With the whole Kennell of the Alphabet,</l>
      <l>I hunt sometimes an houre, one Rime to get:</l>
      <l>What I approv'd of once, I streight deny,</l>
      <l>Like an unconstant Prince, then give the lye</l>
      <l>To my owne invention, which is so poore,</l>
      <l>As here I'de kisse your hands, and say no more;</l>
      <l>Had I not seene a childe with Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ors cut,</l>
      <l>A folded Paper, unto which was put</l>
      <l>More chance, than skill, yet when you open it,</l>
      <l>You'd thinke it had beene done, by Art and Wit:</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="5"/>So I (perhaps) may light upon some straine,</l>
      <l>Which may in this your good opinion▪ gaine;</l>
      <l>And howsoever, if it be a plot,</l>
      <l>You may be certaine that in this, y'have got</l>
      <l>A foyle to set your Jewell off, which comes</l>
      <l>From <hi>Madagascar,</hi> scenting of rich gummes;</l>
      <l>Before the which, my lay conceits will smell,</l>
      <l>Like an abortive Chick, destroy'd i'th shell:</l>
      <l>Yet something I must say, may it prove fit;</l>
      <l>I'le doe the best I can; and this is it.</l>
      <l>What lofty fancie was't possest your braine,</l>
      <l>And caus'd you soare into so high a straine!</l>
      <l>Did all the Muses joyne, to make this Peece</l>
      <l>Excell what wee have had, from Romo, or Greece?</l>
      <l>Or did you strive, to leave it as a Friend</l>
      <l>To speake your prayses, when there is an end</l>
      <l>Of your mortalitie? If you did so,</l>
      <l>En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>y will then, scarce finde you out a Foe:</l>
      <l>But let me tell you (Friend) the heightning came,</l>
      <l>From the reflection of Prince <hi>Rupert's</hi> name;</l>
      <l>Whose glorious Genius cast into your soule,</l>
      <l>Divine conceits, such as are fit t'inroule,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="6"/>In great <hi>Apollo's</hi> court, there to remaine</l>
      <l>For future ages to transcribe againe:</l>
      <l>For such a Poem, in so sweet a stile,</l>
      <l>As yet, was never landed on this Isle:</l>
      <l>And could I speake your prayses at each <hi>Pore,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Twere little for the worke; it merits more.</l>
