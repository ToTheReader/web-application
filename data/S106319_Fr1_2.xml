   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable his singular good Lord, William Lord Cobham, L. warden of the Cinque ports, knight of the most noble order of the Garter, and one of her Maiesties most honourable priuie counsell: long continuance of health, with much increase of honour, and prosperitie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as being vnknowne to your good Lordship, otherwise than by report, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I haue tasted of your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and fauour, to my great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in my troubles, of the which vvhen God vvil I hope I shall be vvell discharged: I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my selfe more bound vnto your honour, than any seruice or abilitie of mine can extend vnto. And therefore to testifie my thankfull and dutifull mind towards you, I haue presumed to dedicate this my labour to your Lordship. And because it is a thing ingreffed by nature, special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in those that are of best and noblest dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to take delight in the hearing and reading of such things, as are most proper and incident to
<pb facs="3"/>
their owne callings, as whereof they haue best skill, &amp; wherein they most excel, &amp; therfore may most iustly chalenge to themselues the censure and iudgement of them: I persuade myself that this my presumption wil not be vnacceptable, or at leastwise will not seeme vntollerable, in the sight of your good Lordship, and of the residue of your most honorable sort &amp; calling, both for the matter, &amp; for the author therof. For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in substāce, is the due administration of state, and chiefly of a kingdom both in peace &amp; war, at home and abrode: on the one side through the politike and vertuous gouernment of the partie that holds the scepter of soueraigntie, with the loiall linking in of his magistrates and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers vnder him: and on the otherside through the seruiceable, willing, and faithfull obedience of those whom God hath put in subiection to him: a matter, as of verie great importance and behoofe, so also greatlie beseeming those whom GOD hath set in authoritie. For of all the states and degrees which GOD hath ordeined for the well maintaining of this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life, like as in highnesse of dignitie and honour, and woorthinesse of preheminence, none is comparable to the state of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, specially which is well and orderlie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed: so of all the formes of gouernment
<pb facs="3"/>
that haue beene in the world, the Monarchie or Kingdome hath euer (as well by common and continuall experience, as also by the grounded iudgement of the best practised politicians, and by the graue censure of the wisest men, yea and euen by the ordinance &amp; approbation of God) bin alwaies deemed and found to be most anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and sufficient, most beneficial and behoofful, most magnificent and honourable, most stable and durable, and consequently most happie and commendable; as vvhich (besides many other most excellent prerogatiues which I omit here) doth most resemble the highest soueraigntie of God, the onely one vniversall Monarch of the whole world, and is most agreeable to the first originall patterne of souereigntie on earth, I meane <hi>Adam,</hi> whom God created but one, to haue the dominion and lordship of all creatures vnder the cope of heauē. The which being iustly forgone by that first mans disobedience, God thought good in his wisdom to repair and set vp againe much more large and magnificent than afore, in the person of one other man, namely of our Lord Iesus Christ, whom he hath made heir of all things, giuing vnto him all power both in heauen and earth, to reigne in glory euerlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly world without end. Who whē he was to come into the world, in the last temporall Monarchie
<pb facs="4"/>
of the world, did thus much further beautifie and commend the state of Monarchie by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, in that he vouchsafed not to come, afore such time as the state of Rome was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Monarchie, and setled in the gouernment of one sole soueraigne. Such and so excellent is the matter whereof this booke doth treat. The which was written in French by one <hi>Iaques Hurault,</hi> lord of Vieul and Marrais, an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable personage, and (as may wel appeare by his handling of the matters here treated of) of great learning, iudgement, experience, and policie. Who for his prudence, grauitie, and loialtie, was admitted to be of the priuie counsell to his soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne lord and master the French king. Wherby he had fit occasion and meanes, to see into the states and forms of gouernmēt, as well of forrein countries, as of his owne, and therefore might be the better able to discerne the truth of things, and to deliuer his censure the more soundlie, concerning the managing of publike affaires and matters of state.</p>
   <p>But now to come home out of Fraunce into England, and to applie the case more particularlie to our selues: I am fullie resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that if wee list to looke vpon things with right iudging eyes, and to consider them with well aduised minds, we shall plainlie see
<pb facs="4"/>
there was neuer anie nation vnder the sunne, more bound to yeeld immortall thanks vnto God for their state, Prince, and soueraigne, than we be for ours; or to magnifie him more for the innumerable benefits receyued by that means, than we be. For first our state is that state which is most iustly deemed the best and most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, namely a Monarchie or kingdome, wherein one sole souereigne assisted with a most graue Senat of prudent and sage counsailors, reigneth by wisedome, and not by will, by law and not by lust, by loue and not by lordlinesse. And vnlesse we will denie the thing which the world seeth and gladly honoureth, and which we our selues haue continually found and felt in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence now by the space of xxxvi years and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to our inestimable good and comfort: we must needs confesse that God hath giuen vs a prince, in whose sacred person (to speake the truth in as few words as so great a matter may permit) there wanteth not anie heroicall vertue or gift of grace, that may beseeme or adorne the maiestie of a kingdome, the which thing is so much the more glorious and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in her highnesse being both a woman and a virgin. By whose means God hath also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored vnto vs the bright shining beames of his most holie Gospell, late afore eclipsed
<pb facs="5"/>
with the foggie clouds of superstitious ignorāce and humane traditions, and the true ancient and catholike religion, borne down and in maner o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed with the terrible stormes of cruell persecutions: a benefit wherunto none other can be comparable in this world. Of the which reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion her Maiestie hath continually shewed her self, not a bare professor, but a most earnest and zealous follower, and a most lightsome example to her subiects: directing al her studies, counsels and proceedings, to the setting forth of Gods glorie, as well by aduauncing and maintaining the same religiō vncorrupted; as also by her most prouident &amp; motherly gouerning of hir people with all iustice &amp; clemencie, to their greatest trā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie benefit and welfare. Wherupon hath also ensued Gods most mightie and miraculous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of her mastiesties most roiall person, her realms dominions and subiects, from exceeding great perils, both forreine, ciuil and domesticall, such and so fitly contriued by the sleights of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan &amp; satanicall practisers, as but by the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and extraordinarie working of the diuine prouidence, could not haue beene found out, and much lesse preuented, auoided or escaped: an assured token of Gods speciall loue and fauor towards both soueraigne and subiects. To be short, so many and so great are the benefites
<pb facs="5"/>
which we haue receiued and still receiue, by and from our most gracious soueraigue lady Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that I know not how to conclude her Maiesties most iust deserued commendation, more fitly than with the verses of a certaine aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poet, written long since in commendation of that renowmed prince of Britaine the noble king <hi>Arthur,</hi> the which verses I haue put into English, with small alteration of some words, but no alteration at all in matter and sense, after this maner:
<q>
         <l>Hir deeds with mazeful wōderment shine euerywher so bright,</l>
         <l>That both to heare and speak of thē, men take as great delight,</l>
         <l>As for to tast of honycombe or honie. Looke vpon</l>
         <l>The doings of the noblest wights that heretofore be gone.</l>
         <l>
            <note n="†" place="margin">Alexander <hi>the great.</hi>
            </note>The Pellan Monarch fame cōmends: the Romās highly praise</l>
         <l>The triumphs of their emperors. Great glory diuerse waies</l>
         <l>Is yeelded vnto Hercules for killing with his hand</l>
         <l>The monsters that anoid the world, or did against him stand.</l>
         <l>But neither may the Hazel match the Pine, nor stars the sun.</l>
         <l>The ancient stories both of Greeks and Latins ouerrun:</l>
         <l>And of our Queene Elizabeth ye shall not find the peere,</l>
         <l>Ne age to come will any yeeld that shall to her come neere.</l>
         <l>Alone all princes she surmounts in former ages past,</l>
         <l>And better none the world shall yeeld, so long as time doth last.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>What remaineth then, but that all we her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue subiects, knitting our selues togither in one dutifull mind, do willingly and chearfully yeeld
<pb facs="6"/>
our obedience to her gratious maiestie with all submission faithfulnes and loialtie, not grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging or repining when any things mislike vs, but alwaies interpreting all things to the best; not curiously inquisitiue of the causes of hir will, but forward and diligent in executing her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, euen as in the sight of God, not for feare of punishment, but of verie loue and conscience. Which things if we doe vnfeinedlie, then no doubt but God continuing his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous goodnesse still towards vs, will giue vs dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more cause of praise and thanksgiuing, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying her maiesties yeares in health and peace, and increasing the honour and prosperitie of her reigne, so as our posteritie also may with ioy see and serue her manie yeares hence still reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning most blessedly: which are the things that all faithfull subiects doe and ought to reioice in and desire, more than their owne life and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and for the which we ought with all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnes to make continuall praier and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto God. But while I am caried with the streame of my desire, to encourage my selfe and my countreymen to the performance of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards her maiestie, wherein neuerthelesse I haue ben much breefer than the matter requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: I feare least I become more long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than may beseeme the tenour of an epistle
<pb facs="6"/>
dedicatorie. And therefore most humbly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting my selfe and this my present translation to your honourable censure and acceptation, I here make an end, beseeching God, greatly to increase and long to continue the honor and prosperitie of your good Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and of your noble house.</p>
