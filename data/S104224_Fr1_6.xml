   <head>BARTON HOLYDAY, to BEN JONSON.</head>
   <lg>
      <head>EPODE.</head>
      <l>TIs dangerous to praise; besides the taske,</l>
      <l>Which to do't well, will aske</l>
      <l>An age of time and judgement; who can then</l>
      <l>Be prais'd, and by what pen?</l>
      <l>Yet, I know both, whilst thee I safely chuse</l>
      <l>My subject, and my Muse.</l>
      <l>For sure, henceforth our Poets shall implore</l>
      <l>Thy aid, which lends them more,</l>
      <l>Then can their tyr'd <hi>Apollo,</hi> or the nine</l>
      <l>She wits, or mighty wine.</l>
      <l>These Deities are banquerupts, and must be</l>
      <l>Glad to beg art of thee.</l>
      <l>Some they might once perchance on thee bestow:</l>
      <l>But, now, to thee they owe:</l>
      <l>Who dost in daily bounty more wit spend,</l>
      <l>Then they could ever lend.</l>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <l>Thus thou, didst build the globe, which, but for thee,</l>
      <l>Should want its Axle-tree:</l>
      <l>And, like a carefull founder, thou dost now</l>
      <l>Leave Rules for ever, how</l>
      <l>To keep't in reparations, which will doe</l>
      <l>More good, than to build two.</l>
      <l>It was an able stock, thou gav'st before;</l>
      <l>Yet, loe, a richer store!</l>
      <l>Which doth, by a prevention, make us quit</l>
      <l>With a deare yeare of wit:</l>
      <l>Come when it will, by this thy name shall last</l>
      <l>Untill Fames utmost blast.</l>
      <l>Thou art a wealthy Epigram, which spends</l>
      <l>Most vigour when it ends.</l>
      <l>This ful <hi>Epiphonema</hi> of thy best</l>
      <l>Wit, out-speaks all the rest.</l>
      <l>Me thinkes, I see our after Nephewes gaze,</l>
      <l>And all their time to praise</l>
      <l>Is taken up in wonder; whilst they see</l>
      <l>Ages of wit, in thee</l>
      <l>Collected, and well judg'd: <hi>Charons</hi> stout heart</l>
      <l>Feeles thy new power of Art,</l>
      <l>And, his obedient armes labour amaine,</l>
      <l>Whilst he wafts back againe</l>
      <l>What Poets shadow, thou dost please to call</l>
      <l>To this thy judgement hall:</l>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <l>Whiles, at these frightning Sessions, thou dost fit,</l>
      <l>The searching Judge of wit,</l>
      <l>O how the Ghosts do shuffle one behind</l>
      <l>Another, left thou find</l>
      <l>Them, and their errours: but, in vaine, they flie</l>
      <l>Thy persecuting eye.</l>
      <l>Bold <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> shrewd whotfon, now</l>
      <l>More feares thy threatning brow,</l>
      <l>Then his owne guilt of libelling, and prayes</l>
      <l>He may new write his playes.</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Plautus</hi> so quakes, that he had rather still</l>
      <l>Grind on in his old mill.</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Terence</hi> would borrow his owne Eunuchs shape,</l>
      <l>By the disguise to scape.</l>
      <l>The Greek Tragoedians droop, as if they plaid</l>
      <l>The persons whom they made:</l>
      <l>Fearing thou'lt bid them adde with more expence</l>
      <l>Of braine, wit to their sence:</l>
      <l>Or whilst their murdered wits thou maist contemne.</l>
      <l>Write Tragoedies of them.</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Seneca,</hi> would with <hi>Hercules</hi> be glad</l>
      <l>To scape, by running mad:</l>
      <l>Or at the least, he feares as lesse a hurt,</l>
      <l>To weare his burning shirt.</l>
      <l>They'd all take care, and if thy <hi>Flaccus</hi> too</l>
      <l>Writ now, he'd write all new.</l>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <l>Yet all at once confesse <hi>Flaccus</hi> doe's well,</l>
      <l>But thou makst him excell.</l>
      <l>The Morning Sunne viewing a silver stream,</l>
      <l>So guilds it with his beame.</l>
      <l>Master of Art, and Fame! who here makst knowne</l>
      <l>To all, how all thine owne</l>
      <l>Well-bodied works were fram'd, whilst here we see</l>
      <l>Their fine Anatomee.</l>
      <l>Each nerve and vaine of Art, each slender string,</l>
      <l>Thou to our eye dost bring:</l>
      <l>Thus, what thou didst before so well collect,</l>
      <l>Thou dost as well dissect.</l>
      <l>For which skill, Poëms now thy censure waie,</l>
      <l>And thence receive their Fate.</l>
      <l>Thou needst not seek for thē, to thee they're brought,</l>
      <l>And so held good, or nought.</l>
      <l>Thus, doth the eye disdaine, with an extreame</l>
      <l>Scorne to send forth a beame:</l>
      <l>But scaly formes from the glad object flow</l>
      <l>By which the eye doth know</l>
      <l>Its subtle image: thus the eye keeps state,</l>
      <l>Thus doth the object wait.</l>
      <l>But here, at this, perchance some one stands by,</l>
      <l>and drawes his mouth awry;</l>
      <l>As if his mouth (his mouth he doth so teare)</l>
      <l>Would whisper in his eare;</l>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <l>When thy soft pitty, if it see his spight,</l>
      <l>But saies, set your mouth right.</l>
      <l>Yet in mild truth, this worke hath some defect,</l>
      <l>As now I dare object:</l>
      <l>Thou err'st against a workmans rarest part,</l>
      <l>Which is to hide his Art.</l>
      <l>Next, all thy rules fall short, since none can teach</l>
      <l>A verse, thy worth to reach.</l>
      <l>For which, Ile now judge thee: know thy estate</l>
      <l>Of wit must beare this fate:</l>
      <l>Till <hi>Ionson</hi> teach some Muse a straine yet new,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Ionson</hi> shall want his due,</l>
