   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing but two mites with the poor widdowe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to cast into your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, euen the seruice of the body and the minde, and the whole man, a tribute that of duety is due vnto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: seeing I am iustly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with this oblation, I hope your Honour will acquite mee
<pb facs="3"/>of presumption, both vse and liuely feeling, giuing mee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: vse wyth every tenant to pay his Landlord rent, and sensible feelyng of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships bounty, iustly extorting this as my bounden duty. Our Lorde forbid, that we receiue a benefit, as a beast his dyet, and neuer respect and beholde the founder of it. My master Christ,<note place="margin">Iohn 6</note> who commanded the fragments of a benefit bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon an hungry people, to be gathered vp in baskets: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth thereby, that the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest benefit that is done vpon
<pb facs="3"/>vs, should not be forgotten. Hauing therefore so deepely dyued into your Lordshippes debt, how can I not but drawe from as deep thoughts, as euer any water was drawne from <hi>Iacobs</hi> well, the memoriall of your goodnes.<note place="margin">Iohn 4</note> Since it pleased your Honor by the ryght wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull sir <hi>Hierome Bowes</hi> Knight, the onely worldely arch, and supporter of my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, to take sight of my poore person, and honourable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration of my afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dition. If I make no relation of your Honors most christian
<pb facs="4"/>clemencie when J drewe my breath but faintly, how I had recouery, and regained free recourse to my woonted study: If I rip not vp the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of your zealous fauors, J doe but as Salomon wyth the brasse in the Temple, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was so massie, hee would not stand to weigh it: or as Portius Latro who engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his minde, that which others ingrossed in a booke.</p>
   <p>This pretious pearle of the worde of God, which shineth, which way soeuer you turne it, and flieth vnto all, I haue
<pb facs="4"/>wrapped vp in this little ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, and fastned it vnto your Honors vertuous name, as vnto a ribband and golden Chayne that will keepe it the better. Your Lordship haue alwayes worne it about you, and haue bound it as a Signet vnto your hand, and with the faithful Congregation of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losse haue suffered it aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to dwell in your heart: whenas with most worldlings, Gods worde, as the Leuite that went to Gibea wandreth in the streetes, and haue but slender entertainement
<pb facs="5"/>among men. I encourage my selfe, that GOD will geue a blessing to these labours, that the argument it self wil draw heartes vnto it: and you my Honorable Patrone will be a sufficient protection to my per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son. God almighty euery way prosper your Honour, double your honour and dayes among vs, and giue you all honor in his heauenly kingdome.</p>
