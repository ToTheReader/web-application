      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Fewe dayes after the
late Duke of Guyse
was hurt sodainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the towne of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,
the .xiiij. daye of
Februarye laste past
there rose a bruyte and rumour, that
one called Merey had done the deede
at the suggestion of the Lord Admirall
which was then and is yet at Caen in
Normandy Lieutenant in the kynges
army vnder the charge of the prynce of
Conde. Whereat the sayd Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
was not muche moued, for as
muche as he thought that this slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(as many other) woulde vanishe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of it selfe. But since by the solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a certain man called La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette,
maister of the campe of the light
horsemen vnder the sayde Duke of
Guyse, goyng aboute to disvnite the
Almaines, and to put the Amirals ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
into an vprore and trouble: a copie
<pb facs="3"/>
of the confession beynge caste abrode
in the sayd army, ascribed vnto one cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
Iohn de Poltrot, naming himselfe
Senior of Merey, &amp; signed by the hand
of one called Maluaut, Scriuener or
Notarie: by the which it appeareth that
the said Poltrot being examined by the
quene mother in persone, &amp; in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of certaine lords of the counsell, &amp;
knightes of the order of the kings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
dyd greatly charge the said Lorde
admyrall, &amp; certayne other Lords, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
certayne Ministers of the worde of
God, to haue induced &amp; allured by
wordes &amp; money the saide Poltrot to
that which is abouesayde. The sayde
Lorde admyrall hauyng respect &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the trouth &amp; to his honour, can
not attribute such an inuented accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ene<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ies of the rest &amp; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes
of this realme, cōtinuing in their
wicked wil &amp; purpose, which is wholly
to ouerthrow &amp; destroye the said Lorde
admyrall with all those that professe
the gospell bringing them into hatred
<pb facs="3"/>
to all the worlde by such craftes &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises:
whervnto he meaneth spedely to
seeke a remedye. And for this cause not
regarding the subtelties &amp; deceytes of
the aforesaid enemies, but trusting in
God &amp; in his own good conscience hath
not stickt to publishe the sayd confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
word for word, adioyning therevnto
his answeres vppon euery article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
therein. Protesting before god,
to answere it before all Iudges in chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
that be not suspected, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
&amp; offering him self to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his innocencie in all sortes &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
reasonable &amp; meete in the place &amp;
degree that he hath in this realme: to
thentent that suche calumnie &amp; slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
being discouered, &amp; the trouth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng
vanquished lyes, the faultye and
culpable maye be punished, as
the déede shall require.
