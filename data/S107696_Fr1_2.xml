   <opener>
      <salute>Right Honourable, my very singular good Lord;</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing incouraged by your Lordships fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptation of some small Labours of mine, heretofore presented vnto your Honour, I presume to offer vp these few, but important and chiefe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Religion vnto your Lordships farther consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as they are maintained and explained by Primitiue Fathers, knowne Papists, and ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts, a threefold corde, which, in my coniecture, cannot easily be broken.</p>
   <p>As concerning the Manuscripts, they are ancient, but not many; innominable as yet, but not long so to
<pb facs="3"/>
continue, if their names can bee redeemed by any▪ meanes; and y t they cannot well be excepted against by the common Aduersarie, being written long before <hi>Luther, Hus, VVicklife,</hi> or <hi>VVal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>o,</hi> as the Character plainely sheweth. And if they were not old enough, it would be easie for me to euicl the true Antiquitie of our Religion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ut of that great Treasure of Bookes, amas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed together by that iudicious Knight, Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> the truest <hi>Philobiblos</hi> of our Age in his kind. For the Papists, whose words and workes are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten cited by me, though the Papists would seeme to elude their testimonies, or expunge their Sentences in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>r vnsufferable and vnwarrantable thrise-accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Indices Expurgatorij;</hi> yet they speake fully and home for the truth of ours, and the falshood and nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisme of their Religion: and doe the Papists what they can, as what hath not been done by their close Indices? Yet all the water in the maine Ocean will neuer be able to wish their testimonies out of our Bookes: Ours I call them, because though bred and brought vp in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of their Romane Church, they are but seeming Papists, so called, as <hi>Montes</hi> are <hi>a non mouendo,</hi> or <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>rcendo,</hi> being easily mooued to take part with vs, and if need were, to defend and subscribe vnto the Articles of our Religion, so vniformely, so Catholikely agreed vpon by the Prelates of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the yeare 1562.</p>
   <p>Lastly, for the Fathers, whom they would faine make Partiaries, and defenders of their new and vpstart opinions; it is not to bee marueiled, when they haue squeazed out the iuyce of their Bookes, Text, or Glosse, pared them to their purposes, and purged them to their
<pb facs="3"/>
minds, or fancies rather: For if they also chance to erre, or mis▪speake in their iudgements (as the best haue failed sometimes, and in some things) they haue a <hi>del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>antur</hi> for them also; they shall be no longer Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but Sonnes, and therefore subiect to their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and in plaine tearmes, purgeable, as <hi>Gretser</hi> the Iesuite hath long since from <hi>Ingolstad</hi> aduertised vs. But let them leaue the Fathers of the purer Ages, in <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> without mixture or mutation of theirs, pure and sincere; and wee doubt not, but the truth of our Religion will as clearely appeare, as the Sunne shine at mid-day, which I shall beleeue, till I shall see a round and plenarie Refutation of the defence of <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ewels</hi> Apologie, which was threatned to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the late Councell of Trent, and our Countriman Master <hi>Harding,</hi> hath challenged it here and there of some mis-quotations, which the learned Bishop doth confesse most ingenuously, and retort the like, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter escapes vpon the Challenger: but wilfull, or purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed corruptions, <hi>id{que} cum authoritate</hi> (such as theirs are) he cannot, he shall not find in him, nor any of his supposts.</p>
   <p>This small Worke of mine, Right Honourable, such as it is (and better it had been, if due encouragement, health, and meanes had not fayled me) I willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vnto your iudicious Fatherhood and graue wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hoping some small good may accrew thereby vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my deere Mother, the Church of England, a sound member and obedient child whereof, I professe my selfe to be, farre from Poperie, and farther distant (if farther may be) from all itching, vpstart, Schismaticall humor, going the Kings High-way, and fighting as others haue
<pb facs="4"/>
done before me <hi>contra Dextrarios &amp; sinistrarios.</hi> I haue better learned my Religion out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others, that the first Religion is the best; and that the higher we steppe, the neerer we approach vnto the truth. And if this small attempt of mine, graced by your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Patronage, shall but worke in my poore sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Countrymen and Compatriots, a true loue of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and detestation of all Popish corruptions, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
