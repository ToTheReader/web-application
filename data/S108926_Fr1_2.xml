   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER, GRACE AND PEACE in Christ Iesu.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LBEIT the reading of the Scripture it selfe, and the simple text thereof without further helpes, hath matter enough to giue intelligence and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sufficient for the soule of mā to saluation, if with hart and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence it be earnestly applyed and followed, as it should: yet notwithstanding the helpe of good cōmentaries &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications annexed withall, especially such as be learned and godly, is not hurtfull, but rather is much requisite, &amp; greatly needefull, both for opening of places of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for dissoluing doubtes, and debating of controuersies, such as may and vse many times to happen. Wherefore most highly bound we are to the goodnes of our Lorde and Sauiour, who hath herein so well prouided for our infirmitie, in blessing this time of ours so plentifully with so many learned writers and worthy workers in his word. As in al times he hath done, but most chiefly in this time of ours is now to be seene. In which time as we haue to giue thankes for many other of late memorie famous &amp; singular instruments of Christes glory, so namely for the author &amp; compiler of this present work, Martin Luther. VVho although of many hitherto either hath not beene redde, and so not throughly knowne, or of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="3"/>
hated and maligned, or of some lightly regarded, or peraduenture misiudged: Yet to such as either haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly redd him, or shall be disposed to take trial of him, hauing by experience of infirmities and affliction any skill to iudge of true diuinitie, shall be founde emonges many preachers &amp; teachers of this our time, most chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly worthie, not onely of iust commendation, but also to be compared with the chiefest: yea and so necessary for these times of the Church to be seene and redde, that the poore mourning soules of the afflicted can not well want him, &amp; that for diuers purposes, especially for two principall causes.</p>
   <p>First for true comfort &amp; spiritual consolation to such weake minds as in cases of conscience are distressed, and wrastle in faith against the terrour of Satan, of death, of damnation, against the power of the lawe, and wrath of God, wherein I see very fewe or none (without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be it spoken) in these our daies to instruct more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with like feeling and experience.</p>
   <p>Secondly for discerning and discussing the difference betwene the law and the Gospell, how these two partes are to be separated, and distincted a sonder as repugnant and contrary, and yet notwithstanding howe they both stand togither in Scripture and doctrine, and yet in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine no repugnance. The knowledge whereof how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite it is for all Christians to learne the miserable lack thereof will soone declare. For where these two be not rightly parted, but confounded, what can followe there but confusion of conscience, either leading to despaire, or else to blind securitie, without any order in doctrine, or true comfort of saluation. As by examples of time is soone seene, namely if we loke into the later times of the Romish Church, where for want of right distinguishing betwene these two, great errors haue risen, and no great
<pb facs="3"/>
maruel. For where the Gospell is taken for the lawe, and the lawe for the Gospel, and Christ receaued but onely for a law giuer: and where things go by workes and lawe of deseruing, what hope or assurance of saluation can be there, considering our workes in their best kind to be so imperfect and vnprofitable? And what shall be said then of our naughtie workes? but especially▪ what shall be said then to the mourning &amp; lamenting sinner, who fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no good thing dwelling in him, but all wickednes? shall he then despaire, or how else will ye comfort him? For if Christ in his principall office be but a teacher of the lawe and of workes, and that be the chiefest thing to be required in a Christian, to worke saluation by the law of working: where is then grace, mercie, promise, faith iustifying, peace &amp; rest of conscience, redemption from malediction of the law, if we be vnder the law still? brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly, where is the new couenāt of God made by his sonne, if the olde couenant made by Moses doe yet remaine? if it do not remaine, then must there needs be a differēce betwene the law &amp; the gospel: betwene the old Testamēt &amp; the new: betwene the law of works &amp; the law of faith: betwene Moses &amp; Christ, betwene the master &amp; the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt: betwene Agar and Sara, and their two children. Now what difference this is, thou shalt not neede, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian reader, by me to be instructed, hauing here the boke of Martin Luther to reade and peruse. VVho as in his former treatise before set forth vppon the Epistle to the Galathians, so likewise in these his commentaries vppon the Psalmes, doth so liuely &amp; at large discourse that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with many other things moe, full of heauenly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; edificatiō, that hauing him, though thou hadst no other expositour vpon the holy Scripture, thou maist haue almost sufficient to make a perfect souldier against all the fierie darts of the tempting enemie. Againe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="4"/>
all other, and lacking this writer, thou shouldest yet want some thing to the perfect practise and experience of a Christian diuine. Although I neede not in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of this treatise vse any suche commendation, the booke being able sufficiently to commende it selfe: yet thus much by way of preface I thought good to notifie and premonish, whereby I might the rather animate and encourage thy studious diligence, good reader, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reade this booke. Wherin if it shall please thee to bestow the labour, as the paine, I trust, will not be tedious, so in the profite thereof I doubt not, but thy labour shall be recompensed with no lesse spirituall consolation to thy soules health, then the godly translator thereof M. Bull did receaue in translating of the same. Who as he once made his vow vnto the Lord for certeine causes, to turne this booke from latine into english, so with no lesse fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie did well performe the same. Blessed be the Lorde therefore, which both put him in mind first to take this worke in hand, and also graunted him life to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment thereof: for so it pleased the Lord to continue his life so long, till this vowed worke was fully finished. And not onely that, but also after his trauell taken, gaue him to receaue such sweetenes thereby, as in neuer thing more in all his life. Now from him departed to turne to you that remaine aliue, I meane all studious readers, as we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> thē that be wel willers to the gospel, as also that be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, &amp; yet not called to the truth: both which sortes I haue here in few words to exhort, &amp; to desire: first, such as haue mind to heare &amp; reade the doctrine of truth, that they in life will follow that they heare and reade: Of the other companie this I haue to craue, that for as much as the gracious goodnes of the Lord hath raysed vp before their face such plenty of preachers, teachers, writers, and translators, wherby by all meanes to call them, and to do
<pb facs="4"/>
them good: they wisely againe for their partes wil consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what they haue to do: that is, to take the time before them, &amp; not to refuse the riches of Gods great grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, least peraduenture hereafter ignorance wil not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them, wheras now the light of truth so euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, wittingly and willingly they stoppe their eyes from seeing, &amp; their eares from hearing. The Lord God of peace &amp; father of all mercy &amp; consolation for Christ Iesus his Sonnes sake, open our hartes and senses, that all preiudice &amp; pertinacie set aside, we may both be willing to learne the right way of perfect faith and truth: and no lesse carefull in life to follow that we learne, growing vp in grace and knowledge more and more, till we atteyne at length to the full measure, which is in Christ Iesu our Lord, Amen.</p>
