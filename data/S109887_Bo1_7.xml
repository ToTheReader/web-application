   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>SEeing these Epistles are now to the world made publique, it
is imagined that I ought to bee accountable of my priuate
meaning, cheefely for mine owne discharge, least beeing
misttaken, I fall in hazard of a iust and vniuersall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
for.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Hae nugae feria ducent</l>
      <l>In mala derisum semel exceptumque sinistre.</l>
   </q>
   <p>Three poynts are especially therefore to be explained. First,
why I entitle this worke <hi>Englands heriocall Epistles;</hi> thē why
I obserue not the persons dignitie in the dedication; lastly, why
I haue annexed notes to euery Epistles end. For the first, the title
I hope carrieth reason in it selfe, for that the most and greatest
persons herein were English, or else, that theyr loues were obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in England. And though (heriocall) be properly vnderstood
of demi-gods, as of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>AEneas,</hi> whose parents were
said to be the one celestiall, the other mortall, yet is it also trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to them, who for the greatnes of mind come neere to Gods.
For to be borne of a celestiall <hi>Incubus,</hi> is nothing else but to haue
a great and mightie spirit, farre aboue the earthly weakenesse of
men, in which sence <hi>Ouid</hi> (whose imitator I partly professe to
be) doth also vse heroicall. For the second, seeing none to whom
I haue dedicated any two Epistles, but haue theyr states ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched
by them who are made to speake in the Epistles, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the order is in dedication, yet in respect of their degrees in my
deuotion, and the cause before recited, I hope they suffer no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement,
seeing euery one is the first in theyr particuler inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
<pb facs="83"/>
hauing in some sort, sorted the complexion of the Epistles,
to the character of theyr iudgements to whom I dedicate thē, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
onely the blamefulnesse of the persons passion, in those
poynts wherein the passion is blamefull. Lastly, such manifest
difference being betwixt euery one of them, where or howsoeuer
they be marshalled, how can I be iustly appeached of vnaduise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For the third, because the worke might in truth be iudged
brainish, if nothing but amorous humor were handled therein, I
haue enter wouen matters historicall, which vnexplaned, might
defraud the minde of much content, as for example, in Queene
<hi>Margarites</hi> Epistle to <hi>VVilliam dela Pole,</hi>
   </p>
   <p>My Daizie flower, which once perfum'd the ayre,</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Margarite</hi> in French signifies a Daizie, which for the allusion
to her name, this Queene did giue for her deuise; and this as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more, haue seemed to me not vnworthy the explaning.</p>
   <p>Now, though no doubt I had neede to excuse other thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
yet these most especially, the rest I ouerpasse to eschue tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
recitall, or to speake as malicious enuy may, for that in truth
I ouersee them. If they be as harmlesly taken as I meant them, it
shall suffice to haue onely t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uched the cause of the title of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications,
and of the notes, whereby emboldned to publish the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue,
(these not beeing accounted in mens opinions relishlesse) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
shall not lastly be afrayd to beleeue and acknowledge thee a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
