      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader, I here present vnto thee in a later seruice, that which deserued a fitter place in another Worke; and which I had sought with much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie before, without successe. I am ashamed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> againe to tell thee with what little effect my Russian labours for Intelligence were seconded: but since my <hi>PILGRIMES</hi> published, Sir <hi>Ierome Horseys</hi> kindnesse offered me (without seeking) better Intelligence then any others could haue giuen; for the times of <hi>Iuan</hi> and <hi>Feodore,</hi> with the politike prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of <hi>Boris</hi> vnto the Muscouian Empire: a Story whereof I was so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> much more desirous, to publish, because our Age (if euer so short a time in any Age or any State) can hardly parallel the like practises of humane Policies, to couetous, cruell, ambitious ends, ended in the Authours and Actors owne Tragedies; God taking the wise in their craftinesse, and iustly spoyling the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust spoylers, of their spoyles, liues, states, yea, rooting out their whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the greatnesse and glory whereof they had sought to aduance by such wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked courses; and withall punishing the wickednes of the people by so frequent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> forreigne Inuasions and intestine Combustions: that wee may out of others e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils learne this good, <hi>Discite iustitiam moniti,</hi> the true vse of all Historie. I had out of <hi>Alexander Gwagninus, Paulus Oderbornius</hi> and others collected some Relations of <hi>Iuan Vasiliwich</hi> and his Sonnes, but those could see but the out-sides of things, and giue vs but huskes, shels, and rumours,<note place="margin">See my <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes,</hi> Part. 3. l. 4. c. 9.</note> (which often are vncertaine, sometimes false) but here wee present an Eye-witnesse, which tooke not vp Newes on trust by wonted Bils and Tales of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, but was admitted vnto the Mysteries of that State, in the Historie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> of the Imperiall Acts written in their Records; and in his owne personall and honourable Employments betwixt Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of glorious Memory, and the Russian Emperours. And indeed want of the Languages of remote Regions hath hatched many imperfect Histories, the blind leading the blind into errour; wherein as I haue euer loued truth, so was I glad to rectifie our Russian Relations by opportunitie of so worthy a Guide; whose Papers had before furnished Doctor <hi>Fletcher</hi> with the best peeces of his Intelligence.<note place="margin">See <hi>Purchas</hi> his <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> Part. 3. l. 3. c. 1.</note> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> here also I was straitned in time, the Presse pursuing me so fast, that I had not leisure to transcribe at large the Authours Danish, Polish and Germane
<pb facs="518"/> Relations; nor to adde forme or beauty from Arte: and perhaps this natiue nakednesse in a Iournall or Trauelling Method will be to some most accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Author and matter addes better lustre to the Worke then my words can; the one so full of varietie and weight, the other an experienced and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Knight, employed in many and honourable Seruices of State, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring the Name and Family of the <hi>Horseys,</hi> with his Acts, Arts, and good Parts. Who had long since also dedicated this Worke to that Honourable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triote Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham.</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
   </p>
   <p>Now for Master <hi>Methold,</hi> I had spared some of <hi>Frederikes, Balbies,</hi> and <hi>Fitches</hi> Relations, if these had comne in time, which so many times I had both by messages and in person sought, and by reason of the Authours absence or businesses was frustrate. But the Reader will finde his labour and cost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed in the Rarities of matter, and stile also trauelling beyond the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pace of a Merchant-Traueller. The Relation is correspondent to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, it entreates of a Mine of Diamants, and is a Mine of Diamants it selfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Gemmes may bee put on after the whole bodie (so I call my former large Worke) is attired and after that full repast, as Indian Drugs vsed in second Seruices, it will second thee with a new, and refresh thee with a fresh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian appetite, and present vnto thee (like Spectacles after great Feasts) such a muster of Indian Elements, affaires, men, arts, Religions, customes, and other varieties, as before we were not able to bring on our Stage. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/>
