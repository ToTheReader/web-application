   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight VVorshipfull,</hi> and Worthie Gentlemen (of the <hi>Innes of Court:</hi>) vnto you, as vnto one of the fairest Ornaments of this happy Realme, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende the benefite of this small Treatise: And I am wel perswaded, in this Dedication, that I salute the best parte of all the yong Gentlemen of <hi>Englande:</hi> For, what Course so-euer, they afterwardes sollowe, there are very fewe Gentlemen, but, either are, or haue ben of your Societie: It is verie wel knowen, that these famous Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, are the first intertayners of your Lybertie.</p>
   <p>For, (notwithstandyng) in your Gouernments, there are many good and peaceable Orders, yet your chiefest Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, is by the Purse. Those that are disposed, studdie the Lawes: who so liketh, without checke, maye follow Dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: And (certainly) the wanton Alectiues, which you (con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinuallie) behold, are not vnlike the <hi>Sirenes</hi> Inchauntments (were Poets faynings true:) you cōtinuallie walke by the Adamant Rockes, whiche drawe Siluer and Gold, as fast as Iron and Stéele: you must be armed with more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence then the capacytie of yong yeares: or els, assure your selues, that Repentance wyll vnlose your Fetters: there is an olde Prouerb: <hi>Euil Companie, corrupteth good maners:</hi> And (truely) I cannot see, how yong men, of the best educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: should escape vnpoysoned, when vice is so conuersant with Elder yeares.</p>
   <p>O how happie were it for your Posterytie, if, <hi>the Innes of the Court,</hi> were farre from <hi>Dieyng-houses,</hi> or <hi>Dicing-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> with their Originall, the Deuill. But, if you can not be thus seperated, this little Booke, wyll (with regarde) guide you as safe, as the Clue of threede did <hi>Theseus,</hi> in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berinth. These Houses (outwardly) are of the substance of other Buildinges, but within, are the Botches and Byles
<pb facs="5"/> of Abhomynation: they are lyke vnto déepe Pittes, couered with smoothe Grasse, of which, men must be warned, or els, they can hardly auoide that their eye can not discouer:</p>
   <p>You can haue, nofairer warnings then the steppes of your Companions falles, nor I, a more fortunate Rewarde for my trauaile, then to see you (worthie Gentlemen) to floorish.</p>
   <p>I beseeche you, to be aduised: It is a more precious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to shun a Mischiefe, by other mennes harmes, then to learne the goodnes of a thing, by the losse therof. This sharp Discouerie, will make your fléering Deceiuers, my open Enemies: but I shalbe well strengthned, if my true Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, breede in you a disdaine of their fellowshyp, &amp; let them spurne their woorste, they hurt them selues, that are angrie with good Admonition. I dedicate this Booke to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestrates. to whome, appertaineth the chastisment of euyll liuers, your woorst enemies: I dedicate to you (courteous Gentlemen) the Fruits of Noble <hi>Alexanders</hi> Counselles, as beseeming your worthinesse: I am but his Trouch-man, and your trustie frend. And (truely) your wisdomes may make his graue Counselles more profitable then their seuere Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: for the Medicine is of more value, that preserueth Health, then that which cureth Sicknesse. The health of a Gentlemā, is Honour &amp; actions of vertue: in which, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> (liberally) instructeth you: The Maladie, nay, death of a Gentlemā, is an vndoyng to the posterytie, which is haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by the sucking of Shifters: Of whome, I (constantly) hope, the good Maiestrates will ease you: I leaue further Ceremonies, in my Preface, leaste I seeme to iudge your Wisdomes, who are (for Learninge) a faire Beautie of the Common-wealth: my plaine Methode, in writing, showeth you a large hole to sée Daye, which is ynouffe (with an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage) who retayne the vertue, to drayne Honie from a Weede: I ende to trouble you, at this time: but in no time, will leaue to bée:</p>
