      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Sathans malice, and mans wickednesse, cease not to molest the thrice happy estate of the Church of CHRIST, so hath the eternall councell of the only wise GOD, predetermined the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Offences, Persecutions, Heresies, Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and Divisions, that Professors may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before <note n="a" place="margin">1.

      <hi>it must needs be that offences come:</hi> neither hath the Church ever enjoyed both purity and peace any long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. But whiles the Church of God thus disquieted, as well with dangerous alterations, as with dolefull altercations, is presented in the Theatre of this World, and crieth out to beholders, <note n="c" place="margin">Lament, 1. 12.</note>
      <hi>Have yee no regard, all yee that passe by?</hi> A pitty it is to see the crooked and sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous courses of the greattest part, every man moving his period within the enormous confines of his owne exorbitant desires. The Atheisticall Nullifidian, nothing regardeth the assoyling of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall controversies: he is of <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 18. 17.</note>
      <hi>Gallio's</hi> humour, and cares for none of those things. The sensuall Epicurean and riotous Russian, (goe Church matters as they will) eates and drinkes, and takes him plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The Cynicall Critick spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

Religion. The Scenicall Iester playeth fast and loose, and can utter anything in sport, but nothing in earnest. The a varitious worldling hath no tune but <hi>Give, Give,</hi> and no antheme pleaseth him but <hi>Have, Have.</hi> The aspyring Diotrephes puffeth downe every course which can not puffe up.

The subdolous Machiavellian accounteth the shew of religion profitable, but the substance of it troublesome: he studieth not the Oracles of God, but the Principles of Satanicall guile, which he learneth so well, that he may goe to the Divell to be Bishopped. The turne-coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

The gnathonick Parasite sweareth to all that this benefactor holdeth. The mercenary Pensioner will bowe before he breake. He, who only studieth to have the praise of some witty invention can not stricke upon another anwile. The silly Idiote, (with <note n="e" place="margin">2. Sam. 15. 11.</note>
      <hi>Absolons</hi> two hundreth) goeth in the simplicity of his heart, after his perverse leaders. The lapped Nicodemite, holdes it enough to yeeld some secret assent to the trueth, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his profession nor his practise testify so much.

The Pragmaticall A diaphorist with his spanne-broad faith, and elve-broad conscience, doth no small harme: the poore pandect of his plagiary profession, in matters of faith, reckoneth litle for all, and in matters of practise all for litle. Shortly, if an expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory <hi>Index</hi> were compiled of those, and all other sortes of men, who either through their carelesse and newtrall on looking, make no help to the troubled and disquieted Church of Christ, or through their nocent accession, and overthwart intermedling, worke out her greater harme! alas. How few feeling members were there to be found behind, who truly lay to heart her estate and condition? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse in the worst times, either of raging persecution, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing defection, as God Almighty hath ever hitherto, so both now and to the end he will reserve to himself a remnant according to the election of Grace, who cleave to his blessed Trueth, &amp; to the purity of his holy worship, and are grieved for the affliction of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> as beeing themselves also in the body. In confidence whereof, I take Boldnesse to stirre you up at this time, by putting you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. If you would be rightly informed of the present estate of the reformed Churches, you must not acquiesce, in the parge ting verdict of those who are wealthy and well at ease, and mounted aloft upon the uncogged wheeles of prosperous fortune (as they call it.)

   <p>After that it pleased God, by the light of his glorious Gospell to dispell the more then Cimmerian darknesse of Antichristianisme, and by the antidote of Reformation, to avoide the poyson of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie; for as much as in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> every noysome weed which Gods hand had never planted, was not pulled up, therefore we now see the faces of those Churches overgrowne with the repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulating twigges and sprigges of Popish superstition. <note n="g" place="margin">Rep. to the answ. p. 269.</note>
      <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Sprint</hi> aknowledgeth the Reformation of <hi>England</hi> to have beene defective, and saith, <hi>It is easie to imagine of what difficulty it was, to reforme all things at the first, where the most part of the privy Councell, of the Nobility, Bishops, Iudges, Gentry, and People, were open or close Papists: where few or none of any countenance stood for Religion at the first, but the Protector and Cranmer.</hi> The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was blessed with a more glorious and perfect Reformation, then any of our nighbour Churches. The Doctrine, Discipline, Regiment, and Policie established here by Ecclesiasticall and Civill Lawes, and sworne and subscribed unto by the Kings Majesty, the severall Presbetries, and Parish Churches of the Land; as it had the applause of forraine Divines, so was it in all points agreeable unto the Word; neither could the most rigid <hi>Aristarchus</hi> of these times, challenge any irregularity in the same. But now alas, even this Church, which was once so great a praise in the earth, is deeply corrupted, and hath <note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 32. 8.</note>
      <hi>turned aside quickely out of the way.</hi> So that this is the Lords controversie against <hi>Scotland:</hi>
      <note n="i" place="margin">Ierem. 2. 21.</note>
      <hi>I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: How then art thou turned into the degenerat plant of a strange vine unto mee?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It is not this day feared but felt, that the rotten dregges of Poperie, which were never purged away from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and having once beene spewed out with detestation, are licked up againe in <hi>Scotland;</hi> prove to be the unhappy occasions of a woefull recidiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Neither is there need of Lyncean eyes, for if we be not pore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind, it can not be hid from us, what dolefull and disasterous mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (to be bewailed with teares of blood) hath happened to the Church and Spouse of Christ in these Dominions? Her comely countenance is miscoloured with the farding lustre of the mother of Harlotes. Her shamefaste forehead hath received the marke of the Beast. Her lovely-lockes are frizled with the crisping pins of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian fashions. Her chaste Eares are made to listen to the friends of the great Whoore, who bring the bewitching Doctrine of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunting Traditions. Her doves Eyes looke pleasantly upon the
<pb facs="4"/>
well attired Harlot. Her sweet Voice is mumming and muttering some missall and magicall Liturgies. Her faire Necke beareth the halter-like tokens of her former captivity, even a burden some chaine of superfluous and superstitious Ceremonies. Her undefiled Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are stained with the meretricious braverie of Babylonish or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and with the symbolizing badges of conformity with <hi>Rome.</hi> Her harmelesse Hands reach bricke and mortare to the building of <hi>Babel.</hi> Her beautifull Feet with shooes, are all besmeared, whiles they returne apace in the way of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and wade the ingruent broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of Popery. Oh transformed Virgine! whether is thy beauty gon from thee? Oh forlorne Princes Daughter! how art thou not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to looke thy Lord in the face? Oh thou best beloved among Women what hast thou to doe with the inveagling appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and abilement of <hi>Babylon</hi> the Whoore?—But among such things as have beene the accursed meanes of the Churches desolation, those which peradventure might seeme to some of you to have least harme or evill in them, are the Ceremonies of kneeling in the act of receiving the Lords Supper, Crosse in Baptisme, Bishopping, Holy-dayes, &amp;c. which are pressed under the name of things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Yet if you survey the sundry inconveniences and grievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of the same, you will thinke farre otherwise. The vame shewes and shaddowes of these Ceremonies have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>id and obscured the substance of Religion. The true life of godlinesse is smoared downe and suppressed by the burthen of these human inventions. For their sakes, many, who are both faithfull Servants to Christ, and loyall Subjects to the King, are evill spoken of, mocked, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, menaced, molested. For their sakes, Christian brethren are offended, and the weake are greatly scandalized. For their sakes, the most powerfull &amp; painfull Ministers in the Land, are either thrust out, or threatned to be thrust out from their callings. For their sakes, the best qualified and most hopefull Exspectants are debarred from entering into the Ministery. For their sakes, the Seminaries of Learning are so corrupted, that few or no good plants▪ can come forth from thence. For their sakes, many are admitted into the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ministery, who are either Pop shand Arminianized, who mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to the flocke poyson in stead of food; or silly ignorants, who can dispense no whollesome food to the hungry; or else vitious in their lives, who draw many with them into the dangerous p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

taste and relish of Popish superstition, (for many such there be in the Land) doe sucke from the intoxicate dugs of Conformity, the foster-milke which makes them grow in Error. And who can be ignorant, what a large spread, Poperie, Arminianisme, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with <hi>Rome,</hi> have taken among the Arch-urgers of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies?

   <p>These are the best wares which the bigge hulke of Conformity, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the prosperous gale of mighty Auctority, hath impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongst us. And whiles our Opposites so quiverly goe about to spread the bad wares of these encombring inconveniences, is it time for us luskishiy to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

   </p>
   <p>Moreover, besides the prevailing inconveniency of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Ceremonies, the unlawfulnesse of them is also plainly evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this ensuing Dispute, by such convincing Arguments, as beeing duely pondered in the equall ballance of an attentive mind, shall by Gods grace afforde satisfaction to so many as purpose to buy the Trueth, and not to sell it.

In the meane while they were so farre from desiring any of the Churches to retaine these Popish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which might have convenient occasion of ejecting them, (farre lesse to recall them beeing once ejected,) that they testifyed plainly their dislike of the same, and wished, that those Churches wherein they lived, might have some blessed opportunity to be rid of all such rotten Relicks, riven Ragges, and rotten Remainders of Poperie. All which, since they were once purged away from the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and cast forth as things accursed into the Iakes of eternall detestation, how vile and abominable may we now call the resuming of them? Or what a piacular prevarication is it, to borrow from any other Church which was lesse reformed, a patterne of policie for this Church which was more reformed.

      <hi>Zanchius</hi> she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth) to be placed under, to be subordinat, and so to give honour and reverence to him who is above, which may well stand without obedience to every one of his Lawes. Yea and <note n="m" place="margin">of the Church lib. 4. cap. 34.</note>

   <p n="9">IX. Forasmuch as some ignorant ones are of opinion, that when <note place="margin">IX.</note> they practise the Ceremonies neither perceiving any unlawfulnesse in them, (but by the contrary beeing perswaded in their consciences of the Lawfullnesse of the same) nor yet having any evill meaning (but intending Gods glory and the peace of the Church) therefore they practise them with a good conscience. Be not ye also deceived, but rather advert unto this, that a peaceable conscience allowing that which a man doth, is not ever a good conscience, but often times an Erring, Bolde, Presuming, Secure, yea perhaps a Seared conscience. A good Conscience, the testimony whereof giveth a man true peace in his doings, is, and is only such a one, as is rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed out of the Word of God. Neither doth a good meaning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse any evill action, or else they who killed the Apostles were to be excused, because in so doing <note n="m" place="margin">Io. 16. 2.</note> they thought they did God good service.

three dayes humiliation and Prayer to God, put her very life in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard by going in to supplicat the King, which was not according to the Law. But now (alas) there are too many Professours who detract themselves from undergoing lesser hazards for the Churches liberty, yea, from using those very defences which are according to the Lawes of the Kingdome. Yet most certaine it is, that without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diligence in the use of the meanes, you shall neither convince your Adversaries, nor yet exoner your owne consciences, nor lastly have such comfort in the day of your suffering as otherwise you should. I know that principally and above all we are <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> to offer up to God, Prayers and Supplications with strong crying and teares, which are the weapons of our spirituall warrefare: but as this ought to be done, so the atchieving of other secundary meanes, ought not to be left undone.</p>
   <p>If you misregard these things whereof in the name of God I have admonished you, and draw back your helping hands from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached and afflicted cause of Christ, for which we plead, then doe not put evill farre from you, for wrath is determined against you. And as for you, my deare brethren, and Country men of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as <note n="d" place="margin">Speed. Hist. of Brit. book 6. chap. 9. s. 9.</note> it is long, since first Christianity was preached and professed in this Land: as also it was blessed with a most glorious and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounned Reformation: and further, as the Gospell hath beene lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continued in purity and peace with us then with any Church in <hi>Europe:</hi> Moreover, as the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath treacherously bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her bonds of oath and subscription, wherewith other Churches about us were not so tied: and finally, as Almighty God, though he hath almost consumed other Churches by his dreadfull Iudgments, yet hath shewed farre greater longsuffering-kindnesse toward us, to reclaime us to repentance, though (notwithstanding of all this,) we goe on in a most dolefull security, induration, blindnesse, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding. So now in the most ordinary course of Gods Iustice, we are certainly to exspect, that after so many mercies, so great long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, and such a long day of grace, all despised, hee is to send upon us such Iudgements as should not be believed though they were tolde. <hi>O Scotland!</hi> understand and turne againe, or else as GOD lives, most terrible Iudgements are abiding thee.</p>
   <p>But if you lay these things to heart, if you be humbled before God for the provocation of your defection, and turne back from the same, if with all your hearts, and according to all your power, you bestow your best endeavours for making help to the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Church of Christ, and for vindicating the cause of pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, yea though it were w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
