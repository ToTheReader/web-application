   <head>The Preface of the Translatour to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Erence <hi>the worthy wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of Comedies, when as he had once ended his works and determined vvith him selfe to publish the same, doubtlesse he feared nothinge more than the maleuolous reprehencion of carping tounges. For he knevv assuredly, that at those daies (as euermore hetherto it hath been) the common people as they polluted their bodies vvith voluptuous and ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured manners, so did they defile and contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their mindes vvith the furious dartes of ZOY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LVS Spirit. And to say the truth, he vvrought him selfe this suspicion not vvithout a cause: for as soone as he had disclosed the secrettes of his studie vvhich not vvithout great toile and paineful labour hee had vvrapped together, there vvanted not some vvho weare redie bente and prepared to be wreake the spitefull malice of their cancred hartes, and vvithout iust cause of controlment to manifest the priuie stinges of their venemous conscience. This (gentle Reader) when I considered with my felfe, I must needes confesse that I was greatlie dismaide, and meruailouslie terrified from mine enterprise, and alreadie, as it were through sundrie conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to my selfe, allured and perswaded rather to retire, than hardilie and stoutlie to aduenture my
<pb facs="7"/> iourney. Yet contrariwise I ponderinge in my minde the contrarietie of humane Nature, and the maruailous diuersitie of disposicion wherwith it is embrewed, and then againe vnderstanding that all are not enemies vnto the Crowne of Vertue, ne Foes to the Scepter of Godlinesse, I thought it more expedient by my simple labour and industry to gratifie and please the good, than by suppressing my attempt cowardlie to flee the busie braines of the naughtie and reprobate. Certes the wicked are to be abandoned with their wickednesse, but the good are to be loued and cherished for their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. The studious sercher of wisdom will more seriouslie pursue the holsom and necessarie instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for life, then the exquisite situation of words. and will rather couet fruitfull lessons, and good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicions, than sugred sentences, oratorial trickes, and outlandish termes. But the vnstedfast and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable minde of the vicious person (I will speake of a thinge manifestlie and commonlie knowne) had leiffer to espy some friuolous doubte to cauell and Question vpon, than to folow any seemelie aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisment, perfectlie staking out the waie to laudable Vertue. Such a Reader as hath his good wil fully addicted to pastaunces and vnhappie delites had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I dare say bothe to see and reade the brutish bookes of VENVS plaies, than to spend his time and busie his braine in such a Treatise which may instruct and teache him to liue Prudentlie, iustlie, valiauntlie, and soberlie: with the honest Reader I trust I shall purchase fauoure and iust commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to the other this little worke shalbe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb facs="8"/> to teache him for to vanquish and bridle his vnfauorie delite in bourding, to mittigate his furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous braide of reprehencion, to asswage the combe of his insolente Arrogancie, to appease the rage of his skornefull spirite, and finallie to make him not onlie a fitte Disciple or hearer, but also a profitable follower of <hi>Morall Philosophie.</hi> Verelie all estates, all degrees, all ages, haue presently laide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eies to looke on the Glasse of all Vertue: for as in a Glasse they may easelie contemplate what is decent, or els vnseemely in their parsonage, and apparell, so by fastening their mindes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandinges herevpon they may with no lesse fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitee ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ke consider, and beare away what is to be folowed in their whole course of life, or vvhat is to be eschewed, vvhat to be retained, as good and profitable, or vvhat to be reiected as vncōmodious and hurtefull. Such vvhether they be noble or base, riche or poore, old or yong, as haue al their delices, and corporall delites as fleshfondinges, and paum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peringes of the vitall porcion subiecte to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novvned &amp; victorious bondage of REASON, such I say haue here to gather aduisements and instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions profitable and expediente to ratifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme their liues: and others vvho like EPICV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RTENS are vanquished vvith gorgious fare and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uervvhelmed, buried, and drovvned, in the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Gulffes of innumerable vanities, haue hereby to reform their insestuous conuersacions, to amend their notorious faultes, to banish their toublesome woodes of minde, to expell and put away their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed doinges, and by adorninge them selues
<pb facs="8"/> with the flourishinge Braunches of Vertue by litle and litle to creepe to the Fountaine of that greatest Soueraintie For assure thy selfe (gentle Reader) that no man liuing can attaine vnto the vtterest good (as ARISTOTLE the Prince of al Philosophers doth say) vnlesse he shall first subdue his apetites, bridell his desires, Imprison his lusts, and confound his mad and bestiall affections, through which nature is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled, and he withdrawen from the fellowship of goodnesse and honestie. And that I may not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe thy pacience any lenger, I doo instantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, that if any part of this my Transacion shall offend thine eares, thou wilt courtously deale with me, rather considering the proper worthinesse and sence of the Aucthor whiche is moste excellence, then my basenesse and tennitie of Stile, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of Eloquence.</p>
