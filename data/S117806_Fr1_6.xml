As that learned Rabbi, broght

      <hi>It were better for me to die, then that any man should make my reioycing vaine</hi> And <hi>Tertullian</hi> by a speech of his to the persecuting tyrants sheweth, that thus they esteemed it, and professed no lesse to the world.<note n="f" place="margin">Ad Lenorem proxime damnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Christianum, quam ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>VVhile you condemne,</hi> saith he, <hi>a Christian matron to a baud, rather then to a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you openly confesse for vs, that we abhor the blot of Chastitie and honestie, more thē all other punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēts; yea then death.</hi> And this is that which the light of Reason teacheth men; that for a man to die honourably, is
<pb facs="7"/> no death; for a man to liue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourably, is worse then death. And as it is a curse for a man, to suruiue his good name, so is it a blessing his good name should suruiue him. So that, he which helps to keep the righteous in a blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall or remembrance, hee doth but bring the promised blessing of God vpon the head of the righteous, help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>debter to them by promise.</hi> A thing that all ought to doe, and not vnbefitting any, no not
<pb facs="7"/> the Ministers of the Gospell; when as our Sauiour Christ saith, concerning <hi>Mary;</hi>
      <note n="h" place="margin">Mark 14.9</note>
      <hi>Wheresoeuer this Gospel shall be preached through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, this also that shee hath done, shall be spoken of in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of her.</hi> And by whom more then by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Gospell? who if they must honour her, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting what she had done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but one act of pietie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to Christ, how much more may they do it for those, who haue performed many and manifold workes of pietie and charitie to Christ and his members? Vpon which ground, I tooke my selfe warranted to
<pb facs="8"/> expresse the loue and honour I bore towards your deceased honourable sonne and brother, in speaking those things I did at his funerals concerning his truely religious life and right blessed death, wherein I labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make euident to others for imitation, that grace which God had made so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in him. The whole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie were much affected with it, and many both godly and learned, both Ministers and others desired much to haue it published to the world, whereof diuers the same day set vpon, and since by letters haue importuned mee much, besides others in the name of many (who haue but heard a
<pb facs="8"/> flying report of the excellent graces and most worthy parts that was in him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by me) haue still pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me to imprint it, to make that common to others, which was so louely in the eares of those that heard it. After all this I began to thinke, that this proceeded from the Lord, and to say with my selfe, as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> to others,<note n="i" place="margin">Act. 11.17</note>
      <hi>VVho was I, that I could let God.</hi> So, who am I, that I should let God, thinking also with my selfe, that that which was so desired of many, might be by the grace of God profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to many mo; knowing that God hath not onely, appointed his word to beget faith, and
<pb facs="9"/> teach godlines, but by the same word, hath sanctified the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of godly men, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke to godlines: as is manifest in holy writ; yea examples are of that force, that men are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten won by them to the liking of the word, who before had either a hatred or distaste of it; and after, by the word are wonne vnto God. Many men must see the Gospell in the liues of the professors of the Gospell, before they will beleeue it in the mouthes of the Preachers of it. And as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith of the Gentiles:<note n="k" place="margin">His quae dicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur a no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
            <desc>•••</desc>

      <hi>They doe not regard what things are vttered by vs, but what are acted of vs.</hi> So may I say of many who liue amongst vs,
<pb facs="9"/> and beare the name of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they little regard either what we preach, or professe, but what wee practise.<note n="l" place="margin">2. Pet. 3.1.</note> And if the husbands may be wonne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word by the submisse and meek conuersation of their wiues; thē may others with the word by the holy conuersation of those who professe the word, be wonne vnto godlines. And as by others, so I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the life and conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this holy young Saint (so was he in earth, so is he in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen) of whom I will not heere speake much, lest any should taxe mee with flattery. Yet this I will say (glorifying God that I can truely say it of him, not to honour him so much by
<pb facs="10"/> it, as the Gospell of Iesus Christ:) that I challenge the whole armie of the vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised Philistimes of Rome, to bring me forth the greatest Goliath, I say not of the like age, honour and rancke, but almost of what age or degree soeuer, that euer shewed so much power of popery or the forme of seeming sanctitie, as this young man <hi>Dauid</hi> did, the power of true pietie and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Let them then cease de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the host of Jsraell, when they came hardly paralell our younglings with men of the best grouth they haue or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly haue had. But if I shold follow this matter I shold hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keepe measure, and therfore I
<pb facs="10"/> will content my selfe with this.</p>
   <p>Why I haue dedicated this to your name cānot be strange to any which know the great &amp; nie intrest you had in the subiect, and so most right to the Sermon. To say nothing of my owne bond who haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued such loue from him, for which I must and will honour all his; yea who haue so deepely tasted of the bountie of you his honourable mother. Accept it I pray you as a smale testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of my thankefull minde, &amp; as a true testimonie of that loue and reuerence that I haue borne to that grace of God which was manifest in him. The Lord hath greatly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you with the worty being
<pb facs="11"/> and the blessed memory of such a gratious Sonne, such a godly brother, yea so honoured you as in all respects he hath hardly honoured any Mother, any Sisters; hauing giuen you, his honourable Mother, the fruit of all your great care, labour, and cost you so naturally and religiously tooke, in tilling his young heart, wherein you not onely laboured by your selfe in his infancie, as another mother of<note n="m" place="margin">Prou 31.</note> the <hi>worthy Lemuel to instruct him,</hi> teaching your <hi>Timothie</hi> like another <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> (renowned in holy writ)<note n="n" place="margin">2.

      <hi>Not ceasing to doe good to the liuing and to the dead,</hi> for his sake to his wife and children. Of which you reaped a plentifull and timely haruest of ioy and comfort, though it is your griefe to liue to see his autumne and fall.<note n="p" place="margin">Iob 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>When God doth vnburden vs, he doth burden vs:</hi> So God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnburdened you of that griefe and sorrow, of that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie &amp; reproch which many mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers and sisters haue, &amp; to to many of your rank, while theirs liue licētiously, <hi>reprobate to euery good work,</hi> dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Christ Iesus whom they professe▪ and their kindered from which they did proceed. I say while God hath vnbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened you of this, and honored you with the contrary, he doth
<pb facs="12"/> onerate and burden you with the dutie of thankefulnes, which among other duties is this, that you continue with a godly zeale and Christian care to imitate and emulate the worthy graces and practise of godlines which were in this your honour &amp; crowne, which is worthily esteemed in him, and will be in you, the highest matter of your honour and praise. Diuines giue the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it to be this, because by pietie and holines of life wee ascend,<note n="s" place="margin">Ad primarium illud bonum vnde originem traximus Nazian. orat. <hi>33.</hi> in land.

      <hi>There is no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the imitation of God:</hi> which is then performed when we imitate those who haue walked with God.

      <hi>That as they who dresse themselues vse glasses, so those who are to performe any thing, propound to themselues the examples of praise-worthy men.</hi> You honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ladies haue a most true, and (as I may so speake) a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall glasse to see to addresse your selues to goodnes by, euen
<pb facs="13"/> the life of your worthy, it is that which will sooner checke you then any, as it ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you more then any▪ nay it is that by which others will sooner reprehend your stepping aside and straying. I humbly beseech you therefore (giue me leaue to further your forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) walke after his waies &amp; runne with good resolution the race of pietie and true godlines he hath finished before you, of whom I may say as <hi>Ambrose</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi>

   <p>And so I humbly and hartily
