   <head>The Authors Prologue to such of his Poems in this booke as concerne Golds Kingdome.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>ALthough that Gold can closely creepe</l>
      <l>where th'aire could neuer come,</l>
      <l>And cause that vice and vertue be</l>
      <l>of equall poise with some,</l>
      <l>Yet noble and true gentle minds</l>
      <l>with Gold will not be won,</l>
      <l>To do the thing that is vniust</l>
      <l>or leaue good things vndone.</l>
      <l>A proofe hereof me selfe haue seene</l>
      <l>in one that noble is,</l>
      <l>And holdeth place of high respect</l>
      <l>as he well worthy is:</l>
      <l>A poore man with Petition</l>
      <l>annexed to his case</l>
      <l>To him repaires, not hauing helpe</l>
      <l>of any friend in place:</l>
      <l>Which when he had exhibited,</l>
      <l>although that noble man</l>
      <l>Had great imployments of the State</l>
      <l>yet marke what followd than:</l>
      <l>Not full two dayes expyrd, before</l>
      <l>the poore man did receaue</l>
      <l>An Answer to his full content,</l>
      <l>And thence did take his leaue,</l>
      <l>Not rendring gifts to any one</l>
      <l>nor Secretaries fees,</l>
      <l>But hasting home vnto his Hiue,</l>
      <l>reioyced with his Bees.</l>
      <l>A yeare thence after, troubles came</l>
      <l>about that passed gift,</l>
      <l>As that some sought to frustrate it</l>
      <l>by friends or fained shift.</l>
      <l>The poore man for his helpe againe</l>
      <l>preferreth his complaint,</l>
      <l>And by his onely writing doth</l>
      <l>that Lord therewith acquaint,</l>
      <l>Himselfe vnable through disease</l>
      <l>in person to be seene.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="5"/>
This noble man, as if the case</l>
      <l>had then like present bene,</l>
      <l>What he had passed earst before,</l>
      <l>Confirmes with greater force:</l>
      <l>Right noble surely was this deed</l>
      <l>and full of true remorse.</l>
      <l>Yea, as before, no peny went</l>
      <l>out of the poore mans purse,</l>
      <l>So now againe, no peny he</l>
      <l>to any did disburse.</l>
      <l>Patron to pupils is that Lord,</l>
      <l>(so doth his office lie)</l>
      <l>Amongst whose vertuous deedes this one,</l>
      <l>the poore mans case did try.</l>
      <l>And sith that I an Actor was</l>
      <l>to pen that poore mans case,</l>
      <l>I therefore write it as a note</l>
      <l>of vertue in that place.</l>
      <l>The rather, for because this Age</l>
      <l>vnhelping is, and why?</l>
      <l>Few men will helpe in cases where</l>
      <l>they see no profit lie.</l>
      <l>So that to speake what I conceiue,</l>
      <l>I feare, no Gold, no Good,</l>
      <l>No, not perhaps for such as haue</l>
      <l>aduentured their bloud.</l>
      <l>And for the man at home, who hath</l>
      <l>of good deseruing bene,</l>
      <l>Nor workes nor worth can him aduance</l>
      <l>if Gold come not betweene:</l>
      <l>For now, as good to beate the ayre</l>
      <l>as fill the eares of some</l>
      <l>Who Sutes preferre: Nay, fill their hands,</l>
      <l>else looke to find them <hi>Mum.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Yet write I not with mind to touch</l>
      <l>men of superiour place:</l>
      <l>Nor do I know particulers</l>
      <l>that any should deface.</l>
      <l>Many complaine and many cry:</l>
      <l>God knoweth where the fault doth lie.</l>
