   <head>THE STATE OF THIS QVESTION
brieflie set down, for the capacitie of such as are
not able to carie the drift of all this
discourse before them.</head>
   <p>THe hebrevve vvord <hi>SHEOL,</hi> vvhich the Greekes call <hi>hades,</hi> the
latines <hi>infernus,</hi> and vvee hell, hath three significations in the
scriptures.</p>
   <p>First and properlie it signifieth the graue, or common condition of all
the dead, expressed in the greek <hi>hades</hi> by the priuation of light or lyfe.</p>
   <p>Secondlie, the place of tormentes, appointed for the punishment of the
vvicked: for this the hebrevve vvord is least, and our inglish vvorde most
vsuall, or rather as it is commonlie taken, hardlie signifieth any thing els.</p>
   <p>Thirdlie, the torments of hel, vvhich by a Metonymicall hyperbole for
amplifications sake, is manie times attributed to the sorrovves of this life.
These things are knovvn to al the learned. And this D. confesseth them
sect. 4. See also sect. 8. sect. 9. and sect. 14.</p>
   <p>Novve, vvhere our beleefe hath that Christ descended into hell: the
question is vvhich of these three significations doth best fit that article of
our faith: We say, that seing euery article of our faith must haue an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douted
sense confirmed by the Scriptures, it must needs signifie the hellish
torments that he suffered for our redemption, or the darknesse of death,
vvhich svvallovved him the three daies that he vvas in the graue. That
these thingt are true, and may be the true sense of that article, our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
cannot denie. Yet not contented heerevvith, they vvil sinke deeper,
and send Christs soule to the damned pit of hell, neither to suffer himself,
nor to helpe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> that suffered there. Novve, because this is a thing that
no man can avouch vpon his ovvne knovvledge, but God himself: We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to take their vvords vvithout his vvarrant. Wherefore to mend this
crooke, they lay three te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s of Scripture in the presse. The first is out of the
16. Psalme: the second is out of the 3. chap. of the 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> the last &amp; vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest,
out of the 4. to the <hi>Ephes.</hi> But these proofes being doubtfull, that is,
implying other plainer senses We denie them to be sufficient to make this
doubtfull assertion, an vndoubted article of our faith. Our reason is, no
doubtfull proofes can make a doubtfull assertion an vndoubted article of
our faith: But these proofes be doubtfull. <hi>Ergo,</hi> these proofes cannot make
this doubtfull assertion, an vndoubted article of our faith. That these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes
be doubtfull, the vvords, drifts, and circumstances, offering other sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb facs="12"/>
both plainer, and better fitting the places, and agreeable to the rest of
the Scriptures, vvill driue anie reasonable head to confesse. Neither doeth
diverse learned Papists denie it. But this aduersarie more impudent then
they, blusheth not like a vvyer dravver, to pull these Scriptures through
narrovve holes, to make them smal inough, to tie our faith to his fantasie.
Moreouer, vvith like violence, hee is forced to break dovvn tvvo other
vvalls that stands in his vvay. The one is in the 23 of <hi>Luke,</hi> ver. 46. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into thy hands I commend my spirit▪</hi> and the other in the 43. ver
of the same cap. spoken to the theef, <hi>This day shalt thou be with mee in
Paradice.</hi> By vvhich tvvo places it is cleare, that Christs soule vvas then
in heauen, and not in Hell. Vpon the true sense of these places riseth this
disputation, to vvhich I referre the discreet and indifferent Reader, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching
them to read vvith a single eie, and iudge vvith an vpright hart.
Onelie I vvill lance an impostume of absurdities, vvhich breeding in the
bovvels of this opinion, like the vvorme that breeds in the nut, hath putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
all the probabilitie of it, and made all men of indifferent iudgement
in this age to caste it vnder the boord amongest the shreddes.</p>
   <p>First, that Christ went down to Hell to triumph, contrarie to the
nature of Hell, which yeeldeth nothing but horrour and torments.
And contrarie to the nature of a triumph, which was vsuallie solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
amongst them, to whom the joy of the victorie did appertaine</p>
   <p>Secondlie, that Christs soule did preach in Hell, contrarie to the
nature of a soule, that cannot preache: and the condition of those
hearers, who could reap no profite of his sermon having their juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alreadie.</p>
   <p>Thirdlie, that he did preach neither to convert the hearers, nor
to condempne them for the contempt of his word: but to aggrauate
their sorrowes. Contrarie to the office of Christ, which was to offer
mercie to all his hearers.</p>
   <p>Fourthlie, that Christs soul did preach in Hel reallie, not vocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:
that is, did preach in Hel and say nothing: contrary to the nature
of the word preach, which neuer man did, without voice &amp; words.</p>
   <p>Fiftlie, that Christ meaning to go to Hell, (as they say) did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
commend his soule into the hands of God. Contrarie
to the true and common vse of these words vsed by Stephan, Act. 7.
and all other godlie men, that craue to be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> heauen.</p>
   <p>Sixtlie, that his soule was in Hell with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>t torments, contrarie to
the name and nature of Hell, which presenteth to the care and hart,
nothing but hainous and hideous torments.</p>
   <p>Seventhlie, that in these words (Thou shalt be with mee in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice)
Christ spake onelie of his God-head. Contrarie to the nature
of the pronoune (<hi>me</hi>) which doeth alwaies note the whole person
that speaketh.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="13"/>
Eightlie, that having conquered Hell vpon the crosse: It was
needfull for him notwithstanding to goe to hell. Contrarie to the
sufficiencie of Christs sacrifice, who had paid a full ransome for our
sinnes before, and left nothing behinde to be done in Hell. These 8.
cankers are festered in the marrowe of this absurde opinion, for all
which, all the Scriptures hath not one sillable, and therefore it must
be a monster, that hath bred so manie monsters.</p>
   <p>I Had answered Maister Doctors Sermon (as he calls it) but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
prolixitie, and because this is but a repetition of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
there, I haue left it out, and haue sent him a breefe summe
thereof, to shewe him that there is nothing there, better then here:
only in the end of it, he calles al his adversaries Boyes, schismaticks,
phantasticall spirits, rashe without studie, and presumptuous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feare of God. If <hi>Caluin</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Beza</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Marlarot</hi> be
a boy, if <hi>Vrsinus</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Bastingius</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Ramus</hi> be a boy, if

a boy, if <hi>Brensius</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Heresbathius</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Sohnius</hi> be a
boy, if <hi>Bullinger</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Bucer</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Danaeus</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>
be a boy, if <hi>Viret</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Sarcerius</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Suinglius</hi> be a
boy, if <hi>Dering</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Perkins</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Rogers</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Fulk</hi>
be a boy, if <hi>Willet</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Reynolds</hi> be a boy, if <hi>Whitaker</hi> be a boy
if <hi>Hoper</hi> bishop of Glocester be a boy, if <hi>Reynald Peacock,</hi> Bishop of
Chester in the time of <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixt be a boy: I wil stand to it, that
this D. is not worthie to wait on many boyes, and bear their books
to the Schoole, of their diligence, of their learning, of their discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of their integritie, of their constācie, of their humilitie, though
his mouth runne over in generall, I hope he will blush to touch any
of them in particular. This I haue set downe to shewe thee gentle
Reader, that his cause wants not more &amp; greater adversaries, then
he supposeth it to haue f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
