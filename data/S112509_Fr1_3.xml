<pb facs="9"/> of all doubt, that manie reuerende, and learned preists, of this kingdome will in Innocencie add to that which I haue begun: And all the rest of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated companie still sufferringe for that most glorious and holy cause, will bee able to performe as much in that kinde, as any temporall Soueraigne can in conscience exact of a spirituall and cleargie man; and more then your best and moste selected Bishops, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters will assume to doe. For matters of Religion, this treatise will bee our warrant, that wee must continue our vnitie, with our Mother church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and not with those, whoe by their owne Iudgments and testimonies, are Hereticks, Scismaticks, damnably sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and seduced, and such, as by manie other titles, by their owne conclusions are men not to bee communicated with in busines of Religion, except men would willfullie incurre damnation: Such as your moste allowed doctors &amp; writters, are most manifestlie proued in this worke, by their owne writings.
