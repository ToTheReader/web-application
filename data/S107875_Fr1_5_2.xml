which I title, His Vnder-wood.</head>
   <l>VVHen (<hi>Iordan</hi>) I had read thine <hi>Vnder wood</hi>
   </l>
   <l>of growing <hi>Poesie,</hi> I understood,</l>
   <l>(At least imagin'd) that I saw a <hi>Spring</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Breake through the depth of <hi>Winter;</hi> and a Ring</l>
   <l>Of <hi>Sylvans, Satyrs,</hi> and light-footed <hi>Fawnes,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>That haunt the Woods, the Mountaines, and the Lawnes,</l>
   <l>(Each with his <hi>Nimph</hi>) unanimously met,</l>
   <l>All overjoy'd to dance a roundelet.</l>
   <l>For that they found in thy delightfull <hi>Grove,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Something for every one of them to love;</l>
   <l>Each in his severall kind; and o're them sate</l>
   <l>The ayrie Choristers, (none without a Mate)</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>
Vpon thy branches, who unto their dance,</l>
   <l>(With no lesse joy in Musick) did advance</l>
   <l>A welcome, and a wish'd increasefull way,</l>
   <l>To every stemme, to every sprig, and spray,</l>
   <l>Sprung from thy pregnant braine. The <hi>Muses</hi> throng.</l>
   <l>To heare those birds chaunt forth the cheerefull Song</l>
   <l>They had inspir'd them with; whilst through his Rayes</l>
   <l>
      <hi>Phoebus</hi> sate smiling downe, to see his Bayes,</l>
   <l>Yet unneglected; and this leaden age</l>
   <l>(Whose dulnesse dampes his Lawrell, which the rage</l>
   <l>Of Thunder never blasted) to send forth</l>
   <l>A <hi>Genius</hi> that to weare it sings its worth.</l>
   <l>And now (most happily) when the <hi>Poets</hi> old</l>
   <l>Are sinking too! That one so young should hold</l>
   <l>The club up gainst the Giant ignorance,</l>
   <l>The malice of the times, and blinder chance,</l>
   <l>
      <hi>Apollo</hi> pleas'd, thou mayst expect soone after</l>
   <l>(For onely thou hast mov'd his this yeares laughter)</l>
   <l>To be in's <hi>Darlings</hi> list, then will he shine,</l>
   <l>Propitiously on every plant of thine;</l>
   <l>And make them flourish by his chearing light,</l>
   <l>Through the grosse darkenesse of detraction's spight;</l>
   <l>And send thee followers, and admirers, who</l>
   <l>Shall cry up all thou doest or aym'st to doe.</l>
   <l>Meane time I lend (that dares on envy looke)</l>
   <l>This <hi>Page</hi> to beare a Torch before thy booke.</l>
