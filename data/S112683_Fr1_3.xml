   <head>To the Right honourable, ROBERT <hi>Earle of Effex,</hi> Viscount <hi>Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Bouchier,</hi> Lord <hi>Ferrers</hi> of <hi>Chartley, Bouchier,</hi> and <hi>Lovaine.</hi>

      <salute>RIGHT HONORABLE,</salute>

   <p>I Could hardly compose my thoughts, touching the presentation of these my unworthy endevors, to one so worthy, and truly noble as your Lordship, having no excuse but your goodnesse, and the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of those who are truly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb facs="5"/>
of your vertues: Among which number I desire to be knowne. I have nothing to plead for my <hi>Muse,</hi> but that the Subject with the Title, do agree: And that the fruit she beares, is whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, though soure. That which fals with shaking, is not worth taking up. I know I shall undergoe the censure of some, that can Judge of nothing but what they see; having narrow spirits, only roome for sense at the worst. In respect of such, my <hi>Muse</hi> was safer walking by Night; than now by Day. But if it shall please your Lordship to support her with your hand, and looke upon that little good which may appeare through a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying glasse, and extenuate the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Envy her selfe will keep at a distance; and shee shall passe with freedome, gayning commendations from your Honours Approbation. She's so farre adorned with modesty amongst her Opposites, that she will
<pb facs="5"/>
not bespeak a glance from your eye, but when you be retir'd from more weighty occasions. If I should write but what high-borne Fame speakes of your worth, and call your noble Vertues by their names, I should make the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance so pleasing-large, that the Reader would there take up his rest. But it shall be satisfaction to me, that she's grac'd with your name: which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve her from living graves. And with my prayers to the God of Truth, for your Lordships eternall hapinesse,</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>I shall rest your most engaged and humble servant, HUMPHRY MILL.</signed>
