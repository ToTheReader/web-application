      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Speech is the Character of man: that is, the image of his heart and mind, and be the Image of God, so silence, whilst it is
<pb facs="3"/> a seasonable and discreet suspension thereof, becomes a man in its time and place: unseasonable use of either, offensive and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to censure. The excesse is branded for a nullifier of Religion, whilst it makes it vaine: The seeming defect finds some approbation in morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>

   <p>This plaine; yet true version of these sacred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, Holy Prayers, and Meditations of a faithfull soule, so truly sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by their Author, so well knowne to all, to be a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and worthy Divine of the French reformed Church. I present and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate to your Ladiship. The end herein proposed to my selfe, being the same with that of my Authors; which none can justly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther question, or quarrel at to wit, the advancement of
<pb facs="5"/> this part of Gods worship, so' much languishing in the cold if not frozen deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of many, and opposed by the giddie practice of mothen a good many, that so farre nauzeate Prayer, publike especially, that in their unkindly and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided zeale, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by one Ordinance of God to shoulder out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Prayer</hi> by <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> God hath stiled his House the House of Prayer. Now, what my well meant paines herein cals mine, I wish may finde acceptance
<pb facs="5"/> with you, as I do humbly tender &amp; resigne the same unto you, not so much for supply of a supposed want in your own particular, of these Spirituall helps to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as for a testimony of observance and due respect Where my obligation is so great. When I plowed with mine own heifer, a smiling autumn failed not to crown those weaker performances with a plenteous &amp; lasting crop for after-use. But to usher in these Holy Prayers and sacred expressions of a faithfull Soule, into the
<pb facs="6"/> approbation and use, of all that know their Author or his works. His name (as I suppose) will suffice. And hence is it Madame: that I presume of your good allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for them to beare your name in their Frontispice, that thereby others may be excited and induced to the perusall and use of them in the frequent practice both of this sacred duty, and of the works of mercy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the other subsequent Tractates annex't do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite. The perusall of which as in order they stand
<pb facs="6"/> rankt, with like good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I commend to those your Olive branches, that stand about your table, to whom any tie of precedent relation may iustly claime my respect. All which I shall not faile to second with continuance of my daily prayers for your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diships health and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, both in your stemme and branches, and will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rest</p>
