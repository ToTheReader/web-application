   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not ignorant (good Readers) of the
manyfold daungers, wherinto (what so
euer he be) he wyllyngly, as yt wer, casteth
hym self, who publysheth any thyng to
the world in wrytyng. The whych confy
deration after that I had well weighed, and deepely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
wyth my self, of what mynde I was touchyng the
sendyng abroade of thys lytle treatyfe of myne, any man
may easely iudge. For I, besydes those sawcy snaphaunces,
and murmuryng <hi>momi,</hi> whome no mans doyngs can ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ase
but there owne (which fortune I tooke to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to me wyth many) foresawe also my self, not wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
good cause in apparence, ready to fall in to the iust
and lawfull reprehension, euen of those, whose iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I haue alwayes both loued, and feared: the wyser,
the learneder and the better sort also. Whylest after so god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so graue, so exact a worck, most amply treatyng of the
same matter: I, of all other moost vnfyt therefore, should
seeme to take pen in hand to wryte agayne.</p>
   <p>This one cause, appeared to me to be of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that I was euen fully resolued to stay my hand, and
trauell herein no farder. When sodenly (beholde) emon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
dyuerse other, it camme to my mynde to thynck, on
the earnest desyre, and godly greedy hunger of my pooer
countrymen: (I meane not the Catholykes only, but
euen of those whome simplicitie not malice hath caused
to stray) whereof I was to my great comfort dayly enfor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med,
wyth what labour they fought for, wyth what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
they harckened after, wyth what sauory appetyte

they receaued in to ther myndes, and as it wer deuoured,
such bookes as brought them any tydyngs of the truthe.

hys, and because hys habylytie serueth hym not to
gyue as muche, gyue nothyng at all: euen so me thought
it fared wyth me, who myndyng these two whole yeares
past, to conferre some part of that small prouysyon, that
allmyghty god hath bestowed on me, to publyke cōmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dytie,
could not now, (I perswaded my self) suppresse
and kepe in the same, wythout the manyfest offendyng
of hys holy spyryt, who fyrst moued me thereto, and
some iniury to hym also, whose liberalitie (to the hynde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
perhapps of some) I should by thys meanes abuse.</p>
   <p>Thus much thought I necessary good Readers, to
sygnyfye to you concernyng thys enterpryse of myne.
Where in yf happely I seeme to some, ouer sclenderly to
haue excused my self, them referre I to hys iudgement,
for my meanyng herein, who shall once iudge both me yf
I haue not gonne vpryghtly but troden a wrye, and them
yf they haue not iudged syncerlye, but demed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysse.
