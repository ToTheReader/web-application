   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue viewed &amp; perused exactly a certaine smale vollume publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by Sir Humfrey Linde. He intituleth it <hi>the safe way,</hi> but I finde it containes nothing either safe or sound. To make it more plausible he giues it a Latin inscripton printing in the front of it, <hi>via tuta,</hi> not much vnlike to the practise of Mountibanks, who to make their pouders more vendible set on their boxes strange titles to persuade the ignorant, they are farre fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched &amp; of care vertue. He calleth it <hi>a waie lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alle Christians to the true Catholike Church.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But indeede it is no waye but rather a diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, or diuersion: or if it be a way, its onely a by-way leading sinple soules into woods &amp; deserts &amp; leauing them there vnmercifully to be deuoured by rauenous beasts. If it be any way at all, it is not <hi>via tuta,</hi> but rather <hi>via torta,</hi> &amp; a Kinde of negatiue way consisting in nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true Catholike way, &amp; therefore as according to the doctrine of Aristotle, <hi>negatio est malignantis naturoe, negation is of a malignant
<pb facs="3"/> nature,</hi> so it being a negatiue way, it cannot possible be any other then <hi>via, malignantium, the way of the malignant &amp; reprobate people.</hi> He addes it <hi>leadeth to the true auncient &amp; Catholike faith now professed in the Church of England,</hi> but this confirmeth that which I said before, that his way is no true way but a by-way as leading to a by-place, to a Countrie &amp; people separated from the rest of the world, <note place="margin">
         <hi>Tote diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus orbe Britannus.</hi>
      </note> conducting to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diuided from the rest of the earth, as in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation so is it separated in Religion from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yea from it selfe, from the trueth, from antiquitie, as being no more auncient in all poynts then the daies of Queene Elizabeth as her 39. articles plainely testifie, diuerse of them being first proclaimed by her &amp; her parliament: hither the way leadeth &amp; there it leaueth the poore traueller at a <hi>non plus,</hi> without any meanes to passe vnto Christ &amp; his Apostles.</p>
   <p>He saith farther in the title that euen the Romanists <hi>his aduersaries doe testifie,</hi> the safety of his way: but this is most ridiculous &amp; most false of all the rest of his inscription; he citeth indeed greate tropes of authors in pretense of his positions, some of which are true Catholike writers, but others not acknowledged for such by vs, others manistly knowen to be his owne consectaries: &amp; all those that are truly ours, he doth eyther malitiously, or ignorantly abuse, &amp; so doth but make checker-worke or Crosse
<pb facs="3"/> lines of them alto gether for his ministers to play in the pulpit with their parishioners at fox &amp; geese.</p>
   <p>I imagin'd his name had bene Line, but now I perceiue certainely it is not, for he vseth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther line nor square in his booke, I meane nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther method nor square dealing. For setting aside his prologue &amp; Epilogue, his first chapter, or section might aswell haue bene the last &amp; the laste his first as otherwise, &amp; as for his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie, it is not to be found, either in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, midle or ending: wherefore if his name be Linde as he subscribeth, it is more agreeable to the inside of his worke, which is very well linde indeede I meane with lies. And the trueth is the greatest part of his pamphlet is but ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne brokery stuffe, dropped from <hi>whites way</hi> &amp; <hi>B. Mourtons</hi> patched <hi>Appeale,</hi> forged <hi>Imposture,</hi> &amp; vshers outrages, excepting some frenchwares taken out of the corrupted store house of that famous mountibanke <hi>Daniel Chamiere,</hi> with whom I perceaue his worship hath had no smale corespondence.</p>
   <p>He stileth himselfe knight which no doubt he is, but as that title soundes honestie, honor, and nobillitie, so none of that I finde in his booke, which is so replenishsd with bragges, boasts, and protestations, as one would sweare him rather to be a protesting puritan, then a pure Protestant.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>Which with other reasons moue me to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the booke is not his, but a ministerial ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard fathered vpon his nobilitie for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authoritie of the worke: but that I will not much examine: onely this I say that when I had read it, I did soma't doubt whether the knight could be so versed in our Roman di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines as (thou' to little purpose) the penner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeres to be: which caused me to suspect the true authour is some one of greater reading and industrie then I imagin Sir Humfrey is: <note place="margin">
         <hi>Spuria multorum patrum proles.</hi>
      </note> yet on the other side I am verelie perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that considering the multitude of ignorant absurdities it conteines; the authour of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a man of any sollide learning in diuinity, which being supposed, I cannot absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Sir Humfrey for taking vpon him the name, yet he cannot be iudged wholely excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable in his honor for that he consented to be the putatiue Father of so base a bratte.</p>
   <p>This which I haue is the third edition, &amp; the fourth may be dailie expected, in regard the booke is so full of matter, I meane of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yet after the contents come once to be exactely discussed &amp; discouered, I persuade my selfe it will quikly loose it vndeserued credit, &amp; the dubtlesse if the leaues were larger it would ride poaste to Tobaconistis, &amp; grossers shops.</p>
   <p>I confesse Sir Humfrey I am Tom. Teltruth who cannot flatter or dissemble: yet may you
<pb facs="4"/> assure your selfe that altho' my speeche be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily directed vnto your selfe, my intent is directly to reprooue those onelie who in their contriuing of the worke for you, &amp; in your name, haue so profanely misapplyed, &amp; abused sacred scriptures, ancient Fathers, &amp; an num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other graue &amp; Catholike authors so corruptedlie produced against their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed faith. Neyther yet haue I anie meaning by my words to offēde the dignitie of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which I respect in the highest degree of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, as neither the persons of those who truely are the authors of the worke, &amp; haue deceiued both you &amp; others: but rather with charitable S. Aug. I chiuse to say of you &amp; euery one of my aduersaries in religion: <hi>Homo viuat, moriatur error.</hi> Let the man liue, the error dye.</p>
   <p>But now I will descend to particulars, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter due examine passe my sentence vpon euerie seuerall section, cheefelie insisting in discussion of the citations of the aduersarie, dedicating my whole censure not to the gentrie of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie as Sir Humfrey doth, and of whose mature Iudgments I can not conceiue so basely as once to imagin they will be dangerouslie enamored with his booke, but I will cheefelie offer it to the more vulgar ranke of people who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their smaler tallents may more easely be circumuented, whom if by conferring the one booke with the other I shall vnderstand they
<pb facs="5"/> come to be right informed of the trueth, I shall hould my selfe sufficientlie rewarded by them as by those whose wauering mindes I onely intend to rectifie by my labors, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for anie matter of substance I finde in the booke, I professe I should neuer haue esteemed it worth the paines I haue taken in the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it.</p>
