   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HAT Epigrams are in Poetrie, the same are Ayres in musicke, then
in their chiefe perfection when they are short and well seasoned. But
to clogg a light song with a long Praeludium, is to corrupt the nature
of it. Manie rests in Musicke were inuented either for necessitie of
the fuge, or granted as a harmonicall licence in songs of many parts▪ but in Ayres I find no vse they haue, vnlesse it be to make a vulgar, and triuiall modulation
seeme to the ignorant strange, and to the iudiciall tedious. A naked Ayre without guide,
or prop, or colour but his owne, is easily censured of euerie care, and requires so much the
more inuention to make it please. And as <hi>Martiall</hi> speakes in defence of his short Epigrams,
so may I say in th' apologie of Ayres, that where there is a full volume, there can be no impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of shortnes. The Lyricke Poets among the Greekes, and Latines were first inuenters
of Ayres, tying themselues strictly to the number, and value of their sillables, of which sort
you shall find here onely one song in Saphicke verse, the rest are after the fascion of the time,
eare-pleasing rimes without Arte. The subiect of them is for the most part amorous, and
why not amorous songs, as well as amorous attires? Or why not new Ayres, as well as new
fascious? For the Note and Tabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ture, if they satisfie the most, we haue our desire, let ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
masters please themselues with better. And if anie light error hath escaped vs, the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
may easily correct it, the vnskilfull will hardly perceiue it. But there are some, who to
appeare the more deepe, and singular in their iudgement, will admit no Musicke but that
which is long, intricate, bated with fuge, chaind with sincopation, and where the nature of
euerie word is percisely exprest in the Note, like the old exploided action in Comedies, when
it they did pronounce <hi>Memeni,</hi> they would point to the hinder part of their heads, if <hi>Video,</hi>
put their finger in their eye. But such childish obseruing of words is altogether ridiculous,
and we ought to maintaine as well in Notes, as in action a manly cariage, gracing no word,
but that which is eminent, and emphaticall. Neuertheles, as in Poesie we giue the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
to the Heroicall Poeme, so in Musicke we yeeld the chiefe place to the graue, and well
inuented Motet, but not to euery harsh and dull confused Fantasie, where in multitude of
points the Harmonie is quite drowned. Ayres haue both their Art and pleasure, and I will
conclude of them as the Poet did in his censure, of <hi>Catullus</hi> the Lyricke, and <hi>Vergil</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke
