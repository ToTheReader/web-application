be not knowen to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet your Honor is wel knowen vnto me: and (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) to whom not? I haue no small time (be it spoken without blasphemie) euen worshipt your Worth; and therefore now offer vp vnto it, all the reuenewes of my reuerence. I was the rather induced to dedicate it to your Honour, by reason that my father was a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to your Father, being much obliged vnto him; and my whole Family vnto your selfe. And next of all, to giue you thankes in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of all Gentrie; which is daylie bettered by your

Lordships directions, and furtherances in all honest courses. Desert was fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Desert, before your Lordship called her home from exile, &amp; clad hir wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-beaten limmes.
