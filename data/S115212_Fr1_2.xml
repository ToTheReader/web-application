   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Onourable, worshipfull, &amp; belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, at the last I am come to the execution of my first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the dedication of this Crosse labour. It was long since prepared for you, and now at the length presented vnto you, the Lord giue all of you a spirituall blessing by it. Some honourable, and many favourable gales of winde haue at length brought home this
<hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi> vnto you, though in my labour in conducting ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I haue ventured my credit to the wide sea of common opinion. I confesse it is not the <hi>Merchant Royall</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Salomon,</hi> laden with gold, and silver, ivory, and apes and Peacocks: But yet is such a
<hi>Merchant</hi> as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in all his riches was not so great as he. It is a holie and heavenly Merchant carefull in search, happy in successe whom neither the tediousnesse of the way, nor difficultie of the straites could hinder, but that he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth through the worlds Ocean, with speede, and gaine, and glorie, Christ being his Pilot, faith his sterne, hope
<pb facs="3"/>his ancor, Conscience his carde, good works his lading, happinesse his landing, and his haven heaven.</p>
   <p>At that great Marte whereas I was commaunded this businesse I fitted the time with this Text, I hope this Text fitted some of you at that time, and my praier vnto God shall be that you may be fitted by this vnto the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of your eternall salvation, and so I commend these labours vnto you, and your selues and them vnto God.</p>
