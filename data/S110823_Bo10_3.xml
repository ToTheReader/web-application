   <head>The Authors admonition to the <hi>Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloued <hi>Reader,</hi> it is about fourteene yeares past, since I was commanded by the late Illustrate and most vertuous Princesse <hi>Iean, Queene</hi> of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> to reduce the <hi>Historie</hi> of <hi>Iudith,</hi> in forme of a <hi>Poeme Epique.</hi> Wherein I haue not so much aimed to followe the phrase or text of the Bible, as I haue preased (without wandring from the verity of the History) to imitate <hi>Homer</hi> in his <hi>Iliades,</hi> &amp; <hi>Virgill</hi> in his <hi>Aenel dos,</hi> and others who hath left to vs works of such like matter: therby to render my work so much the more delectable. And if the effect hath not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to my desire, I beseech thee to lay the fault vpon her who proposed to me so meane a <hi>Theame</hi> or subiect, and not on me who could not honestly disobey. Yet in so much as I am the first in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> who in a iust <hi>Poeme</hi> hath treated in our tongue of sacred things, I hope of thy fauour to receiue some excuse; seeing that things of so great weight cannot be both perfectly begunne and ended together. If thou neither allow my stile nor workmanship, at least thou shalt be driuen to allowe the honest pretence and holy desire which I haue to see the youth of <hi>Fraunce</hi> so holily by mine example exercised.</p>
   <p>I may not forget, that they doe greatly wrong me, who thinks that in discriuing the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (truely tragicall) I am becomne a voluntary Aduocate to these troublesome and sedicious spirits, who (for to
<pb facs="458"/>
serue their temerarious passiōs, and priuate inspiratiōs) conspires against the liues of placed princes. For, so much doe I disassent that this example and the like ought to be drawen in consequence, that I am verily perswaded that the act of <hi>Ahud,</hi> of <hi>Iaell,</hi> and of <hi>Iudith,</hi> who vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of obeysance &amp; pretext of ami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y layd their reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hands vpon <hi>Aeglon, Sisara,</hi> and <hi>Holophernes:</hi> had been worthy of a hundreth gallowes, a hundreth fires, and a hundreth wheeles, if they had not been peculiarly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen of God for to vnloose the chains, and break the bands which retain'd the <hi>Hebrew</hi> people in more then <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> seruitude, and expresly called to kill those Tyrants with a death as shamefull as their liues were wicked and abhominable. But seeing this question is so diffuse that it cannot be absolued in fewe words, and that my braine is too weak for so high an enterprise; I send you to those who haue spent more oyle and time in turning the leaues of the sacred scriptures, then I haue done for the present. It me sufficeth for the time to admonish the <hi>Reader,</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothing without a clear and indubitable vocation of God against those whom he hath erected aboue vs; and aboue all things, not to abuse the law of humane hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and other holy bands, for to giue place to these frene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike opinions so to abolish a pretended tyranny. I haue also to warne thee of two different sorts of men: of the which one sort is so depraued that they can heare nothing, but that which is altogether prophane; and the other is so supersticious, that they make conscience not onely to write, but also to read of holy things in verse, as though that the measure and iointure of syllabes were so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained as it were vnpossible to keepe the sense vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted,
<pb facs="459"/>
or at least not excessiuely obscured. Now if I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that this my first assay may bee to thee agreeable, I shall continue more gladly my newe commenced race, in such sort that thou shalt not repent thine indulgence nor I my passed pains. But if contrarie fall, in time to come I wil be ware to lày out my smalpack in this ample <hi>Theatre</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> where there is almost as many Iudgements as beholders. A Dieu.</p>
