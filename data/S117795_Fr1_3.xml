      <salute>SIR:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it pleased you to</hi> appoint mee a certaine time, to giue answere of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, or refusal of Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: So I haue at last resolued to offer it vnto you in these my Letters; Confessing ingenuously, (for some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects seeming weighty to my poore iudgement) my vnwillingnesse thereto, if by any meanes I
<pb facs="5"/> might auoide it: Howbeit, seeing I see the sway of Authoritie ouer-ruling, and inforcing thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, partly in obedience to it, and partly for other more important reasons swaying my Conscience; I giue you to vnderstand, that I am resolued to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. To the which resolution, I confesse I was the rather drawen, by the mixture of your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete proceedings, yet not so much driuen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by your publike authoritie, as drawen by your priuate lenitie and kindnesse, and vndeserued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect vnto my meannesse; I being well acquainted with the common condition of mans will which may be induced, when it cannot be inforced. And I trust with equall good conscience and successe, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede and continue in seruice vnto God and to his Church in this my Conformitie, as before I did in not Conforming: And I heartily wish, that in the like case all others did the like. This I can say, that my indeauours haue not beene wanting to perswade others, wherein I haue preuailed with not a few: And I am perswaded, that if my reasons of this point, might see the light (authoritie giuing way thereunto) it would more preuaile to induce men of contrarie iudgement, then many other bookes pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to that purpose. Not for any worth of Art
<pb facs="5"/> or reading that is in them more then others, my selfe being the meanest of many thousands for a matter of this nature: But partly in respect of the qualitie of the penner, (which haue beene I confesse a Non-conformitan) and partly because of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion prooued, which inforceth the imputation of a sinne vpon the sufferers of silencing for not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; a matter which of all things the Ministers of this kinde will least indure: And partly also for the sufficiency of the Truth presented in those reasons.</p>
   <p>Now, if any shall thinke the booke vnfit to bee published, because it reacheth not home to prooue the conueniency or necessitie of the Ceremonies themselues: they may bee pleased to consider, that this position of mine, being onely proposed by way of presupposall, concludeth nothing to crosse that. I haue endeauoured to prooue this, others (whose knowledge and dexteritie is greater) haue libertie to prooue further if they please. But this I may more then probably affirme, that the very most of not conforming Ministers will hearken vnto this, when (I am assured) they will not vnto that. My reasons I offer to your Learned view, and correction of authoritie. If any thing bee found in them hindering the passage thereof, I wish it bee
<pb facs="6"/> censured with a <hi>Deleatur:</hi> For that my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not rashly to thrust out any thing offensiue to authoritie, but that which may bee to the profit of the Church: Which I humbly desire of God in this, and al other mine indeauours for his owne names sake. To whose sauing grace in Christ, I commend you, with many thankes for your many vndeserued fauours. This 21. of October 1617. <hi>Thornebury.</hi>
