   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>READER, Let not thy gentle eye disdaine</l>
      <l>To walke along my lines so smooth so plaine;</l>
      <l>Delightfull walkes they happily may proue,</l>
      <l>So they may catch thy liking, I thy loue;</l>
      <l>This volume, (though not large) at large discouers</l>
      <l>The fortunes of a payre of princely Louers,</l>
      <l>Prince <hi>Curan</hi> and the Princesse <hi>Argentile.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>He stranger, she a natiue of our Isle.</l>
      <l>He one for lineaments, and gifts of mind:</l>
      <l>Such as the like to him was hard to find:</l>
      <l>And sure, if to be amorous be no blot</l>
      <l>To vertue, then his vertues had no spot,</l>
      <l>And shee, a dame whose beauty so excell'd,</l>
      <l>That in those dayes shee was not paralell'd,</l>
      <l>And, if she were not coy more then shee should,</l>
      <l>No imputation could on her take hold,</l>
      <l>How loue, from Lordlinesse doth him debace,</l>
      <l>And makes him to supply a peasants place:</l>
      <l>And how his loue to shunne, th'assaults of loue,</l>
      <l>From Court to Cottage doth her selfe remoue.</l>
      <l>These things are here discourst, and here is showne</l>
      <l>How he the second time loues her vnknowne,</l>
      <l>How long he wooes her, how at last he sped,</l>
      <l>Though not till then, when all his hopes were dead,</l>
      <l>Then how he conquered him in bloudie fight</l>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <l>That wrongfully vsurpt his Ladyes right,</l>
      <l>(Then which) his former taske was farre more hard,</l>
      <l>This last was easie with the first compar'd,</l>
      <l>T'was more to him his Ladyes loue to gaine</l>
      <l>Then to giue end vnto a tyrants raigne:</l>
      <l>To conquer her affections was a thing</l>
      <l>More hard to him then to vncrowne a King,</l>
      <l>Nay, all the weapons in these wars imployde,</l>
      <l>Against the Prince, not him so much annoy'd,</l>
      <l>As did his Ladies angry frownes, for those</l>
      <l>Could daunt him more then all his armed foes:</l>
      <l>How he was rays'd vnto a Kingly throne,</l>
      <l>That low deiections long had vndergone,</l>
      <l>Concludes this booke, which read vnto the end,</l>
      <l>Perhaps to thee, it may it selfe commend:</l>
      <l>Thus (of thy wishes) wishing thee possest,</l>
      <l>(For kind acceptance onely.) Thine I rest.</l>
