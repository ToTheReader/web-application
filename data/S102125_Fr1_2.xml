      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS petty Pamphlet (for so I may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stile it, then a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise) being so bold against the abuses of
<pb facs="3"/>the tongue, cannot but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the criticall censure of many a Tongue. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious tongue wil defame it, the Scorners Tongue deride it, the Slanderous Tongue back-bite it, the Censorious Tongue will whip it, the Curious toung will hang, draw, &amp; quarter it: Therefore it needeth a protecting Patronage, to giue some coūtenance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, against those oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which it is likely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre by cōming vnder the Presse. And what fitter Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage could it find then your two names? both which, for the Tongue, the
<pb facs="3"/>one in witty speech, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in discreet silence, not my self alone, but diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also haue held in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Besides that, the neere affinity, wherewith, of late, by marriage, I am linked vnto your Family, and the many fauours vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same by you both vouchsafed vnto mee, do require this as a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of my gratefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the same. I haue therefore presumed to Dedicate vnto you both, a as monumēt of my duty which I owe vnto you both, this poore present, humbly desiring a fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="4"/>acceptance. Though it enrich not your coffers, yet it may your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for herein you shall finde (although vnpolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) both an <hi>Antidote</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a bad Tongue, and an <hi>Amulet</hi> for a good Tongue; how we may bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle our owne, how wee may tame others Toungs. <hi>In many things wee sin all:</hi> And many times wee all sinne with this little mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, our vnruly Tongue. And what man liueth but is wronged by the tongue? Happy is that man who can auoide the strife of Tongues; happier he that
<pb n="177" facs="4"/>can set a watch before his owne tongue: A patterne for both these is here proposed. God blesse it, both to you both, and to all that reade it. And so humbly crauing pardō for this my boldnes, I cōmend you both to the Lord, and to the Word of his Grace, who is able to perfect that good worke which he hath begun in you.</p>
