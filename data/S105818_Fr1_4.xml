   <head>The summe of the Apocalyps.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>IOhns</hi> Apocalyps telleth, that Christ shewed the state
to come, to the ende of the world; &amp; a vision of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
as vnto Daniel, chap. 10. this doth hee, chap. 1.
And in singular sweetnes to the seaven starres, in the seaven
golden Candlestickes, all these partes be applyed with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against all Arrianes, that the <hi>Eternall, the sonne of God,</hi>
the <hi>Creator of the world,</hi> is he, that appeared vnto <hi>Daniel.</hi> So,
<hi>Iohn</hi> expoundeth <hi>Daniel,</hi> into Salvation of all Iewes of grace.
This goeth through chap. 2. &amp; 3. in easie facilitie.</p>
   <p>Now for tymes to come, this appeareth, chap. 4. God
on a throne fitteth a iudge, like <hi>Iasper,</hi> for <hi>Beniamins</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
&amp; <hi>Sardius</hi> as <hi>Ruben:</hi> to fight for the tribes. And Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
in state Persones, are 24. Bishops, and besides good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this in, chap. 4. Then the <hi>Lambe</hi> and <hi>Lion</hi> openeth the
Booke of seaven seales, chap. 5. then hee cometh further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Caesares,</hi> on horse, white: with plaguing riders, vpon
red, blacke, pale; For the martyrs, who crave to destroy the
Empire, but are bid to expect <hi>Diocletianes</hi> persecution. Then
shall their profane world be rowled vp, chap. 6. After that,
a generall apostasie commeth, chap. 7. Howe that falleth
out, the seaventh seale doth shew. Christ standeth at the
golden Altar, to receive all prayers, &amp; Rome bendes a policy
against all this. Therevpon Christ, as in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> casteth fire
into the earth: and Angels trompetters sound howe haile
and fire is mixt with blood: by that, Popes bee made a
mountaine: so a mountaine of fire cast into the worlds sea,
<pb n="14" facs="8"/>
to set all on fire: when the <hi>starre-Byshop</hi> falleth from his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
to turne the Law-waters, into wormewood and to
darken the chiefe Sunne, Moone, and Starres: comming vp
by falling, and by turning the Scriptures into gall, soone
darkening the third part of the Church: that three woes
are pronounced, chap. 8. By his keies of the pitt, whence he
fetched the wormwood of his haeresies, he bringeth <hi>locastes</hi>
of <hi>Monkes</hi> to devour all the West, and able to make warres,
and becommeth <hi>King of Locusts:</hi> and maketh warres: and so
becommeth a firie mountaine, to make haile and fire mixt
with blood. This was one woe. He weakned the East Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
to set vp the Saracens: and is plagued from <hi>Euphrates:</hi>
as his Idolatry and treachery turned away the East, chap. 9.
Christ reviveth the Gospell, when men eate the little booke,
teaching againe, how hee is the Angell of Covenant, and
Mediator for the faithfull, chap. 10. Martyrs bring policies
to see what the king of Locusts his Citie or policie is: and
he falleth, and the Gospell is restored: and he falleth with
worlds ende, chap. 11. The same matter is repeated for <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sares</hi>
and <hi>Pope</hi> in a dragon of Romane Armes. As it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Egypt, chap. 11. and Pharaoh, a <hi>Dragon,</hi> Esai. 27. The
vpper parte of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> is shewed to be the <hi>Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:</hi>
one, compiled of the foure in Daniel: and the taile is
expounded to be the beast arising from the earth, chap. 11.
or King of Locusts, chap. 9. <hi>he reuiueth the former empire,</hi> so,
that none can live in it, without his marke, chap. 13. His
marke is to <hi>force Christians to Idolatrie.</hi> For which vilanie,
Romane <hi>Babilon</hi> is told of a fall, chap. 14. By vrging Idolatry,
he driveth from his Aegypt, the Church through a sea of fire
and fagot, into the wildernesse. Where the Tabernacle built
hath a smoke of Gods anger, and Angels seaven plague
him, as hee plagued all vnder the seaven Trompets: (Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="15" facs="8"/>
16.) For that our holy Martyrs calling for vengeance
from vnder the Altar rowled vp also the Popes heaven as
a booke rowled. The <hi>Beast</hi> revived hath no difference from
the former, but in bloody color, and the daughter <hi>Rome</hi>
riding vpon it, all bloody, Chapter 17. <hi>Rome</hi> shall fall as
<hi>Babilon</hi> &amp; <hi>Tyrus</hi> did, Chapter 18. It shall fall when all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones
sing <hi>Halelu-Iah</hi> vpon the destruction of the wicked,
with vnderstanding. Then the WORD of GOD, will catch
the Beast-false-prophet: the whole Dragon revived, and
cast him into a Lake burning with fire and brimstone:
which is the second death, Chapter 19. But the <hi>Romane
Dragon</hi> shall be tyed 1000. yeeres before the King of Locusts
deceiveth generally. But then hee makes a new <hi>Gog and
Magog:</hi> for the old <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and thereupon shalbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied,
as the old was, by the first coming, so he by the
second, of CHRIST, from a throne of iudgement: as the
old <hi>Gog and Magog</hi> was, Chapter 20. As <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Patmos</hi>
saw the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> so <hi>Patmos</hi> the Church, tossed
with <hi>Aegean</hi> waves shalbe in Gods fight such, as Isaiah,
Ezechiel, Aggei, and Zacharie spake of. CHRIST saluteth
vs poore heathen, with his owne most gracious voice.</p>
   <p>To him that loued vs, and hath washed vs from our sinnes
by his blood, be all honour &amp; glory for ever, Amen.</p>
   <bibl>Isaie 25.</bibl>
   <q>And hee (the <hi>ETERNAL</hi>) will destroy in this mountaine
the covering, that covereth all people, and the vaile,
that is spread vpon all nations.</q>
