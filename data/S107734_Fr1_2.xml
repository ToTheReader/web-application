Wherefore good Christian Reader, I be seech thee in the bowels of Iesus Christe, beware of these pestilēt hissing adders, whose poyson is not only in their cursed doctrine<note place="margin">Antichriste the head of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> manifestly against gods euerlasting word, but also in their sinful, shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; abhominable liues: their head, beeing that mā of sin &amp; childe of<note place="margin">1.

And albeit in vs our sinnes ought not to weigh against the truth, which the truth condēneth &amp; punisheth, &amp; we condemne in our selues, neither to discredit it, nor shake thy faith, because we measure it not by mens liues, which were to measure light by darknes: yet in them it ought, in whom both are ioyned together, false doctrine &amp; euill life: and of these thou oughtest to be warned, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thou maiest learne to iudge<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> thē, &amp; to know thē by their fruites. For as their professiō is wicked, so their liues are accursed: as they are Idolaters, so they are abhominable liuers, iustifiyng sin, &amp; maintaining it, &amp; lesning it, as afterwardes shal more plainely appeare. Neither is this to vncouer our fathers priut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties though they belaide open &amp; naked. For they are nofathers of<note place="margin">Sir Thomas Moore in his di alogues. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

They are those swine &amp; rauens that delight in nothing but carion, letting passe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is wholsome &amp; good, as not agreeing to their grosse appetite and humour. Therfore good Reader, euen as thou louest thine owne saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: beware of thē, learne to haue iudgement, that thou maiest discerne.
