   <p>I Thought it good (right worshipfull and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gentlemen) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with you this delightsome tract of strange deuises, barcly clothed in an English habite, voyde of al such ornaments as are due vnto the worthines thereof: presuming vpon your wisdomes, who had rather gather a pleasant flower springing amongst the sharpe thornes, for the sweet sauour, then a gay colored weede for all the fayre semblance: esteeming the value of the precious treasure not by the outward shewe, but the inward substance, sith often we finde by triall <hi>meliora la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere,</hi> and faire shewes to proue often fond shadowes. The tree <hi>Caliestephenon</hi> in <hi>Palestine,</hi> hath a corrupt barke, but a pure body: And well may a gallant blossome fit the humour of a delicate eye, when the gaynfull fruite shall satisfie the sauour of a discreet taste. But the Diamant hath ingendred a naturall forme, so that it neede no artificiall frame, a gay glosse may better beseeme a course

Kersey, then a fine Skarlet. My weake commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of these not able and rare inuentions, may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eclipse their credit, then purchase their fame, therefore I referre them to the censure of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate readers, for whose better vnderstand of the <hi>Imprese</hi> of <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> (who in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue erred from the common receiued precepts) I haue gathered into a certayne order the way of framing and composing all such kindes of deuises both militarie and amorous vsed at this day of the noble gentlemen of <hi>Europe,</hi> in adorning their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious triumphes, or declaring their inward preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded purposes and enterprises, not by speach or any apparent maner, but shadowed vnder a certayle vayle of formes or figures in such sort as shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be declared. And although that to signifie our intentions by these formes or figures, of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be not a thing more notable then speach or writing, which perfectly doe manifest any operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereas the other doth doubtfully discouer our pretences. Yet I say, that to represent vnto the sence of sight the forme or figure of any thing, is more natural in act, &amp; more cōmon to al creatures then is hearing, and thereupon sayth <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that we loue the sence of seeing, for that by it we are taught and made to learne more then by any other of our senses, whereby we see that all men naturally take delight in pictures, and euen litle children as soone as they can vse their hands at libertie, goe with a Cole to the wall, indeuoring to drawe the forme of this thing or that. This naturall disposition hath
<pb facs="10"/>
raigned generally euen from the beginning when the worde was but yet new, and induced nations first to figure beasts, plants, trees, celestiall signes, and such like, obseruing the nature and qualitie of euery creature represented by their figures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in time they became able to shewe their intent to their frends and others vayled vnder the forme of these creatures, in which facultie the AEgypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were most singulare as the first authors of this <hi>Hieroglyphicall</hi> art: as well do witnesse their sacred Colomnes dedicated to <hi>Mercurie,</hi> whereon were diuers formes and pictures wrought and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen, contayning great knowledge, which they called <hi>Hieroglyphi,</hi> To the which pillers <hi>Plato</hi> is sayde to haue gone and retourned with great profit. Yet notwithstanding, in my opinion their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise was vnperfect, by reason of the diuersitie of the natures of beastes and other things which they fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured. Whereupon they who drewe more neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our time seemeth to haue brought this art to perfection, by adding mots or posies to their sigures whereby they couertly disclose their intent by a more perfect order. Moreouer besides the figuring of things corporall and of visible forme, men haue also represented things incorporal, which they could not doe more fitly then by colours, as representing sorowe by blacke, defire to shed bloud by red, puritie by white, &amp;c. And now sith time hath brought to perfection many notable deuises, which rude anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie could not discerne: Let vs consider by howe many wayes we may discouer our secret intentions
<pb facs="11"/>
by colours and figures, as first by Liurees, secondly by Ensignes, thirdly by mots, and lastly by Imprese, of which foure kindes of Deuises, I purpose to set downe distinctly in fewe words their significations and properties, according to the opinion of the best authors which euer haue written of this matter.</p>
   <p>This worde <hi>Liuree</hi> is borowed of the Spanishe, which they write with, <hi>b librea,</hi> but pronounce it as written with <hi>v.</hi> Some say it had his <hi>Etemolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giè</hi> of <hi>Libro,</hi> for that <hi>Liurees</hi> are as an opē booke where a man may reade the intent of him which weareth them. Some also will haue it deriued of <hi>Libero,</hi> and that for two reasons, the one, in that from the beginning it hath beene a profession onely of Gentlemen, and noble personages: and although that seruaunts do commonly weare these <hi>Liurees,</hi> yet are they not said to be their owne but their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones. For <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Solon</hi> saieth, that seruauntes were forbidden any free exercise. The other reason may bce, for that the Authors setting them to the common vewe, being not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether apparent, commit them <hi>libero iudicio,</hi> to the free iudgement of the Interpreter. Some will haue it brought from the Latin, <hi>Liber eram,</hi> for that the principall purpose of <hi>Liurees</hi> haue been to shewe some amorous seruice, and for this onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent were they first inuented at the beginning, to shewe that they which did weare them, were no more free of them selues but subiect seruauntes to their Mistrisses: as who should say, <hi>Liber eram,</hi> I was free, but now bound: according to that of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,
<pb facs="11"/>
fuimus Troes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It is said that <hi>Liurees</hi> of only colours, had their originall after this manner: that the Gentlemen which loued or rather (to speake after the <hi>Spanish</hi> or <hi>Neapolitan</hi> manner) which serued any Lady, with that amorous kinde of seruice, which is vsed in those places, were accustomed, to marke with what coloured robe their Mistrisse was inuested, to the end to decke them selues with apparell of the same colour &amp; cut. But some supposing that to be to great a presumptiō, thought rather to addresse thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in a habite of the same colour, as did the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall seruantes of their Ladie, to denouate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, and shew them selues readic for any seruice commaunded by her soueranitie: Yet now, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers respectes, in this our time the discrete Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bound to the performance of this strict Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>fecrecie,</hi> haue deuised a closer couert for their amorous conceiptes, by colours and figures in their <hi>Liurees,</hi> which are now more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Deuises,</hi> in all the most florishing Countries of Christendome: which also is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottē of <hi>Ariosto,</hi> in these verses following, recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Deuise</hi> of <hi>Bradamante,</hi> whereby she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed her dispayre, and desire to die.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Era la soprauesta del colore</l>

      <l>Quando dal ramo è tolta, è che l'humore</l>
      <l>Che facea uiuo l'arbore, le manca:</l>
      <l>Ricamata à tronconi, era di fuore</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="12"/>Di cipresso, che mai non si rin francae</l>
      <l>Poi ch' ha sentito la dura bipenne</l>

   </q>
   <p>Thus in effect in English.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Her vpper robe of such like colour was,</l>
      <l>As is the fading leafe of palish hew</l>
      <l>Whē from the bowe the liuely fap doth passe</l>
      <l>Which nourish did the stock whereon it grew</l>
      <l>Embrodered al with braunches thick aboue,</l>
      <l>And fading bowes of dolefull Cipresse tree:</l>
      <l>Which cut with deadly axe doth neuer proue</l>
      <l>This habit with her griefe did well agree.</l>
   </q>
   <p>There are first, diligently to be obserued in these <hi>Dcuises</hi> or <hi>Liurces</hi> three things: The time when: The place where: and the maner how they are to be vsed. Concerning the time: they are neuer worne but either in true or fained warre, or at Iusts, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis, Maskes, or at such like extrauagant shewes. The place sit for them, are on armed men or Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, worne in such place as they best like about their persons: albeit the Helmet, the Shiclde, the Bardes, the borders of the garment, or the breast, are the fittest places appointed for them. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of vsing them is diuers, according to their <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:</hi> but first generally you are to obserue this, that they bee not too intricate in greate number, nor so confused that they neede some <hi>Apollo</hi> to resolue them. Perticularly it behoueth to note the deuition
<pb facs="12"/>
of their <hi>species</hi> which are of al kindes of <hi>Deuises</hi> or <hi>Liurees</hi> sixe. The first consisteth altogether of colours: The second of colours and figures: The third of colours and letters: The fourth of colours figures and letters: The fifth of figures onely: The sixth of figures and letters. Concerning the first colours alone, are now seldome vsed but of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or such like. As for example, a certaine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman on a time, hauing ill successe in his amorous feruico, and spending his time in dolor and griefe, was aduertised that the wife of a certaine freende of his was departed this life, whereupon it behoued him to put on mourning apparell: and hauing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to shewe himselfe at a feast, he clothed him in blacke Grogran drawne out with Taffatie, &amp; both cut on blacke Damaske, in such sorte that the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maske was best seene to bee blackest: which mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning habite was no soner seene of such as knewe the historie of his loue, but they perceiued What it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisied, as well as if he himselfe bad declared it: and greatly did they commend the inuention. For with the vppermost blacke he represented sorowe for the dead: with that vnderneath he mourned for his freend: but his owne blacke appeared more and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified some greater griefe, and that of his frend see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med lesse, and represented lesse in effect. For in his opinion lesse griefe was it to bee depriued of a wife, sith she is called to the heauens, then to stand seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the fauour of a proude disdainefull dame, whilest an other enioyes the fruite of his desirued affections. But to returne to our purpose, <hi>Liurees</hi>
      <pb facs="13"/>
of onely colours, and also with colours and figures are wont to serue in effect, but for the shewe of one day, either at Iusts, Maskes, or other solemne fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuall sportinges, where are commonly assembled a great multitude of people: and to the end that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Gentlewomen (which giue the vew but as they passe by, among so great a companie) may not stande to muse about the intention of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, there is vsed a mot to declare the meaning, &amp; these kinde of mots pertayning to <hi>Liurees,</hi> are to bee composed in the same language which is there vsed where they are presented: and it is requisite they bee shorte so that they exceede not two of our verses: very rarely are they made of foure, yet so they may be if neede require. These mots so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed serue for colours alone, or els for colours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with figures, or with figures alone: and when they shalbe ioyned with colours alone, yet are they called <hi>Liurces,</hi> when with colours, figures and the mot, which shall exceede three wordes being manifest of it selfe and seruing for no other purpose but to declare the signification of the colours and figures, they are likewise then called <hi>Liurees</hi> or <hi>Insegnes,</hi> and as I haue before sayd, they serue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for one day. These last properties rehearsed, that the mot may passe three wordes, and that it must be plaine and manifest, seruing onely to disclose the meaning of the colours and figures: note well, for therein consisteth the difference betweene <hi>Liurees</hi> and <hi>Impreses,</hi> which are altogether diuers. The ignoraunce of which distinction deceiued many in
<pb facs="13"/>
the composing of <hi>Impreses.</hi> And also <hi>Iouius</hi> him self in his discourses following was greatly ouersene in putting no difference betweene <hi>Impreses, Liu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rees,</hi> and <hi>Insegnes,</hi> as you may plainely perceiue. This worde <hi>Insegne</hi> is taken from the Latin, by the which is signified Standards, Banners, and also the Helmets of the chiefe Souldiers and Captaines, as may appeare in this verse of <hi>Virgil.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Danaumque insignia nobis.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Aptemus Clypeos,</hi> but chiefly it is now taken for Standards or Banners, which are capable of all such properties mentioned before in <hi>Liurees,</hi> as either of colours alone, as when they are all red, all white, all blacke, &amp;c. Or when they are of seuerall colours, as white and red, or in like maner of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To them also may bee added mots, as many notable men haue vsed of late time: &amp; also colours with figures, or figures alone: all in such maner as hath bene shewne in <hi>Deuises</hi> or <hi>Liurees.</hi> The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe is also fit for <hi>Impreses,</hi> of the which I am hereafter to speake, and many therein set the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of their house: whereof to recite examples this shorte Preface will not afforde, sith ech of them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally require a whole volume. only suffice it, brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we touch them, to the end we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderstande the forme of <hi>Impreses:</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to hādle, it is necessary that I say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of <hi>Mots,</hi> which truely are of great excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie if they bee gallantly composed. And first this word <hi>mot</hi> signifieth as much as <hi>Gnome,</hi> a shorte sentence or Posie, whose places are diuers. Some
<pb facs="14"/>
vse to set them on gates, as that which (according to the fiction of the Poet) was set on Hell gate. <hi>Lasciate ogni speranza voi chi intrate.</hi> Lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all hope, all you which enter in.</p>
   <p>A ridiculous mot or posie is not to be vsed but in some occasion of maskes, or to quip an enemy, as for example, a certaine Cardinal in Rome for some offence being imprisoned, and after put to death, it was bruted abroade, that the Pope had done it to pleasure two of his <hi>Nephewes</hi> with his liuings, wherupon one liuely pictured the sayd Cardinall on the Crosse, and the two yong Cardinals preferred to his liuings, at his feet beholding him with this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in their hands, <hi>Crucifixus etiā pro nobis.</hi> But the mots which are chiefly vsed, are either amorus or graue, &amp; they beare a great grace if they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cōposed with their circūstances &amp; properties, so that they be short, &amp; exceede not if it be possible a verse in any tongue. Yet Latin &amp; Greek verses of six feete are to long to be vsed whole, wherefore of thē it is better to take a part, as <hi>nullū scelus error habebat.</hi> And better are they esteemed being takē out of some famos autor. As out of <hi>Ouid, Horace, Catullus</hi> and other Latin <hi>Poets,</hi> out of <hi>Homer, Hesidus, Callimachus,</hi> or any good author of the <hi>Greekes</hi> out of <hi>Petrarch, Deuine Ariosto, Dāte Bembo,</hi> and other famous in the <hi>Italian</hi> tōgue, &amp; aboue all, if it be possible, let them leaue some scruple whereon to meditate, to him who either readeth or heares them, and it is lawfull to vse them without figures, although that <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> vainly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb facs="14"/>
them so vsed, soules without bodies.</p>
   <p>There is also another kind of <hi>Deuise</hi> called in <hi>Italian, Cifre celate,</hi> which many haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vsed being ignorant of <hi>Imprese,</hi> which inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is onely for youth, and very vnfit for men of grauitie, seruing thē but to sport with their Ladies, by cōuaying their names into some Posie or figure, which they ware in tokē of their seruice, of this kind you shal find fit examples in <hi>Paulus Iouius,</hi> which I haue noted in the <hi>Margent.</hi> The inuention is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together barraine, and vtterly disliked of the wise.</p>
   <p>Thus hauing briefly touched the principall points of the former <hi>Deuises,</hi> it resteth that I say somewhat of <hi>Impreses,</hi> which is the most notable, ingenious and perfect king of all other. And first to declare the signification of the worde, with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, I say, that <hi>Impresa</hi> is vsed of the <hi>Italians</hi> for an enterprise, takē in hand with a firme &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stāt intēt to bring the same to effect. As if a Prince or Captaine taking in hand some enterprise of war, or any other perticulare affaire, desirous by some fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure &amp; mot to manifest to the world his intēt, this figure &amp; mot together is called an Impresa, made to signifie an enterprise, wherat a noble mind leueling with the aime of a deepe desire, striues with a stedy intēt to gaine the prise of his purpose. For the valiāt &amp; hautie gentlemen, disdayning to cōioine with the vile and base <hi>Plebeians</hi> in any rustique inuention, haue procured to thēselues this one most singulare, which time hath now at length perfited and rought into a more regulare order. And the chiefe places
<pb facs="15"/>
whereō they vse to weare these their <hi>Impreses</hi> are their <hi>Standards, Shields, Helmets, Brooches, Tablets</hi> or such like. The time when, is either in Warres, Iusts, or amorous seruices. And you are to note, that <hi>Impreses</hi> are not Hereditarie, as are Armes, for the sonne may not vse the <hi>Impresa</hi> of father, nor the successors of their ancestors, and it behoueth that they be of no other colours, saue ono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blacke and white, vnlesse it be rather to adorne them, then for any necessitie, and chiefly in the composing of them, are to be noted these fiue proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. First, that they haue not many kinds of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent formes, for at the most there can be but three, in a perfect <hi>Impresa,</hi> vnlesse they be parts of the whole: as the Sunne, Moone and Starres repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent onely the heauens, which may be the intent of the <hi>Impresa:</hi> or as many trees flowers and herbs, represent onely a Garden. As for example, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne gentleman figured a garden with <hi>Palmes, Bayes, Marigolds</hi> and <hi>Roses,</hi> with this mot. <hi>Tu haec omnia,</hi> to signifie that his mistresse deserued the <hi>Palme</hi> for her beautie, &amp; that she was free frō the assalt of <hi>Loue</hi> as is the <hi>Lawrell</hi> frō the wrath of the heauens, that she drewe the eyes of his mind after her, as doth the Sunne the Marigolde, and that by the vertue of her comfortable lookes she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued his heart, as doe the ioyful beames the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Rose. But now in any other case diuers formes are not to be vsed.</p>
   <p>Secondly, the mot or posie of an <hi>Impresa</hi> may not exceede three words, vnlesse it be composed of
<pb facs="15"/>
some of these. <hi>Dum. Nec. Et. Non. In. Per. Aut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si. Cum. Vt.</hi> and then may it haue foure, as <hi>Nec spe nec metu.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, that the mot be taken out of some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous author. This precept is good, but not alwayes necessarie.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, that it be not altogether manifest nor too too obscure, neither yet triuiall or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
   <p>Fifthly, that the figure without the mot, or the mot without the figure signifie nothing, in respect of the intent of the author, and this precept is of great importance, for many ignorant hereof, haue composed <hi>Imprese</hi> altogether vayne and voyde of all inuention. As when the figure of it selfe or the mot of it selfe, suffice to declare the meaning, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either the one or the other is superfluous. As he which figured a Harte in the middest of fire, with this mot, <hi>Il cuore ho in fuoco.</hi> I haue my Harte in fire, or as he which depainted a <hi>Cupid,</hi> with his Bowe &amp; shafts, &amp; thereunto this verse. <hi>A gli strali d' amor son fatto segno.</hi> To <hi>Cupids</hi> shafts I am ornayned the Butte. Or not vnlike to that of him in <hi>Iouius,</hi> which figured a Chimney with a great fire and smoke, with this mot. <hi>Doue è gran fuoco è gran fumo.</hi> Where there is great fire, there is great smoke, in all which the mot without the figure, or the figure without the mot, might haue serued the purpose as well. But if vnto the fire &amp; smoke had bene added this mot, <hi>Vtrū{que} simul,</hi> the <hi>Impresa</hi> had beene most perfect. The
<pb facs="16"/>
like defect had that of <hi>Borgia,</hi> which likewise <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi> doth mention, which was the mountayne <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croceraunii,</hi> wherunto, if in stede of <hi>feriunt sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos fulgura montes</hi> had bene added <hi>Humilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra minus,</hi> or <hi>humiliora nunquam,</hi> therein had wanted no perfection. <hi>Iouius</hi> also addeth for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the rules of <hi>Imprese,</hi> that in them thcre ought to be no humayne forme, which precept is most true, if it be in the ordinarie and simple forme of a man, for that rarenes is rather delight som: but yet when the humaine forme shalbe in a strange &amp; vnaccustomed maner, it beareth a great grace. As did that of <hi>Sinior Bernabo Adorno,</hi> being ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mored of a noble and vertuous Lady, wbo often certified him both by speach and writing, that the arrowes of loue could not enter or passe farther then her gowne. Whercupon the Gentleman composedan <hi>Impresa</hi> which was a <hi>Cupid,</hi> holding in one hand the vaile of his eyes, and in the other hand an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobuze s<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ttled to his brest, as if he were readie to discharge it, and thereunto this mot. <hi>Hoc pera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get.</hi> To signifie that he had omitted no seruice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, or loyaltie in his pursute, which are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maynshotte of Loue, and are able to batter the bulwarke of a rigorous breast, and make the most flintie heart to yeeld.</p>
   <p>Thus haue I in fewe words (gentlemen) declared the properties of a perfect <hi>Impresa,</hi> to the end your choyce therein may be currant, sith many deceiue themselues with a counterfeit. And so wisbing the happie successe of all your vertuous <hi>Impreses</hi> and
<pb facs="16"/>
godly pretences. I referre you to the reading of <hi>Paulus Iouius,</hi> till time my studies shall yeeld you a better present of the like subiect.</p>
