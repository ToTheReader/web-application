   <lg>
      <l>GEntle Spectators of this Pamphlet small,</l>
      <l>The Author doth desire no prayse at all,</l>
      <l>His works prayse him so worthily he writes,</l>
      <l>To read his travels he the world incites,</l>
      <l>The name of Poet he doth here refuse,</l>
      <l>Yet we may understand he hath a Muse.</l>
      <l>Souldier and Scholler, it seems he is belike,</l>
      <l>For he can use his pen as well as Pike,</l>
      <l>He is no <hi>Venus</hi> Darling, you shall know it,</l>
      <l>A sonne of <hi>Mars,</hi> a Souldier, and a Poet:</l>
      <l>So then regardlesse of vain Criticks cavils,</l>
      <l>Honour his person, and read o're his travels.</l>
