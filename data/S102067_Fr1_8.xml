      <p>Besides, for the more part there have bin also some, that withstood and condemned the grosse errours and superstition of their times; and these good men, whiles they were suffered, taught the truth openly; but being persecuted by such as went under the Churches name, even then also they taught, and administred the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

<pb n="12" facs="27"/>
in the publike and private Libraries in Oxford; I will therefore acquaint the Reader with the mysterie thereof.</p>
      <p>When that politike Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> perceived, that howsoever men might bee silenced, yet bookes would be blabs, and tell truth, they devised this course: They directed a Commission to a company of Inquisitors, residing in severall places, and therby gave them power to purge and prohibit all manner of Bookes, Humanitie and Divinitie, ancient &amp; late, in such sort as they should think fit. Vpon this Cōmission, renued as occasion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Inquisitors set forth their severall expurgatory, and prohibitory Indices, printed at Rome, in Spaine, in the Low-countries, and elsewhere; and in these Tables (yet to be seen) they set down what books were by thē forbidden, and which to be purged, and in what places ought were to bee left out, whensoever the Workes should be printed anew: for according to their Tables or Corrections, books were to be printed afresh. Now to make sure worke, they got as many of the former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Fathers workes, as they could, into their hands, and suffered no new Copie to come foorth, but through their fingers, purged according to their Receit: neither feared they that their adversaries would set foorth the large volumes of the Fathers Workes, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, having not the meanes to vent their Impressions, being forbidden to be sold in Catholike countries. By this meanes, the Romane Censurers thought to stop all tongues and pennes, that none should hereafter speake or write otherwise than the <hi>Trent Councell</hi> had dictated<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> and so in time all Evidence should have made for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane cause.</p>
      <p>Hereby the Reader may perceive, that had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice gone on, they would in time, by their chopping and changing the writings of the Ancient at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, have rased and defaced whatsoever Evidence had made for us, and against themselves. But so it pleased
<pb n="13" facs="27"/>
God, that howsoever they had carried the matter cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly in secret, yet at length all comes out, their plot was discovered, and their Indices came into the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants hands. The Index of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> was discovered by <hi>Iunius</hi>

      <p>Indeed, if you had purged or prohibited the lewd writings of wanton <hi>Aretine,</hi> railing <hi>Rablais,</hi> or the like, you had done well: but under-hand to goe and purge out the wholesome sentences of the Fathers, such as were agreeable to the Scriptures; thus to purge those good old men, till you wrung the very blood and life out of them, bewrayeth, that you have an ill cause in hand, that betakes it selfe to such desperate shifts.</p>

of living stones, and reedifying Gods spirituall Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: so that in this time of Monkery, many religious Houses were erected, either out of voluntary Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or enjoyned Penance: Now, insteed of the right administration of the Word and Sacraments, came in the dumbe guize of the Masse; and the people instead of the pure milke of the Word, were intertained with feigned Liturgies, Legends, and Miracles, &amp; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences loaden with a number of unprofitable Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and unwarrantable Traditions; now there was great con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Now the crownes of Martyrdome wherewith the first Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> were honoured, were changed into a Triple Crowne, and the Pastorall Staffe, beganne to quarrell with the Princely Scepter; and all these things were carried by the name of the Church, the People many of them beleeving as the Church beleeved, and this Church was the Roman, and this Roman Church, was the Pope.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="32"/>
were perused, the Doctors and Fathers read, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries opened, Times compared, Truth discerned, and Falshood detected.</p>
      <p>Now because there hath already, and will hereafter be occasion to speak of Antichrist; I will therfore heere point out his severall Ages. About the yeare 607. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ began in part to appeare and show himselfe, rising by degrees untill he came to the height of impietie; for as other things, so Antichrist also, was to have his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, growth, height, and fall; even as monstrous and huge Beasts goe with their young ones many yeares, as other creatures doe many monthes. The maine strength of the Romish Antichrist consisted in those two Swords, the Spirituall and Temporall; now the Pope did not at once attaine to the managing of these two Swords; but by degrees he came to usurpe this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed Sword.</p>
      <p>The first step that hee made to the throne of pride, was about the yeare, 607, when Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, by the grant of that murderer <hi>Phocas,</hi> tooke to himselfe the Title, Authoritie, and Supremacie over the whole Church.</p>
      <p>The next time, that he notoriously shewed himselfe, was after the thousand yeare, when <hi>Gregory</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>eventh claimed and usurped both the Swords; that is, a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne and Universall Iurisdiction, not onely Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall over the Clergie, but also Temporall over Kings and Emperours: unto this second Soveraigntie they had long aspired, but never attained untill the time of this <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> in whom Antichrist came to his growth: yea, the Pope was discovered to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ by those Catholike Bishops, the Bishop of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>

      <p>The summe of all is this, the Pope having pearkt himselfe above his fellow Bishops, it grieved him to be subject to Kings and Emperours; not to exalt himself above them, he distracted both Church and State in the point of <hi>Image-worship,</hi> which occasioned much blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in Christendome, and then having weakened the Empire, he became superior to Kings and Emperours: there being nothing now but the Church in his way, he preuailed over it by his <hi>Lateran</hi> Flatterers, who set the Pope above a generall Councel, that is, aboue Gods Church; a Generall Councell being indeed the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative Church of God here on earth, and the Pope himselfe being <hi>the Vertuall Church,</hi> for so <hi>Gretser</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, <note n="d" place="margin">
