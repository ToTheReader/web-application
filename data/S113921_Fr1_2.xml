   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing framed this discourse long since for
mine owne aduertisement, what might and
ought to be done by Trauaile; and now consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the manifould errors and misprisions,
that the greater sort of such as trauaile into
forraine Countries, haue heretofore commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(because these dayes wherein we now liue
are no lesse disordered, then when pilgrimages were on foote) and how
few haue arriued vnto that perfectiō which was requirable, for the wāt
of a Guide or Counsellor, to aduise &amp; aduertise them of the fairer and
more readie way, to make their trauailes somewhat more profitable and
honorable: I haue been encouraged (worthy Reader) vpō the vertue
of the yonger sort of such noble gentlemen as intend so recōmendable a
course, to prepare and addresse the same, by way of Essay; the rather
also for that, in other languages, I haue suruayed some of like proiect,
for other Nations, who I am sure stand not more in neede then wee in
this State doe. Protesting (as in the inferiornesse of the stile may well
appeare, that neither vanitie of glorie, nor selfe presumption (being of
many the most vnworthie to haue enterprised this taske) nor other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
respect then dutie to my good friends (that haue requested this at
my hands) and Zeale to my louing Countriemen, hath made me pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it. For, considering of all voluntarie Commendable actions, that
of trauailing into forraine States (vndertaken and performed Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly)
is the most behoueable &amp; to be regarded in this Common-weale,
both for the publike and priuate good thereof, singularly also for that
the same is not vndergone with ordinarie charge, care, hazard, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of paines, but of most vncertaine issue and commoditie to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailers:
It seemeth vnto mee (vertuous Reader) a faire dutie
(where other worthie men haue beene so long silent, in giuing a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
rule for Trauailing, as it is in vse at this day) to begin the hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of one, that by some master workeman, it may hereafter be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
planted, formed, and tried.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
Moreouer, I thought good, for the informatiō of some Readers, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
my intent in sundrie points therin cōtained. And first, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
diuers other sortes of Trauailers are mentioned thē those Generall
Voluntaries, (for whom this discourse was framed) they are <hi>honoris
gratia, &amp; obiter Salutati;</hi> and rather by way of order, then worthie
to receiue direction, mentioned. Secondly, that whereas by the found of
some words, some people and Nations may thinke they be taxed in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
points, notwithstanding therein I may say, <hi>Nihil iam quod
non prius ab omnibus dictum fuit:</hi> yet I trust, the honest Reader
will perceiue may meaning to bend rather to the rectifying, then preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of any. Thirdly, where any point is obserued by way of secreat or
policie, that no other Construction be made thereof, then the literall,
to ensample and aduance knowledge. Fourthly, that considering for
the priuate respect of the most vnexpert, more Minute Subdiuisions
and points are cōtained, then per aduenture will rellish with the taste of
some; that such will take for their better stomacke the benefit of those
Marginall notes, which for their sakes I haue set downe. Lastly, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not only we here in <hi>England</hi> may, as all other Nations in the world
doe, account it a shame that there should be so many and such fugitiues
(vnworthie of the honourable name of Trauailers) as this Land hath
affourde hertofore, who haue not afterwards made conscience of their
owne wayes nor of others, but like the most pernitious haue communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with all euill and mischiefe in their trauailes, to subiect their own
Countrie, Princes, State, Parents, friends and all that is held deare in
this life; let me discouer so much of my secretest affections vnto thee
(discreet Reader) that the preuenting hereof, was one of the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
to vndertake this worke. And so I heartily pray to God to make
thee happie in all vertue and godlinesse, and to set to thy helping hand,
as much as in thee lyeth, to encounter that imputation to our Countrie:
leauing vnto thy discreete iudgement, moreouer, these Tables which
are here abstracted for the ease and aide of mens memories. And
so I bid thee farwell. From <hi>Wingham,</hi> the first of <hi>Iulie.</hi> 1606.</p>
