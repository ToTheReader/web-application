      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR as muche as that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Clarke Erasmus, and
profounde Censor, both of
wyt and skill, letteth not
first to confesse that thys
treatise following, tasteth of
good learning, though the stile, phrase, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
differ from the workes of S. Augustine, in
the number of the which it hath bene accomp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted:
And next, that it descryeth or bewrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a very diligent Reader of that holy father
his volumes, out of whose confessions especially
hee hath inserted into this Pamphlet manye
wholesome and proper sentences, as well tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
and prouing that S. Austine doth so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
inculcate: namely that nothing was create
without the word of God, as mouing and styr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vs to ghostly loue and affection, from the
right feeling of the which it seemeth to haue
flowen: I am the bolder to presume that to thee
(good Reader) it shall be both the more leefe
and acceptable: And the rather because that
I haue endeuoured my selfe to the vttermost of
my power, in the translatyng hereof, so to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the copye vsed by the Author, as no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie
(I trust) may seme to remaine, and so
<pb facs="8"/>
with him to haue iterated one thyng or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that it may rather serue as a drop by oft fal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling
to pearce more deepelye, then to breede or
induce any lothsomnes or sacietie. For albeit
that thinges earthlye, vayne, and transitorie
may iustly bring with them a certaine tedious
disdaine, when they are to often or commonly
repeated, or lacke the releefe of pleasant varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
yet am I perswaded, and so would I haue
thee, that thinges heauenly, euerlasting, endles
and durable, and verely repleate wyth blysse
and felicitie, so worthely deserue the Poet hys
testimonie, that the oftener they be inculcate,
the more they shall double their pleasure wyth
profit. Take this therefore in gree and good
worth, how soeuer for want of good methode
it seeme to be confused, as a wholesome medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and no lesse needefull then fruitfull for
this tyme and season, in the whyche selfe loue,
friēding of the flesh, and vanity of the world so
vniuersally rage and raigne, as I pity to see, &amp;
am sorry to report. For herein thou mayst by
contemplation and vew of thy duty to God, &amp;
his loue to thee, learne to abandon whatsoeuer
to thy soule health is repugnant or aduersant,
without the interlacing of superstitious vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or feare of infection proceding frō popery.
<pb facs="8"/>
For in auoyding thereof, I confesse me plainly
that I haue euen wittingly vsed in this trāsla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a certain fredome and libertie, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the sense of the Author, to the consonancy,
and Canon of the holy scripture.</p>
   <p>For as I acknowledge it to be great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
impiety, to racke or vse force in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
testimonies, suche I meane as are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
within the compasse of both Testaments,
as holden &amp; allowed for canonical scriptures:
beyng by God his own mouth prohibited anye
way to wrest or to wring them: so I thinke it
not vnlawfull, but rather requisite and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie,
in translating or readyng the bookes of
Interpretours, be they olde, be they newe, or
what soeuer they be, sithens they cannot well
be without some wartes of errour, especiallye
when they are conceaued &amp; written in mood
and affection, or rest in the preiudicate opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of humane infirmitie, or willingly followe
the iniquitie of their time: to vse such mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
discretion and iudgement grounded vp
on holy writ, as by diminishing, adding, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
or rasing, they may reasonably be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and as in part, so in all made fruitfull to
the Reader. This if any man either of spiced
conscience, or wayward mynde, dislike or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole,
<pb facs="9"/>
I wish him more wyt, then fantastically
to desire to haue hurtfull thinges ioyned to the
wholesome as of necessity, especially when they
maye conuenientlye either be taken awaye, or
chaunged, without preiudice done to God his
word, or offence geuen to good men. For I hold
him an vnwiseman, and more then franticke
in folly, that wil haue any such opinion of any
Phisicion, how learned or skilful so euer he be,
that bccause hee hath receaued at his handes
many wholesome drugs, and comfortable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
which at sundry times turned to hys
ease, health and sanitie: that a poyson by the
same Phisition in the ende or among them so
ministred, shall not be able to annoy or to hurt
him: especially when the drugs or confections
before geuen, had neyther qualitie, quantitie,
nor operation in them to qualifie, resist, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the poison. And yet is there no earthly poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so pestilent to the body, as the poyson of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
is noysome to the soule. And therfore to
fantasie any earthly man so muche in the dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of anye peece of doctrine (considering
that as he may both deceiue and be deceiued,
so he may therin couertly conuey into the eares
of his hearer, as many damnable paradoxes
as Christian articles) that not onely the care
<pb facs="9"/>
shall bee taken awaye from vs to eschewe hys
heresies, but also a desire faire kindled to lyke
and to learne them, where nothing is infarced
to their confutation, I holde it so incurable a
peece of frensie, as all the pollicies in the world
are not able to tame.</p>
   <p>Thus trustyng that I haue not onelye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaynted
thee with the profit and cōmoditie
which this treatise shall yeld thee, but that I
haue also rendred a sufficient reason of my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
in translation, and of alteryng the sense
where it tended any way to the derogation of
Gods glory by attributing to much to man his
merites and deseruinges, and aduertising thee
to esteeme no man his workes, opinions, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
or counsail, further then they shall agree
with the touchstone of all truth and veritie: I
wish thee the grace of God his holye spirite to
conduct &amp; leade thee into all such thinges
as shall stand with thine own dutie,
and tend to the glorie of the
whole Trinitie.</p>
