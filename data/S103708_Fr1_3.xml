   <head>TO THE CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIAN
READER
Wisedome and
Charitie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is no easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for a man so far
to mortifie his self-love,
as to neglect
himselfe for the publique good;
&amp; to vaile his private ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(though with some see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
disadvantage) to the
peace of the Church; that which
<pb n="38" facs="22"/>
is too apparent in the present
occasion. Whiles there might be
some colour of ambiguitie of
termes, and possibilitie of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construction,
in that Position
concerning the true being, and
visibility of the Roman church;
I could the lesse marvell that
a mistaking should breed a
quarrell; but now, after so clear
an explication, as I have given
of my sense, and so satisfactory
a reconcilement, as no ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Christian can except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst;
I am not a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to see the peace of the
church yet disquieted with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall,
<pb n="39" facs="22"/>
and unkinde disserta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
   <p>Surely (what ever may bee
pretended) not one haire of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Christians head can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered,
in that assertion of
mine (yet not so much mine, as
the most of the reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of Christendome) as
it is by them, and me both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
and interpreted; since
we call all Christians to no lesse
detestation of the abhominable
corruptiōs, &amp; Idolatries of the
Roman Church, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the yeeldance of a boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
visibilitie, then those that
<pb n="40" facs="23"/>
deny it the being, and name of
a Church: yea wee raise more
strong advantage against the
adversary by this grant, then
by that denyall.</p>
   <p>Neyther is here the least
contradiction to any clause of
the Articles of our Church, of
England, in that sense where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I have delivered my selfe;
such is my true filiall honor to
that our holy Mother, that I
should hate my selfe, if I should
offer to oppose any of her sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
dictates; how ever it may
sound to an ignorant eare.</p>
   <p>In every opposition there
<pb n="41" facs="23"/>
must be supposed the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the same respect, the same
understanding of both; Else
how ever the words run, the
matter disagrees not. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
If one man shall say,
The Church is visible, mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,
consisting of lime and
stone; Another shall say, The
Church is invisible, immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
not consisting of any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stuffe; these two doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
each other; whiles the
one speakes of the outward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke
of the Church; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the spirituall state of
the Church; Neyther is it
<pb n="42" facs="24"/>
otherwise in my assertion, and
that which is counter-alledged
from the Articles or Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the Church; as I have
sufficiently explained my sense
both in my Advertisement,
and Reconciler; It is not for
me to cloy my Reader with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions.</p>
   <p>Now, lest I might perhaps
seeme partiall to my own cause;
and flatter my selfe in my own
opinion; I have craved the
judgement of some, of the most
eminent &amp; approved Divines
of our Church, &amp; the French;
whose names are justly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend;
<pb n="43" facs="24"/>
whose workes have made
thē famous in our gates: I have
of many hundreds, selected on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

      </note> two Bishops, and two
Doctors; such, as whose very
mētion is able to stop the mouth
of calumny; and to make igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
ashamed of it selfe. I
have taken the boldnes to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
their private Letters in
answer to mine. Peruse them,
Reader, and take satisfaction;
and confesse it was thy mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and not my errour that
made me appeare foule: Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
and love peace, and the
God of peace be with thee.</p>
