      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oming lately to <hi>London,</hi> I found in publike &amp; priuat, many Monuments of honor, loue and griefe, to those Great Worthies; the Earle of <hi>Southampton,</hi> and his Sonne, which lately deceased in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> whiles they did Honour to our State and Friends. And because it cannot be denied, but wee of the Isle of <hi>Wight</hi> (of whom that Noble Earle had the speciall Charge and Care) were most obliged vnto his Honour: I thought it very meet to publish these Teares, which (for the greater part) were shed in the Island long since for priuate vse, and adiudged to darknesse; but that my selfe (being bound by particular duty to doe all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to these Gracious Lords) intreated that they might still liue, which not without importunitie I obtained. And now they are set forth, neither for fashion, nor flattery, nor ostentation; but meerely to declare our loue and respect, to our neuer sufficiently Commended Noble Captaine. So take them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out curiositie; and farewell.</p>
