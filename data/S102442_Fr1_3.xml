      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, if euer errors in any Art proued pernicious, I thinke none of meane capacity will deny that in the faculty of <hi>Physicke</hi> they are not of the least annoyance. Amongst many others, the abuses committed in the iudgement of diseases by the inspection of the <hi>vrine</hi> onely, haue beene so great and so many, that for the subduing of the same is required the helpe of some mighty <hi>Hercules.</hi> Amongst diuers others who haue opposed themselues against the sayd errors and abuses, none haue more fully, and more pertinently handled this subiect then this our Author. And because the vulgar sort of people is most subiect to be ensnared, and most obuious to euery error, my chiefe ayme and end therefore hath beene, as much as in me lyeth, to free them from imposture and cozenage, by communicating to them this Treatise in our owne vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue. It cannot indeed be denied that <hi>vrines</hi> haue for many yeares beene most basely abused. If I should say that in this Kingdome this abuse hath not a little beene improued, I thinke I should say nothing besides the truth. Witnesse so many ignorant <hi>Empirickes, women-phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians,</hi> with a many of our saucy <hi>Surgeons,</hi> and many moe, who by their pretended and supposed skill in the

      <pb facs="8"/> inspection of <hi>vrines,</hi> doe assume vnto themselues a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse liberty of encroaching vpon that profession wherein they were neuer instructed nor trained vp. But at this I doe not so much maruell, but rather to see some of the Tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> who should sound out with their voyces like Trumpets against all sinnes, to be themselues inuolued in this sinne of <hi>Couetousnesse.</hi> For whatsoeuer other pretence they make, it may plainly appeare, that it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>arment of figge leaues which will neuer couer their nakednesse. Is it not apparent that many of our <hi>Parsons</hi> and <hi>Vicars</hi> in this Kingdome, as though they were of the secret counsell of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> or had digged out of the graue the ghost of that famous <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> or else with some <hi>Pythagoricall</hi> translation of the soules of all the most famous <hi>Physitians,</hi> the skill were conueyed vnto them; they haue like vsurpers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded vpon other mens right? Now that preaching of the word, with the dependances of the same, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of <hi>Physicke,</hi> are in the word of God two seuerall distinct callings, I thinke cannot be denied. And in the second place, that the practice of the one hindreth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the other as it ought: those that well weigh the weight of both callings, their seuerall subiects, large extents, paines, and labour to be imployed about either of them, must needs confesse, that whosoeuer will conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably performe the worke of the Ministery as hee ought, shall therein finde worke enough without medling with the health of the body. And besides, the preiudice to the common good, may hence euidently appeare, that often at one and the same instant, each of these callings demandeth his personall presence.</p>
   <p>All the charge our Lord and Sauiour gaue to <hi>Peter,</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/> was to feed his flocke, and that reiterated three seuerall times. And this was the charge committed to all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and other Ministers of the word. As for the curing of Diseases, it was both miraculous and lasted but for a time, they being as free from couetousnesse and pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary traffique, as ours at this time are addicted vnto the same. The holy Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> willeth euery man <hi>to abide in the same calling</hi> (not <hi>callings) wherein hee was called:</hi> and in another place; <hi>Ministers must wait on the Ministery:</hi> and, <hi>Let euery man meddle with his businesse with quietnesse.</hi> Now how small account so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer these men make of the ministeriall function, the charge is so great, and the account so strict, that Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>He wondreth that any Bishop or Minister can be saued. Ammonius</hi> also being vrged with a Bishopricke, cut off his right eare, that such defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity might be a Canonicall impediment. May it not then plainly appeare that <hi>Ye take too much vpon you, ye Sonnes of Leui.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Their colourable excuse of doing good to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, is to small purpose: for then were it lawfull for euery man to meddle with another mans profession, then might the <hi>Lawyer</hi> become a <hi>Physitian,</hi> the <hi>Physitian</hi> a <hi>Diuine,</hi> and the <hi>Diuine</hi> all three. Indeed the <hi>Lawyer</hi> hath likewise some cause to complaine: for some of our <hi>Parsons,</hi> I heare, are busied with making Wils and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Deeds, and Conueyances, and what not? But the <hi>Lawyer</hi> is old enough to plead his owne cause. But God is the God of order, not of confusion; and neuer did allow of this confused <hi>Chaos</hi> of callings.</p>
   <p>Now a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> these men are iustly to be blamed, so in like manner such as are occasions of their distractions must
<pb facs="9"/> needs also deserue some reprehensions. It is not the part of an honest man either to incourage or countenance so pernicious distractions and confusions in a Christian Common-wealth. The Princely Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> would not drinke of the water that was purchased with the perill of mens liues. And is it not apparent that these mens negligence endangereth the soules of their flockes, while they care most for their fleeces.</p>
   <p>But it is easier for me to reprehend this disorder, then to amend it. Would to God those that haue the salue would apply it to this sore; to the end that this foule <hi>Vlcer</hi> spread it selfe no further to the annoyance both of Church and Common-wealth. As for my selfe, the loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect I beare vnto the publique good, together with the vindicating of our <hi>Aesculapian</hi> Art from abuse as much as in me lyeth, haue beene the chiefe meanes which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to impart these my paines to the publique, being not a little animated hereunto by the Author himselfe, who towards the latter end of this Discourse hopeth for the publication thereof in vulgar tongues. Howbeit I doe not deny but I haue euer beene as auerse as any from the publication of any such <hi>Physicke</hi> bookes in our vulgar tongue, as might giue the least incouragement to ignorant Droanes and Dunces, wherewith this Kingdome doth so abound. And I haue euer wished that some of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession would employ their paines to some better purpose. For as the inspection of <hi>Vrines,</hi> as it is now practised is one; so is the writing or translating of <hi>Physick</hi> practicall books in the English tongue another bād which much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldneth this kind of people to proceed in their erronious course. As for that idle and more then threed-bare ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the pleaders for this abuse, it is of no force nor
<pb facs="9"/> validity; to wit, that the abuse ought not to take away the right vse of the same: For while as the Booke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth a remedy for the disease in generall, yet can the ignorant Reader neuer thereby collect the seuerall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in such a case to be obserued; as the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the patient, the manifold causes which may either inhibit the exhibiting, or yet indicate the altering thereof in quantity, quality, or both, with many moe circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are so many and so diuers, that they require no vulgar vnderstanding to find them out; howsoeuer, such remedies, how absurd soeuer, may at sometimes be seconded by a prosperous and wished for successe: which being but casuall, the cleere sighted vnderstanding will neuer trust to And therefore it may plainly appeare that there can be no right vse of such Bookes. Besides, that they proue often occasions of procrastinating and putting off the time and opportunity of asking sound and learned aduice, vntill such time as irrecouerable occasion be past, and <hi>He that would not when he might, now may not when he would.</hi> And whereas the pleaders for this practice would seeme to haue gotten ground on vs by sheltring themselues vnder the shield of the ancient <hi>Greeke</hi> Physitians, to wit, that they follow the footsteps of the famous ancient Fathers, <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and his Apish imitator <hi>Paulus Aegineta,</hi> with many moe: It is true that these worthy ancient Writers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate to posterity the precepts and rules of Art, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with manifold remedies, did couch them in the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, the which howbeit it was their vulgar and common speech, yet neither was it their intent that they should be diuulged abroad amongst the vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, neither yet could it then be so preiudiciall as now

      <pb facs="11"/> adayes. Good reason had they to write them in the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue, as being very famous, and by reason of the <hi>Macedonian Monarchy</hi> vnder <hi>Alexander</hi> and his successors, besides <hi>Europe,</hi> it was farre spread in <hi>Asia,</hi> and the copiousnesse and elegancy gaue it no small grace and estimation among many Nations. Now that it was neuer the intent of these learned men that those Bookes which contained the whole mysteries of this Art should be diuulged abroad, may plainly appeare to all such as will not be obstinately ignorant, by the carefull keeping of them in their Temples and Oratories, their <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Southsayers</hi> taking charge of them: as likewise that all who did professe and practise this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession neere the space of a thousand yeares, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended of the linage of old <hi>Aesculapius;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their intent and purpose was onely to haue them inuiolably kept for their successors to be trained vp in the same profession. And againe, that there was no such danger of diuulging them abroad in those dayes is manifest, in that the vse of printing was not many hundreds of yeares after this knowne, by which means (saith a learned man) more may be in one day di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched, then by more mens writings in a whole yeare.</p>
   <p>Now among many other Physicke practicall Bookes some of our <hi>vrine bookes</hi> written in the English tongue, haue not a little emboldened a many ignorant busie-bodies <hi>to thrust their sickle into another mans haruest.</hi> Hence comes it to passe, that any idle old trot, Cobler, or Costardmonger, vpon the reading of such a booke will seem to pronounce some <hi>Delphian</hi> oracle by the <hi>vrine.</hi> The greatnesse of which abuse so
<pb facs="11"/> much encreased in this Kingdome, hath occasioned me to take this cause in hand. And because it doth chiefly ayme at the informing and rectifying of the iudgement of the deluded multitude, I am so farre from affecting a high and strained style, that I haue euen accommodated my words as much as I could to the capacitie of the meanest. And if this finde kinde entertainment at thy hand (kinde Reader) then shall I be incouraged to publish vnto thy view another part concerning the same subiect, which I haue my selfe collected out of a great number of ancient and late Writers, the chiefe contents whereof shall be these:</p>
   <p>The Tractate being diuided into two bookes, in the first shall be contained the authorities of some learned Physitians against this abuse in generall, and then shall the vncertainty of this signe be seene in some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities where it is thought to be of greatest force. Then shall follow a confutation of the vulgar opinion of discerning of women with childe, as also of the sexe by the <hi>vrine:</hi> all illustrated by the authorities of the learned at large, with pregnant proofes, and vnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable arguments, wherunto are added some things desumed from mine owne experimentall knowledge. In the second I proceed to a more particular suruey first of the regions of the <hi>vrine,</hi> then to the substance, quantity and qualitie: and in the qualities, first to the smell, then the chiefe colours of <hi>vrines,</hi> together with their manifold seuerall strange contents: not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the circle or garland, spume or froath, and bubbles, with other contents swimming on the top. And before the Conclusion shall follow the fond and foolish conceit &amp; opinion of some doating Alchymists
<pb facs="12"/> of our times concerning the distillation of <hi>vrines.</hi> All which shall be prosecuted after the foresaid plaine and perspicuous Method.</p>
   <p>I intreat thee therefore (courteous Reader) that thou wouldest be pleased to accept this my paines in as good part, as I haue beene willing to impart the same vnto thee for thy vse and profit. And if thou wilt set partialitie and by-respects aside, I make no doubt but thou shalt see, and plainly perceiue, that the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest here mentioned shall finde it <hi>billa vera.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would take away all excuses from the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, and lest with the Iewes they shall say <hi>Doth our Law condemne a man before he be heard,</hi> I will therefore deferre the further prosecuting of this businesse vntill another Assize, to see if the offenders can say any thing for themselues. So ceasing to abuse thy patience any longer, and entreating thy charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble censure of this my rude labour, I will here take my leaue of thee vntill the next occasion.</p>
