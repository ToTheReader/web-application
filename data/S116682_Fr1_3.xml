   <head>TO THE RIGHT honorable, and his singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>good Lord, the Lorde</hi> Robert Dudley <hi>Earle of Leicester, Baron of</hi> Denbigh, Master of the Queenes Maiesties horse, of the noble order of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Knight, and one of hir high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse honorable priuie Counsayle. &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vche as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detted to many men, and yet haue so shorte and slender abilitie, that they cannot satisfy them all, are wont to lay by all meanes to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde first with them to whom they owe most. So I also, right noble Earle, hauing in maner infinite persons both here and elsewhere, which haue bounde me to them by their benefites, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnable to discharge my self towards them all, haue thought it meete to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb facs="6"/> cheefly at those, which aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue after a sorte brought me in bondage to them, by ouerloding me with their deserts. In whiche number, forasmuche as your Honor is not the furthest behinde, as who about an eight yeeres ago, at my first comming into England, not onely receyued mee with singular fauour and good will, but also rewarded me with very bountifull libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, which notwithstanding (to say the truthe) was the thing that I least sought for: I deemed it my dutie to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some thankfulnesse of minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your Lordship. There are (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) other innumerable benefites of yours towards me since that time, the reckening vp whereof in order one by one would be both tedious and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture not very acceptable to your Honor: who, as you haue not at any time sticked to bestowe your benefites vpon all straungers, and specially vpon suche as were cōmended to you for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Religion: so beeing conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the conscience of weldooing,
<pb facs="6"/> (which is the propertie of vertue and of true bounteousnes) you haue neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired any other thanke or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the same. Therfore although I haue many things to say (and that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) of your Honorable deserts: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding for feare (as I sayd) least I might perchaunce by mine vnseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or ouergreat setting foorth of your prayses, offend your noble mind, which despiseth the things that we haue in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: I willingly leaue all those things, &amp; proceede to that which both beseemeth both your excellent &amp; noble disposition, and which I haue alwayes iustly taken to be the cheefest &amp; greatest of all your benefites towards mee. For you haue not onely voutsafed to fauour me in my prosperitie (as the maner of the worlde is nowadayes) but also she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed your selfe a moste fauourable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone in my cheefest distresses (whiche is the propertie of singular vertue, and of perfect good will) and not streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes giuen credite to matters vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly giuen out, but (which was the
<pb facs="7"/> poynt of a moste stout and wise noble man) did vvith great Alexander keepe one eare for me, and according to the olde sayde sawe of Athens, gaue eare to both sides alike, and perceyuing myne innocencie, voutchsafed alwayes since to imploy your authoritie and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my defence. By meanes whereof not onely my good name (which part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through ccrtein doubtfull reportes, and partly through the ouerlight belefe of some persons, was falne in perill) abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth whole and sound to me, so farre as lay in you to do: but also I haue more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer obteyned your wel liking &amp; good fauour: Of which things I make so great account, as a man of my meane state ought to make of the fauour of a moste honorable and bountifull noble man. And surely that dealing of yours wherby I finde my good name for the most part defended through your singular iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; wisdome, from the reproche of infamie, is of so great account with me, that in cōparison of that alone, I take the residue (which notwithstanding are
<pb facs="7"/> very great) in maner as nothing. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Preacher of the doctrine of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, what can be more deare, what can be more acceptable, &amp; finally what can be greater or more to be wished in this life, than a good name? So that, to my seeming, Salomon hath sayd very right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a good name is better than great riches. And contrariwise me thinks that christian charitie is greatly impeached, not only by suche as bereeue their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of it by their craftie dealinges, but also by suche as credite misreports vnaduisedly, bicause that if there were none to be found which would admit misreportes ouerhastily, all the whole pestilent kind of backbiters would fade of it owne accorde, and false reportes would vtterly vanish away. And truely, if we were not blinder than Beetles, we might perceyue euen by natures direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a good name, whiche euery good man setteth more store by than by his life, can not be taken away from others without exceeding great wrong, and the breach of all humanitie: and
<pb facs="8"/> moreouer the thing vvoulde come of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to our remembraunce, vvhich vve reade to haue bene very discretly considered euen of the Heathen, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God the creator of all things, beeing most vvise, hath giuen to man but one tung, not to lye or slaunder vvith, but to expresse the conceiptes of his minde and hart (vvhere agaynst it is placed) truely, playnely, and meeldly: and tvvo eares, so fitly placed, that we may vvell heare the things that are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to vs, bothe on the right side, and on the left. But to the intent I may at length come to the matter, right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, vvhen I my selfe had first vvritten this Metaphrasis of mine in Latin vpon the Epistle to the Romanes, and cōmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the same to my hearers: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervvarde had caused a friende of myne to translate the same into Englishe: I purposed to dedicate it to your name, for the manyfolde and great benefites vvherby you holde me most streightly bound vnto you: that wheras I am not able to make any recompence at all to
<pb facs="8"/> so great a Lord, I might at leastwise giue him some inckling of thankfulnesse. And although this present (if you haue an eye but to my labour only, and not to the holy Epistle of the Apostle) be neither worthy of your excellencie, nor of the benefits that I haue receyued, no nor correspondent to my vvill: yet I hope (such is the noblenesse &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your mynde) that in respecte, not of the gift, but of the giuers mynd (vvhich surely is most forvvade to doo you seruice) you vvill take this small vvorke of myne (suche as it is) in good worth. By the reading wherof if you take any profite, you shall thinke your selfe beholden for it alonely vnto our moste gracious and almightie God, vvho by his holy spirite hath put these medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into my minde, to set them foorth to the common welfare of his Churche. And if the reading of this my lyttle booke shall confirme that opinion of yours vvhich your Honor hath concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (&amp; not vvithout cause as I hope) of the purenesse of my doctrine: then I
<pb facs="9"/> make this petition to you, (vvherof not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithstāding I ought not to doubt) that it may please you not only to imbrace me more &amp; more vvith your good vvill and fauour: but also to cherishe &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende this vvriting by your authoritie: vvhiche although it come foorth vnder your name in the English tung as clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in a new garmēt, yet is it set out by me as a cōfession of my fayth to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and iudged by the whole church of England. And thus I wish your noble L. most happy welfare &amp; prosperity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seching our most gracious &amp; almightie God to preserue your Honor long in health, as a right strong defence vnto this Realme.</p>
