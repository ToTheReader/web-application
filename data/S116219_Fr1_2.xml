      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, It pleased God by his prouidence to drawe me to preach at Stepney nigh London in Easter tearme <hi>1613.</hi> where Sir <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cope</hi> beeing one of my auditors, a man to whom I was vnknowne, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ending of that businesse sent for me, and entreated that I would enlarge the two last pointes of this tractate, beeing part of my sermon at that time, and to send them vnto him; which at my returne I speedily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke: and hauing added as herein is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, I endeauoured two seueral times to haue cōmunicated thē vnto him, but I fayled of my
<pb facs="3"/> purpose, and hee stood disappointed of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Now as I am enformed, he is gone the way of all flesh: a man in his life time well commended for his pietie and zeale, with whom I am not willing to burie that which he for his priuate comfort desired, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the Church, leauing the blessing of it to him that is the God of all grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all mercies. And for that it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God of his great mercie to make me both scholler and fellow of your Colledge, where through the Lords goodnesse I obtained that small portion of learning I haue: And in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as since that time I haue found you ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind and willing to yeeld such fauours vnto me in preferring such as I desired, I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and now must ingeniously confesse, that I stand in these respects greatly obliged vnto you; and not hauing wherewith to make any recompence for so great benefit, I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to offer vnto your iudicious view this poore Tractate, and to publish it vnder your protection, as a testimonie of my thankefull heart; humbly praying you to accept these my first fruites with that affection with which I commend them. And thus commending you to him that is able to keepe you that you fall not, and to present you faultlesse before the
<pb facs="3"/> presence of his glorie with ioy, I humbly take my leaue.</p>
