   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HO begins (my most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Race, receiues no Crowne.
I haue begunne to submit to
your Patronage, my former
endeauours: And therefore
thus continue their grace,
with prescription of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
name. Your most
Noble disposition neuer giuing ouer free and honest
seruices; T'were inconstancie, respectlesse, and rude
to relinquish, or not euer to celebrate you: Or to
an encreasing Nobilitie and merit, to decrease in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance
and Tribute. I haue chosen now to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
your Lordship with the Life of one of those
Kings, which my former French disfranchisements,
and makings free in our English, haue in other sort
toucht at: Now selected, augmented, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb facs="3"/>
illustrated, by the neerer, and more labor'd
insight of one of their learned'st, and most profit-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Obseruers. All obiections to his labours, he hath
answered himselfe in Sequell; my paines being onely
to render him truely, and with as much grace of our
English representation as I might. Nought rests
but your Lordships leasurable perusall, and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of both: Together with my zealous desire of
your honorable conceit; that all Offices, performed
on my part, in this or any other worthy subiect, shall
euer be particularly confined to your chosen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
and noble acceptance. So euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
