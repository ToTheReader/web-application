      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD in the beginning when he created the earth, gaue vertue to the same, to bring foorth euery hearbe of the fielde, that might beare seede in him selfe, after his owne kinde, without gardening, digging, sowing, plantyng, weedyng, or any other trauayle of man. But after that man had transgressed, the earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the curse due to mans offence, that is, to bring foorth thornes and thistles: and as man was defiled, and coulde yeelde foorth no good fruite, except he were delued by Gods spirite, and the seede of Gods worde sowen into him, which by the influence of the same spirite, might bud out the leaues, stalkes, and blossomes of grace, which ripeth in time of it selfe, so the earth then remayned to man as a thing tillable, out of the which by continuall eradication of weedes, and by digging and deluing the grounde, plantyng and sowyng of good and commodious hearbes and fruites, he might receyue vnto him selfe by continuall trauayle and labour in the sweat of his face, thinges necessarie for his comfort and bodily sustentation. Hence groweth it also that nowe vnto this day, men, the terrestriall heires of Adam, digge, delue, plowe, hedge, ditche, eare, sowe, threshe, cull, weede, plant, set, graft, proine and such like, vpon the face of this trauayle some grounde, in the which as the preacher saith, when man hath laboured what he may, <hi>Quid vtilitatis est homini, de vniuerso labore suo, quo laborat sub sole?</hi> What profite hath man more of all the labour wherewith he weerieth him selfe, vnder the Sunne, but sorowe and care, and nothing without paynes and greefe. Also <hi>Euripides</hi> saith to euery man: <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. That is, if thou which art borne mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, doe thinke thy selfe to liue without labours and vnquietnes, thou arte a foole: and what could of a Pagan be I pray you more wisely spokē, or diuinely? The plowman reapeth not till he haue daunced after the Plowshare, holdyng fast the handle, pochyng in mire, vp to the calfe of the legge, he filles not his handes with the eares, till he haue parched and well koned them, with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stainyng the bitter blowes of the pearcyng Haile, beatyng with bityng sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers &amp; frost by vehemence of the Northest winde. He filles not his bellie with bread, before he haue well wet his backe with Snowe and Raine. No man drinkes wine before the Grapes be planted, no man eateth pure fruict before he haue grafted, the Marchaunt receiues not his gaine without greate feares, perils, and aduentures by Sea, by lande, by night and daie, and that not without manie vnknowen and greate losses. No man hath the pleasure of a holsome Garde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap>rt incommodita secum.</hi> That is, euery commoditie bringeth his discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities with hym, no gaine without paine, no ioye without noye, no honour without labour, no meede without neede, wherein yet man is daiely taught to remember, that these are badges, monumentes, and memorials of his fal, and his sinne, the cause of all these infirmities, which he was free from before his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</p>
   <p>Yet notwithstandyng, all men are not so mindefull of their firste fall, or els of their present labours, that either they do bewaile their miserie, or seke to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploye their labours aright: For where the onely ende of Adams trauaile is, that he maie eate, that is, that he maie gather comfort, and releefe in his necessitie: Many are so forgetfull of their miseries, that the studie of their whole life, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie employed to satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Brambles, and all ouergrowen with Brakes and moste vnprofitable weedes.</p>
   <p>But God, whose wisdome surpasseth mans foolishenes, hath prouided a sufficient salue for euerie sore, and a remedie for mans vntowardnes, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng the nature of the disease, hath also planted simples of his grace, Whereof he maketh medicines to heale the greate sore of mans corruption. For as a good phisition is well grounded in the nature of Hearbes and Plantes, whereof are made salues and remedies for the diseases of the bodie, and is neuer destitute ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a good Garden, well replenished with al maner holsome hearbes, or else of a trustie learned Apothecarie to prouide the same: So God doth neuer leaue his ordinarie meanes vnoccupied and vnprouided, wherby the Vlcers and Blai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>e greate benefite, that men doe finde by the aboundaunce of holsome hearbes, and flowers, in preseruyng of their bodyly health. For which ende and purpose, I woulde wishe that all Gardens were made, and not so much sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes bestowed in waste, onely for the vaine delight of the eye, but also to the great encrease of muche vaine expences and wasted money, whereby nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb facs="5"/>
I speake neither against anie honourable or worshipfull mans pleasure or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie, whiche is made for the encrease and preseruation of health, but against vaine and superfluous gardening. Gardens are wholsome, healthfull, and commodious for two causes. First, for the ayre sake, for where manie kinde of sweete hearbes, grow together, there must of necessitie be an excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of aire, whereby the senses of man are both holpen and rele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ued. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie for medicine sake, bicause, of hearbes are made the moste excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, salues, and emplaisters for the expulsing of all maner diseases and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the bodie. But notwithstanding the commoditie be greate, yet for the most part it is priuate, for commonlie those that make faire Gardens, thei do so inclose them with huge walles, and high pales, that none hath the fruit of them but them selues, and in the richer mens Gardens, the more seldome do poore men reape anie pleasure by them. But herein I must, as I haue good occasion, commende the labour of this spirituall Gardener, our deere and painefull bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Iohn Northbrooke, whose Garden is not onelie painefullie purged and cleansed of all weedes, but well furnished with all maner of moste excellent hearbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> and flowers, that maie serue to the comforte of the spirituall senses of the faithfull, and for the curing of all diseases of the minde and conscience infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the corruption, either of the foule blacke aire of ignoraunce, or pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous sayinges and decrees of false doctrine and heresie.</p>
   <p>Whiche spirituall Garden, after that with greate labour and studie he had brought about to finishe, hauing taken great paines no doubt, in gettyng out of many Gardens, the most excellent Slippes, Seedes &amp; Plantes, and after that he had brought to passe, that no good hearbe was wanting, that might any thing profit or benefit such as are desirous of their soules health. He neither hath wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it about with great Bricke walles, nor hedged it about with quick thornes, neither paled it in, whereby it might seeme that he bestowed this cost for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and this paines only for his owne cōmoditie, as the maner of the world is to do: he hath franckly and freely, with all the commodites thereof, left it open to all maner of men: nay, more then so, that he hath made it a common Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he hath onely planted it, and geuen it to the poore, it is a common Garden for the poore, you maie be bolde to call it the poore mans Garden, out of which notwithstanding, both riche and poore, mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> gather and receiue, not a poore▪ but a verie fertile and riche commoditie. And none that shall haue occasion to walke in it, but he shall haue great cause to praise God for the commoditie that shall come to the faithfull by the paine and trauaile of this godlie and vige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Pastour and Minister of Gods Church, Iohn Northbrooke, whose sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of doctrine, modestie, integritie of life, and vpright conuersation, shineth, not only in this his labour, to the example of al the rest of Gods Ministers, but is also very apparant in his maners, and whosoeuer of parcialitie, purpose, or selfe affection, doth or shall go about to saie or maintayne the contrarie, others that shoulde heare it, knowing our godlie brother, and faithfull Minister of the Church, Iohn Northbrooke (who is a man not vnknowen, but by face well
<pb facs="6"/>
acquainted) shall and maie iustly accuse such of no small iniurie done to the Church and Ministers of Christ, especially in these perillous times, where the good name of a faithfull Minister (walke he neuer so vprightly) is not so easily preserued and kept, as mischieuously stollen and purloyned from him, by the enuious and spitefull Papistes, and Newters, which are with Lyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>es eyes, and Tygre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> teeth bent against Gods trueth and Ministers: one of whom hauing once lost his good name, hardlye it is that euer it maie or can generallye be bought or purchased againe, and that made <hi>Isocrates</hi> to say, Let it be more care vnto thee that thou maiest leaue an honest report vnto thy children, then great riches, for riches be mortal, but a good name is immortal, &amp; through hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, goodes maie be gotten: but a good repor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> is neuer redeemed with money. Also, riches fall to wicked men, but the glorie of a good name, can not happen except to passing good men only, and surely truely it is saide of him, for as the worlde nowe goeth, a man were better not to liue, then to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ue among the wicked scornefull, with an vndeserued infamie, but blessed be God, that the force of slaunder can not so preuayle, that it can vtterly deface open knowen vertue, at the least, if the Tygre b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>e, it can not kill, as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> saith, Slaunder, a litle while doth confirme the opinion of the hearers, but in processe of time, nothing is more feeble then it is. But what good reader, and my deare brethren and fellowe Ministers, shoulde I waste much time in commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, whose Christian conuersation doth not onely commende it selfe, but doth inuiolably defende it selfe against the fierie dartes of slaunder. I will let passe to speake any more of the person, I will speake of his painefull trauaile, godlie zeale, and faithfull affection to Gods Churche, and for the helpe of the memorie of his fellowe Ministers, doth shewe, and plainely set foorth in this his most christian and godlie worke, so profitable to all, and vnprofitable to none, that euerie man shal finde great assistaunce in hauing it, and much dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in wanting it: For if I shall speake of the worthinesse of it, it is so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, as neuer any thing in my iudgement, in our time, in our barbarous rude tongue, of an Englishe mans compilyng, and of no greater volume, well waying the richnesse of the matter, hath bene printed a worthier. This worke is not in vaine called the poore mans Garden, for it is a riche bed of all sweete flowers, that is, a breefe collection and vnifourme consent of fragrant sweete smelling Scriptures, and fruitfull agreement of the soundest iudgement of the Doctours, which haue on the Scriptures builded long ago their faith and true religion, nowe gathered together for the profite of the ignoraunt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>oubtfull, and for the confirmation of such as do beleeue and are perswaded in the trueth. The sicke infected papisticall conscience, reading this with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and charitable humilitie, shall no doubt feele the operation of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of trueth and present health approching. The Anabaptist, the Pelagian, and the Arian hither resorting, maie gather amongst these leaues, medecines of health. God graunt them not to despise it: for they are diseased to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting death, excep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> speedie repentaunce and confession of the trueth. All such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>
      <pb facs="6"/>
are infected with any false opinion, here maie be healed, and no doubt, it is not hurtfull euen to the wholest: that is, to the most sounde and stablest in faith. The poore plowman maie, hauing this litle booke often to studie vpon, easily learne in the plaine mother tongue, not only to giue a sound reasō of his owne faith, which aswell apperteyneth to the Carter and Plowman, as to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and Bachiler of Diuinitie: but hereout he maie also arme him selfe with trueth, that all the subtile Sophistrie of the diuine and sorbonistes Papistes, shall neither make him doubt or be offended at the trueth. Finally, none that loueth Iesus Christe the sonne, and surest pointes of his doctrine: namely, of faith in the Gospell, but he will be farre in loue with this Garden: but aboue all, my brethren of the Ministerie, to Whom God hath not geuen the gift of tongues, this is to you no small benefite, for whose sakes cheefly the aucthour hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this paine. God graunt that no lesse aduantage may come to euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church of God by the same (gentle reader) then the present worke it selfe doth shewe was sought and desired of the writer, which may yet encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him to take more paynes, and stirre vp all the rest of able Ministers to set foorth their talentes, to encrease, for the profite of the Church of Christ as he hath done. The Haruest is great, God sende painefull labourers into the feelde, and their labours diligently employed, God geue encrease, that it may fructifie in his faithfull peoples heartes, and yeelde foorth fruite mightily, that on euery part Christ may be glorified, with his heauenly father, and the holy ghost, worlde without ende,</p>
