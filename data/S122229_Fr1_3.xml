   <head>TO THE THRICE ILLVSTRIOVS AND MOST EXCELLENT PRINCE, CHARLES, <hi>THE ONELY SONNE OF</hi> OVR SOVERAIGNE LORD THE KING.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>SIR:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue humbly sought leaue of his most Excellent MAIESTIE, to present your <hi>Highnesse</hi> with this <hi>Ʋolume</hi> of his MAIESTIES WORKES. I durst not but make the Suite; and his MAIESTIE could not well deny it. I will not say, that it had beene a peece of <hi>Iniustice</hi> in the KING to haue denyed you this right: But I dare say, it had beene a point of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in a <hi>Churchman</hi> to haue stolne from you such a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="4"/>of your Inheritance, which consists as much in the WORKES of his Royall <hi>Ʋertues,</hi> as in the wealth of his mighty <hi>Kingdomes. Basilius</hi> wrote <hi>de Jnstitutione Principis</hi> to his Sonne <hi>Leo; Constantinus</hi> to his Sonne <hi>Romanus; Manuell</hi> to his Sonne <hi>Iohannes;</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, to his Sonne <hi>Philip:</hi> The workes of the three former are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant both in <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi> His <hi>Maiestie,</hi> after the Example of those <hi>Emperours,</hi> and sundry other <hi>Kings,</hi> wrote his ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΟΝ-ΔΩΡΟΝ to <hi>Prince Henry,</hi> your <hi>Highnesse</hi> most worthy <hi>Brother:</hi> His part, by GOD his Prouidence, is falne to your Lot; and who may iustly detaine from you the rest? The rule in Scripture is; that if the first fruits be holy, so is the whole lumpe; and to whom the first was giuen, to him all the rest was due: To your <hi>Highnes</hi> therefore are these offered, as to the trew Heire and Inheritor of them. And that I may make you the better accompt of them; May it please your <hi>Highnesse</hi> to vnderstand, that of these <hi>Workes,</hi> some were out before; some other of them neuer saw light before; and others were almost lost and gone, or at least abused by false co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, to their owne disgrace and his <hi>Maiesties</hi> great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. Now it being the duetie of all <hi>Deanes</hi> in their Churches, <hi>Dispersa colligere;</hi> I thought it might sort well with the nature of my place in the <hi>Chappel,</hi> wherein I haue had the Honour so many yeeres to serue his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> to gather these things that were scattered, and to bring to light those that too long had lien in darkenes, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue in one body, what might easily haue bin lost in parts. In this <hi>Presentment,</hi> I must humbly craue of your <hi>Highnes,</hi> not to be mistaken in the trew meaning and maner of it: For these <hi>Workes</hi> come not to you, as vsually Bookes doe to men of great <hi>Dignitie,</hi> for <hi>Patronage</hi> and <hi>Protection;</hi> for Protection is properly from iniurie; and that the Royall <hi>Author</hi> of them is best able to right: But to you they come partly for preseruation, and for that the Disposition
<pb facs="4"/>of Nature hath made you more apt, and more principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a Patterne, and that not vnfitly; since the <hi>Samplar</hi> is euer more ancient then the <hi>Exemplification:</hi> And as in the preseruation, the Sonne hath his aduantage by succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; so in the Patterne, the Father by preceding hath his <hi>Prerogatiue.</hi> Let these <hi>Workes</hi> therefore, most Gracious <hi>Prince,</hi> lie before you as a Patterne; you cannot haue a better: Neither doeth the Honour of a good Sonne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in any thing more, then in immitating the good <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> of a good <hi>Father;</hi> as we may very well perceiue by the Scripture phrase, where the vsuall <hi>Encomium</hi> of good <hi>Kings</hi> is, that they walked in the wayes of their Fathers. Al men see, how like the Patterne GOD and <hi>Nature</hi> haue framed the outward <hi>Lineaments:</hi> and who knowes your <hi>Highnes</hi> wel, knowes also, that the inward <hi>Abilliments</hi> hold in the like proportion. The <hi>Philosophers</hi> say, that Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeds from Inclination; And trewly, if your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Imitation be answerable to your forward Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in <hi>Religion, Learning</hi> and <hi>Ʋertue;</hi> your <hi>Highnesse</hi> cannot come farre short of your <hi>Patterne,</hi> nor yet of any of your <hi>Predecessors</hi> that euer went before you: Which GOD grant together with the length of many good and happy <hi>Dayes.</hi>
