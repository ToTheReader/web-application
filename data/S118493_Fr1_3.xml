   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>RVE it is, Nothing is begun and ended
at one, and the selfe same tyme; nor are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-thoughts
only, better then the workes
themselues. Some yeares past, I wrote the
like of <hi>Francis Xauier,</hi> with as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actnes
and fidelity, as possibly I could: but
the very shape thereof, when I saw it (being diuulged in my
absence) could I hardly know, it was so defiled &amp; distayned
with faults. Nor came it forth, indeed, more faulty, then
mayned. For when as formerly the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> had
commanded <hi>Xauerius</hi> famous Deedes to be sought out by his
Viceroy of <hi>India;</hi> those things only of note, which he had
wrought within the <hi>Portugheses</hi> dominions, were then col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and set downe: nor yet those entierely neither, but
only such, as could be knowne, and testified by sufficient
Witnesses that were present. As for his other acts, especially
those which he perfourmed among the <hi>Chineses</hi> and <hi>Iapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
(although very memorable and illustrious) they were
for the most part, as yet, detayned in silence, and obscurity.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
Those therfore in like manner comming at last vnto my
hands, &amp; being written by such persons as at that tyme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed
with the <hi>Iaponians</hi> and <hi>Chineses;</hi> I was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly
induced to set my selfe to worke againe, by transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them into Latin, and inserting them in their due place
amongst the rest. And although I was heerein to vndertake
the compiling of almost a new worke, and thereby driuen at
the first into some feare from the enterprize: yet my loue, as
well to <hi>Xauerius,</hi> as my desire of the publicke vtility, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
all the difficultyes with were presented to my fancy. For
so great was the copiousnesse and worth of his new exploytes,
that of foure Bookes (least they might grow ouer-great) it
was necessary to make six. Besides, I haue in this, done my
best also, to procure, that, as our <hi>Xauerius</hi> hath heereby
gotten a new Make; so he may appeare in publicke, more
corrected and exact, although humane frailty can neuer be
wary inough against errours. So as, he may well be said a most
wise and iust Esteemer of things, who iudgeth that to haue
bin corrected best, which in this kind may seeme to haue fewest
faults.</p>
