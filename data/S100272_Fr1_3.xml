   <head>❧ To the gentle Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VHen I considered with my
selfe (Gentle Reader) of the
sundry kinds of delights; of
the fine wits yeelding, most
pleasant conceipts: of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
of inuentions, with
the profunditie of euerye
mans iudgement, I find that
(thereby) this is the hardest world that might happen
to grosse heads and greene wits. The redoubling of
phrases running with words beginning all with one
letter, in the amorous discourses of young Gallants,
iointly with the liues of their inamoured Mistrisses:
in Histories liuely desciphering foolish dotage ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
in old men and stale widdowes, with the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencie
of matching crooked old age, and wilie
youth together are so commonly vsed; as they who
spend their time, dull their heads, and bestowe their
trauell in penning such bookes, are either thought to
steale their inuention from othermens labours, or
else accounted of as wittals, for spending their studies
about such common deuises. But if any man write
louing Songs, and amiable Sonnets, they, as foolish
toyes nothing profitable, are of euery one misliked,
if of famous mens actes done long agoe, they are tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
lyes, and therefore to be reiected, if of things
hapned in our dayes, the euents of those but now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
practises, neede no discourses to cause remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.
What shall I say, the Booke-hinders shops,
and euery Printers presse are so cloyed and clogged
with Bookes of these and such-like matters, that they
<pb facs="4"/>
are good for nothing (as they say) but to make wast-paper,
whereby it falleth out, that through the mispri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the <hi>Authors</hi> minds, and misconstruing of their
meanings, with the innumerable swarme of <hi>Momus</hi>
followers, that a man were better to go to plough one
whole yeare, then to toyle his head but one moneth
about publishing any of his studyes. The considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whereof, hath been such an impediment to the
printing of this my Pamphlet (I tearme it so, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the matter there-in handled, but of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
thereof,) that when it was (at the earnest request
of one that might haue commaunded) both begun
and finished very neere with-in the space of one whole
moneth, I was after-wards three long moneths stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying,
whether it were better for me to burne it, or to
giue it to the Presse: which the rather happened, for
that my proceedings were crost by diuers backward
euents. For first of all (after the finishing of it) when I
had gone through with the Printer, so that within
two dayes it should haue been ready for his trade,
there fell out a crosse matter, whereby it was dasht for
the space of tenne weekes, then hauing intelligence of
the commonnesse of Ballads, with Bookes to this
purpose, I resolued my selfe to bestowe this my
Pamphlet on the fire. But crabbed <hi>Fortune</hi> (who euer
hinders willing enterprises) through the intreatie of
diuers of my deerest friends, stayed my determinate
purpose, by perswading me that those Bookes and
Ballads did very little touch the matter my Booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth
of, which caused me rather to publish this
my worke (intituled <hi>Elizabetha Triumphans)</hi> truely
and effectually declaring the wicked attempts of the
<pb facs="4"/>
diuelish <hi>Pope,</hi> with his damned adherents practised to
the praise or dispraise of me it <hi>Author,</hi> then to let
such broken tales, told in plaine Ballets, expresse the
vnspeakeable actes, and wondrous ouerthrowes had
against the <hi>Pope</hi> by this our royall Queene and her
(by this made famous) <hi>Island.</hi> Committing therefore
both this Booke my first worke, with my selfe a yong
versefier to your liking, I desire nothing of you
for my paynes, but that you will not condemne
the beginning, vntill you haue read to the
ending, and then of Gods name be
free with your censure.
Fare you well.</p>
