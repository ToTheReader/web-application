   <head>The Preface of the Translator vnto the second Oration of Morall instructions, written by that famous and learned Oratour <hi>Isocrates</hi> vnto <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocles</hi> the king of Salamis, as touching the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Princes and Magistrates, and the well ordering of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Weale.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the former Oration contained a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall discourse as touching the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing of youth, and the ordering of the life of euery priuate person, so doth this now next insuing describe and set forth certaine rules and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes appertaining to the gouernment of a common weale, written vnto one Nicocles King of Salamis, a part of Cypers, the sonne of Euagoras: who being verie young (and his father dead was now to take vpon him the rule and gouernment of the kingdome wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Isocrates wrote vnto him this briefe Oration, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as bound therevnto by the courtesie and friendship showen vnto him by his father, desiring also a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the same in the sunne) and partly for to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to the worlde, (to the reproofe of his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) that the ende of all his studie was to exhorte and perswade all men to the imbracing of vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie: and to the auoyding of wickednesse and vice, willing through so lust an occasion giuen by writing to this king, to profite all others which should take vpon them any kinde of gouernment or office in any Common weale, as shall plainely appeare vnto those which will take the paynes to reade it ouer. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the slendernesse of my simple skill, may seeme not so exactly to haue translated the same, as my poore good will could haue wished, yet to the intent
<pb facs="27"/>
that neither the worthynesse thereof should in ought respect be obscured by me, or remaine as vnknowne vnto you, the bountifull liberalitie extended by this noble Prince towardes the writer, shall sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the same. It is left vnto memorie by sundry wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that this king sente vnto Isocrates as a rewarde for his good will, and paines taken in writing this so necessarie a lesson for him: twentie Tallentes of siluer the which summe of our money amounteth vnto .xx. hundred poundes reckoning Talentum minus. And where as now beholding the magnificencie and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler liberalitie of this renowned king with the great good will he shewed himselfe to beare towardes those which are studious in the knowledge of good litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I might iustly bewaile the want of such men in these our dayes, respecting not onely the infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of liuinges at the first allowed for the maintenance of studentes, but nowe remaining in the handes of those whom we may rightly call worldlinges, but also that horrible and most abhominable selling and craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie conueying of spirituall benefices, nothing respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nor waighing the conuersation of the man on whom they bestowe them, so that they may haue ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther present money by him or his friends, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages themselues in pawne, vntill the income bee payde because I knowe it is but labour lost, in that it is so commonly cried out vpon, by most graue and learned preachers euen euery day, and yet not one to be founde whose couetous heart relenteth his former wretchednesse, I will rather returne to my authour as one with silence signifying my griefe, then sharpely in wordes to prosecute that, wherein I shall seeme so litle to preuaile, wherefore my onely request is that all true Christians would not forget euen in their dayly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to beseeche the Lord our God among a number of other mischiefes, as especially to redresse this so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible an infection, whereby learning the onely mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayner
<pb facs="28"/>
of a common Weale bee not onely alreadie greatly hindered, but also in daunger in time to come to be vtterly neglected: if this yoke be not taken of from the neckes of poore stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents by some such one as shal seeme as greatly to fauour the same as did this woorthie King.</p>
