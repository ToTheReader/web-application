      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the imprinting of this booke of the displaying of the Familie of Loue, I haue beene answered by diuerse letters, but from whome they were sent, it is not expedient that I declare, for as much as I doe but guesse at the matter. by the reading whereof, you shal perceiue, that some in the same Family are touched so neerely, that they begin to kicke and spurne against the trueth, and stirre vp themselues with all the poore skill they haue (which God knoweth is but a little) to defende both their Authour and his doctrine. Many are the causes that haue moued me to publish these their priuate letters with my aunsweres there vnto. Especially ij. the one is, that the Godly learned seeing wherein these of the Family are grieued
<pb facs="74"/>
touching our doctrine, may plentifully in places conuenient confute their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and defend the puritie of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which is taught. An other cause is, the bookes haue come into diuers mens hands, who neuer heard of the family of loue, which do imagine that I haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this my self, their errors are so grosse: hauing no occasion so to doe. Therefore I haue for my discharge let the worlde see, that such there are as I haue manifes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And some there are you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that can say somewhat to defende their authour and his doctrine. Some wil not thinke it well done to make that common which was written priuatly for conscience sake, to whom I wholly agree in all thinges sauing heresies, (and especially those y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> are secreat) therefore for my excuse I protest I could very wel haue kept these priuate conferences se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, had not some Godly and learned, ernestly moued me to the contrarie. And if I had thought that these rude aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres shuld haue come abroad. I would haue vsed some more diligence in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them: but since the family haue
<pb facs="75"/>
coppies hereof, I minde not to add any thing least they exclame against me as you see they doe. What part of our doctrine they finde fault with, by peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing these leters thou shalt perceiue. The Lord in mercy open their eyes that they may at the last beholde their backsliding from the right wayes of the Lorde our God manifested, and bring them O Lorde againe into thy folde, that we all may reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that good sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde of our soules Christe Iesus.</p>
