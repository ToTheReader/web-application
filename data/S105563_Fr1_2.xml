      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He most ancient and famous Philosophers (right honourable) albeit they neuer had any certain knowledge of God, yet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by hir instinct of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, delt so beneficially with them, that beholding the wonderful power of God in all his creatures, they dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to cōfesse that there was one who hadde made these things, and with all had a speciall care ouer them: Besides this, after the dissolution of this life, they aimed very neare at the immortalitie of the soule: who in the ende being ouercome with the depth of so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine a Mysterie, as a matter not to be measured by mannes reason, were constrained to leaue of to be curious in the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie after suche questions, and fell to the studie of such things as they thought would serue best to stay their appetite from the attempting of any vncomelinesse, and stirre their minds to the attaining of most commendable vertues. Wherin as they haue left behinde them so great store of necessary precepts, as we can not (so long as we direct our doings by their good discipline) but of necessitie we must tread the path that leades to perfecte happinesse. So besides this (as men reputing it a shame to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in any thing that by trauaile they might attaine vnto) they haue founde out to their great praise and our singular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
<pb facs="3"/>
and pleasure, the secrete and hidden reason of many things, which nature hath kept vnknowne from vs (as it should seeme of set purpose) to the end we might the rather finde our selues occupied in the search and knowledge of the same. And like as some of them by reason they are ordinary and cōmon, the cause thereof being also naturall, together with the familiaritie and acquaintaunce we haue with them, and that they happen as it were of custome, doe moue vs the lesse or nothing at all to haue them in admiration when they chaunce or happen: Euen so on the contrary part there are other effectes of nature, which when we beholde, they do the more amaze vs, bicause we be not able to comprehend the causes and reasons thereof, but imagine straight way that nature is abused, or at least hath lost hir rule who in dede is alway one and vniforme, and cannot be but one cause working diuersly, according to the diuersitie of hir sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. Touching things supernaturall or aboue nature, we are to think they are not so cald in respect of nature, as though she had made ought by chaunce, wherof she was not able to yeld a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but rather hauing regard to vs, whose weake vnderstāding cannot conceiue hir secrete meanes in working. And therefore we must thinke they haue their proceeding from God or some diuine inspiration, either directly or indirectly, immediatly or by a meane, seing that God oftentimes both to warne vs of his iustice and to punish our offences, layeth his hand and rod vpon vs in diuers sortes, as when we feele the raging whirlewindes and tempests by sea, the terrible earthquakes by land▪ the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flames of lightning, and crackes of thunder in the aire, and all these things without vs. But to come nigher vnto our selues when we feele any distemperature in our bodies, wherupon doe grow some greuous diseases: All which albeit they haue their being and motion by naturall meanes, yet seeme they the rather prodigious bicause they be rare and happen but seldome. But those things which are called supernaturall bicause the reason is hidden from vs, they come by the permission or speciall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God, as when we be troubled with wicked spirites

      </gap>acles, fained visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other such diuelish illusions. Wherof as I shall not nede to speake either particularly or in general, so seeing that besides the reasons and aucthorities which are gathered together in this slender volume, the writers of Histories in bothe kindes haue giuen out sufficient matter touching an absolute resolution that way, which as I hope may suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap> to discharge me of a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>scription of such things as the booke it self doth amplie and more at large containe: So leauing to deale in the offences of some suche persones as vse and abuse their bodies through an inordinate lust against the prescripte of nature, wherupon hapneth oftentimes both a superabundāce and default in the creatures brought into the world: As I hope also it is nedelesse for me to mention in this place the generation of precious stones with their sundrye properties, the force and vertues which by experience we find to be in plants and herbes proceding out of the sappe and substāce of the earth, with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other qualities, seruing against the incōueniences that come by the aire, by fire, by scalding lead<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ttals molten &amp; burning, bicause the volume following discribes them sufficiēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their seueral places. The iudgement wherof with their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall reasons, I humbly submit to the censure of your wisdome, the which if it shall in any part be to your liking, I haue the chiefest part of my desire, and shall the lesse neede to regard the variable fantasies and opinions of the multitude: For as much as my trauaile bestowed herein hath bene onely in respecte of your Lordship, to whom as well for my selfe as diuers of my frendes, I am very much bound. Notwithstanding I would be glad that my priuate trauaile might vniuersally either profit or pleasure all. For the boke it selfe I am of opinion that neyther the discription of many things therin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap> is so commonly knowne, that the strangenesse therof is not able to delite a great many, neither yet the matter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 span">

      </gap> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t shall not yelde much fruit that may be applied to sundry purposes. We see in daily experience, with howe great earnestnesse and delight the

vnlearned sorte runne ouer the fruitlesse Historie of king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> and his round table Knights, and what pleasure they take in the trifeling tales of <hi>Gawin</hi> and <hi>Gargantua:</hi> the which bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that they passe all likelihode of truth, are vtterly without either graue precept or good example. Whereby I am in better hope that this booke containing suche varietie of matter bothe plesant to read and necessary to know, being sprinkled through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with great wisdome and moralitie, shall be the rather em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and allowed of all. And in the meane time trusting that as I haue taken vpon me the translation of this smal boke, only vpon consideration bothe to acknowledge the duetie I owe youre Lordshippe, and signifie the good meaning I beare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes you, so you will vouchesafe to vndertake the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage thereof, and when your waightier affaires shall giue you leaue to haue recourse thereunto and reade it for your recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I leaue your good Lordship vntil such time as my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge shall embolden me to present you with a greater matter and more worthy your reding: wishing vnto you and the whole race of your noble house, encrease and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of honor, with the attainment of perfect felicitie.</p>
