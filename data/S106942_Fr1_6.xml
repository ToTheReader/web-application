      <l>Well knowen to me (good Banister) thy poore and loyall fiend,</l>
      <l>I would I could in skilfull Verse so cunnyngly commend,</l>
      <l>As well I know it well deserues both prayse and prayse agayne.</l>
      <l>And sure I am that this thy toyle, and heere employed payne</l>
      <l>For paynting out the frame of man, in this our mother toung,</l>
      <l>Culd out of learned Latine workes, heerehence hath onely sprong</l>
      <l>That thou thereby thy countrey men mighst further much in skill:</l>
      <l>And geue them light that earst they lackt, as sure (I hope) it will.</l>
      <l>Thou wrightst not for the learned sort (I know) that were but vayne,</l>
      <l>But hopest to helpe the meaner folke. And so, I trust thy payne</l>
      <l>Shall wynne such prayse of skillfull men, as paynfull toyle may craue,</l>
      <l>And as a mynde that meaneth well of duety ought to haue.</l>
      <l>If errour ought hath scapte thy penne, or paynter hapt to hault,</l>
      <l>Let that no whit dismay thy mynde. None scapes deuoyd of fault.</l>
      <l>Where skillfull men geue iust reproofe, with carefull payne amend it.</l>
      <l>Regarde not much the rascall sort that blyndly reprehend it.</l>
      <l>For as we know that men be men, and easely apt to stray:</l>

      <l>My selfe of late haue tryed in that so small a worke of myne,</l>
      <l>Wherein I sought no prayse to winne, nor get a name deuine,</l>
      <l>But onely to content my frendes, whose earnest suyte to craue it,</l>

      <l>Yet some I found with readyer tounges forth with to reprehend it,</l>
      <l>Then fraught with skill to frame the like, or ought perhaps to mend it.</l>
      <l>But who so ready to controll, or fit to carpe, and clatter,</l>
      <l>As he that hath the dymmest sight, and iudgement in the matter?</l>
      <l>What if I did somewhat omit? what if the Print were lame?</l>
      <l>What if I meant at leasure more to haue enlargd the same?</l>
      <l>How euer it be, I neuer meant to please eche curious hed,</l>
      <l>Syth who so toyles him selfe in that may bryng a foole to bed.</l>
      <l>Wherfore my good and honest frend referre the whole successe</l>
      <l>Of this, and all thy toyles to hym that will thy trauailes blesse.</l>
      <l>And as thou hast by labours great, obteined a grounded skill,</l>
      <l>And settled sight in Surgery, so I exhort thee still</l>
      <l>By skillfull workes the fame of such a facultie to rayse,</l>
      <l>Wherein we know most famous Clerkes haue, often, spent their dayes,</l>
      <l>And trauailes great: in hope thereby immortall fame to winne,</l>
      <l>Whose worthy workes do well bewray their paynfull toyle therein.</l>
      <l>I speake not of the famous Greekes, and fathers of the Artes:</l>
      <l>Nor Guidoes workes, nor Vigoes workes that write of other partes:</l>
      <l>But of the whole Anathomie Vesalius passyng well.</l>
      <l>Collumbus and Fallopius workes, how much they here excell.</l>
      <l>Whose skilfull pennes haue paynted so ech part and peece of Man,</l>
      <l>As none lookes now to better it, (I thinke) nor euer can.</l>
      <l>Whose lastyng fame no age shall once be able to deface.</l>
      <l>Among the which (good Banister) I wish to thee a place.</l>
      <l>And so Adeiwe. And thou (good Reader) pardon I thee pray</l>
      <l>My penne that in this homely ryme hath raungd to farre astray.</l>
      <l>But three fold wayes enforst thereto. For zeale vnto my frend.</l>
      <l>For wronges of myne. For my professed Art. And so I end.</l>
