      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Sermon, at it was neuer meant to the Presse, so bath it been kept from it almost foure yeeres: Now it is constrained to shew it selfe, as sometimes Trinces bee, lest some counterfeit steale their name, and vsurpe their place. Whilest <hi>Samuels</hi> body slept, the <note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>So Austen</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim; immundus spiritus, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus spiritus.</note> diuell would be <hi>Samuel,</hi> &amp; deceine with <note n="b" place="margin">Image Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elis, sumilitudo Sam, imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria simulatio Samuel, &amp;c. <hi>so others</hi> v. D. Rayn. lest.</note> shewes, I had reason to feare some such like ingling with <hi>Samuels</hi> funerall, being fore-threatned. In this extremity, if I had rather my owne child beare my name then a bastard, blame mee not. Now thou seest it, take me with thee a little, before thou readest it: Know, that the first point onely was enlarged, the rest thus briefly (as thou findest them) touched by reason of hast, being tyed to an houre. Secondly, know, that I neuer wrote forth these notes but once, and that is the reason of the most of the marginall quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and references, it being now my ordinary practice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre my selfe in priuate notes to such Authors, as haue written (within my memory and reading) of the same subiect, although in publike I quote sparingly. Thirdly, vnderstand the true reason of my forbearing personall praises in the close: my text gaue me occasion of saying somthing before, &amp; me thought it handsomer to lay al my stuffe vpon the foundation, then to set vp a leane-to. Secondly, I remembred what a wise man said, <note place="margin">Sapientia non quaerit vocis testimon um, sed operum. Hierod. in Math. lib. 2.</note> Wisdome grounds vpon mens workes, rather then words. Thirdly and especially, I finde the practice (though in it selfe lawful) exceedingly abused, I haue no leisure now to take vp the complaints of worthy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters against this abuse; onely I could wish, that our age would distinguish betwixt funerall Orations, and funerall Sermons, as former ages haue done, and not confound so different things. It is fit that grace should be followed euen to heauen with honour:
<pb facs="5"/>but oh that euery of Christs messengers would remember his master, and before he speakes, aske himselfe the question; Would my Lord and master speake this himselfe, were he now to preach in person? but I must not dwell in the porch. One thing more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leaue thee, thou seest the guise of this world, Printers get copies for their profit; Readers buy and reade for their pleasure, and (perhaps) some print too for their credit: but where is the man that proiects his owne spirituall good? Ʋerily the number of such is small, be thou of that number, make some vse of others liues, of others deaths, trifle not as many doe: what is this same <hi>R. H.</hi> &amp;c? who was this <hi>A. C.</hi> a good or a bad man, &amp;c? bee thou godly, and I care not what thou esteemest of me: as for this worthie Gentleman in speech, vnderstand, that as I neuer flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him liuing; so will I not deifie him (as the Heathen did their Patrones) being dead. <note place="margin">Herodian.</note> He had his wants, his faults, nor did wee concurre in all opinions: but I would that thou and I, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially men of his owne rank would follow him in these particulars: first, in praying most earnestly, and particularly against our spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial sinnes; secondly, in louing and reuerencing our own teachers; and that so much the more, by how much the more frecly and plainly they reprone vs. For these things (not to speake of other particulars) much commend the truth of that Honourable Knight, that in his standing prayers with his family, hee would shame himselfe most in his confessions for his owne most speciall sinnes. And againe, as he much respected, and greatly countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced euery learned and vnscandalous Preacher: so most of all those that least fauoured his corruptions; often blessing God for such teachers as would not giue him rest in sinne, and not sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome prouoking them, at least my selfe (to speake of my owne knowledge onely) with such like words: <hi>Goe on, spare vs not; though corruption may busle a while, yet God will giue vs hearts to come in at length, and to submit to the scepter of his Word; howsoeuer, it shall bee a Preachers Crowne to be faithfull, and to baulke none.</hi> Thus bee many a time to mee in priuate, after that I had been (as the world thought) sharpe enough with him in publike. Oh that we had more such Knights, such hearers now! But I forget my selfe to remember thee of a dutie, Shall I say on: thing more in his bonour? The Papists
<pb facs="5"/>neuer loued him; and therefore if they in thy hearing now perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his name, say as a Father once said of a cruell persecuter, That religion which they so persecute, must needs be excellent: This I can assure thee, his end was most comfortable, and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour no way obscured, nor his memorie lost in his owne country by death. More then this I haue not now to say to thee, onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that thou hast gotten one more witnesse against thee in the last day, by reading this Sermon, vnlesse thou put it to some vse. Farewell.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Thine in the Lord, R. H.</hi>
