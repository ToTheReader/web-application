                 <title>A dictionarie in Spanish and English, first published into the English tongue by Ric. Perciuale Gent. Now enlarged and amplified with many thousand words, as by this marke * to each of them prefixed may appeere; together with the accenting of euery worde throughout the whole dictionarie, for the true pronunciation of the language, as also for the diuers signification of one and the selfesame word: and for the learners ease and furtherance, the declining of all hard and irregular verbs; and for the same cause the former order of the alphabet is altered, diuers hard and vncouth phrases and speeches out of sundry of the best authors explaned, with diuers necessarie notes and especiall directions for all such as shall be desirous to attaine the perfection of the Spanish tongue. All done by Iohn Minsheu professor of languages in London. Hereunto ... is annexed an ample English dictionarie ... by the same Iohn Minsheu</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hreefold Reader, for so thou wilt diuide thy selfe, into good, bad, and indifferent; whom I likewise compare to three kindes of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Bee, the Spider, &amp; the Cameleon: The first, only I hold in account, and I hope he will account of me and my labours, as that it may not be said, <hi>Perit quod facis ingrato.</hi> The second, whom I as little regard, as he the credit of others; because like the Spider, conuerting all to poyson; or as cupping glasses drawing out nothing but corrupt blood, he thinketh himselfe graced to haue only a grace in backbiting. But let me aske him this one question, whether he euer published his owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in Print? If he answere yea: then I say with the Italian, <hi>Chi vuol dir' mal d' altrui, prima pensi di lui,</hi> He that will speake ill of another, let him first looke into himselfe: and <hi>Chi semina spine, non vadi discalzo,</hi> He that soweth thornes, let him not go barefoot; then may he finde, that <hi>Nemo sine crimine viuit,</hi> or <hi>Nemo sine crimine scribit:</hi> so that <hi>Bene audire qui vult, bene dicere oportet.</hi> To other moat-finders, that neuer smelt the oyle of the presse, I say with the Poet, <hi>Carpere vel noli nostra, vel ede tua,</hi> and let them consider this is my first worke; &amp; as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, in euery first worke there must be of force some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection &amp; error, which if he beleeue not, I say with <hi>Terence, Tu si hic sies, aliter senties.</hi> They that busie themselues in reprehending the faults of other mens writings, their owne are likely neuer to come to light: wherefore I wish them to deale gentleman like &amp; not vpon ods; then may we see, if <hi>El dezír y el hazér cómen juntos a su mesa,</hi> If speaking and dooing dine togither at their table. Besides, I haue vndertaken more then one worke at one time; as first the Spanish Dictionarie with English following; then an English Alphabet with Spanish following; then another little Dictionarie with generall heads, shewing the particular parts, as a man and his parts, a house with the implements therein, ships at sea, officers in war, trades and occupations, and diuers other things, <hi>quae nunc perscribere longum est, &amp;c.</hi> which is left out being somewhat preuented by time, besides Dialogues Spanish and English: and I haue done as the Italian Prouerbe saith, <hi>Chi tutto abbraccia, nulla stringe,</hi> or <hi>Chi due lepri caccia, vno perde altro lascia. Qui vbique est, nullibi est.</hi> Furthermore, the worke is long and my time but short, and as the Poet saith, <hi>Tantum opere in magno fas est obrepere somnum,</hi> that is, In a great worke it is tollerable to let passe diuers errours which time and perusing might haue corrected; and therefore saith <hi>Horace</hi> in his <hi>Arte poetica,</hi> that a worke that is finished, should be nine yeeres after in the Authors hands, to the intent, he might blot out, adde to, alter and amend: And I want nine yeeres yet to come, before I should thereof make an end, as those that be well experienced in this kinde can best deeme. Yet some that presume much, and can iudge little, haue affirmed that a Dictionarie in a yeere might be gathered compleat enough, I answere, that in conceit it may so be, and in much lesse time. And herewithall it comes now to my minde, that talking hereof with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman well read in the Greeke, Latin, and vulgar toongs, which entred into a worke, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and vowing to me, that he thought when he began, it could by no meanes possible hold him a moneths time, &amp; since that, he hath continually dwelt thereon almost this three yeeres, and thinkes he hath scarce halfe done. Before we begin, we lay downe our plot in conceit one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and thinke we may as soone make an ende, as our imagination or thought (which is the swiftest thing in the world) can flie ouer it. I confesse my selfe I was seduced by this errour, till practise brought me into the right path, &amp; repentance scourged me for going astray: if he take not my word herein, which haue tried, how would he haue his taken which neuer prooued. I acknowledge these workes <hi>Abortiues,</hi> borne before their due time into the world, which being so full of trouble and sickenes consumed the fathers substance thereon, for <hi>Moult des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendre, rien gaigner n'acquerir: fait l'homme en fin son pain querir.</hi> Therefore meanes was made in great haste that it was brought foorth as you see, which if the fathers wealth had
<pb facs="4"/>
beene answerable to his will, it would haue bin better able to haue done his countrey seruice: Notwithstanding all this the enuious, who canker and eate vp themselues in their owne rust (seeing they are of most continuance and antiquitie in the world, taking their beginning from the Serpent which seduced <hi>Eue,</hi>) so laboured that it might not be printed, that they left no stone vnturned which they thought might any waie hinder the same: a strange nature, to seeke to stop that should runne to the publike good; besides to some of their helpes, to pull them out when they sticke fast, and to other some to reape other profit by. Which droue me into remembrance of a fable, how <hi>Iupiter</hi> disposed to suruey the earth, sent his mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger downe, who met with a couetous and enuious man, for whose companie at their parting, he promised to giue either of them, what he woulde aske, and the other foorthwith shoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue double the value: the couetous would not demand first, because he woulde haue double so much; neither would the enuious, bicause he coulde not abide his fellow to do so well: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this conflict who shoulde aske first, knowing a demand must be made, the enuious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded one of his owne eies to be pulled out, that the other might receaue double: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious are neuer sadde, but when some harme is happened to themselues, or some good to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, therefore saith <hi>Antisthenes, Inuidos tam ciuitati esse inutiles, quam lolium tritico aut ignauum bello;</hi> Enuious persons as vnprofitable in a citie as darnell or cockle in the wheat, or a coward in the war: they resemble the Viper, which first gn̄awes out his dams guts, afterwards stings &amp; poisons others; or muzeled dogs, which when they cānot bite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, they set others on, &amp; oftētimes like the serpent <hi>Porphirius,</hi> who is ful of poison, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toothlesse hurteth none but himselfe; but let them passe as they are, &amp; prosper as they wish to others. Another sort of people which are so puffed vp with pride, &amp; swollen with fat of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, &amp; riches so metamorphosed, &amp; looking so proudly as if they were borne to be princes cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and lifting their heads so high as if they had beene bred to locke no lower then stars, hold in beggerly and base account learning and arte, forgetting now as the priest that euer he was parish clarke: yet as the peacocke wrapt in all the pride of his plumes is knowne to be but a dunghil birde by his foule feete; so though the high lookes, and costly sutes, argue to the eies of the world, they were men of worship, yet the churlish illiberalitie of their minds bewraie, that fish that is bred in puddle, will alwaies stinke of mudde. This sort woulde thinke it a fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call humour to honour greatly grauers in stone, as Romulus did, or priestes as Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius his successour did: or goldsmithes as Caius Caesar: or writers as Claudius: or good painters, as Vespasian: or to respect learning as <hi>Alexander</hi> did, which neither in peace or warre left <hi>Homers</hi> Iliades (togither with his sword) from vnder his beds head: or to write Commentaries as Caesar. And heere I cannot forget a gentleman of rare wit, and excellent learning, sir <hi>Edward Hobbie knight,</hi> who as hee hath gotten the perfection of the Spanish toong in a short time, so hath he publikely in print manifested it in like sort, as also in curtesie vouchsafed due praises, to the helpes he had for the same: well knowing, that <hi>Honos alit ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi> and <hi>Ars non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem.</hi> The thirde sorte of Readers which are as Iohn Indifferent, and resemble the Cameleon, which changeth it selfe into any colour according to the obiect that is neere it; so these men not able to iudge themselues, or not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into the matter,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Quien quiere mula sin ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha que se sté sin ella.</hi> He that will haue a mule without a fault, let him be without her.</note> harken what another saith of it, and so he affirmeth the same, not weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether the other spake of malice or ignorance: he that woulde holde esteeme of them, were not woorthie to be esteemed himselfe. Yet do I notwithstanding submit my selfe and doings, to the iudgement of the discreete, learned, and wise, that whatsoeuer is amisse, being aduertised thereof, I promise to labour with my best endeuours to correct and amende: for no doubt many things may escape in Printing, and much the more, for that I was in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey vpon necessitie, when the Dictionarie was at the presse, and there remained till it was all done:<note place="margin">Note, <hi>Péro</hi> as it is in the Grammar, pag. <hi>14.</hi> l. <hi>20.</hi> for a sower apple tree.</note> wherefore I meane to peruse the whole worke ouer, which shall be augmented, and if any thing be amisse it shall be amended: As for the captious (which take vp matters before they fall) let them allow me maintenance, and I will make it to their liking: knowing it is harde to please fewe, harder to please many, impossible to please all: I leaue these my labours to the viewe of all, so to be censured as they shall finde themselues profited by them. <hi>Vale.</hi>
