   <head>To the right vvorthily hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and most free Respecter of all vertue, his chiefly esteemde and singular good patrone Sir <hi>Iohn Scudamore</hi> Knight.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow noble, how auncient, and how effectuall the Arte of Musicke is, many excellent discourses of Theoristes deepely learned in the science haue already so confirmed &amp; illustrated, that it might seeme as much arrogancie in me to attempt the prayse thereof, as it argues malice or ignorance in such as seeke to exclude it out of diuine, or humaine soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie. I will onely alledge one testimonie out of an Epistle, which that auncient Father <hi>Martin Luther</hi> did write to <hi>Senfelius</hi> the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, which is so ample in commendation of this art, that it were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to adde any other. Musicke, saith he, to Diuels we know is hateful and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I plainely thinke neither am I ashamed to auerr it, that next to Theologie, there is no Arte comparable with Musicke: for it alone next to Theologie doth effect that, which otherwise onely Theologie can performe, that is, a quiet and a chearefull minde. Now if Musicke merites so high a place, as this holy man hath giuen it, can wee deny loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to them, that with their grace and bounty raise the professors thereof? Or to whome shal we that labour in this qualitie, better recommend our workes, then to our patrones and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors? Receiue therefore (most honoured Knight and my worthiest Patrone) the fruites of your bounties and the effects of those quiet dayes, which by your goodnes I haue enioyed. And as the glory of a new finisht house belonges not so much to the Worke-man that built it, as to the Lord that owes it, so if any part of this new worke of mine can excite commendation, the grace is chiefly yours, though the labour mine. But because there is no man more distrustfull of his owne endeuours then I am my selfe, by the weakenes of my nature: I beseech you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue my labours howsoeuer into your protection, whose worth can best countenance thē from misfortune, &amp; spirit defend them, I will onely assist you with a poore mans bounty, I meane my many humble prayers to the highest protector, beseeching him to blesse you with long life and prosperity to his glorie and our comforts, that must euer owe you our seruice and loue.</p>
