   <head>A PREFACE TO THE
READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O testifie my due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and seruice,
which I owe to
the Churche, and
my countrey; and
to satisfie my frē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
in these quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whose iudgmentes I haue not to
discredit; to confute M. Iuell in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
poyntes, whose challenge ys so glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riouse
and generall; and to geue faire
warning to the negligent, that false
Prophetes doe not deceaue them; to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynue
the memorie of the challenge;
which neuer can be honestlie maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
&amp; to moue a further expectation;
which part first shall shewe her weak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse;
to take the present tyme of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
euen as there hath ben tyme of
silēce, or recompense the formar slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="3"/>
by reasonable and faithfull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gēce:
to proue that M. Iuell may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
by a meane scholar in diuinitie,
that he neede not to prouoke the best
of the Catholykes, which at this daye
are anywhere lyuinge: to shewe that
all thowgh, we be kept downe and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
yet we perish not for all that,
nor be vtterlie confounded: I send that
furth now, after fower yeres, which so
long before was made by me, and I
make that now commō to frindes and
to foes, which at the first I prepared
for one frind alone, to auoyde feare of
foes. He that lyketh this, let hym thā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
God, and helpe me with his praiers.
He that findeth fault, lett hym shame
the dyuele, and tell me of it hardelie.
If any iust one shall be founde, (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
of me and others) I trowe, it will
be omission in leauing of some thinges
vnanswered. Yet doe I answer euerie
<pb facs="3"/>
matter, concerninge the whole some of
it, marie I was not so diligent, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
euerie witnesse. And whether
I am bound so to doe, I am not yet ful
perswaded, but euer I thowght, that
it was free, to wryte and fight, after
my fasshion. Especiallie where the
number ys great, and euerie one readie
with his weapon, so that the enemie
be beaten downe, the captaine aloweth
their labors. Yet all they dyd not stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
one waye, but as they should see
their aduantage, so would they vse or
downe right blowes, or foynes, or some
other inuētions. Some writers of these
our dayes, men of great contynuance
and studie, doe late full lode owt of
scriptures and councells, iust vpon the
pates, and backes of owr common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries,
Other some be more sparer,
in alleaginge of old authorities, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
folowe a sensible fasshion, of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
<pb facs="4"/>
withowt boke, against them.
Againe, some will persequute, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
so narowlie: that sentence by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
thei examyn his trueth and fide<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litie.
but some againe, doe so thinke
vpon the cheife poynt of the question:
that, for hast sake, thei let much esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,
which perchaunse, was well worth
the noting. Lett one example stand
for all. M. Iuell here in his sermon, to
proue that the people dyd cōmunicate
and receiue togeather with the preist,
all the first six hundred yeres after
Christ: beginneth with owr Saluyor,
and cummeth to the blessed Apostle,
goinge downe by S. Clement, Denyse,
Iustine, and other fathers, vntill he
stayeth at S. Gregorie, whom yet he
rekoneth for a wittnesse. But to what
purpose and conclusion? to proue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soth,
that sole receiuinge, ys not to be
suffered, emong Christians, bycawse he
<pb facs="4"/>
findeth, by so manie testimonies, that,
of old tyme, there were made commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
VVell then, goe ye to, if this
be all the matter, it ys not hard or cū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berouse,
to geue M. Iuell an answer.
Yet trulie, he shall not be answered, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one manner by all men, but lyke as
leisure, zeale, and lerninge, abundeth
or lacketh in any one, for the purpose:
so, more or lesse, will be browght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
hym, and he that saieth lest of
all, will yet be good inough for hym.
For the lest is this,<note place="margin">The first maner of answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe.</note> to grawnt his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
and onlie to denie his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
bicawse, sole receiuinge, might
be vsed in a thowsand chappells, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandinge
the dailie communion,
which was then, or may be now; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narilie
had in parissh Churches. On
sondaies also or solempne feastes, all
might be charged to cōmunicate▪ and
when the people on other daies are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="5"/>
wise occupied, the preist, might
right well doe his office, if none but
the parishe clerke, were present to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
hym.<note place="margin">A second manner.</note> But some other Catholike, is
not fullie satisfyed, by ending this mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
so quicklie, and therefore he goeth
further, in tryinge M. Iuells places,
which serue yet vnto no purpose, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
thei were truelie alleaged.
And he obiecteth agaynst Iuell (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
to call hym Maister) that the
Apostle vnto the Corinthians, meaneth
not literallie, so, as Iuell taketh hym.
For,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> (<hi>Tari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> ye, one for an other</hi>)
which are the true wordes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
are not properlie, (he will say)
to be referred to the Sacrament, but
those other suppers, of cōmon meates,
which then emonge the Corinthians,
were not charitablie or discreetlie or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.
He will tell hym also, that he
mistaketh Calixtus, and would say
<pb facs="5"/>
(perchaunce) Anacletus, and that he
speaketh, onlie of the clergie, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
and not (as M. Iuell repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth)
generallie of all the people, and so
furth in other testimonies.<note place="margin">A third mān<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>r.</note> Now some
third one, will passe these two, and
shewe by manie examples, that sole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuinge
was not vnknowē, in the best
tymes and most awncient. For which
purpose he will bringe owt, Tertulliā,<note place="margin">Tertull. ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

S. Ciprian, Serapion, and Satirus, with
manie other, which in this place I nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
not tell of. VVhat then shall we

when a false preachers vaine tale
is confuted, be it done either lernedlie,
abundantlie, and deeplie, or meanelie,
<pb facs="6"/>
sufficientlie, and by light passing ouer
