   <head>THE AVTHOR TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE PHILOSOPHERS teach vs by their writings, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth better shew it vnto vs, that to couet and desire is proper to the soule, and that from thence all the affections and desires of men proceede, which draw them hither and thither diuersly, that they may attaine to that thing, which they thinke is able to lead them to the enioying of some good, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may line a contented and happie life. Which felicitie, the most part of men, through a false opinion, or ignorance rather of that which is good, and by following the inclination of their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nature, do seeke and labor to finde in humane and earthlie things, as in riches, glorie, honor, and pleasure. But for a smuch as the enioying of these things doth not bring with it sufficient cause of contentation, they perceiue themselues alwaies depriued of the end of their desires, and are constrained to wander all their life time beyond all bounds and measure, according to the rashnes and inconstancie of their lusts. And although they reioice for a little while at euerie new change, yet presently they loath the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same thing, which not long before they earnestly desired. Their owne estate alwaies seemeth vnto them to be woorst, and euerie present condition of life, to be burdensome. From one estate they seeke after another, so that now they withdraw themselues from the seruice of princes, and mislike publike charges, and by and by they blame the priuate life, labouring that they may be imploied. They forsake one countrie to go and dwell in another, and sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they desire to returne againe into their former waies. They that haue neither wiues nor children, seeke and wish for them, and when they haue them, they desire oftentimes nothing more than to be rid of them: and soone after ye shall see them married againe. Haue they heaped vp great store of wealth, and increased their reuenues by halfe so much more? they desire notwithstanding to make it altogither as much. The soldier seeketh to be a captain: from a captaine to be maister of the campe: from maister of the
<pb facs="11"/>
campe to be lieutenant to the king: then he would gladly make himselfe king. The seelie Priest would be a Curate: from a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, Bishop: from a Bishoppe, Cardinall: from a Cardinall, Pope: and then would commaund Kings and soueraigne Princes. Kings are not contented to raigne ouer their owne subiects, but bende themselues alwaies to enlarge their limits, to make themselues (if they can) the onely Monarchs. Briefly, all men whose harts are set vpon worldly goods, when they are come to this estate of life, they would attaine to that: and being come thereunto, some other neae desire carieth them farther, so that this mischiefe of continuall, vncertaine, and vnsatiable lustes and desires doth more and more kindle in them, vntill in the ende death cut off the thred of their inconstant, and neuer contented life. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, bicause the alteration of an Estate and condition of life plucketh not out of the mind that, which presseth and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth it: namely, the ignorance of things, and imperfection of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But they, who through the studie of wisedome are furnished with skill and vnderstanding, and know that all humane and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie things are vncertaine, deceitfull, slipperie, and so many allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnto men to drawe them into a downe-fall and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they I say, doe laie a farre better and more certaine founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their chiefe <hi>Good,</hi> contentation, and felicitie. For they are so farre off from being caried away, as worldlings are, with the desire of greatnes, riches, and pleasure, that they rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire lesse than they haue, contemne them, and so vse them as though they had them not. And deliuering their soules by the grace of God, from all those perturbations, which besiege them in the prison of their bodies, they lift vp their wishes and desires, yea they refer al the endsof their intents &amp; actions to this only marke, to be vnited and ioined to the last end of their soueraigne <hi>Good,</hi> which is the full &amp; whole fruition of the essence of God, that their holy affections might be at once fulfilled and satisfied, by enioying that diuine light, through a most happie &amp; immortal life, when they shal be vncloathed of this body of death, &amp; of all concupiscences &amp; passions, &amp; reioice in such a felicitie, as neither eie hath seene, nor eare heard, nor euer entred into the hart of man. Moreouer we ought to know, if we haue neuer so litle iudgmēt &amp; reason, that in al worldly things how great &amp; goodly soeuer they seeme to our carnall
<pb facs="11"/>
eies &amp; sences, there is such a mixture of bitternes &amp; dislike ioined with the fruition of them, that if we could diuide the euil from that which of the ignorant sort is called good, &amp; weigh them one against another, there is no doubt but the bad part would easily weigh down what goodnes soeuer could be found amongst them. But how shal we call that good, which is so mingled with euill, which oftentimes hurteth more than it profiteth, and which being possessed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, cannot yet keepe the possessor thereof from being wretched and miserable? What contentation can a man find therein, seeing that such a Good commonly slippeth away as soone as it is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and alwaies worketh an vnsatiable desire thereof? What feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie shall we expect and looke for in the fruition of that thing, which waxeth old and perisheth, and which men are alwaies afraid to loose? Now I pray you, who can doubt iustly, but that the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and nature of riches, of glorie, of honour and pleasure is such? Whereupon we must conclude, that man can finde no goodnes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation or happines, in any thing that is earthly and mortall. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, who knoweth not sufficiently the poore estate of mans life, which in the fairest of his race commeth to nothing in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eie, so that all his bodily shewe and brightnes turneth suddenly into putrefaction? Who doth not try more than he would, how full his life is of sharpe griefes, and pricking miseries, and how it is assaulted with continuall troubles? With how many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing cares doth it abound, and what griping griefes doe pursue it? Briefly, as a wise Grecian said, hauing but the bare name of life, it is in effect and truth a continuall paine. And truly that thing hath no beeing in deede, which changeth without ceasing, as the nature of man doth, which neuer continueth in the same estate, no not the least moment that is. I would gladly aske of thee who readest this, or doest meane to reade it, what day, or what hower thou hast passed, or now passest ouer, since thou hadst any iudgement or knowledge, wherein thy body hath not felt some griefe, or thy hart some passion? As there is no sea without tempest, warre without danger, or iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without trauell: so there is no life without griefe, nor calling without enuie or care: neither did I euer see or know that man, who hath had no cause to be grieued, or to complaine. Doth not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence daily teach vs, that no man liuing can make choise of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state void of all trouble, or flie one inconuenience, but that he is in
<pb facs="12"/>
danger to fall into another? Is it not also most certaine, that a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ioy or prosperitie, is but a fore-warning or signe of some griefe &amp; heauie calamitie at hand? But what? Shall we for all this think man so miserable, that sailing all his life time in stormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, he cannot possibly attaine to any safe hauen against the rage of them? Shall we in such sort depriue him, (during the time of his being in this world) of all <hi>Good,</hi> contentation and happines, as if there were no meanes to auoid, or at leastwise to mollifie the mishaps and miseries of mankind, that he faint not vnder the heauy burden of them? Wherefore then do wise men by so many learned writings inuite vs diligently to seeke after, and with a burning zeale to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace holy vertue, saying, that by hir alone a man may liue happily and contentedly in euery calling, and may enioy therein the soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne <hi>Good,</hi> through the tranquillitie and rest of his soule, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of perturbations by Philosophy? Was it in vaine and fruitles, that an infinite number of famous personages, whom Histories, the mother of antiquitie set before our eies, imploied so great trauell, passed infinite watchings, for sooke and contemned riches, pleasures, honors, and worldly commodities, to get and treasure vp vertue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? And why do we, after their example, despise all these things, and spend that which we account most pretious, I meane time, that we may be adorned and cloathed with vertue, if it cannot make vs hit that marke, which euery one so much desireth and seeketh after with such great paine and labour, namely, that they may enioy some chiefe <hi>Good</hi> in this world, and lead thereby a contented and happy life? Be not ouertaken (friendly Reader) with this smal difficultie, which perhaps might cause a grosse and feeble head not well instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in wisedome, to stagger and depart out of the right way. Now, although the heauenly word onely hath the perfect and sound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of wisedome, bicause he is that eternall wisedome it selfe, yet man being his workmanship, &amp; aided with his grace must not leaue of to seeke for, &amp; to require earnestly of him that gift of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; participation of the secrets of that incomprehensible truth, (so farre foorth as he may and shall be necessary for him) that his soule thereby may obtaine hir permanent and lasting happines. Moreouer, albeit our soueraigne &amp; chiefe <hi>Good,</hi> our perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation and absolute felicitie be onely in heauen in the enioying of that diuine light, yet we must not in the meane while, (albeit we
<pb facs="12"/>
cannot fully possesse that) leaue of to seeke without ceasing, or giue ouer in any sort to keepe and follow that good and infallible way of vertue, which causing vs to passe ouer quietly, and to sustaine with ioy of spirite the miseries of mankind, and appeasing the perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our soules, from whence proceed all the euils that torment vs, and making them void of all damnable effects, will teach vs to lead a pleasant, peaceable &amp; quiet life, &amp; to effect all things woorthy &amp; beseeming this certaine hope, that we shal one day (by the grace of God) be framed a new in that eternal, most happy, &amp; contented life. Let vs therefore account this world, and all the riches thereof, as a thing belonging to an other, as a straunger and nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to those men, who beyng regenerated by the spirite of grace haue profited well in the schoole of wisedome. Let vs not seeke for friendshippe vpon earth: let vs not couete after riches, glory, honour and pleasure, which none but fooles doe extoll, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and wonder at. Wee are not of this worlde, but straungers onely therein, and therefore let vs set all worldly things behinde vs, and account them vnwoorthie the care of our immortall soules, if we meane not to perish with the worlde by ioyning our selues there-unto. Let vs forsake it, I say forsake it boldly how precious soeuer it bee, that we may aboundantly treasure vp that great, <note place="margin">This commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of vertue is chiefly to be vnderstood of faith the roote of all good ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note>sweete and durable wealth, I meane vertue, which is honoured, loued, and desired for it selfe onely, which is the true and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some medicine for diseased soules, the rest of the mynde oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with care, the cause (by the will of GOD) of that chiefe <hi>Good</hi> wherein the principall ende of the soule consisteth, and the onely assured guide which leadeth to the Hauen so much desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of euery one, namelie, the contentation of minde. Which thing this present Academie doth not onely set before our eyes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so doth saue and keepe vs beyng already entered into this Hauen of safetie, agaynst all tempestes, if wee will our selues, and not spare our labour to reape profite of those learned and wise instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that are here giuen vnto vs by the preceptes of doctrine, and examples of the lyues of auncient, vertuous, and famous men. For first of all wee shall learne hereby to know our selues, and the ende of our beyng. Secondly, wee shall bee instructed in good maners, and taught how we may liue well and happily in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery estate and condition of lyfe whatsoeuer. Yea we shall finde
<pb facs="13"/>
in the basest and lowest estate, which of the ignorant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of people is oftentimes called miserable, as much ioy and happinesse, as a Monarch can be partaker of in the fruition of his greatnesse, yea much more than he, if he bee wicked: bicause vice in all Estates maketh the possessour thereof wretched, and contrarywise, Vertue maketh euery condition of life happy. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer wee shall see in this Academie, that euery one louyng and fearing GOD may obtaine this inestimable <hi>Good</hi> of vertue, and thereby remayne a Conquerour ouer the perturbations of his soule, which breede all his miserie, remembring this poynt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, so farre foorth as the fraile nature of man, ayded by the Author of all goodnesse can attayne to this perfection. Wee shall learne here how we ought to gouerne our selues wisely and dueti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in all humane actions and affaires, and in all charges and places whatsoeuer, either publique or priuate whereunto we shall be called. We may note here cause of the subuersion and ruine of many Empires, Estates and Common-wealths, and of the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering shew and glory of infinite others: as also the cause of the wretchednesse and destruction of a great number of men, and what hath lift vp others, and crowned them with honour and immortall prayse. We shall bee taught here the gouernement of a house and familie, the maner of the education and instruction of children, the mutuall duetie of married couples, of brethren, of masters and seruauntes, how to commaund, and how to obey. We shall see here the order and establishment of policies and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periorities: what is the duetie of the Heads of them, of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Gouernours of nations, as also what the duetie of their subiectes is. Briefly, both great and small may drawe out from hence the doctrine and knowledge of those things which are most necessarie for the gouernement of a house, and of a Common-wealth, with sufficient instruction how to frame their life and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the moulde and paterne of true and holy vertue, and how by meanes thereof, (the grace of GOD woorking in them) they may runne the race of their dayes in ioy, happinesse, rest and tranquillitie of spirite, and that in the middest of greatest aduersities, which the vncertaintie and continuall chaunge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things may bring vpon them. Nowe bicause the sequele compounded of the sundrie treatises and discourses of this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy,
<pb facs="13"/>
will sufficiently instruct thee in all things aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as it promiseth in the fore-front and title thereof, I will not dilate this matter any farther, but only desire of thee (Reader) patiently to heare these Academicall students, from the first of their discourses vnto the last. Their intent was only (as thou maiest vnderstand more at large in the entrance of their assembly) to teach themselues, and next euery one according to their abilitie, the institution of good maners, and rule of good lining, for all ordinarie and common estates and conditions of life in our French Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, to the ende that euery member of this politike body (brought thus low with euils, and beaten with tempestuous stormes) might somewhat helpe and profite it by their counsels and instructions. And this thou mayest do (friendly Reader) if thou takest payns to read well, to vnderstand better, and (which is best of all) to follow the precepts, instructions and examples, which thou shalt find here: as also, if thou bringest hither a good will and cheerefull disposition, voyd of all malicious enuy, which at this day is commonly practised by most men of this our age (who like to malicious Censorers) bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie themselues rather in seeking out what to bite at, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in other mens workes, than to draw out, and to commend that which is good, or to assay to make them better. Besides, thou shalt haue somewhat to commend in the order of these discourses, and in the maner of teaching which is in them. For after the handling of that knowledge which is especially necessary for man, all those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues follow which he ought to imbrace, and those vices which he is to shun. Next, he is instructed in that which concerneth house-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: then in that which hath respect to estates and policies, &amp; last of all how he may die well, after he hath liued well. As for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of teaching, which is diligently obserued by these Academikes, thou shalt see that first they prayse that vertue, or disprayse that vice which they propound to themselues to discourse vpon, that they may mooue and frame mens minds as well to hate the one as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the other. Then they define that wherof they discourse, that the end of the present subiect may be better knowen. Afterward, they giue precepts to find out the means wherby to attaine to that which is <hi>Good,</hi> and to eschew the euil. Lastly, they adde examples, which are liuely reasons, and of great waight to mooue men with delight to embrace vertue and to flie vice. Now if thou thinkest that too
<pb facs="14"/>
litle is spoken, considering the goodly and large matter here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, it is not bicause they knew not that the excellencie of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing put foorth here is so great, and the reasons so aboundant that a man might well make a booke therofby it selfe, as many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men haue done, but the chiefe scope and drift of these Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakers, was to discourse briefly of such things as are necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the institution of maners, and of a happy life. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it may well be, that that which thou findest not sufficiently fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in one place may be learned in another, if thou lookest vnto the end. Moreouer they who are here named, and who mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine alwayes the name of disciples, neuer purposed or presumed to set downe resolutions, or to appoint lawes which are necessarily to be kept, and may not be changed in any wise by those that are cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted, according to the occurrence &amp; benefit of the estate of this Monarchie, but grounding their counsels and instructions vpon the soundest and most approoued opinion of the writings of learned men, both of auncient and late times, and vpon such as drew neerest to the infallible rule of the holy scriptures according to the small measure of graces giuen them from aboue, they haue left to euery one (following therein the ancient schoole of the Academikes) li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to compare the motiues of the one side, with the reasons on the other, that the truth of all things might be diligently searched out and inquired after, that none through any head-strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit should be wedded to priuate opinions: and that afterward choise might be made of the best, and of such as are most certain, therby to order and rule all intents and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to referre them to the perpetuall glory of that great Lord of Hierarchies, who is the onely cause and chiefe fountain of all <hi>Good,</hi> contentation, and happinesse.</p>
