   <lg>
      <l>WHo lists to lern the blustring broyles, &amp; frāticke fumes of France,</l>
      <l>The troublous times in three kings raignes, that dolefully did chaūce:</l>
      <l>May here suruey a perfect platt, of pageants plaide in vewe,</l>
      <l>That will enforce eche Christian harte, most ruthfully to rue:</l>
      <l>To see and heare the true discourse, of superstitious tymes,</l>
      <l>That shattered pure Religion, with spytefull cankred crimes.</l>
      <l>VVhere errour blind and ignorance, true Christians did suppresse,</l>
      <l>And armed all her lungish loutes, the godly to distresse:</l>
      <l>To rage and fume against the Church, that lurking lay in feare,</l>
      <l>VVith spitefull hate and infamies, of those that did it teare.</l>
      <l>Christes faithfull spouse not suffered, through furious foes to shine,</l>
      <l>Through rancour lodgd in Princes heads, that did from truth decline.</l>
      <l>Gods chosen sheep and vassals true, raisd vp to doe his will,</l>
      <l>In puritie him for to serue, proud papistes sought to spill.</l>
      <l>Their throates to cut, their heades to poll, their corpes in fier to caste,</l>
      <l>That to Gods pure Religion, came flocking wondrous faste.</l>
      <l>Some choackt with gibbets, gabbet at, some murdred spitefully,</l>
      <l>Some stabbed in with goting blades, and daggers wilfully,</l>
      <l>And all for hating Romish rytes, and Belials bragging broode,</l>
      <l>For cleauing to the Chrrstian church, that sore astonyed stoode.</l>
      <l>Among the superstitious troupes, of Antichristian foes,</l>
      <l>Starke blinded with the Popes delights, (behedgd with wailsul woes)</l>
      <l>Starte vp some chosen chieftaines stoute, of Christes disperpled band,</l>
      <l>That did defie such beggeries, in Fraunce that famous lande▪</l>
      <l>VVhich few at first did more allure, vnto their sacred sawes,</l>
      <l>To serue the Lord in Hymnes and songes, according to his lawes.</l>
      <l>And secretly to pray and preache, to set foorth his dew prayse.</l>
      <l>In corners and in hidden holes (for feare) his trueth to rayse.</l>
      <l>Vntill the rage of hellish hagges, the common blinded crew,</l>
      <l>Dyd spye and spite their godly wayes, and many of them slew.</l>
      <l>Accused them as Lutherans, before the Pee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap>es and Kings,</l>
      <l>(Of Luther that reuin'd the same) with fond inuented things.</l>
      <l>Hereof came sectes and taking partes, the people censt with rage,</l>
      <l>By might mayntaynd, did spoyle the iust, the godly▪ and the sage.</l>
      <l>Edictes were made to staye such broyles, and Parliaments were held,</l>
      <l>To let the faithfull be at rest, but yet the enemie sweld:</l>
      <l>And daily raged more and more, till faithfull did encrease,</l>
      <l>And this reform'd Religion some noble minds did please.</l>
      <l>VVhom God raisde vp to ayde his flocke, his chosen sheep to garde,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="7"/>Against th▪ assault of waspishe wolues: when their loud cryes he hard.</l>
      <l>For whose defence rose ciuill warres, and many a bloudy day,</l>
      <l>The Popish crewe by force did seeke, Christes pacient sheepe too slay.</l>
      <l>To roote out this Religion (that planted) lurking lay.</l>
      <l>And feared not the skalding threates, of th' antichristian route,</l>
      <l>But paciently abyde the crosse of Christ, with courage stout.</l>
      <l>Though Antichrist the Popes proud grace, did rage and fume his fill,</l>
      <l>And all his cankred Cardinals did ioy their bloud to spill.</l>
      <l>They dread not all the Guisian gardes, that fierce and mighty be,</l>
      <l>And perfecutors of the trueth, that pyne and poute, to fee</l>
      <l>Such valiaunt Captaynes of Christes bande, that doe the truth defend.</l>
      <l>And with the gaging of their bloud, their frendly ayd doe lend.</l>
      <l>A princely part here Conde playd a prince replet with grace,</l>
      <l>And all his house trew Souldiours stoode, the trueth still to embrace.</l>
      <l>Burgeus suffred losse of lyfe, and feared not the fier,</l>
      <l>For Gospels sake and truthes defence, a lew of his desire.</l>
      <l>Suruey his lyfe and trayning vp, his constant faythfull harte,</l>
      <l>His zeale, and stout confession, he playd a martyrs parte.</l>
      <l>Chatillon shrinke not here a whit, a chieftane of the troupe</l>
      <l>Of Gods dispersed faithfull flocke, that made their foes to stoupe.</l>
      <l>Three tymes for this rife ciuill warr, the papistes shewd their spight,</l>
      <l>The true and trustie protestants stood stoutly in the right.</l>
      <l>Their cause they manfully mayntaynd, Christ Iesus was their shield,</l>
      <l>Sometimes thei foyld their fretting foes, that gainst them rose in field.</l>
      <l>Some Nobles slayn, and valiant Knights cast downe before their time,</l>
      <l>And all in fence of Christ his cause, accused thus of crime.</l>
      <l>Some goard with sword, some choackt with rope, some battred down</l>
      <l>There many parēts wer dispoild of their beloued sonnes.</l>

      <l>Oh Fraunce thou famous realm before, and eke most populous place,</l>
      <l>Thou art dispeopled, wasted, tourne, thy owne doe thee deface.</l>
      <l>Thy Cities cract, thy Townes bereft, thy men and nobles rackt,</l>
      <l>Thy faythful subiects burnt and slaine, thy welth and strength is sackt.</l>
      <l>Ah pity, pity for to heare, how altered is thy state,</l>
      <l>Through tyrannous popish, cruel carles, that Christ his truth did hate</l>
      <l>The Lord hath iustly plagued thee, for so defacing his,</l>
      <l>VVho in the end will ayd his flocke, thou maist be sure of this.</l>
      <l>If euer land might loth her lucke, and lamed lowring state.</l>
