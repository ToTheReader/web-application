      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was well donne by Nature (gentle Reader) to giue time, but ill donne by men not to apprehend the same: How much thou hast lost in life in begetting vanities and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing them, in applauding follies, and intending them, read heare; and begin now to apprehend this, that it is but lost life, that men liue in en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tertaining vaine things, &amp; that no time is better spent, thē in studying how to liue, and how to die wel. This shalt thou learne in our <hi>Seneca,</hi> whose diuine senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wholsome counsailes, serious exclamations against vices, in being but a Heathen, may make vs ashamed being Christians; when wee consider how backward a course wee haue runne from the right scope, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buried in vaine readings, besotted with selfe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, by apprehending vertue no more, but in a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which serues for a vaile to couer many vices. It
<pb facs="9"/>
is lost labour in most men now-a-dayes whatsoeuer they haue studied, except their actions testifie that readings haue amended the ruines of their sicke and intemperate thoughts: and too pregnant a proofe is it, of an age and time ill spent, when as after a man hath summed vp the account of his dayes that are past, hee findeth the remainder of his profites, hee should haue gotten in life, to be eyther ambition vnsatisfied, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution attended by pouerty, or vaine vnderstanding boulstered by pride, or irksome age called on by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet; I must confesse that (had I effected it) I could haue pickt out eyther an author more curious, or a subiect more pleasing for common eares, to allure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them. But seeing the worlds Lithargie so farre growne, that it is benummed wholly with false appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I made choice of this author, whose life was a pattern of continence, whose doctrine a detection and correction of vanities, and whose death a certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of constancy. Would God Christians would endeuour to practise his good precepts, to reform their owne in seeing his errours; and perceiuing so great light of learning from a Pagans pen, ayme at the true light of deuotion and pietie, which becommeth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. Learne in him these good lessons, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to memory, That to be truely vertuous is to be happy, to subdue passion is to be truely a man, to contemne fortune is to conquer her, to foresee and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maske miseries in their greatest terrors is to lessen them, to liue well is to be vertuous, and to die well is the way to eternitie. This as often as I thinke vpon, I finde an alteration in my resolution, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath too long time surfeited vpon time-pleasing;
<pb facs="9"/>
I am armed against all worldly contempts, wherwith Enuie may pretend to loade mee. My soule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science bearing me witnesse that my intent and scope was only to draw men to amendment of life, &amp; to root out vain customes, that are too much ingrafted in this age; What care I for detraction? which rather barketh for custome sake, then baiteth at mee for fiercenesse. No Souldier is counted valiant, that affronteth not his enemie; no Philosopher constant, that contemneth not Fortune; nor writer vnderstanding, that scornes not detraction; I had rather bee condemned for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming men in goodnesse, then flattering the world in follie. Gentle Reader for thee I laboured, for thy good haue I made this admirable Roman speake English, if it profit thee I haue my wish, if it displease thee, it is thy want of iudgment. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
