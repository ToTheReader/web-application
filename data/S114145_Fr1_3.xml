   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN AND WELL AFFECTED READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, I freely confesse, that mans heart naturally is like to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; a little one will swell, grow big, and in a short time puffe vp the whole lumpe of a mans person: and rare it is, not to be well conceited of our selues; not to iudge aboue the worth of our owne workes; and with <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> not to thinke, that wee bee not some great bodies: But euery man knoweth best the beginning, and scope of all his proceedings. Wherefore though the setting out of Bookes may smell of vaine-glory, if not of folly, in these learned times; yet I am best acquainted with my owne heart, and full well vnderstand mine owne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours: and were not I perswaded, that (through the blessing of God) it would returne to thy further edification, these lin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s had neuer com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> to light.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, I must giue thee to vnderstand, that when I first treated of this subi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ct, it was (though a fault peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) within the City of London, and before one of the most indicious auditori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s there. But since that time, I haue had occasion else where to prosecvte the text more at large; and diuers haue been d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sir us to haue what I then deliuered, to be published iudging it to be not vnworthy the Press<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>. Now if I haue don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> amiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> not mine owne, but many other mens errours are with me; the which If I bee blam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>-worthi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> (as it is like
<pb facs="5"/> enough) may serue in part, though not altogether, to excuse me in this action. But and if I haue done well, Id sire not, neither deserue any praise, because it was as much of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as willingly. I will not altog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ther ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>use, or accuse my selfe vnto thee: onely this (without preiudice to any) may bee spoken, that euery man hath his proper gift of God; whence it followeth, that the meanest scholer, sometimes, in some thing, from this ground, may excell him, that in many things excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth others: the which either being not vnderstood, or (as it ought) practised; makes men of good desert contemned, and the graces of Gods spirit, reiected despised. Were he not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the title of a foole, that would neuer walke out of doores, because all the Planets are not equall to the Sunne in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, brightnesse? or deserues not he to die for want of food, that will not eate, neither drinke, vntill he finde all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be like in kind, colour, and taste? Who would not deeme him an vnskilfull Musition, that will not strike a stroke, except all the strings be one and the same in quantitie and sound? And he is no wiser, that will reade no Authours, heare no Preachers, approue no mans labours, vntill there bee an equality in words, method and phrase.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, in reading, and hearing, try the spirit, see wherein the Gift of the person most consisteth, and then draw the water of life from that Pipe and Conduit: so shalt thou neither abuse thy owne wit, nor another mans worthinesse. The which that thou maist doe, the Lord rectifie thy iudgement, and then encline the wheele of thy will (which is froward) to runne according to its direction. <hi>Amen.</hi>
