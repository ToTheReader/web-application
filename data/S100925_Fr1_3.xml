      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a sort of men, by foundation <hi>Fryars,</hi> by appellation <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who are the last, but proudest Order of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cleargy. One of these, swelling like a to ad with a great conceit of a little learning, in an evill houre for himsefe challenged (as thou knowest) an <hi>Elisha,</hi> a valiant horseman of
<hi>Israell</hi> to combate with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout sundry points of faith. In this duell this Challenger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded went over Seas for healing unto his Master-Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites. And having his wounds bound up, he returneth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare or wit to assault the most learned <hi>Primate</hi> with a new Reply. In which he promiseth much, but performeth little; and defendeth the
<hi>Roman Capitoll,</hi> as it was of old defended, by <hi>gagling</hi> like a
<hi>goose</hi> in babling eloquence, and by <hi>barking</hi> like a
<hi>dogge</hi> in slaunders and reproaches.</p>
   <p>To write of these points after the most learned
<hi>Primate</hi> is all one as to write the <hi>Iliads</hi> after
<hi>Homer.</hi> And none are so well able to defend his <hi>Answere</hi> as himselfe; but as S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> thought it not fit to answere
<hi>Helvidius,</hi> so the most judicious, concurring with him in judgement, thought it not fit for him to answere this Reply.

   <p>There are others who are picked out to doe this service, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom I confesse my selfe the meanest and unfittest to fight against this <hi>Roman</hi> Bullwarke: yet seeing it is fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, not by my choyse, but by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>, trusting to God (for whose word, and by whose word I fight) and to the fastnesse of the cause I have set upon it.</p>
   <p>Happily some curious Spectators, seeing the manner of my fight, may say; I have a good cause, but doe not defend it well: be hath a bad cause, but defendeth it craftily. I confesse that in this fight I have used no Fencer-like flourishes: and at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times such words have dropped from my pen, as if it had beene dipt in vineger. If any man blame me for those two things, my defence is this. For the 1. I had rather fight with the words of wisedome, then with the wisdome of words. For the 2. His own thundring of scornefull and disgracefull speeches against so grave &amp; so gracious a Prelat, hath turned my wine into vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Had he replyed in a calme manner, he should have beene answered in the same; but seeing his <hi>Reply</hi> is a rayling and slanderous accusation of his
<hi>Answerer,</hi> rather then a sound and solide confutation of the Answer, I thought it not amisse to currie him in his kinde; and I hope no man will blame mee for calling <hi>a spade a spade.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>As for craftie defending of the cause, I deny the fact; let him bee Master of the craft. <hi>Pura religio nescit impostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> Truth needeth not lying pretences, nor cunning devices; I leave them to this juggling
<hi>Iesuite,</hi> whose craftie dealing is discovered in many particulars. In his carping at the true sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Question, and in not stating of it at all, of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that he might wander from the question. In not answering
<pb facs="8"/> many of the testimonies which were produced against him. I passe by his absurd distinction of <hi>mediate</hi> and <hi>immediate suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie</hi> or <hi>perfection,</hi> where with he answereth most of the testimonies of the Fathers. I need not here to discover his false quotations, his corrupt translations, his impertinent allegations, his vaine tautologies and reiterations of the same testimonies, some times ten times over, his scraps gathered from
<hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> table, and his treasure stollen out of
<hi>Coccius</hi> his <hi>the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saurus,</hi> his manifest contradictions, and his manifold digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into other points, his division of this Part into nine Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   <p>I have used none of these: if my Adversary can discover any such dealing, let him not spare me. I have followed his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring method, to the intent thou maist see all his testimonies to be answered: and what is not answered being formerly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the margent (to avoid needlesse repetition) directeth thee to that former place: &amp; for the easier finding of it, I have made divisions of every Section. My Adversaryes words thou maist know by these two <hi>[ ]</hi> inclosures. With thy will to reade the Lord give thee an understanding he art to believe those things which <hi>were written,</hi> that thou
