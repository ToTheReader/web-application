   <head>The Occasion, <hi>Intention,</hi> and use of the Foure <hi>Lotteries</hi> adjoyned to these foure Books <hi>of</hi> Emblems.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>STultorum plena sunt omnia.</hi> The world is growne so in Love with <hi>Follie,</hi> that the Imprinting of over-solid and ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ous <hi>

            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises</hi> would undoe the Book-sellers; especially, being so chargeable as the many costly <hi>Sculptures</hi> have made this Booke: therefore, (to advance their <hi>Profits,</hi> rather than to satisfie my owne <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>) I was moved to invent somewhat, which might be likely to please the vulgar Capacitie, without hindrance to my chiefe <hi>End.</hi> And, though that which I resolved on, be not so <hi>Plausible</hi> to Criticall understandings, yet I am contented to hazzard among them, so much of my Reputation, as that comes to.</p>
   <p>I have often observed, that where the <hi>Summer-bowers</hi> of Recreation are placed neare the <hi>Church,</hi> it drawes thither more people from the remote <hi>Hamlets,</hi> than would else be there. Now, though I praise not their <hi>Devotion,</hi> yet I am glad if any thing (which is not evill in it selfe) may be made an occasion of <hi>Good▪</hi> (because, those things may, perhaps, be continued, at last, for Conscience sake, which were at first begunne upon vaine <hi>occasions</hi>) and, have therefore added <hi>Lotteries</hi> to these <hi>Emblems,</hi> to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the more frequent notice of the <hi>Morals,</hi> and good <hi>Counsels</hi> tendred in their <hi>Illustrations;</hi> hoping that, at one time or other, some shall draw those <hi>Lots,</hi> which will make them the better, and the happier, whilest they live. I confesse that this Devise may probably be censured, as unsutable to the gravitie expected in my ripe yeares: and be reputed as great an Indecorum, as erecting an <hi>Ale-house</hi> at the <hi>Church-stile;</hi> yet, the same having had begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in my younger dayes, I do now resolve not to be ashamed of it, for the Reasons aforementioned. To such as I was, it will be someway avayleable: and perhaps, if the <hi>Wisest</hi> did otherwhile, when they walke abroad, to <hi>Vncertaine purposes,</hi> take up this <hi>Booke,</hi> and (without <hi>Superstitious Conceites</hi>) make tryall what their <hi>Lots</hi> would remember, or give them cause to thinke on; It might, now and then, either occasion better <hi>Proceedings,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>Mischieves.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Some <hi>Games</hi> were ever in use; ever, I thinke, will be, and for ought I know, ever may be without exception. And, I believe, this <hi>Recreation,</hi> will be as harmlesse as any, if it be used accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my Intentions. For, my meaning is not, that any should use it as an <hi>Oracle,</hi> which could signifie, infallibly, what is divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alloted; but, to serve onely for a <hi>Morall Pastime.</hi> And, that I may no way encourage the secret entertaining of such a <hi>Fantasie,</hi> I doe before hand affirme unto them, that none but <hi>Children,</hi> or <hi>Ideots</hi> may be tollerated to be so foolish, without laughing at.</p>
   <p>Yet, if any one shall draw that <hi>Lot</hi> wherein his <hi>Secret vices</hi> are reproved; or some good Counsels proposed, which in his owne understanding are pertinent to his welfare, let not such as <hi>those,</hi> passe them over as meere <hi>Casualties</hi> to them; for, whatsoever these <hi>Lots</hi> are to <hi>others,</hi> or in <hi>themselves,</hi> they are to all <hi>these,</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
made pertinent in such cases, both by their particular <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> and <hi>Occasions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Some will thinke perhaps, that I have purposely invented this <hi>Game,</hi> that I might finde meanes to reprove mens <hi>vices,</hi> without being suspected, (as I have hitherto unjustly beene) to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
