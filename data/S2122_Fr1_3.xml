   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing moued by some friendes, to conferre with one of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent good iudgement, and of no ill disposition of nature, though very earnest in that religiō which he did professe: I was desirous to doe my best endeuours, to let him plainly see, that the Catholique Romaine faith was the onely right. For which purpose, I did chose, to let passe disputes about par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular pointes, and in generall to shewe; First, that it is necessary to admitte an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority in the true Catholique church: by reason whereof, euery one is to learne of it onely, which is the true faith of Christ. Secondly, that those one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which professe the Romaine faith, are the true Catholique church. The which hauinge proued: I did consequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; that the faith &amp; beleife, which the authoritie of the Romaine church, doth commend vnto vs, ought, without doubt, to be holden for the true faith.</p>
   <p>Vpon which pointes, when he had heard my discourse: he desired me, for his better remembrance, to sette downe in writtinge, what I had said. The which I had first thought to haue done briefely,


<pb facs="5"/>
and to haue imparted it onely to him: but by some other friēdes, it was wished, that I should hādle the matter, more at large; they intēdinge (as it seemed) that it might not onely doe good to him, but to others also, that should haue need of it, aswell as he. Of which sorte of men standinge in this need, as I could not (consideringe their miserable case) but take great pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: so I was easily moued, especially at my friendes request, to be willinge to doe my endeuour, which might be for their reliefe &amp; succour: and to take any course, which might turne to their helpe and profit.</p>
   <p>Now of all other courses, which haue beene, and might be vndertaken; that, which, in my speach, I did choose, as most expedient for him, with whome I did conferre, seemed best also for me, to prosequute in this my writinge, for the benefit of him, and others, and this for foure reasons.</p>
   <p>First, because it is very briefe, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and consequētly such, as euery one might haue leisure, and should not be much weary to reade it.</p>
   <p>Secondly, because, it, standinge onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
      <pb facs="6"/>
vpon few, but most certaine conclusions, and groundes▪ is free from many cauils of the captions, which more ample discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are subiect vnto.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, because, the matter handled in it, is not very high nor hard, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, easy, &amp; plaine: and such, as may be vnderstoode of any, who, hauing but a reasonable witte, or vnderstanding, will carefully reade it (as the importance of the matter requireth) with iudgment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, &amp; (which is chiefe) with praier to God, and a resolute good will to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that, which he shall finde to be right.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly: because, these few plaine pointes, which are here sett downe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all other: and whosoeuer shall, by the help of Gods grace, and the force of these, or other reasons, yeeld assent to the pointes proued in this discourse: must by cōsequence, without farther disputing or difficultie, yeeld to all particular pointes, which the aforesaid church commēdeth for pointes of faith, and wilbe moued to settle himselfe in the stedfast belefe of all For if he once admitte, that there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap> Church, or company of mē, on earth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly taught by the holy gost, what is


<pb facs="6"/>
the true faith in all pointes: and that this church is, by Gods appointemēt, to teach all men in al matters of faith, which is the infallible trueth: and further, that this Church, which is thus taught, and must teach vs, is no other but that visible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which professeth the <hi>Romaine faith</hi>: then he shall not neede to straine his wittes in studying, or to wast wordes in wrangling, about particuler pointes of controuersies, or to vse any such trouble some and vncertaine meanes to finde out the trueth: but may easely, and most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely be instructed in all, by onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring and finding out (which all sortes of men may easely doe) what is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holden, by the Church, for truth, in all particuler pointes, whereof they doubt. Of which pointes also, (If they be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) they may haue sufficient authoritie and reason yeelded, by the learned of the same Church, though they should not so desire reason to be yeelded, that without reason be giuen, they would not beleeue at all, or as grounding their faith vppon the reason giuen: sith Christian beleife ought onely to be grounded, vpō the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God, speakinge by the mouth


<pb facs="7"/>
of the church who ought to be beleeued in all matters, without giuing any reason.</p>
   <p>The which briefe &amp; compendious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutiō of faith, whosoeuer will (as euery one may securely, and (as in the discourse following shall bee declared) must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily embrace: beside the ease, he shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so reape this commoditie, that, cutting of all occasions of needlesse and fruitelesse doubtes, questions and disputes, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matters of faith: wherein vnsettled mindes spend their time and spirit; hee shall haue good leisure, and better li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge, then ordinarily such vnquiet mindes can haue, to emploie his ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoures more fruitfully otherwaies; to witte, in building vpon the firme foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of stedfast faith, the gould &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious stones, of Gods loue, and other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, in practise whereof consisteth that good life, which maketh a man become the liuing temple of almightie God: the which temple, Gods spirit will not only visitte with holy inspirations &amp; blessings oftentimes, in this life, but he will also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite and dwell continually in it, both by grace, here, and by glory, in the other most happy, and euerlasting life.</p>
