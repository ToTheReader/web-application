         <hi>My Honourable</hi> LORD,</salute>
   </opener>
   <l>THough, <hi>Worthlesse</hi> in my owne repute I am;</l>
   <l>And, (though my <hi>Fortune,</hi> so obscures my Name</l>
   <l>Beneath my <hi>Hopes</hi>; that, now, it makes me seeme</l>
   <l>As little worth, in other mens esteeme,</l>
   <l>As in mine owne;) yet, when my <hi>Merits</hi> were</l>
   <l>No better, than, to most, they now appeare,</l>
   <l>It pleased some, ev'n some of those that had</l>
   <l>The <hi>Noblest Names,</hi> (and, those of whom was made</l>
   <l>The best Account) so lowly to descend,</l>
   <l>As, my well-meaning <hi>Studies,</hi> to befriend.</l>
   <l>Among those WORTHIES, I may both bemone</l>
   <l>(My selfe in HIM) and memorize, for <hi>One,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Your much renowned BROTHER, as a <hi>Chiefe</hi>
   </l>
   <l>In bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ging to my waned <hi>Hopes,</hi> reliefe;</l>
   <l>And, in my <hi>Faculties,</hi> were I as able</l>
   <l>To honour <hi>Him,</hi> as he was honourable,</l>
   <l>I would have showne, how, all this <hi>Emperie</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Hath lost a <hi>Friend,</hi> in HIM, asmuch as I.</l>
   <l>To MEE, so freely, of his owne accord</l>
   <l>It pleased HIM, his <hi>Favours,</hi> to afford;</l>
   <l>That, when our learned, and late <hi>Sov'raigne-Prince,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>(By others mis-informed) tooke offence</l>
   <l>At my Free <hi>Lines</hi>; HEE, foun'd such <hi>Meanes</hi> and <hi>Place</hi>
   </l>
   <l>To bring, and reconcile mee to his <hi>Grace</hi>;</l>
   <l>That, therewithall, his <hi>Majestie</hi> bestow'd</l>
   <l>A Gift upon mee, which his <hi>Bountie</hi> show'd:</l>
   <l>And, had inrich'd mee; if, what was intended,</l>
   <l>Had not, by othersome, beene ill befriended.</l>
   <l>But, as I long time, suffred have by those</l>
   <l>Who labour'd much, my thrivings, to oppose:</l>
   <l>So, <hi>I my selfe,</hi> (although not out of pride,</l>
   <l>As many thinke it) have so much relide</l>
   <l>Vpon the <hi>Royall-Gift,</hi> neglecting so</l>
   <l>To fortifie the same, as others do</l>
   <l>By making Friends; that my estate grew lesse</l>
   <l>(By more than twice five hundred Marks decrease)</l>
   <l>Through that, which for, my profit was bestowne.</l>
   <l>And, I, ere this, had wholly been undone;</l>
   <l>But, that the <hi>Wealth,</hi> which I relie on, most,</l>
   <l>Consists in things, which never can be lost.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="112"/>Yet, by this <hi>Losse,</hi> I have <hi>Occasions</hi> had</l>
   <l>To feele, why other men are often sad.</l>
   <l>And, I, (who blushed, to be troublesome</l>
   <l>To any Friend) therby, almost am come</l>
   <l>To such a passe; that, what I wish to have,</l>
   <l>I should grow impudent enough to <hi>Crave,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Had not impartiall <hi>Death,</hi> and wasting <hi>Time,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Of all my Friends quite worne away the <hi>Prime</hi>;</l>
   <l>And, left mee none, to whom I dare present</l>
   <l>The meanest suite withom encouragement:</l>
   <l>Although, the greatest <hi>Boone,</hi> I would implore,</l>
   <l>Should cost them, but a <hi>Word,</hi> or little more.</l>
   <l>Yet, some there are, no doubt, for whose respect</l>
   <l>I might endeavour, with no vaine effect;</l>
   <l>Had I but cause, to have as high esteeme,</l>
   <l>Of mine owne <hi>Merits,</hi> as I have of them.</l>
   <l>And, if your <hi>Honour</hi> should be so inclin'd,</l>
   <l>As I desire; I, now am sure to finde</l>
   <l>Another <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> by whose ayde sustain'd,</l>
   <l>I may preserve, what by the <hi>Last</hi> I gain'd.</l>
   <l>To make adventure, how it will succeed,</l>
   <l>I now am come. And lo, my LORD, insteed</l>
   <l>Of better <hi>Advocates,</hi> I first begin,</l>
   <l>Mine EMBLEMS, by these <hi>Lines,</hi> to Vsher in;</l>
   <l>That, <hi>they,</hi> by their admittance may effect</l>
   <l>For <hi>Mee,</hi> and for <hi>themselves,</hi> your kinde respect.</l>
   <l>That, which in <hi>them,</hi> best Worthy you shall find,</l>
   <l>Is this; that, they are Symptomes of a <hi>Minde,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Affecting honestie: and of a <hi>Heart,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>So truly honouring a true desert,</l>
   <l>That, I am hopefull made, they will acquire</l>
   <l>As much respect as I can well desire:</l>
   <l>And, SIR, your <hi>Candor,</hi> your knowne <hi>Courtesies,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>With other praisefull <hi>Vertues,</hi> make mee rise</l>
   <l>To this Beliefe; that, YOV by fav'ring mee</l>
   <l>Hereafter, may as highly honour'd be,</l>
   <l>As by some former Bounties; and encrease</l>
   <l>My Future <hi>Merit,</hi> by your <hi>Worthinesse.</hi>
   </l>
   <l>However, what I <hi>am</hi> or shall be knowne</l>
   <l>To <hi>Bee,</hi> by <hi>Your Deservings,</hi> or mine <hi>owne,</hi>
   </l>
