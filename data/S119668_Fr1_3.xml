   <l>
      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Erusing ouer sundry bookes of volumes large and great,</l>
   <l>Which of the worthy feates of Fame, &amp; Martial actes intreat,</l>
   <l>Of mightie Princes of the world, accomplished of yore,</l>
   <l>In diuers kingdomes vpon earth, and countreis heretofore.</l>
   <l>I finde in auncient Histories, by learned men laid downe</l>
   <l>The conquestes of the <hi>Worthies</hi> nyne to be of most renowne:</l>
   <l>Who are by famous Register enrowled in record</l>
   <l>The greatest and mightiest conquerers, and <hi>Worthies</hi> of the world:</l>
   <l>As well for their couragiousnes, as magnanimities,</l>
   <l>Their valiantnes, their wisdomes rare, and Princely pollicies:</l>
   <l>As for the wonders maruelous, and miracles also</l>
   <l>In their exploytes, and their affaires, which God for them did show.</l>
   <l>How God exalted them on hie, to earthly dignitie,</l>
   <l>And gaue them Kings and kingdomes by tryumphant victorie:</l>
   <l>Appointing them to be his scourge, the wicked to confound,</l>
   <l>And their vnrighteous seede vnroote, with sword from of the ground.</l>
   <l>How God remained to the end, with them that godly weare,</l>
   <l>And prospered all their attempts, which him did loue and feare.</l>
   <l>How other were amid their pryde, in highest roome of all,</l>
   <l>For that they had forgotten God, brought to a sodaine fall.</l>
   <l>As for example: <hi>Iosua</hi> the Iudge of <hi>Israell,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>The first of all these conquerers, in vertue did excell.</l>
   <l>And doughtie <hi>Dauid</hi> in like sort, in whom God did delight,</l>
   <l>From shepheard being made a King, was righteous in Gods sight.</l>
   <l>And noble <hi>Iudas Machabeus,</hi> these three <hi>Iewes</hi> by byrth,</l>
   <l>And feared God continually, while they did liue on earth.</l>
   <l>Wherfore the Lord wrought miracles vpon their enemies,</l>
   <l>As shalbe afterwardes discust heere in these Histories.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>
Then <hi>Hector</hi> fearce the <hi>Phrigian</hi> Prince, and <hi>Alexander</hi> great,</l>
   <l>And <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> painyms all, their God they did forgeat:</l>
   <l>For which, amid their most estate, when they were highest of all,</l>
   <l>Ambicion, Pride, and Auarice, gaue each of them a fall.</l>
   <l>Then <hi>Arthur, Charle-mayne</hi> and <hi>Guy,</hi> were christians as I gesse,</l>
   <l>The one was plagde in his most pompe, for his lasciuiousnesse:</l>
   <l>The other two were godly men, wherfore they dyed well,</l>
   <l>As in their seuerall Histories the Sequell plaine doth tell.</l>
   <l>A briefe of all whose liues, I haue in meeter with my pen</l>
   <l>Compiled out of sundry bookes of famous learned men.</l>
   <l>And as I read of them also, according to my skill,</l>
   <l>I haue all their proportions depainted with my quill:</l>
   <l>And drawne the armes and cognisaunce in euery seuerall shield,</l>
   <l>Which when they liued vpon the earth they bare vnto the field:</l>
   <l>The yeare &amp; time where they did raigne, and when &amp; where they died,</l>
   <l>And what they were enclined too, I haue herein discried:</l>
   <l>Beseeching that your honour wil accept in gentle part</l>
   <l>This litle booke which I present, to shew my faithfull hart.</l>
   <l>And when your leasure so shall serue, vouchsafe I humbly craue,</l>
   <l>To read it ouer once or twise, and where I erred haue,</l>
   <l>That crime or fault committed so, let ignorance excuse,</l>
   <l>Blame not the man that meaneth well, but blame his simple Muse.</l>
   <l>Record the matter in your minde, although this style be base,</l>
   <l>Then shall your Lordship plainly see before your present face,</l>
   <l>A myrror of mans mortall life, by them compared right,</l>
   <l>Which well may be a looking glasse, to euery liuing wight:</l>
   <l>And chiefly to the higher sort, whom God shall please t'aduance,</l>
   <l>In any wise here vpon earth to rule or gouernaunce:</l>
   <l>To learne therby to know the Lord, who liues eternally,</l>
   <l>Not to forget their owne estates, through pride nor surquedry:</l>
   <l>To abandon wicked vice away, and vertue to embrace,</l>
   <l>That to their latter end they may run out a happy race.</l>
   <l>Thus humbly I do take my leaue, and hartily do pray,</l>
   <l>That God will graunt you <hi>Nestors</hi> yeares, in vertues honour ay.</l>

Richard Lloyd.</signed>
