   <head>In commendation of Hawking, George Turbervile.</head>
   <l>I Deeme that no man doubts, but games &amp; all our▪ <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>efe delights,</l>
   <l>Were first deuisde to daunt the dumps of pensiue pained sprights.</l>
   <l>To cleare the clowds of drowping cares, &amp; mists of mournfull mind,</l>
   <l>And banish bale that heauie harts in cheerelesse chaines did bind.</l>
   <l>And more than that, to further health, by moouing too and fro,</l>
   <l>That in our lumpish lustlesse limmes, no dire disease might grow:</l>
   <l>Which otherwise (set sport aside, and sweet delightfull glee)</l>
   <l>In idle bodies breeds of force, as we by proofe do see,</l>
   <l>Not much vnlike the standing lakes, in durtie dampish grounds,</l>
   <l>Where water hath no power to passe, most noysome filth abounds.</l>
   <l>If games were thus found out at first, for mind and bodies ease,</l>
   <l>Aswell to quite that one of griefes, as th'other of disease:</l>
   <l>Why then? of force it follow must, that those delights are chiefe,</l>
   <l>And most to be imbrast, that lend to either part reliefe,</l>
   <l>Which if be so, I need not blush, or deeme it my disgrace,</l>
   <l>If Hawks and Spanels I preferre, and set in highest place.</l>
   <l>For truely no deuise delights, the mind of man so much,</l>
   <l>No game so gladsome to the limmes, there is no pleasure such.</l>
   <l>No Phisicke fitter to remooue the dregs of direfull paine,</l>
   <l>And to restore to former life, the feeble force againe.</l>
   <l>Of Spanels first I meane to speake, for they begin the glee,</l>
   <l>Who being once vncoupled, when they feele their collers free,</l>
   <l>In roysting wise about they range, with cheerefull chappes to ground,</l>
   <l>To see where in the champion may some lurking fowle be found.</l>
   <l>A sport to view them stirre their sternes, in hunting too and fro,</l>
   <l>And to behold how nature doth her power in Spanels show:</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="4"/>Who scoure the fields with wondrous skill, and deale in cunning sort,</l>
   <l>As though indeed they had conspirde, to make their master sport.</l>
   <l>What merrier musicke can you craue? what note but halfe so good?</l>
   <l>As when the Spaniels crosse the runne, of Peasants in the wood?</l>
   <l>Or light vpon the little Poutes, where they haue lately beene?</l>
   <l>Assuredlie no better glee, is either heard or seene.</l>
   <l>So as by Hawkes doth pleasure grow, vnto the gazing eie,</l>
   <l>And dogges delight the listning eares, before the hawkes do flie.</l>
   <l>What dolt so dull but takes delight, when once the Spaniell springs</l>
   <l>The fearefull fowle, and when the hawke lyes long vpon her wings?</l>
   <l>What sence so sad, what mind so mazde, but sets his sorrowes by,</l>
   <l>What once the Falcon free begins, to send amid the skie?</l>
   <l>To turne and winde a bird by sleight, and eke at last to slay</l>
   <l>With strong encounter, doues, and duckes, and euery other pray?</l>
   <l>The prettie Partridge, Railes, and Quailes, that haunt the open field?</l>
   <l>And from her mountay to enforce the Hearon haught to yeeld?</l>
   <l>By binding with her close in cloudes, in manner out of sight?</l>
   <l>For noble Peeres and chiefest States, a passing pleasant flight?</l>
   <l>So small a bird, so large a fowle, at such a loftie gate,</l>
   <l>To reach and rappe, and force to fall, it is a game of state.</l>
   <l>No fellow to the flight at Brooke, that game is full of glee,</l>
   <l>It is a sport the stowping of aroysting Hawke to see.</l>
   <l>And if shee misse, to marke her how she then gets vp amaine,</l>
   <l>For best advantage, to eneaw the springing fowle againe.</l>
   <l>Who if be landed as it ought, then is it sure to die.</l>
   <l>Or if she slippe, a ioy to see, the Hawke at randon flie,</l>
   <l>And so for head to slay the fowle, a noble sport to view,</l>
   <l>In my conceit no pleasure like to Hawkes, I tell you true.</l>
   <l>It sets the sences all to worke, there may none idle be,</l>
   <l>The tong it lures, the legs they leape, the eie beholds the glee:</l>
   <l>The eares are busied eke to heare, the calling Spanels quest,</l>
   <l>Do tell me then what sence it is, that respite hath to rest?</l>
   <l>And more than that the bart it leaps, and laughes for ioy to thinke,</l>
   <l>How such a slender hawke should cause, so huge a fowle to shrink.</l>
   <l>This kind of sport doth banish vice, and vile devises quight,</l>
   <l>When other games do foster faults, and breed but base delight.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="4"/>No idle thought can harbor well within the Falconers braine,</l>
   <l>For though his sports right pleasant be, yet are they mixt with pain.</l>
   <l>The toyle he takes to find the fowle, his greedy lust to slay,</l>
   <l>The fowle once found cuts off cōceits, &amp; driues ill thoughts away.</l>
   <l>He lures, he leapes, he calls, he cries, he ioyes, he waxeth sad,</l>
   <l>And frames his moode, according as his hawke doth well or bad.</l>
   <l>Dame Venus harbors not in holtes, no Cupid haunts the hilles,</l>
   <l>Diana dwelles in open place, with bow her game she kils.</l>
   <l>In woodes no wanton Goddesse woones: in Citie soiournes sinne,</l>
   <l>There vice in vawts &amp; dungeon dwells, the lecher lurks within.</l>
   <l>Dianas traine doth loue the launds, they long abrode to rome,</l>
   <l>But bawdie Ʋenus ympes embrace, the loitring life at home.</l>
   <l>To dice, to daunce, to coll, to kisse, to carde the time away,</l>
   <l>To prate, to prancke, to bowle, to bowse, and tipple out the day.</l>
   <l>To checke at Chesse, to heaue at Maw, at Macke to passe the time,</l>
   <l>At Coses, or at Saunt to sit, or set their rest at Prime.</l>
   <l>Both Ticktacke and the Irish game, are sports but made to spend,</l>
   <l>I wote not I, to what auaile those trifling games do tend.</l>
   <l>Ʋnlesse to force a man to chafe, to chide, to sweat, to sweare,</l>
   <l>To brawle, to ban, to curse, and God in thousand parts to teare.</l>
   <l>At cockepit some their pleasures place, to wager wealth away,</l>
   <l>Where Falconers only force the fields, to heare their spanels bay.</l>
   <l>What greater glee can man desire, than by his cunning skill,</l>
   <l>So to reclaime a haggard Hawke, as she the fowle shall kill.</l>
   <l>To make and man her in such sort, as tossing out a traine,</l>
   <l>Or but the lewre, when she is at large, to whoup her in againe?</l>
   <l>Where birds, &amp; beasts, &amp; ech thing else, their freedome so imbrace,</l>
   <l>As let them loose, they will be thralde no more in any case.</l>
   <l>What finer feat than so to ympe a feather, as in view,</l>
   <l>A man would sweare it were the old, and not set on a new?</l>
   <l>When hawkes are hurt and broosde, by rash encounter in the skies,</l>
   <l>What better skill, than for their harmes a powder to devise,</l>
   <l>To drie the bloud within the bulcke, and make his Mummie so,</l>
   <l>As no Physition greater Art, on pacients can bestow?</l>
   <l>To cure the crampe, and eke the cray, the stone that lies within,</l>
   <l>The Philanders, the Frounce, the Gout, the Panthas, &amp; the pin.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>The Rie, the Rhewne, the Canker, &amp; both lice and mytes to marre,</l>
   <l>And all such wormes as with your hawkes do wage continall war:</l>
   <l>To make her mewe when time requires, to bowse and eke to bath,</l>
   <l>By cunning skill to cause her cast, such glit as breeds her skath.</l>
   <l>To cut her hoods, to shape her gesse, her tyrets, and her line,</l>
   <l>With Bells, and Berrets, Ʋernels eke, to make the Falcon fine:</l>
   <l>Belieue me is no common skill, no bate nor base deuise,</l>
   <l>But meet for ciuill courtly men, that are reputed wise.</l>
   <l>Which if be so, then yeeld me thankes, that beat my busie brow,</l>
   <l>And tooke this toyle for thine auaile, to teach thee when &amp; how</l>
   <l>To worke this practise and deuise. Accept the Printers paine,</l>
   <l>Who shewes thee sundry shapes of hawks, though little to his gaine.</l>
   <l>Both he and I can do no more, than offer our good will,</l>
   <l>And all to further thy delight, and adde vnto thy skill.</l>
   <l>VVhich if we do, we haue the hire of both our meanings than,</l>
   <l>You cannot do a better deed than thanke the painefull man.</l>
