   <head>Notes for the vse of the booke.</head>
   <p>First note that this Booke is deuided into .ix. partes, according to the .ix. vowels, which come before the consonant in the last silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: of the which vowels these fyue be simple, a.e.i o. and u. &amp; these four, ay. ea. oy. &amp; ou. be Dipthonges: Note also that the Dipthōgs be alwayes long, and that the other be alwayes short, except that after a single Cosonant, this letter, e. be the last letter of a word, for then the letter (e) is not the vowel of the sillable, but it is only added at the end, to make the sillable afore it to be long: as in these abe. ebe. ibe obe. ube. (e) is only put to make the other vowels long with (b) which else should be short if (e) were away, as these ab. eb. ib. ob. ub. &amp;c. whiche also be short, if it be a double consonant though (e) do follow as. abbe. ebbe. ibbe. obbe. ubbe, and, ab. eb. ib ob. and ub. be all one. Note thirdly, that first we set the short silla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and then the long, yet with this differēce in both places, that first all the monasillables be by thēselues: yea &amp; in either of these first all Substantiues by them selues, afterwarde all Verbes by them selues, and finally all the adiectiues and other od parts of speach, eche kind by them selues. Fourthly note, that whereas some Terminations haue two or mo consonantes in the sillable after the vowell, thou must follow the vowell, and the first conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant after it, as in these, au, auce, auche, aude, auge, augue. &amp;c. followe the alphabet of <hi>A, Ante N.</hi> and thou shalt not misse him in his place. Fiftly note, that when as some words here contained be either barbarous, straunge, or fallen out of vse, we haue not much put them in as imitable, but rather that the rude may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their tong, and that the Readers of suche bookes, may here learne what the wordes meane, and for that end we haue inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted such words, as kirke, church, myrke, darke, ken, know, and such other. Sixtly, if any word be in diuers clause, the same is witingly doone, in respect of diuerse kindes of writing, both which are in vse, and likewise when one word hath diuers significations we haue by adding some word to both in English and Latin, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincted
<pb facs="3"/>and expounded the same: as the Gout in the hands <hi>Chira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra,</hi> the Gout in the féete <hi>Podagra,</hi> a Pike for the eares téeth. &amp;c. <hi>scalprum,</hi> a Pike pricke, <hi>stimulus</hi> a Pike fyshe, <hi>Lupus sluuialis.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Finally wheras the declenson, gender, or coniugation is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hard to know, we haue in the Nownes expressed the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue case, encreasing long with this circumflex <hi>(o)</hi> signifiing to be declined with <hi>hęc,</hi> except an other article be expressed: and the geuetiue ease encreasing short with this accent called graue <hi>(ô)</hi> signifying to be declined with <hi>hic,</hi> except an other article be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed: all other that haue neyther of these do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and be declined with <hi>hęc:</hi> except they end in, <hi>er,</hi> or <hi>us,</hi> (for then they be <hi>hic</hi>) or in <hi>um,</hi> and, <hi>e,</hi> (for then they be <hi>hoc</hi>) or haue some other article expressed. And to know the coniugations: we haue set ouer <hi>(e)</hi> the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiue moode of the seconde coniugations, this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex <hi>(ê)</hi> as <hi>doeêre, merêre,</hi> and ouer <hi>(e)</hi> the infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue moode of the thirde, this accent graue <hi>(e)</hi> as <hi>agére,</hi> fynally if any Verbe end not in <hi>ari, êri,</hi> nor <hi>éri,</hi> but only in <hi>(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>)</hi> as <hi>frui,</hi> it is the infinitiue moode of the third coniugation of some Verbe in <hi>(or).</hi>
