   <p>To the end that thou fall not into this discourse abruptly, I haue thought it not impertinent, by way of Preamble, to insert this short aduertisment, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first institution of the Iesuites, with their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and proceedings in France, and the occasion of this present controuersie; which may serue, not only for an introduction, into the discourse ensuing; but also for an explanation of sundry passages, alleged therein.
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Whatsoeuer is here rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken partly out of</hi> Steeuen Pas quier <hi>sometime Atturney ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the King at</hi> Paris, <hi>in his 4 booke of Epistles &amp; last epistle, which I wold not conceale, the rest I haue collected out of the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of</hi> France.</note> As for the Vniuersity of Paris, I shall neede to say little, for it is sufficiently set foorth in the discourse, but that it was first founded by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, in the yeere of our Lord <hi>791.</hi> and that the Sorbonne so often mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned is nought else, but a famous Colledge of Diuines, founded about the yeere <hi>1253.</hi> by <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>9.</hi> called Saint <hi>Lewis,</hi> as my Author saith; or as others write, by <hi>Robert</hi> brother of the said King. Now as concerning the Iesuits: this Order first arose in Christendome, about the yeere <hi>1540.</hi> the Author and Founder therof, was one <hi>Ignacius Loyola</hi> a gentleman of Nauarre, who all his life time had followed the wars, and being hurt in the Towne of Pampelona, which is the chiefe City of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,
<pb facs="5"/>whilest his wounds were a healing, he fell to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the liues of the Fathers, resoluing vpon the pattern of their liues to frame the tenor of his owne: afterward ioining with some others, who were some <hi>10</hi> in number, they altogether swore a kind of Societie; and <hi>Ignatius</hi> beeing cured they made voiages to Paris, Rome, and to Ierusalem, and at last retired themselues into Venice, where they made their aboad some few yeeres, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had many followers, remooued thence to Rome, where they began to make publike profession of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, promising two things especially; the one, that their principall end and scope, was to preach the Gospell to the Pagans and Infidels, for to conuert them to the Christian Faith: the other, freely and without reward to instruct Christians in good letters: and for to fit and accommodate their name to their deuotion, they termed themselues religious men of the Society of the name of Iesus. They presented themselues vnto Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>3.</hi> of the house of the <hi>Farneses,</hi> about the yeere <hi>1540.</hi> which was the time that Germany began to take armes, by reason of the alteration of religion; and because that one of the principall points which the Germans contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, was concerning the power of the Pope, whom <hi>Martin Luther</hi> sought to quell and pull downe: these making a contrary profession, gaue the Pope to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the first and principall Vowe which they made, was to acknowledge him to bee aboue all earthly powers; yea aboue the generall and vniuersall Councell of the Church. The Pope who at first doubted, whether hee should approoue of them or no, and afterward had permitted them, to vse the title of religious men, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that they should not bee aboue <hi>60.</hi> in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb facs="5"/>at this promise began to hearken vnto them, and to giue their deuotion free passage: and after him <hi>Iulius</hi> the <hi>3.</hi> vntill that Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>4.</hi> called the <hi>Theatin,</hi> who was one of the chiefe promoters of this Order, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized them absolutely; and consequently, almost all the succeeding Popes, in respect of the seruices they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from them, haue endowed them with most large and ample priuiledges. Their Order is composed of two sorts, whereof the one is called of the greater Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, the other of the lesse. The first are bound vnto foure Vowes; Chastitie, Pouerty, and Obedience, which are the three ordinary Vowes of religious men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides they adde a fourth Vow, which is of particular o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience vnto the Pope, as hath beene already said. The second are tied only to two Vowes: the one regardeth the fidelity which they promise to the Pope; the other is of obedience vnto the Generall of their Order. These are termed lay brethren, who doe not vow Pouerty, but may hold Benefices or Offices; they may inherite their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, mothers, and kindred, enioy lands and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and marry at a need, as if they were bound by no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Vow. They haue besides many schollers, whom they cal Nouices who are (as it were) Probationers, from whence they take fresh supplies, and thence it is, that their Colledges are commonly called Seminaries, they hauing two sorts of lodgings ioining together, the one for their Priests, the other for their schollers and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices. And this may shortly suffice for the description of their Order.</p>
   <p>Now as concerning their proceedings in France, it so fell out (they beeing established, as hath beene already set downe) that the Bishop of Clermont tooke a liking of
<pb facs="6"/>them, and was very desirous to settle this Order in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> whereupon he brought in <hi>3.</hi> or <hi>4.</hi> of them, who vsed likewise the recommendation of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>4.</hi> At their first comming they were lodged meanly in a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Colledge of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> &amp; afterward set vp their abode in the Bishop of <hi>Chemōt</hi> his Pallace, by the permission of him who first entertained them. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their affaires succeeding according to their minde, they presented themselues diuers times to the Court of Parlaiment, requesting it to authorize their Order. But the king his Solliciter general, that thē was called Mouncieur <hi>Brulart,</hi> opposed himselfe against all their requests, not for that he fauoured not the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man religion as much as any one could doe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee misdoubted and feared aboue all things no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties as the mothers of many errors, especially in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Wherfore he told them, that if they had their minds wholyaltenated frō the world, they might safely without bringing in any new Order, confine themselues vnder some one of the auncient religions approued by many Councels, or vnder some one of the foure Mendicants. Thus they were reiected by the Court of parliament, who not being satisfied with her owne opinion, nor wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to relie only thereupon, had recourse vnto the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Theologie, by the decree whereof they were scensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, partly in that entitling themselues by the name of religious men, they did neither we are the habit, neither did confine themselues within their Cloisters, as others did; and partly in that some of their opinions derogated from the liberties of the French Church. This is that decree of the yeare. <hi>1554.</hi> often mentioned in the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discourse, not long after the Bishop of <hi>Clermōt</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, who by his testament bequeathed great sums vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="6"/>them, they hauing receiued this legacie, the troubles about religion happened, in the beginning whereof there was an assembly of the French Church at <hi>Poissy</hi> in the yeare. <hi>1563.</hi> they then began to breake off their long si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and presented a request vnto the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be receiued and approued not as religious men, yet at the least as a College of schollers only. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conceiuing that this concerned principally the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors of the Church, referred them ouer vnto the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of <hi>Poissy,</hi> where the Cardinal of <hi>Tournon</hi> was President, as the most auncient Prelate, who in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Tournon</hi> had before founded a company of them. By his intercession, they obtained to be receiued onely as a societie and Colledge, vpon condition, that they should be bound to take another title then that of Iesuites, and to conforme themselues in all, and throughal, to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church without enterprising any thing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ordinaries, &amp; that they should first and formost renounce expresly, and in precise termes, the priuileges, which their buls did import; otherwise if they failed herein, or obtained any other, that their approbation should be vtterly void. This decree was ratified by the Court of Parliament, according to the forme and tenor thereof. Shortly vpon this they purchased them a house in the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> and called it the Colledge of <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> in memorie of their benefactor, &amp; by reason that they had at that time diuers learned personages amongst them, they were fauourably entertained, and drew an infinite number of schollers after them. And seeing they had the wind at will, they presented a request to the Rector &amp; Vniuersitie of <hi>Paris</hi> to be incorporated ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into. Whereupon there was a solemne Congregation
<pb facs="7"/>assembled, in the which it was concluded, that before they proceeded any further, they should declare whether they tooke vpon them the quality of regulars or seculars which did put them into a great perplexitie, for if they should deny they were religious men, they belied their Vow, and to say they were so, had beene to contradict that which was enioyned them at Poissy, and for that they tooke no precise qua itie vpon them, the Vniuersitie gaue them the repulse. Yet would they not giue ouer but had recourse vnto the Court of Parliament, to the end that they might gaine vpon the Vniuersity by constraint that which they could not obtaine of freewill, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a short day was giuen to both parties for to pleade, and the matter was argued on both sides, by <hi>Pasqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> for the Vniuersitie, and <hi>Versoris</hi> for the Iesuits with such veh mencie, as so great a cause required, &amp; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion it was or deined that they should remaine in that estate they were, without decreeing ought in fauor of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partie, for neither were the Iesuits incorporated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Vniuer sitie, as they desired, neither were they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded frō reading lectures as they had done in former times, as the Vniuersitie requested. In this estate they continued vntill the yeare <hi>1594.</hi> when vpon occasion of the execrable attempt of <hi>Peter Barrierre</hi> (who had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to murder the king <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, but was discouered by a Iacobin a Florentine, to whom he had reuealed it by way of confession, and thereupon was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at Melum where the king was watching his opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, and found seased with a double edged knife for the purpose, &amp; afterward was executed for it at Paris) the Vniuersitie renewed her auncient processe against them, demanding to haue them banished and rooted out,
<pb facs="7"/>in as much as <hi>Barrier</hi> had vndertaken it by the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their mischieuous doctrine, and by the speciall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation of <hi>Varad</hi> rector of their colledge: &amp; the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was handled in Parlement by <hi>Arnaud</hi> who argued against them, and <hi>Versoris</hi> for them, both graue and bearned aduocates: but they were so strongly supported, by some great men, as namely the Cardinall of Bourbon and the Duke of Neuers, that at that time nothing was done against them, vntill that the prodigious and bold fact of <hi>Iohn Chastel</hi> a nouice of their societie (who in the kings owne chāber at the Louure, and in presence of his Nobles and gentlemen, stabbed at the king, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his belly as hee had purposed, by reason that the king stooped to receiue two Noble men, who kissed his knee, strooke him in the mouth) and brake out one of his vpper teeth extorted that famous decree of the <hi>29.</hi> of december <hi>1595.</hi> whereby besides the condemnation of <hi>Iohn Chastel,</hi> the Iesuites whose doctrine had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him were banished out of France, as enemies of the king and the estate, corrupters of youth, and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the publike peace and quiet, and the house where the father of that monster dwelt, which was situate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the gate of the Pallace being rased, a Pyramide was erected containing (for a perpetuall monument) the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the said decree. Thus they stood banished vntill that as well by the incessant importunitie of some great ones about the king, as especially by the earnest interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, they were reuoked in the yeare. <hi>1604.</hi> in the moneth of Ianuarie, and the Pyramide taken away, notwithstanding the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and admonitions of the Court of Parlement to the contrary: yet with diuers restraints and conditions,
<pb facs="8"/>amongst the which one was, that they should erect no College, nor make any residence but in the towns named in the letters of their reestablishment, without expresse permission of the King, and particularly within the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort and iurisdiction of the Parliament house of <hi>Paris,</hi> vnlesse it were in the townes of <hi>Lyon,</hi> and <hi>La Fleche.</hi> Notwithstanding the late King by the meanes of father <hi>Cotton,</hi> whom he had made his Confessor, gaue them permission to returne to Paris, and made them restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all their goods, and of their Colledge of Clermont, but did not permit them to keep publike schoole, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with ought which concerned the Vniuersitie: notwithstanding that they laboured by all meanes possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be incorporated thereinto. Instantly vpon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astrous death of the King, they thinking it to be best fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in troubled water, renewed their pursuite, &amp; by the fauour of the Queene Regent, obtained the letters here mentioned, licensing thē to reade lecture, to set opē their schooles in the Vniuersitie, whereupon the Vniuersitie presented a Petition vnto the Queene Regent for to preuent them therof. The Iesuites on the contrary pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their letters, and presented them vnto the Court of Parliament, requiring the allowance of them: the Court would not proceed without signifying it vnto the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie, who formally opposed them, and thereupon it was ordered, that both parties should be heard iudicial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the cause was remitted to the opening of the Court, the morrow vpon Saint Martins day, and from thēce it was put off vntil the seuenteenth of December; all which time it was openly and solemnely argued on the seuenteenth and ninteenth of the said moneth, when <hi>Montholon</hi> the aduocate of the Iesuites, hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb facs="8"/>the allowance of the foresaid letters, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued for them. <hi>De la Marteliere</hi> for the Vniuersitie made this argument ensuing, whereupon followed that sentence <hi>interlocutorie</hi> annexed vnto the end hereof. Since which time I doe not vnderstand of any further proceeding: it is likely that the Iesuites perceiuing the inclination of the Court, and of all in general, contrarie vnto them, and fearing to be drawne further into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, haue retired themselues, expecting some fitter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie for the effecting of their designes, which it is probable, that they now failing in, will hardly be able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to bring to passe. This is shortly the whole processe of this businesse and controuersie.</p>
   <p>Now I am not ignorant that diuers discourses haue beene of late set forth in this kinde, but I dare confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirme, that none is of equall weight with this, in that it is no particular calumnie, but a publique account iustified in open Court, and published by authoritie, the Positions herein alleaged are these of the famous Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp; the schoole of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> (whose mouth this Aduocate was, &amp; spake as hee was instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) and not any priuate censure or opinion. If ought be said herein which is not altogether consonant to the doctrine of our Church (as I am certaine there is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little) let it be remembred whose words they are, and where they were spoken. Thus hoping that this may helpe to dissipate and purge that noisome and pestilent aire of the Iesuits, wherewith they seeke to intoxicate and infect the weake and tender consciences of men, to the dishonour of God and of religion, to the danger and preiudice of soueraigne Princes, their persons and estates, to the ruine &amp; ouerthrow of their owne fortūes,
<pb facs="9"/>the shipwracke of all good conscience, and scandall of Christians, it being impossible that a good Christian should bee other then a true and loyall subiect to his Prince: I wil no longer withhold thee from the discourse it selfe, praying thee fauorably to interpret my indeuors and good intention herein.</p>
