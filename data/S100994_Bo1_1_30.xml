   <p>A Man can hardly haue knowledge of the estate of the <hi>Romaine</hi> Empire, nor lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of the Kingdomes, Signories and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities that are in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia:</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he vnderstande their moneyes, manners and behauiour in speech, which hath bred
<pb facs="47"/>
heer-to-fore a generall error and confusion. For they that haue written an hundred times Sestertiaes, meant and signified an hundred times an hundred thousand Sestertiaes: the which custome and kinde of speeche, hath brought the Interpreters and Translatours of good Authours, since within a thousande yeeres, into great doubt and errour.</p>
   <p>There were some that imagined and thought them to be the same indeede, and therfore spake thereof indifferently: others there were that either vnderstood them not, or else could not comprehend thē, and so by reason of their weakenes &amp; doubting, there hath ensued very great disference and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
   <p>But the verie trueth is, that this manner of speech came in vse, by abbreuiation of the language: for when they woulde signifie a great sum, to cut short the word, they would say an hundred times Sestertiaes: in sted of saying, an hundred times an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Sestertiaes. And foure hundred tymes Sestertiaes, in sted of four hundred times an hundred thousande: twelue times Sesterti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aes, meaning twelue thousande Sestertiaes. &amp;c.</p>
   <div type="currency_equivalencies">
      <pb facs="48"/>
      <head>
         <hi>To know summarily the declaration and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the summes contained in the Histories: I haue according to the account of</hi> Budaeus, <hi>gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the notes, and abridged them as followeth, to be knowen after our owne English money, or after the value of the French Crownes.</hi>
      </head>
      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>As,</hi> valueth foure small French Deniers, not so much as an English farthing.</p>
      <p>Thys <hi>As,</hi> is the very least peece of coyne or currant Money that is.</p>
      <p>In signification according to the Latine, it is taken for a pound weight, consisting of twelue ounces.</p>
      <p>In diuision of solid thinges, as of Lande or inheritance, it is likewise takē for the whole part or portion.</p>
      <p>There is required sixe <hi>Sextans</hi> to make or value an <hi>As.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>A <hi>Sextan</hi> is a coyne lesse then that which is called a <hi>Quadran</hi> by the third part.</p>
      <p>It likewise is a certaine poyse or weight, being two ounces, after some called <hi>Obolus,</hi> after other, the sixt part of a pound.</p>
      <p>It is the sixt part of any measure, summe or quantity, that is deuided into 12. parts.</p>
      <p>It is somtime likewise taken for 2. inches.
<pb facs="48"/>
Also the sixt parte of <hi>Iugerum,</hi> which is so much grounde as one yoke of Oxen wyll eare in a day. It containes in length, two hundred and forty foote, and in bredth one hundred and twenty foote, which multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, riseth to 28800.</p>
      <p>It may bee vsed for our English Acre of grounde, which neuerthelesse containeth more, &amp;c. or for a furlong.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Obolus</hi> is also a small peece of Coyne, but variable, according to the Coūtry: in <hi>France</hi> it is a little brasse peece, the sixt parte of a Souse: with vs in England it is a half-penny. Yet <hi>Iunius</hi> taketh it for a penny and farthing of our money.</p>
      <p>It is also a weight containing three Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, that is, halfe a Scruple.</p>
      <p>It is sometime vsed as <hi>Obolus terrae:</hi> fyue foote in breadth and tenne in length, which containes siftie foote square.</p>
      <p>A <hi>Quadran,</hi> in coyne is a brasen piece cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Triunx</hi> or <hi>Teruntius,</hi> the fourteenth part of <hi>Denarius,</hi> or as wee in England count, the fourth parte of a penny, which is our far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
      <p>It is the fourth part of an <hi>As,</hi> that is three ounces, and a quarter.</p>
      <p>Also the fourth part of any nūber or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: or three inches.</p>
      <p>
         <pb facs="49"/>
It is vsed diuers waies, as <hi>Quadrans operae Col,</hi> the fourth part of a daies work.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Ex quadrante haeredem facere. Ulpian,</hi> to make heire of the fourth part.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Quadrans vini. Cels.</hi> sixe ounces of Wine, after <hi>Budaeus.</hi> After Physitians foure ounces and a halfe.</p>
      <p>Four Quadrans or Quadrins, value an <hi>As.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>The <hi>Libella</hi> or little booke, as it is tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, is a coyne likewise valuing one <hi>As.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Of this coyne there were two sorts, one the tenth part of <hi>Sestertius,</hi> another the tenth part of <hi>Denarius.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Of English money it is no more thē three farthings.</p>
      <p>It is taken some time for a pound weight. <hi>Sesquiobolus</hi> valueth not halfe a Souse french.</p>
      <p>It is diuersly taken in other Countreyes: but in England it is likewise no more then three farthings.</p>
      <p>Also it is a poyse containing three parts of a Scruple.</p>
      <p>The little <hi>Sestertius</hi> valueth ten <hi>Deniers</hi> &amp; a halfe.</p>
      <p>This coyne was among the <hi>Romaines,</hi> whereof <hi>Denarius</hi> contained foure, and is so called, <hi>quasi Semitertius:</hi> for it contained two and a halfe of the brasen coyne called <hi>As,</hi> and is marked with this figure <hi>H. S.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>
         <pb facs="49"/>
Of English money it is estimated woorth two pence, I meane the little <hi>Sestertius.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>The <hi>Drachma</hi> valueth three french Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or Sols, whereof there be three-score in a French Crowne.</p>
      <p>It is otherwise called three Shillings and sixe pence, of this peece there is mention made in the Gospell of S. <hi>Mathew.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>This <hi>Drachma</hi> is a coyne figured with a Bullocke, counterpoysing an olde sterling Groate of eyght pence to the ounce.</p>
      <p>It was diuersly taken by the name of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidus amongst the Romaines: sometimes for a coyne of brasse containing twelue oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a shylling: sometime for Drachma in siluer.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Aureus solidus</hi> in <hi>Alexanders</hi> tyme, was two Drammes of gold, afterward, in the time of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> sixe of them made an ounce: they being of the weight of our olde English Nobles.</p>
      <p>After <hi>Aiginea Iun.</hi> a shilling. <hi>Attica Iun.</hi> seauen pence. <hi>Auri</hi> twelue siluer Drammes, that is, an ounce and a halfe of siluer.</p>
      <p>The <hi>Sicle</hi> valueth two <hi>Drachmaes.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>It is a coyne in value about foure English Groates, when eyght went to an ounce.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Siclus Hebraicus, vel argenteus,</hi> according to <hi>Iun,</hi> was two shillings foure pence.</p>
      <p>
         <pb facs="50"/>
It is also a weight beeing halfe an ounce in poyse.</p>
      <p>The <hi>Didrachma,</hi> valueth two of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Drachmaes.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>The <hi>Denier</hi> valueth foure Sestertiaes, which according to some, are woorth three shyllings sixe pence.</p>
      <p>It was a dayes wages for a Labourer, as it is sayd in the twenty Chapter of Saint <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>After the Latine, <hi>Denarius</hi> is an olde pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, worth tenne peeces of siluer, or tenne <hi>Asses.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>According to some other Countries, it is reckoned worth eyght pence.</p>
      <p>The word interpreted after our English, is vsed for a penny of our common coyne.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Iunius</hi> saith, it is a coyne as much as eyght pence of our coyne.</p>
      <p>The Romaine penny likewise, was worth foure Sestertiaes, and it went in pay for ten <hi>Asses.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Of it were three sorts: one, the sixt parte of an ounce, which was more by the thirde part then the <hi>Greeke Drachma.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Another was, the seauenth parte of an ounce, weighing a Dramme, &amp; the seauenth part thereof, and twentie and foure went to a pounde.</p>
      <p>
         <pb facs="50"/>
The third was the eight part of an ounce, equall to the Greeke Dramme: in value a sterling Groate, when 8▪ went to an ounce.</p>
      <p>The <hi>Sportula</hi> valueth an hundred <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drans</hi> or <hi>Quadrines.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>After the <hi>Romaines,</hi> they termed it ten Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stertiaes, which they vsed to bestowe in a small drinking or banquet, on such as came to salute them.</p>
      <p>After our English account, by our far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: it is worth two shyllings &amp; a penny.</p>
      <p>The <hi>Mina</hi> valueth an hundred <hi>Drach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>These hundred <hi>Drachmaes</hi> are of our old sterling money, three and thirtie shyllinges and foure pence.</p>

            </gap>nus,</hi> which is all one with the <hi>Drach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma:</hi> whereby they reckon it to be woorth fifty eyght shillings and foure pence.</p>
      <p>It is also takē for a poyse of weight, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twelue ounces and a halfe, so that it is more then the <hi>Romaine</hi> pound by 4. <hi>Drach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>It is likewise a measure of ground, contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one hundred and twenty two foote in length, and as manie in breadth.</p>
      <p>Ten thousand Sestertiaes, or tenne great Sestertiaes, amount to two hundred and
<pb facs="51"/>
fifty Crowns of the Crowne, the best French Crowne next the Sun Crowne.</p>
      <p>A thousand Sestertiaes make twenty fiue Crownes French, which is fiue pound ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our English money, wherby the rest may easily be valued.</p>

      <head>To make a briefe account of our English money, from the small pennie, to the pounde of twentie shillings, I thought it necessarie, for helpe in the former great summes.</head>

      <p>Of these are the greatest Measures, which for Ale, Beere and Wine be indifferent.</p>
      <l>The Firkin of Ale holdeth eight Gallons.</l>
      <l>Of Beere nine gallons.</l>
      <l>The Kilderkin of Ale sixteene gallons.</l>
      <l>Of Beere eyghteene gallons.</l>
      <l>The Barrell of Ale thirty two gallons.</l>
      <l>Of Beere thirtie-sixe.</l>
      <l>Of VVine but thirtie one and a halfe.</l>
      <l>The Wine Tierse holdeth forty two Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons.</l>
      <l>The Hogshead sixtie-three.</l>
      <l>The Tertian eyghty-foure.</l>
      <p>The Pype or Malmesie Butte, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty sixe.</p>
      <l>The Tun two hundred and 56. gallons.</l>
      <p>
         <pb facs="54"/>
In the measure for Graine, two Gallons make a pecke.</p>
      <l>Foure Pecks, a Bushell or Strike.</l>
      <p>Foure Bushels, a Cowmbe or Cowme, a Cornock, a Rasor.</p>
      <l>Two Cowmes make a quarter.</l>
      <p>And for the playner declaration of smaller measures, I suppose three quarters of a pint to be a pound in measure, deuided into 12. ounces, euery ounce according to the Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smithes assise: which pounde containeth of pure Oyle a pound. &amp;c.</p>
