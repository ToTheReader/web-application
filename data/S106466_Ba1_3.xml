   <p>IF any will-worship or Ceremonialist
say: that this bowing and ducking <hi>at
the name or naming of Iesus,</hi> is justified
in Mr. Widdowes his Answer to Mr.
Prin: I reply, first <hi>let us observe what a
brand of an evill conscience he have, which
do defend this Superstition;</hi> It is certainely
knowne, that Mr. Widdowes is knowne▪
and detected to be but a drunken Divine,
a kind of mad-fellow and pot-compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
and though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e useth often, (as is
credibly or reported) to sweare by the
sacred name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> yet his answer for
bowing at it, was nothing but a Sottishe
mad, rayling Pamphlet; replied unto, and
utterly confuted by Mr. Prin, and he putt
to a limping silence, and a <hi>non plus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But some of you, Advocates for Baal,
will happily say, that Mr, Page (forsooth)
hath hard, and killed the Cow, in justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Widdowes and defending of bowing


<pb n="73" facs="37"/>
and cringing <hi>at the name or naming of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>

with a single and impartiall eye, must

      </gap>eeds say, that it is, likewise, farced fuli of
idle impertinencies, sophistications, and
not free from absurdities, falsities, and
blasphemous comparisons; and revilings
towards the person, and junioritie of M.
Prion: though upon my certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the learned Laick, being betwixt
30 &amp; 40 yeares old, is of sufficient age, &amp;
ambilitie, to encounter with any Iesuites,
Priest, Arminian, Anti-puritane, or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legelubber
in Christendom; as his learned
Labours doe sufficiently testifie to the
World: And herein I will not decline,
but dare and doe appeale to all that are
Orthodox, Learned, Godly, and Wise-hearted
of the aforesaid famous Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities:
And that the first of these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

They are allready fully confuted by
these Pair of Orthodox Divines, before

my premised Challenge standeth good.
Let therefore any opposite Reader, in
the name and feare of Christ Iesus, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
further scoffing, rayling or giering,
and in stead thereof, if he be able, take
pen in hand, and see what he can say to
to the Challenge. <hi>Iterum vale.</hi>
