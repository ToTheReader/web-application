         <note place="margin">Anno 1580. Iune 20.</note> Confession of Scotland, after long and due examination his Maiestie is thoroughly resolued in the truth by the word and spirit of God.</p>
      <p>Who would thinke that hee which a little before iustlie commended his Maiestie for exceeding clemencie, mildnes, louingnes and affablenes, should now challenge him for persecuting heauily the sincere professors of the onely true Catholike and Apostolike faith?</p>

         <pb n="28" facs="20"/>
For there being great diuersities of pretended Religions currant in the world, all contrary to the Church of Rome, how can I certainlie know, whether of them h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

These principall diuisions of the new Gospell (to omit sundrie sub-diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions) being famous, and receiued of diuers in England, according to each mans phantasie, it is meete you expresse, whether of them you speake of, that it may be dulie considered, how the Romane Religion and it agree, and what vnion may be made betweene them.</p>

         <hi>
            <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y a</hi> Reformed Catholike, <hi>I vnderstand any one that holds the same necessarie heades of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with the Roman Church: yet so, as he pares off and reiects all errours in doctrine whereby the said religion is corrupted. How this may be done, I haue
<pb n="38" facs="25"/>
begun to make some little declaration in this small Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise: the intent whereof is to shew how neere we may come to the present church of Rome in sundrie points of religion: and wherein we must for euer dissent.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>
         <hi>My purpose in penning this small discourse is threefold. The first is, to confute all such Politikes as hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that our religion, &amp; that of the Roman Church dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not in substance, and consequently that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled: yet my meaning is not here to condemne any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification that tends to perswade the Roman Church to our religion. The second is, that the Papists which thinke so basely of our religion, may be won to a better liking of it: when they shall see how neere we come vnto them in sundrie points. The third, that the common Protestant might in some part see &amp; conceiue the point of difference betweene vs and the Church of Rome: and know in what manner and how farre forth, we condemne the opinions of the said Church.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>
         <hi>I craue pardon for the order which I vse, in handling the seuer all points. For I haue set them downe one by one, as they came to minde, not respecting the lawes of Method. If any Papist shall say that I haue not alleadged their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aright, I answere, that their bookes be at hand, and I can iustifie what I haue said.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>
         <hi>Thus crauing thine acceptation for this my paines, and wishing vnto thee the increase of knowledge, and loue of pure and sound religion, I take my leaue and make an ende.</hi>

            </gap>.</note> of the whore of Babylon, and that at large, as he saw her in a vision described vnto him. In the sixteenth verse of the same chapter, he foretels her destruction: and in the three first verses of this 18. chapter, he goeth on to propound the sayd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, yet more directly and plainely, withall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging arguments to prooue the same, in all the verses following. Now in this fourth verse is set downe a caueat seruing to forewarne all the people of God, that they may escape the iudgement shall befall the whore: and the wordes containe two parts: a commaundement, and a reason. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement: <hi>Come out of her my people,</hi> that is, from Babylon. The reason taken from the euent, <hi>least ye be partakers, &amp;c.</hi> Touching the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, first I will search the right meaning of it, and then set down the vse thereof and doctrine flowing thence. In historie therefore are three Babylons mentioned: one is, Babylon of Assyria standing on the riuer Euphrates, where was the confusion of Languages, and where the Iewes were in captinitie: which Babylon is in Scripture reproched for Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and other iniquities. The second Babilon is in Egypt, standing on the riuer Nilus, and is now called Cayr; of that mention is made, 1. Pet. 5. v. 13. (as some thinke) though indeede it is as likely and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought, that there is meant Babylon of Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria. The third Babylon is mystical, whereof Babylon of Assyria was a tipe and figure; and that is Rome, which is without question here to be vnderstood.
<pb n="42" facs="27"/>
And the whore of Babylon, as by all circumstances may be gathered, is the state or regiment of a people that are the inhabitants of Rome, and appertaine thereto. This may be prooued by the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Ghost: for in the last verse of the 17. chapter, the woman, that is, the whore of Babylon, is said to be <hi>a citie which raigneth ouer the kings of the</hi>
         <note place="margin">B.</note>
         <hi>earth:</hi> now in the daies when S. Iohn penned this booke of Reuelation, there was no citie in the world that ruled ouer the kings of the earth but Rome; it then being the seate where the Emperour put in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xecution his Imperiall authoritie. Againe in the seuenth verse shee is said <hi>to sit on a beast hauing seuen</hi>
         <note place="margin">C.</note>
         <hi>heads and tenne hornes,</hi> which seuen heads bee <hi>seuen hils,</hi> vers. 9. whereon the woman sitteth, and also they bee <hi>seuen kings.</hi> Therefore by the whore of Babylon is meant a citie standing on seuen hills. Now it is wel known, not onely to learned men in the Church of God, but euen to the heathen themselues, that Rome alone is the citie built on seuen distinct hills, called <hi>Caelius, Auentinus, Exquilinus, Tarpeius</hi> or <hi>Capito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus, Viminalis, Palatinus, Quirinalis.</hi> Papists to helpe themselues, doe alleadge that old Rome stood on seuen hills, but now is remooued further to the plaine of <hi>Campus Martins.</hi> I answer, that howsoeuer the greatest part of the citie in regard of habitation bee not now on seuen hils, yet in regard of regiment and practise of religion it is: for euen to this day vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these hilles are seated certaine Churches and Monasteries and other like places where the Papall Authoritie is put in execution: and thus Rome being put for a state and regiment, euen at this day,
<pb n="43" facs="27"/>

         <note n="c" place="margin">Reuel. 18. 2. &amp; 17. 18.</note> But this the text will not beare; the whore being opposed to the Kings of the earth, and ruling ouer them: vpon this foundation Master <hi>Perkins</hi> thus builds his reason.
<list type="syllogism">
            <item>Either Rome Heathenish, or Rome Christian, is the whore of Babylon:</item>
            <item>But Rome Heathenish is not: </item>
            <item>Therefore Rome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is.</item>
         </list>
      </p>
      <p>This is plainly his reason, and not that which you ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The proposition is euident, because the state of Rome was neuer but either Heathenish, or Christian. The assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Master <hi>Perkins</hi> proues. But I must be faine to leaue his course, and to follow this reformers steps.</p>
      <p>The state of Rome must be taken, as it is the <note n="d" place="margin">See Fulke, Dovvnam, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, Povvel.</note> seate of Antichrist: but it was not the seate of Antichrist in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> daies; for Antichrist, <note n="e" place="margin">Bellarm. de Romano pon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>if. lib. 3. cap. 2</note> according to your doctrine, is not yet come. Againe, it was no mysterie, for heathenish Rome to be an Idolatrous and bloody persecutor of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. Thirdly, the state that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> calles the harlot, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues till the finall destruction spoken of by him, and S. <hi>Paul:</hi> but the estate of heathenish Rome was decayed long since. Your proofe is insufficient, for you alleage but two of many, that make Rome Babylon: who, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue commendation for discerning so much of the truth, so may they bee excused, if seeing Rome in their time a Christian famous Church, they did not take it to be the seate of Antichrist. But <hi>Hierome</hi> seemes rather to make against
<pb n="49" facs="30"/>
you, because euen then he calles it Babylon, in respect of Antichrist to come.</p>
      <p>Your second and third reasons are of no more force. For S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as I haue shewed, spake not of Rome as it was then, but as it was to be afterward, and now hath been almost one thousand yeeres euen in temporall authoritie, to which one of the Popes swords belongs. Master <hi>Perkins</hi> rightly applies to Rome the words, that fifteene hundred yeeres since were spoken of her, as she is now: the Popes Legates were nothing inferiour, either for authoritie, or exactions, to the Romane Proconsuls. But, as it was foretold in a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, vnder a colour of spirituall gouernment, ouerruling both in Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill matters: he that remembers the bloodie massacre of so many thousands, in a few daies, not many yeeres agoe in France, shall see that the Church of Rome shed blood enough, at that one time, to make her drunke as long as she shal continue: &amp; yet what a small part was it, of that, which from time to time she hath bezeled in?</p>
      <p>This section is nothing to purpose. For who denies, that there were as well Christians as Heathen in Rome, in the Emperours daies? The distinction, Master <hi>Perkins</hi> denies, is, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes of Rome, as it was vnder the Emperours, and not of it, as it hath been, and is vnder the Popes; which the authors, you alleage, meddle not with.</p>

And thus Bernard hath giuen his verdict, that not only this vsurper, but all the Popes, for this many yeeres, are the beast in the Apocalyps: because now they are onely chosen by the colledge of Cardinals. To this agreeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the second, ann. 1059. that the <note place="margin">C. In nomine, dist. 23.</note> Pope shall afterward be created by the suffrages of the Cardinall Bishops of Rome, with the consent of the rest of the Clergie and people, and the Emperor himselfe: and all Popes <hi>are excommunicate and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>

         <hi>as Antichrists,</hi> that enter otherwise, as all now doe.

      <p>There is a grosse fault, also in the Canon of <hi>Pope Nicolas</hi> as he citeth it, <hi>that the Pope was to be created by the Cardinals, Bishops of Rome.</hi> As though there were some 30. or 40. Bishops at once: but of the matter of election else where.</p>

      <p>Marke and embrace this most learned Doctors iudgement, of ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vvith the See of Rome, in all doubtfull questions: he vvould not trust to his ovvne vvit and skill vvhich vvere singular; nor thought it safe to relie vpon his learned and vvise neighbours: he durst not set vp his rest vvith his ovvne Bishop <hi>Paulinus,</hi> vvho vvas a man of no meane marke but the Patriarke of <hi>Antioch:</hi> but made his assured stay vpon the See of Rome, as vpon an vnmoueable Rocke, vvith vvhich (saith he) if vve doe not communicate in faith and Sacraments, vve are but profane men, voide of all Religion: In a vvord, vve belong not to Christ, but be of Antichrists traine.

Whereas Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> holdeth all to appertaine to Antichrist, who be not fast lincked in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, with the <hi>Pope</hi> and See of Rome. And so to conclude with this point, euerie true Catholike must say with Saint <hi>Ambrose: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in all things to follovv the Church of Rome.</hi> And thus much of his Prologue.</p>

Who sees not the feeblenes of this consequence? And yet this is all the force that can be in the reason, till they haue prooued, that the Church of Rome either was then, or is not now, the Church of Antichrist.</p>
      <p>If that principalitie, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaks of, were in the Church of Rome, by any right of authoritie from God; how should the same <hi>Irenaeus</hi> be excused, who <note n="n" place="margin">Iren. lib. 3. cap. 3.</note> reprooues <hi>Victor</hi> B. of Rome, for taking vpon him to excommunicate some of the Easterne Churches, about obseruing of Easter?

         <hi>Hierome</hi> a Romane, and at that time a yong man, liuing in Syria, being pressed by an Arian Bishop to allow, by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription that, which might tend to the countenancing of Arianisme, writes to <hi>Damasus</hi> his owne Bishop, for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the matter. But that he did, not in respect of his place, as if hee could not erre, because he was Bishop of Rome (for <hi>Liberius</hi> the very next Bishop before <hi>Damasus,</hi> by <note n="q" place="margin">Descriptor. eccles. in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatiano.</note>
         <hi>Hieroms</hi> owne confession, had subscribed to Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme) but in regard of his iudgement, which was sound against that heresie: so that whosoeuer, in that question, gathered not with him, scattered, and held with Antichrist against Christ.</p>
      <p>Those, all things, that <note n="r" place="margin">Ambros. de sacra. lib. 3. cap. 1.</note>
         <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaks of, are, according to the place alleaged by you, to be restrained to the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and Ceremonies of the Church of Rome. Wherein though <hi>Ambrose</hi> professe himselfe desirous to follow the Church (note by the way, that the Church of Rome is taken <note n="s" place="margin">Gabriel Biel in Canon. Missae, lect. 18. de quotidiana praefatione.</note> as a particular Diocesan Church, such as the Church of Millan also was at that time, and not as the vniuersall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church) yet he did not so follow it, because reason led him another way: his words are these: <hi>In all things I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to follow the Romane Church: but</hi>

         <hi>yet we also being men haue vnderstanding: therefore that, which is otherwhere better obserued, we also rightly keepe: We follow the Apostle Peter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, we sticke vnto his deuotion, &amp;c.</hi> Out of which speech of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> these points are to be obserued. First, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Christian men is to direct them, wherein they are to follow the Church of Rome, wherein to leaue it. Secondly, that some other Churches might, and did better obserue diuers things, than the Church of Rome did. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Church of Rome did not obserue that, which the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> (at least in <hi>Ambrose</hi> his iudgement) had deuoutly performed. Thus we see what helpe there is in the ancient writers to free the Pope and Church of Rome, that

now are, from being the very Antichrist foretold of in the Reuelation.</p>

First, how far forth we may ioyne with them in the matter of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: secondly, how far forth and wherein we must dissent and depart from them. And for this cause I meane to make choice of certaine points of religion, and to speake of them in as good order as I can, shewing in each of them our consent and difference: and the rather, because some harpe much vpon this string, that a Vnion may be made of our two religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that we differ not in substance, but in points of circumstance.</p>

Yet (I hope) with that perspicuitie, as the meaner learned may vnderstand it, and with such substance of proofe, both out of the holy Scriptures and auncient Fathers, as the more iudicious (to vvhose profit it is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie dedicated) may not contemne it.</p>
