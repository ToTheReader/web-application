      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Othing is so rashly, rudely, or vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly vndertaken, but that reason or discretion seemeth to direct the same: and most of all Militarie attempts are to bee enterprised with high deuotion, because they tend to peace the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious end of warre. For there seemeth as great difference betweene peace and warre, as betweene a sober and a mad man: the one plausible, sweete and profitable to many, the other ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and troublesome to all, and truly profi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>able to none. It is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious euill, as of it selfe, but by circumstances it is both lawfull and expedient, not that <hi>it openeth the way to heauen by slaughter and bloud,</hi> as <hi>Scipio</hi> of <hi>Affricke</hi> boasted, but that it is the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme most wished peace. When the cause is iust no man may que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether the warre bee lawfull. It is then iust when it seeketh to defend and preserue the publique quiet and Christian religion, and it is then lawful, when it is done by the authority of the Prince, and rightly vndertaken when it is in the feare of God, and truly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted when it is with vpright minds. As touching the iustice and lawfulnes of the cause present, it sufficeth vs to know it is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue our state, the superiour Magistrate commandeth it, and wee are to obey it in a treble dutie, to God, our Soueraigne and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, to the end we may possesse our owne in quiet vnder the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of equitie and iustice, which both are established by peace, and peace maintained by suppressing warre. Our present warre is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against hostile offence, which (as euery man seeth) threatneth vnto vs the dreadfull deuouring sword, or such wretched seruitude
<pb facs="4"/>
as was neuer shewed vnto the <hi>Iewes</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> or <hi>Babylon.</hi> For the experienced tyrannies of our aduersaries haue many wayes and in diuers places, displaied their bloudie inclination to bee more than heathenish: and therefore our estate (aymed at by their cruell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires) is neither to faint or flatter it selfe, but in the name of the God of hoasts to goe foorth with our armies, and with courage onely in Christ to witnes our Christian fortitude: not as some great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialists haue done, that haue sought and gotten fame by bloud, as <hi>Herod, Hannibal, Caesar, Attila,</hi> and infinite others, who haue left behinde them nothing whereof truly to glorie, onely the stinke of their ambition, and slaughter of men remaineth. And our present enemies testifie their apt imitation of these tyrants in all their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, wherein they regarde nothing more then the number of townes burned, and of men, women and children murthered. And he priseth his reputation dearest, that hath inhumanely bereaued most of life, and most tyrannously behaued himselfe in the warres, without feare of God, or clemencie towards man: shewing thereby how farre they degenerate in affection from true Christians, that imbrace compassion and mercy as the badges of true religion, which teacheth that wee ought to conforme our mindes to a godly procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the affayres of warre, without rigour, tyrannie and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious lenitie. And to this end ought all men called to the profession of armes to be furnished with diuine vertues, that all their proceedings may sauour of godlines and godly boldnes. And for as much as (by reason of our vsurped libertie to sinne more in this profession then is fit in any) we are depriued as of our owne natures, of the true knowledge of that good course which in these dangers of warre is to be taken. And therefore all militarie men ought to haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall counsell and consultation with the God of armies, disclayming their owne wisedomes, iudgements and valour, and to followe what is commanded in, or agreeth with his word. The Common-wealth of <hi>Israel</hi> was held happie for that it might aske, and receiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and direction in all their proceedings of God by <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi> But much more blessed are we in that the diuine light shineth vnto vs in Christ, whereby the true meaning of the spirit is expounded in the word of trueth, whereunto all men are inuited
<pb facs="4"/>
freely to referre themselues, and therein to search diligently what dutie is required of them in their seuerall functions: for therein hath God declared his mind and will concerning all things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with man hath to deale in this life. From thence must euery degree be furnished with warrant and direction how to proceede in their professions: therein is the Prince taught how to rule rightly, the subiects how to obey loyally: therein are Commanders in the warres directed how to dispose of their charge wisely, and the inferiour souldiers may therein learne how to frame both their affections and all their proceedings godly. And for that the office of a souldier is a calling of higher reckoning and of greater moment then it is commonly reputed by the generall and rude multitude, yea, then it is considered to be, of the most that vndertake to carrie armes in the field, and of some that beare office in the warres: it is requisite that all should vnderstand what burthen they beare, that they may also learne to discharge the same, so as they may be worthie to be called what they desire to bee. For as the life is to the bodie, so is vertue to the minde, and the diuine spirit to the soule: the bodie without life is but a dunghill, the minde without vertue is but a sinke or gulfe of filthie cogitations, and the soule without the heauenly comforter is but a forlorne captiue vnder the Prince of darknes. Ignorance of the will of God is a darke clowde that shadoweth all diuine quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that smoothereth euery sacred grace and speciall fauour receiued at the hands of the highest, whereby a souldier becommeth oftentimes proud of vanitie, and couetous and greedie of vitious and hurtfull in stead of vertuous and profitable things: whereby he becommeth conquered of his owne carnall affections, making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe thereby vnfit to vndertake that honorable action which onlie is proper to the vertuous, and to such as feare God. Such as are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with diuine habiliments within, aswell as girded with milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie furniture without. For who so considereth that he fighteth for the Lords cause, for his Princes state, his countries good, and his owne honour, cannot but thinke himselfe bound to cast off all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments that may hinder his prosperitie, or blemish his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein. For there is no assurance in things displeasing the King of Kings, in things vnsauourie to the spirit of God, who being
<pb facs="5"/>
on our side giueth vs victorie: but if we defraude him of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honour due vnto him from our selues at home, and from our men of war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e abroad, wee haue no assurance that he is with vs and for vs. And therefore <hi>when we goe foorth with our Armies</hi> (saith Moses) <hi>we must then keepe vs from all wickednesse: for that the Lord himselfe walketh in the middest of our campe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> to deliuer vs, and to giue the enemie into our hands, if we be holie: but to destroy vs if we be prophane, faithles and wicked.</hi> And it h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>th been euer a noted subtiltie of a wicked enemie prompted by <hi>Sathan,</hi> to lay traps and snares to cause Christians to sinne. <hi>Search</hi> (saith <hi>Achior) if there bee any wickednesse among them,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iudith. <hi>5.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>then shall wee surely destroy them, otherwise we shall neuer preuaile against them, for their God will defend them.</hi> And it seemeth that our aduersaries haue no greater encouragement, then to see the fruites of our grosse corruptions, affirming that wee feare not God, because wee transgresse his will so boldly: and aboue all they take notice of the vnciuill behauiour and licentious liues of our men in the warres, grounding greater hope to preuaile, by reason of our sinnes, then by their owne forces. Experience hath long tolde vs that there hath been defect of vertuous exercises among men of militarie profession, who seeking to be renowmed, begin not at the feare of God, but yeelding their mindes captiue to sinne, come con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered into the field: and therefore their enterprises often faile of victorie. But howsoeuer some deeme the contrary, it doth higly dignifie men of armes, to feare and serue the liuing God, and to bee at one with him, before they presume to march to the battell, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to beare armes in the field. And all such as are called to that high and worthie calling ought to be changed in their minds, casting off all the former lusts of the flesh, to shape their affections after a more holie order: for the neerer they resemble the great conqueror, by participation of his diuine vertues, so much the more powerfull shall they become, and bee partakers also of his glorie by conquering by him, as were <hi>Gideon, Barac, Sampson, Iepthath, Dauid, Samuel,</hi> and many other that in and by him ouercame king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and obtained many admirable victories against their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. It is an honorable thing in Commanders to be able to exhort
<pb facs="5"/>
by word to godlines of life, but more honorable when their exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is ioyned with the example of a vertuous life: for the one proceedeth from the tongue, which may dissemble before the world, the other from the heart, which is knowne to God. And he that is truely sound within, cannot but appeare vnto others to be so: for he will bring foorth the fruites of approbation, among which it is not the least to haue care of the choice of his souldiers, as of the most vertuous, as much as lieth in him, after the example of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who sayd vnto his souldiers: <hi>My friends, I haue chosen you, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I haue had experience heretofore of your manhood, but because I haue knowne you readie to doe those things which are honest, and to eschew all dishonestie.</hi> In his choice he seemed to agree with the opinion of valiant <hi>Agamemnon</hi> a Grecian Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, who affirmed to <hi>Achilles,</hi> that <hi>one man beloued of God, is in stead of many men in an armie.</hi> On the contrarie the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirmeth,<note place="margin">Iousha <hi>7.1.2</hi>
      </note> that the wickednesse of one man indangereth the state of a whole armie, as <hi>Achan</hi> did the armie of <hi>Israel.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Traian</hi> sayd, <hi>to accept of warre, to collect souldiers, to put them in order, and to giue battell, belonged to man: but to giue victorie was the worke of God onely.</hi> Whereby it followeth, that as victorie is the end of waging battell, and battell disposed by best discretion of chiefe Commanders: so there is not a more pretious thing in the execution of this busines, then to doe all in his feare, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and reuerence, that giueth that which is striued for. They that couet to vanquish, and not to bee vanquished, must relie wholly on him that disposeth of victorie, and to vse souldiers, munition and policie as his meanes: for if they be blessed by him, they are holie, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they may bee aswell instruments of their owne, and of the confusion of such as trust in them as of their safetie. To the ende therefore that our enterprises may succeede to our comfort, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth all men of armes, of what qualitie or degree soeuer he bee, not to thinke is a blemish to his reputation to be seene vertuous, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and godly, but to testifie the same in the view of all men, by continuall exercise of prayer and praise to the God of hoasts, that he may still blesse those meanes, direct their counsels, and dispose of their proceedings happily: so shall they triumph in victorie as well
<pb facs="6"/>
with few as with many, with the godliest, and not with the greatest number of men. And to the end that all militarie men may be put in minde of this heauenly consideration, I haue presumed vnder your fauours, to speake a little vnto you in a plaine manner, not that I would be seene to presume to teach such as are alreadie furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with diuine knowledge, and are armed with faith and religion: but to whet them on to the daily practise thereof, and to stirre vp such as are more ignorant, to a desire to become also vertuous and obedient to God, and in him to their Prince and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, that as they seeke honor, they may so at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, as may make them in deede truely honorable.</p>
