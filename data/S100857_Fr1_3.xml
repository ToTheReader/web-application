   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ouing Brethren, and my kind Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and fellow-Trauellors, you haue heere presented vnto your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable acceptance, a Treatise of the cure of Wounds made by Gunne-shot: the worthinesse whereof, I cannot better expresse, then to say <hi>Parie</hi> wrote it; a Man experienced with forty yeeres practise, at that time when <hi>France</hi> did most groane vnder the burthen of the vnciuill <hi>Ciuill Factions,</hi> bred by her home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred <hi>Enemies</hi>; wherein there was not any nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble assault, siege, nor battel fought, but <hi>Ambrose Parie</hi> was chiefely imployed about the cure of wounded souldiers, as hee himselfe testifieth in his owne Booke of voyages and trauels. Accept it therfore thankfully, as a gift from the Author, as it was first intended. And although it may be obiected, that in these peaceable times this <hi>Treatise</hi> is of little vse, and therefore vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: true it is, and with thankfulnesse to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
<pb facs="4"/>
we liue in a calme and quiet age, but is therefore this so necessary and worthy a <hi>Document</hi> to be neglected? Because it hapneth but sildome, wee are the more vnacquainted with the cure: And as amongest all the <hi>Engi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>es</hi> that the malice of <hi>Man</hi> could euer inuent for the ruine of man, Artillery is the cruellest and most dangerous, because that neither <hi>strength</hi> or <hi>policy</hi> are able to preuent the fury therof: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Method</hi> that reacheth vs to cure those wounds after so easie and excellent a way as is here described, must needs be accounted most needfull and beneficiall. But howsoeuer, I doe not doubt, but that you my kinde friends, who with <hi>Galen</hi> trauell to benefit your Country, and enrich your experienccs, that you (I say) doe know the vse and necessitie of this subiect. And although there are diuers extant at this time; yet neuerthelesse, this doeth deserue the best place in your good opinions, because that the translation heereof, was first vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for your sakes onely. Farewell.</p>
