                 <title>The Spanish pilgrime: or, An admirable discouery of a Romish Catholicke : Shewing how necessary and important it is, for the Protestant kings, princes, and potentates of Europe, to make warre vpon the King of Spaines owne countrey: also where, and by what meanes, his dominions may be inuaded and easily ruinated; as the English heretofore going into Spaine, did constraine the kings of Castile to demand peace in all humility, and what great losse it hath beene, and still is to all Christendome, for default of putting the same in execution. Wherein hee makes apparant by good and euident reasons, infallible arguments, most true and certaine histories, and notable examples, the right way, and true meanes to resist the violence of the Spanish King, to breake the course of his designes, to beate downe his pride, and to ruinate his puissance</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was my hap to contract amity with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Gentlemen of Arragon, and other Spaniards (not Castillians, for to them I wot not how to carry any affection, which should exceede the prescript rule of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell) of whom I vnderstood many things t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uching matters of State, which were to me strange and vnknowne: by reason that there were amongst them some personages exceedingly well learned, and most conuersant and expert in all Histories, and notably well seene and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in the affaires of the World. There was one aboue the rest in their company, a man of great spirit iudgement, and experience who had seene a great part of Europe, and (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene for a long time in Portugall) had dealt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersed with the Portugals, whose Language he spake natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and had read all the Histories of that Realme, and was so well acquainted with all their affaires, and knew them all
<pb facs="3"/> so particularly, that I did greatly wonder at it. For, in things that were to come, I found him in manner of a Prophet: in so much that for the viuacity and quicknesse of his spirit, and the long experience which hee hath had, he seemeth to me to haue as great knowledge in things to come, as if he saw them present before his eyes. He made proofe vnto me by many reasons (which did not onely plainely conuince my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but did as it were bind me hand and foote) that these voyages, and others of like kinde, would neuer draw with them any other profit, nor serue to any other purpose, then to waken the sleeping dogge, and to re-enforce the common enemie. Now considering that <hi>Don Philip</hi> King of Castile hath a Councell, the most choise and excellent, such as neuer Prince in this World had a better, his seruitors most loyall and faithfull, great forces, and abundance of treasure, vpon the which all other things doe depend: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this, hee doth not leaue daily to cause diuers Bookes to be imprinted in his fauour and defence, I doe therefore desire to haue drawne from this learned and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy person some thing written with his owne hand, which I might present vnto your Maiesties: and to this end did I diuers times make request vnto him, but I could neuer get him to yeeld or condescend thereunto. Wherefore bethink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my selfe, that as pouerty, griefe, and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, doth bury, and (as it were) kill the spirits of a man, so the commodities of this life, contentment and cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, doth reuiue and quicken them, I determined because I saw him sad, pensiue, and melancholicke, by reason of his exile and misfortunes out of his owne Countrey, to procure his pleasure and contentment, knowing that by this meanes
<pb facs="3"/> I might obtaine the accomplishment of my desire, I did therefore set open my gates and my House vnto him, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him with my Purse, and made him partner of my Coyne; I cherished and entertained him for many dayes, and (for loue of him) some other of his company. And by this curtesie I made him so beholding to me, that afterwards hauing many times held dispute and conference together, I caused him in the end to take his Pen in hand. Thereupon did he compose in the Castillian Tongue, this Discourse, which he entitled <hi>Trattado paranaetico:</hi> and he presented it vnto me. The which when I had read, a most strange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration or astonishment did rauish me: for that I neuer saw (I will not say in so little a Volume) but not euen in great Bookes, so many curiosities reported, so many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Histories, things so secret and particular, admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments so necessary to be embraced, nor counsels so iust to be followed. And knowing perfectly the excellency of this worke, and how greatly important it would be to be seene of your Maiesties, and by the Kings, Princes, Potentates, and Common-weales of Europe. And albeit I know my stile to be rude and barbarous, yet such was my ambition (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse mine owne infirmity) that I was not willing that any other should haue the pleasure in doing it. In some places I haue augmented it: holding it so to be needfull, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more cleere vnderstanding of the History. Touching the originall, I thought it reason not to abridge or cut off any part thereof. I most humbly beseech, in regard of your most Christian Maiesties, to receiue it with that good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which Princes oweth to their Subiects: who for his seruice, will not esteeme to hazard the losse of all that hee possesseth: much lesse to make himselfe vncapable for the
<pb facs="4"/> obtaining of that which of right is due vnto him, and who for the good and honour of his Countrey, will spend his life most freely and willingly. God preserue and blesse the most Christian persons of your Maiesties, with so great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of spirituall graces, and assist you and make you to prosper with so many riches of temporall blessings, as is possible to his diuine Maiestie. Amen.</p>
