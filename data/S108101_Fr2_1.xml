   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, in viewing certaine olde Bookes of Chirurgerie, I happened to light vpon this written coppie, and perusing it thoroughly, I thought it a worke verie profitable and necessarie for all godly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of our Arte: for heere they shall finde in breefe, certayne iudgements and aphorismes, of most imperfections, which dayly assaulteth mans bodie, not onely in the exterior, but also in the interior partes: which diseases, or griefes, are easie to be found, because it goeth alphabetically, first in latin, and then in english. It is a worke, (as I iudge) gathered out of diuers Authors, as well of Physick, as of Chirurgerie, by some that was willing to profit his countrey and common wealth. A collection in mine opinion woorthy the publishing and setting foorth, although I knowe it will not please the humors of some captious heads, that will neyther do good themselues, nor suffer others: as I my selfe, and other good men, haue tasted of their sclanderous toongs, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly backbiting taunts. But thou (good Reader) whatsoeuer thou art, if thou louest thy</hi>

      <hi>countrey and common wealth, or dost take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in our so worthy an Arte, hauing a care to discharge thy calling with a good conscience, then (I say) thou wilt not onely finde great profit and pleasure thy selfe, by carying these small sentences in memorie, but also thou wilt be thankefull to any that shall take paynes in so woorthye a thing.</hi>
