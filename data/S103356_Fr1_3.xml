   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue noted for some yeares many thousands of Histories collected out of sundrie Authors, to whose consciences I referre you, ingaging my selfe for nothing of their writings, but a faithful collection which I haue made, &amp; yet thinking that they would offer nothing that were false or foolish to bee published, without good consideration. I call them <hi>Admirable,</hi> for that the reasons of many of them are farre beyond my apprehension, and that to my iudgement they are miraculous. They are also <hi>Memorable,</hi> for the contentment, instruction and consolation which good and quiet soules may gather thereby. I haue very seldome exceeded the age that went last before vs, and will forbeare it more in those bookes that shall followe, If GOD will giue mee leaue. The History of our times is an abridgement of all the wonders of fore-passed ages: Do not blame me if I were desirous to offer vnto you some patternes, to reuiue your thoughts. When you shall haue seene the continuance, if you shall remember any thing worthy to bee left to our posteritie, you may surmount our example. It shalbe easie for you. I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite and coniure you. GOD cannot bee better knowne and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced of vs in his iudgements and mercies. Those which can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it in a heigher stile, will not disdaine my weake affection. As for others which cannot or will not do any thing but censure and
<pb facs="4"/>
inueighe, I wish them true vnderstanding and a good conscience. In my opinion GOD in this newe age doth raise vp men, who in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places are carefull to note in Iournals and Annales, all that we see worthie to bee reserued for instruction of our successors. I would not set out in collours these plaine Histories, which I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto you. As good stomaks haue no neede of saulces, so strong spirits are content with a simple reading, the which they studie to conuert into quickning substance. The ende of this collection and of the following, shalbe Feare GOD, and keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: this is the dutie of man. For GOD will call euery worke into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bee it good or euill.</p>
