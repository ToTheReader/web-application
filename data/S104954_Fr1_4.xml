   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is most euident to them that are of the houshold of faith, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our most gracious God did by his mightie power create and fashion the whole frames of the heauens aboue, and all things else on earth beneath: so also it is no lesse manifest, but y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> by his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull and vnsearchable prouidence hée doth from time to time, preserue and kéepe, gouern &amp; guide, alter and change, and euery way dispose thereof according to his owne good will and pleasure, and as it séemeth best to himselfe for the glory of his blessed name, and the good of his chosen children: deare to him in Christ Iesus, to whom therfore be praise &amp; glory now and euermore, Amen. These things (I say) are most apparant vnto men: And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the bright eye of his Almightie maiesty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pearcing into our hearts, and sounding déeply the vnséene secrets of mens deceitfull thoughts, doth by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine wisedome sée and perceiue, that many there bee who haue their continuall conuersation among his children, and do sometimes sucke the fatte of the earth more plentifully then they doo, who yet lyke vnto bruite beastes, destitute of reasonable soules, can goe no further in contemplation of spirituall matters then their bodily sences, common vnto beastes, which doe leade and direct them: And therefore these carnall men (as the Apostle tearmeth them) haue as he saith, no taste nor sence, of diuine matters, nor any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of those things that do appertaine vnto God: yea there bee some of them so farre from hauing any reuerent estimation and religious féeling of his gratious maiestie,
<pb facs="4"/>
and especially from acknowledging of his fatherly goodnes and watchful prouidence, sustaining thē and theirs in their dayly necessitie of life and liuing, as that vnto themselues, and in their owne hearts they saye plainlye (and that the Lorde himselfe doth knowe) that there is no God at all.</p>
   <p>This damnable impietie, although it doo deserue, as a most blasphemous contempt of the sacred deitie, to be no waies tollerated, but to be most sharply censured, and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously punished, either with the fearefull fier that fell vpon <hi>Sodom,</hi> or the suddayne gaping of the ground that swalowed vp <hi>Corah,</hi> or the swarming lice &amp; vermin which did féede vpon the flesh of that presumptuous <hi>Herod,</hi> and deuoured his loathsome carkesse aliue, yet such is the great patience and long suffering of the Lorde, as that hée doth vouchsafe to forbeare, to execute his sharpe iustice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same for a time, and in the meane while (as one pittying this naturall blindnesse) doth most bountifully (as it were) put foorth his glorious hand, and therein doth holde out such lampes of light as maye clearely shine vnto vs, and be (as the starre to the wisemen was at Christ his byrth) sufficient guides to leade vs out of this grosse darknesse of error and ignorance, and bring vs to finde him where he is, if we applye our selues as they did to followe the course and footing of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same going before vs, euen here vppon the earth: For séeing we be thus hardly tyed vnto our outward sences, and so strongly pressed down with the heauy sway therof, as that we cannot passe higher then the reache of them: and so resting thereupon, become altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnapt to mount a loft, and ascend by fayth to discerne him sitting aboue in the height of the heauens, in his inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible maiestie, he doth not yet leaue vs héere, and forsake vs so: but to the intent our dead and benummed conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might euen by these our naturall sences be sufficiently conuinced in this point, and further our humaine dulnesse (if it may be) stirred vp, to haue some more liuely féeling, forcible perceyuerance, and effectuall consideration of that
<pb facs="4"/>
supreme essence, who is God all sufficient, vnto all, and in whom we liue, moue, and haue our béeing, he doth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vouchsafe, to discend in some sorte vnto vs, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth héere vpon earth, vnto our eies a sencible testimony of his most certaine béeing, and of his mightie power dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable by his straunge workes, daily doone in our sight, farre aboue the common course of nature, and beyond the pollicie and strength of man: And to the intent we maye vnderstand so much of them, he doth in doing them, cal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by his prophet, willing vs to looke vpon them, and to cōsider them reuerently, while he saith, <hi>Come and behold the workes of God, for he is terrible in his dooings toward the sonnes of men:</hi> For if they were in déede well wayed as they ought to be, &amp; duly considered one with an other: the order and course of them one way, and the varyetie and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of them an other way, is such, as may easily induce and perswade vs to know and beléeue, cofesse and say, very<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is a God that ruleth the earth: And among sundry other his workes that may be of this force, he commendeth vnto vs in place where some especially, namely these (that as the prophet saith,) <hi>One while he turneth running riuers into a wildernesse, and the springs of waters into dry groūd, and conuerteth fruitful land into barrainnesse, for the sinnes of them that do dwell thereon. An other while he turneth the wildernesse into pooles of water: And a dry land into water springs.</hi> Whereto we may adde, that sometime hée hurleth downe hilles, and maketh them to become lowe vallies, and withall exalteth the lowe vallies, and maketh them to become high hilles: Which extraordinary effects when they come to passe, they are not to be altogither neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, nor attributed, as the maner of some is to doo, vnto blind chaūce, casualtie, and fortune, or else to the only force of naturall causes measurable by philosophicall reason: but as it appeareth by the holy prophet, they are to be estéemed as matters of especiall marke, and woorthie to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as héedefull d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="5"/>
idlely therein, but tending vnto some especial end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: and chiefely this, that men beholding and séeing the same, should therupon take occasion as it appeareth by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> with trembling and feare to thinke vpon that mightie maiestie, who is the first cause and causer thereof, and then to reuerence his holinesse, who reigning triumphantly in heauen aboue, doth yet by these his workes on earth, shew himselfe terrible vnto the sonnes of men, and thereby cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them to remēber him perforce, that so one good thought in them, may as fier encreasing fier, beget an other, before all be quite quenched. This then (as it séemeth) being the purpose and counsaile of the holy Ghost, by such his workes to stirre vp in vs a more strong and fruitfull impression of the great deitie▪ we néede not now trauaile farre to séeke out some presidents thereof, in straunge countries for the satisfying of our selues by the testimony of our owne eyes: for loe, the Lord doth now at this instant in some sort pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the same vnto vs at home in our own natiue country, and that in diuerse places by common report, but especially in one place more aboundantly then els where, as may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appeare by this discourse insuing, faithfully sette downe by them who are very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
