   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, is <hi>Adam</hi> our Father dead, and shall not wee his Children mourne? can we behold his Tragedie, and not see our owne miserie? his loynes did beget corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our sinnes bring forth affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Who is there but hath trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed? who then but ought to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected? True it is, that most profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the rod that brings vs vnto God. For the flouds of affliction, and the trying fire of aduersitie, are to no other end sent from God vnto his children, then by the one to wash their vncleannesse, and by the other
<pb facs="5"/>to purge their drosse, whereby they might be made as pure and perfect Gold, fit for the heauenly temple of the Lord.</p>
   <p>Difference there is, betweene pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and affliction: by the one God in his wrath rooteth out for to destroy, but by the other he correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his loue for to restore: the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares seruice doubled vpon <hi>Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob</hi> was to make him rich; but the seauen yeares famine sent vpon Egipt was to make them poore. <hi>Iosephs</hi> imprisonment was for his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Bakers for his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Daniels</hi> casting into the Den was for his glory, but the throwing in of his accusers was for their shame: Christ his crosse was <hi>Pauls</hi> crowne, but a stumbling blocke to <hi>Iudas</hi> to throw him downe: murmure brings misery, but patience felicity.</p>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <p>Wherfore thy afflicted friend (most Christian Reader) doth counsel thee to pray in thy aduersity, &amp; thou shalt be comforted, to beleeue, and thou shalt obtaine, and to performe thy <hi>Vowes</hi> which thou hast made vnto the Lord thy God: the which lest thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest forget, and bring a punishment vpon thee, I here present them vnto thee, being as it were the copie of the couenants which thou hast made and sealed vp in thy baptisme vnto God. The which that thou mayest truely keepe and meditate vpon all the daies of thy life, God Almightie graunt for his glorie and thy comfort, to whose grace and euerlasting mercie I heartely commend thee.</p>
