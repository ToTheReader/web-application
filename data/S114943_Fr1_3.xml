   <p>THe sacred Scripture (howbeit alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether eschewing,<note place="margin">

            </gap>.</p>
      </note> I say not (according to the received de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition) that Rhetorick is the art of pleading well, howbeit I was about to define it the art of Oratory, which is equivalent with the former: but I consider, that to an Oratour (besides Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick) Logick and Grammar essentially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. For together with the cooking, that is, the dressing and serving up of an oration, wherein Rhetorick consisteth, an Oratour must have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and method from Logick; puritie of constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and words accustomed from Grammar; or
<pb facs="4"/>
he cannot be perfect. Indeed it is very rare to finde a man skilfull in Rhetorick, who is not so in Logick and Grammar; yet I have read some sermon-books stuft with Tropes and Figures, which doubtlesse with a good deliverie would please, yet were very barren of solid matter. Now because these arts commonly met in a professed Oratour, those that formerly wrote Rhetoricks,<note place="margin">
         <p>Common places to help inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
         <p>
            <hi>Qui figuras grammaticas Rhetoricâ tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt, distincta <gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtium prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta confun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt.</hi> Dict.</p>
      </note> put in the Topicks of Logick and Figures of Grammar, as essentiall parts of Rhetorick. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must the learner, in any pleasing passages of words, diligently consider to which of these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall arts every vertue in them is to be ascribed. For whose help herein, if this work take, I will annex in future editions an Appendix of all grammaticall figures.</p>
   <p>Again, I say not, the parts of Rhetorick are Elocution and Pronunciation; for both these are but utterance, and neither implie the gesture: as for that their common acceptation is equivalent with the terms I give, this were tolerable in case of necessity, not where more significant may be had.</p>
   <p>Secondly, I presume, I need not excuse giving of English names, having put the known names in the Margent, and used them in my Comment: as for changing those names, good reason. For Tropes and Figures were distinguished by names that had no difference,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Metaphora &amp; Tropus idem sunt apud Aristot.</hi>
      </note> as Metonymia and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphora
<pb facs="4"/>
are both Translation, which is a name generall enough for all the Tropes: neither can I think it but preposterous, to speak of affections of Tropes before the Tropes themselves; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they did, that the examples wherein affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were, might be more fully apprehended, though I suppose so much at once would rather puzzle the learner.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, I thought it strange, that Rhetorici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans should be fain to define Metonymia and Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>echdoche, as Plato did <hi>a man,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Homo est ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal bipes abs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que pennis, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis unguibus.</hi> Substitution is a proper name unto them both; neither can any name be given to Substitution, which will not as well serve for Compreh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>nsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> by couching the particulars: nor yet do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>h their definition of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymie directly teach Elliptick Substitution, nor of the other comprehend the putting of one kinde for an other; yet indeed I found it very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to distinguish them. The truth is, that these two are but one Trope; and but for avoiding cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of singularitie, I would have made them one, as I have annexed them in regard of their affinitie.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, whereas I have made Metonymie twofold, Perfect and Elliptick, I say boldly, that nothing in all Rhetorick doth more puzzle scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, then not being made acquainted with this difference of Metonymicall examples, how that in some, a borrowed word supplying the place of a proper, we do no more but change again, that is, cast away the borrowed word and assume the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and they are resolved: But now again some
<pb facs="5"/>
examples will not suffer a change of the tropicall word for another, but must be resolved by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of some word, containing the Cause, Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, Subject, or Adjunct in a generall term. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in this speech, <hi>That rock was CHRIST:</hi> They say truely, In the word <hi>CHRIST</hi> is a Metonymie of the Subject for the Adjunct. Well, then say I, Resolve this Trope, put out the word <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and render the Adjunct, for which it is put, <hi>That rock was</hi>—what? If they say, <hi>CHRIST</hi> is put for the signe, then I should say, <hi>That rock was the signe.</hi> But this resolution you see is defective: therefore I must lay both together, the generall term <hi>SIGNE</hi> and <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and say thus, <hi>That rock was the signe of Christ.</hi> Now in this example, <hi>The Pope spurns Emperours KINGDOMES off their heads,</hi> I need not fetch in the generall term to resolve it by <hi>spurns the SIGNE of their KINGDOMES,</hi> &amp;c. but change for the adjunct it self, which is ready and compleat, <hi>Spurns Emperours CROVVNS off their heads.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Fifthly, I averre that I have truely referred Pronominations to Metaphors, for they all carry the force of comparison. Instance, I call an Arch-traitour, a <hi>IUDAS</hi>: Now say Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, This is by a Synechdoche: for here is <hi>Iudas,</hi> a particular word, put for the generall, <hi>TRAI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOUR.</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
How unlawfull this predication is, and how insufficient the resolution, any scholar will discern; For Iudas by a Synechdoche cannot sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie an Arch-traitour, but simply a Traitour. Now make it a Metaphor, and I have the full meaning. But I will give a more usefull answer: I say therefore, that if this be a Synechdoche, we need no Metaphor; for I can, by as fair a sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance as this, reduce every Metaphor to a Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>echdoche or Metonymie. Instance, Luk. 23. 43. <hi>To day shalt thou be with me in PARADISE</hi> Shall I say this is a Synechdoche,<note place="margin">

            </gap> intricate, before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

            </gap>e hath compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it with the Tract.</p>
      </note> Rhetorician<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> have been deceived by a relation Metaphoricall in stead of reall. For instance, They <hi>PRICK UP THEIR EARES:</hi> Let us <hi>BREAK THEIR BONDS ASUNDER.</hi> In these examples, would Rhetoricians say, are Metonymies of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct. For, <hi>PRICKING UP THE EARES</hi> is a signe of <hi>HEARKENING; BONDS,</hi> an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct to <hi>AUTHORITIE</hi>: But say I, <hi>Pricking up the eares,</hi> is a signe of <hi>hearkening</hi> in beasts. So God hath no <hi>CORDS,</hi> but comparatively; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these are Metaphors.</p>
   <p>Sixthly, I say also, that those examples which I have referred to an Ironie in the latter end of the chapter, are truely referred. And either an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronie must be made so large (as it well may) to comprehend them, or we must invent another Trope. Synechdoches they cannot be (though some make them so) for they have no relation.</p>
   <p>Seventhly, I averre also, that Hyperbole and Tapinosis are as flatly different as the names I give them, although the <note n="*" place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>dern or late Writers. <hi>Nonnulli Rhetores, &amp;c.</hi> Keck. lib. <hi>2.</hi> pag. <hi>17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>.</hi>
      </note> Neotericks make them one. But saith Keckerman, <hi>Some Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians call Tapinosis Hyperbole in defect, but it is better to distinguish them.</hi> What? when I call a <hi>MEER FOOL</hi> a <hi>SHALLOW FEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOVV;</hi> a <hi>VVICKEDNES,</hi> an <hi>ERROUR;</hi> when I say that is <hi>WARM,</hi> that shrewdly <hi>BURNS,</hi> &amp;c. do I hyperbolize? do I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach,
<pb facs="6"/>
and speak beyond my compasse? Moreover, they were too short in not observing that these Affections were often found without being in other Tropes: and so where they found speeches that were meerly hyperbolicall or tapinosicall, they would referre them to some Trope, though without reason. For this speech, <hi>I made my bed to SVVIMME,</hi> Dietericus takes for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor: but I pray you where is the comparison? For put case his bed were born up with waters, it were a plain speech; which being impossible, what is it else, but a notable Hyperbole?</p>
   <p>Eighthly, I dare professe, that whatsoever Rhetoricall excellencie is or can be in words, is comprised in the Tropes and Figures which I have set down. I have deliberatively read the most eloquent books, besides divers Rhetoricks; yet all the commendablenesse of words I could pick out, would not yeeld a new Figure.<note place="margin">As <hi>Geminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication &amp;c.</hi> come into <hi>Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi>: so <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

But some examples I have, which they never paralel'd, and some things their Rhetoricks touch not. It had been easie to have made my book confused and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with prolixitie, to have shewed much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and little wit, and needlesly to have weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perplext my reader. If it be objected, that specially in those figures of Repetition, Variation, Allusion, there are various examples, which

might have had severall names: I answer, if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry phrase, whereunto I could have given a proper term to expresse the form thereof, should have been a Figure,<note place="margin">

   <p>And why should not we contract and refine late writers, as they did the former? I have given ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall terms whereto all kinde of pleasing speech may be reduced, so that I know no reader, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he meets with whole heaps of Figures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, shall finde any thing but the spice or composition of what I have mentioned.</p>
   <p>Ninthly, whereas Rhetoricians give divers rules about delivery, for the turning of the eye, carriage of the hand, setting of the countenance, framing of the voice, &amp;c. I dare say, they are needlesse, insufficient, absurd: for this varies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a multitude of circumstances, person, subject, place; and these particulars are also vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Onely I have mentioned the Emphasis; and truely, if mine observation fail me not, look what facultie a man hath in giving a gracefull Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis,
<pb facs="7"/>
in like degree he hath the gift of the whole delivery.</p>
   <p>Lastly, I expose my Treatise to the view and censure of the learned, as I have been bold in some things to censure other mens. Whoso will, may examine the matter; and whoso can, may undertake the patronage: although I have imputed faultinesse to theirs, I do not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant there can be none in mine own. I have spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to mention the worst I found, and think it might be judged pride and envy in me to reckon up the contradictions, curiosities, coincidencies, impertinencies, which are among them. I arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate nothing to my self in detecting or amending them. I hold it a duty of this age and nation,<note place="margin">As <hi>Mr. Harris</hi> taught in that eloquent sermon of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

For what I have altered, I think I could pick my apologie out of severall authours, whom I found to be hammering upon those very matters, though (not finding a way out) they were fain to come again into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rode. Indeed I had, besides the advice of my learned friends, the joynt assistance of my brother; and that candle, which we have lighted, we set up to others. Sure I am (Reader) that this facil art hath been found by good wits so imperfectly discovered, that some things were very intricate, some things very frivolous.
