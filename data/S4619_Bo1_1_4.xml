   <head>AN EXHORTATION of a ciuile life, vnto Monsieur de L.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am very glad that there is some-thing passed my hand which liketh you: And I neuer thinke my watchings better besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, then when as they content such as with their friendship honor me, and vnto whome I haue vowed my seruice as I haue done to you. Howbeit, if the Epistle of <hi>Saint Basile</hi> which I haue put forth into French, haue done you any pleasure, it is not to me that you should shew the fauour: not vnto me, I say, who haue rather empared then amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the worke of so great a Clarke, in making it to change the toong, and to speake out french language. Truly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all the Fathers of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, there is not one amongst them all that I better like of, then I like of him. Euery man hath his liking, and I will
<pb n="113" facs="69"/> leaue other men to the commending of that which they best like of: but as for mine owne part, I will rather vse this man which pleaseth me, for this is the man that I chiefeliest make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt of. Neuerthelesse, there is one thing in your letter which you wrote vnto me that misliketh me, and that is this, You write, that the often reading of this Epistle, which you say, you read ouer as it were euery day, hath brought you into a desier to get you into some Monasterie, and there to passe the rest of your dayes, that you might turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your eyes from beholding the great miseries which this miserable ciuill warre hath hatched and brought foorth, and wholy conuert your mind and thoughts vnto the honor and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God. This purpose of yours, I must needs confesse, proceedeth from a most godly hart, and a very good forecasting meane to bring vnto you in your owne particular cause, some quietnes of mind, and peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which I suppose to be one of the greatest benefits which wee can any way locke for. But it would sore grieue me to be bereaued of so sweete and
<pb n="114" facs="70"/> deere companie, and so great hurt vnto the common weale. You should (beleeue me) in my poore opinion, doo maruellous wrong both vnto your countrey, and to your friends: and euery man is to seeke his owne benefit, but yet so, as that it be not to the hurt of another. For, wee are not borne heere in this world for our selues: and besides, we are but the lesser part of the whole, and therefore binde and tye your selfe vnto the great and principall parts thereof, with most straight bonds, which allow vs not to withdrawe our selues in this dangerous sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, without violating and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king both the bonds of charitie, and also of godlynesse. And yet for all this, I would not haue you thinke, that I will gaynesay, or yet dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the commendation which <hi>Saint Basile,</hi> and so many auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and my selfe with them, haue geuen vnto solitarie life: for I great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend it, yea, and I loue it, it may be too well. But I wish you did loue it as they doo, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the selfe-same considerations,
<pb n="115" facs="70"/> and not for any discouragement, the rather to auoyde the thwart and tedious dealings of a ciuile life, then for to followe the pleasure that is in contemplation. Followe (if you please) the examples of the auncient Fathers, but followe them with that wisedome and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they doo. Beleeue mee if you will, it is now no time for their example of life, to call such men as you are, vnto solitarie life. For monasticall life came not in, in a troublesome time, ne yet for such men, as whose wisedome and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie was necessarie vnto the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the weale publicke. Neyther doo wee see, that in the fyrst beginning of the Christian Church, although it was euerie manner of way, and with all sorts of troubles and afflictions tossed and turmoyled, that the Fathers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe themselues into the deserts and solitarie places, there to serue God quietlie. But their liues beeing full of actions, and those publicke also, hindered them to establish the Churches, to discipline the people,
<pb n="116" facs="71"/> to conserue the peace and vnion of cities and prouinces, and to serue for examples of modestie and temperance vnto the whole world. But when as the Christians had full libertie and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and that the Emperours and chiefe Gouernors had embraced the Religion, and kept the same vnder the couert of their armes and power, and fauored such as made profession ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the peace then of it being establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and the common weale being able as it were to be maintained of it selfe, vpon the good and sure founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which so many wise and holie personages had before layd, it was permitted vnto great learned men to enioy the sweetnesse of solitarie life. But of what age were they when they thus did? Forsooth it was euen then, when they had spent the strength of their yong yeares in the gouernment of the ciuile life, and in worldly affaires amongst men. And about this age, and after this manner, did <hi>Saint Basile,</hi> and <hi>Saint Ierome</hi> withdrawe them selues. And yet notwithstanding when as the necessitie of the common state requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their ayd, some of them were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="117" facs="71"/> away, and enforced to enter againe into their former charge for the good of the common weale. And othersome of them remained all their liues long in solitary life, and it was by reason they were not t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ght competent and necessary me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> about those affayres which then were eminent. And to say truly, what man is able to abide to see, during the tempest (when as the bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes rowle most hye, the sea fometh most furiously, the winds blow most outragiously) the most expert pylots leaue the helme vnto passengers, to fall to their sleepe? For, so long as it is calme, euery man may guide the st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rne, for then, skill is to small pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and ignorance doth no great hurt. But so long as the storme conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth, the direction and wisedome of him that gouerneth is seene, vppon whose direction and wisedome alone hangeth the liues of all those that are embarked with him. Now, your studie, age, and experience, haue brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you great sufficiencie, and ripenesse of counsell, and your wisedome, and sinceritie, haue made you in such sort affect the cōmon weale of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="118" facs="72"/> as in deed you ought, so that you haue thereby gotten your selfe such credit amongst your naturall countrey-men, as the time yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and affoordeth for honest men to haue. For, with what pretence can you any way abandon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of your countrey? It may be, you will say, I am not able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide the outrages which reigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the people, I can not away to see the disorder and confusion where-into all thinges are fallen. Tell me, I beseech you, doth this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the words which I haue heard you oftentimes speake, that our Countrey is in the stead of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, and to this effect it is called <hi>Patria,</hi> by a name, the deriuation whereof, signifieth a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the feminine terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on signifieth a Mother, as conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them both in one word, and signifying <hi>Patrie,</hi> and <hi>Matrie,</hi> both together. Put the case that a Father should waxe mad, and be out of his wits, vppon whome would you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe the care, keeping, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of him? would you not say,
<pb n="119" facs="72"/> vppon the Children? Now, if the Children would excuse them selues, and say, that hee had punished, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuried, and beaten them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not take it vppon them, would you not finde fault with them, and with checks and taunts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to doo that dutie which both nature and charitie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them? Peraduenture you will say, that there are two things which withdrawe you, and they seeme to excuse you for putting too your hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hand, and medling in and with these affayres. And the one is, that it is lost labor, that the pleadings of honest men are vtterlie vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and serue for none other purpose, but to make them to bee enuyed and hated, without brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging any benefite to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale at all. By this, the wound is no whit the more cured, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie hath ouer-much wonne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon reason. For, honest men are no whit bound to trauell for the proffit and commoditie of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, but so farre-foorth as theyr trauell may do good, and that
<pb n="120" facs="73"/> there is thereby some hope of well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For, men must deale in a State, as Phisitions do with their phisicke, for, they must not minister phisicke vnto diseases that are incurable, which bringeth nothing else vnto themselues but shame and dishonor. The other that you tell of, is this, that there are some things which an honest man may not by any meanes possible support, nor dissemble. Well, patience is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous great vertue, and greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming, and necessary for the life of men, and yet she hath her bounders, and the mischiefe groweth sometimes vnto such an head, as that they which both loue and feare God, are no way able to abide it. For answere vnto the first, this I say, that it is a cowardly, idle, and slothfull excuse, grounded ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon our pusillanimitie, then vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon wisedome which it so vaunteth of. For, who is he that can haue any iust occasion to despaire of the good of an Estate or of a Citie, since we see by the course of histories how vncertaine, both their ruine and preseruation is? For, how often haue we seene king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes &amp; cities fall, euen in their most
<pb n="121" facs="73"/> flourishing time, by a suddaine earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and by great winds; and other some, altogether tottering, and almost halfe fallen, maruelously holden vp, raysed, and set vp againe in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of their ruines? For, this power of God, which men foresee not, hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to hang betweene feare and hope, neither was there euer any thing so sure, as that the fall of it was not to be feared, nor any thing so staggering, as that there was not some hope of the staying thereof. And this is without all doubt most true, that if our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lay wholy in our owne hands, we had alreadie bene damned. Howbeit, God fighteth for vs against our selues, and will saue vs whether we will or no. Now, although we were sure to be rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and sawe it neuer so clearely, that it would light vpon vs, as in verie deed we see not so much as one iote there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is it not a part of the dutie of good children and good friends, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o assist those that are incurably sicke, euen vnto death, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ourd them with faire words, whome wee can not possibly heale? You will perhaps say, that you are not able to abide the vnbridled
<pb n="122" facs="74"/> libertie, which some priuate men take vpon them, as the oppression of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and the disorder and confusion wherein we liue. What is it then that you would haue? Would you see all things as they should be, as to see good men in authoritie, ill men supprest by lawes, and Iustice to rule and reigne? Surely, these are worthy wishes of you, and worthie an honest man; howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, the world is not gouerned by wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing and woulding. A man may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully desier good things, but let them be as they may, we must needes beare them. There will be vices ynow in the world, so long as there are men in the world. And this is to heale and ease these disorders whereunto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale and your dutie call you, neither must you bring with you, your eyes alone, but your hands also, to heale your countrey of so grieuous wounds. I right well knowe, that you shall not therein be able to do as you would, nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>her is the mischiefe to be medled withall, but you must do what you can in it, and as the condition of the mischiefe will suffer you. This is an occupation, out of which we choose
<pb n="123" facs="74"/> not the matter, but is geuen vnto vs: for, a good workman, is oftentimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to worke in a rotten peece of wood, and yet for all that he must not geue it ouer, but make the best he can of such an ilfauoured peece of wood. When <hi>Solon</hi> was asked whether he had geuen vnto the <hi>Athenians</hi> the best lawes he could, he answered no, but I haue geuen them the best that they are able to abide. And we must apply remedies according to the strength &amp; nature of the diseased. To be short, we are not warranted in our affaires none otherwise then with our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and hauing done the best we can, because it is to be done, we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of discharged both before God &amp; men. And as for the particular iniuries which we receiue therby, where cā we better bestow our charitie &amp; patience? where shall we exercise that which we learne out of the schoole of Christ, if we can not beare the iniuries &amp; slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people with whome wee liue? yea, when shall we hope that by our patience wee shall appease the popular furies, bring agayne the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious people into their right wits,
<pb n="124" facs="75"/> displace the wicked from their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and set good men in their rooms? It is most certaine, that these diseases are sooner cured by winning of time, then by applying of remedies, it is far better to entertaine them by wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that they empaire not, for in the end, it is length of time that must ripen and heale them. For, the people by experience recouer health, and then they seeke after good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men, and abhorre those whome before they had made much of. They are like vnto pale-coulored maydes, which eate all the worst things that possibly they can get, but they cast them by and by vp againe. For, so soone as they are stirred and moued, they vse for the seruing of their turne the most desperate and most wicked men: but they are no sooner quieted and in a good moode, and that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate boyling heate hath runne ouer, they by and by make no accompt of those villaines, but are the first that will lay hold on them and plague them. And therefore is not the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale greatly benefited, when as good men preseru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> them selues for such a
<pb n="125" facs="75"/> dangerous time, and forsake not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through anger, or despaire, the ship wherein they see the drunken pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers for a time rage and storme? I confesse in deed, that he must needs in such a case runne into a thousand hazards, and suffer a thousand indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. But whosoeuer taketh the paine, to him b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>longeth the merite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and through trauell, glorie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth. But especially amongst vs Christians, who make profession to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and abide by it, and haue enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our selues vnder a Captaine, that layeth before our eyes an hard and tedious warfare, and assigneth vnto vs no crowne, before such time as we haue sustayned many strange afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and innumerable trials and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. He braggeth no whit of his victories, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> yet of his souldiers that haue followed him, otherwise then for their patience. By this only vertue haue they conquered so many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, Kingdomes, and Empires, and were no way glorious, but by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing and bearing of iniuries. How can we then better follow him, then by hazards, opprobries, and iniuries?
<pb n="126" facs="76"/> And in what a more worthie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable occasion can we endure all this, then to serue, for the good and preseruation of our countrey? If loue, which God hath so highly commended vnto vs, may so preuaile with vs, as to hazard our goods and liues for the safetie of our neighbour, what ought we to do for such an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable number of men, and such a number of cities and prouinces, vnto which nature hath conioyned and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed vs by all one lawe, language, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and secret affection, which she hath imprinted in vs, from the which, whosoeuer separateth himselfe, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged of all the nations of the world vnworthie to behold the day light, and to liue and be esteemed amongst men as an vnnaturall and cruell Parricide. Now, God came not into the world to dissolue and adnihilate this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obligation, but contrarywise, more surely to strayne and tye the knot by this loue, which he hath so greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended vnto vs. Euen so we also see, that when we once begin to cut asunder the bond of the common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection vnto our countrey, that all
<pb n="127" facs="76"/> manner not onely of disorders, but of most abhominable crimes and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesses set in foote; and thefts, murders, rapes, extortions, and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, forthwith rule and reigne. Now, what is it in the whole world, which a man can more mislike, more abhorre, kindle his furie more, and more stirre and prouoke him to ruyne, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found people? What shall wee then say? whilest so many labour headlong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ouerthrow both themselues and their countrey, will you, euen you, I say, that haue alwayes had charge, and whose office bindeth you to take paines for the common weale, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne as it were carelesly in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, to see, your selfe being safe, the fire burne your countrey, and reserue your selfe to behold the ashes thereof? What a grief would it be vnto you, not to haue brought the ayde which you might haue done, or at least not to haue made an assay &amp; proofe thereof? Do you not dayly see, that after our friēds are dead, we say euen with sighs, if we had done such a thing, it may be that he had bene aliue? Come therefore, and contribute with vs
<pb n="128" facs="77"/> your wisedome, and resolute coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, that we may saue that which in this world is most deare vnto vs. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare this purpose of yours to liue a solitarie life, and drawe you vnto your rest, euen then when wee shall all at once haue brought the Ship to the hauen, or else being ouercome with that foolish opinion of such as would willingly cast away themselues, be saued with some boord of the wracke. But if we perish therein, death, which way soeuer he may come, shall haue shewed vs no small fauour, in taking vs away from the beholding of so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable a spectacle or sight.</p>
