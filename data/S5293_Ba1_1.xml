   <head>A conclusion of this booke conteyning an exhortation to all estates to prepare themselues to die well, for feare least the vncertaine howre of death should surprise them.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oreouer my brethren &amp; friends it remaines, that this booke be not onely in our hands, but also in our hearts, and if we haue any desire to amend ous liues, let it not be deferred till to morrow; for when to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row shall come, wee will yet referre all to the next day, and so consequently the whole yeare shall passe, yea our whole life.</p>
   <p>If then at this present howre there bee some little good affection in vs, let vs not suffer it to be quenched, let vs not kill that grace which God hath giuen vs; but to the contrary by all meanes which shall be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vs, let vs endeuour our selues in such sort, that from howre to howre it may not onely be confirmed, but also augmented.</p>
   <p>God is mercifull enough and liberall to grant vs our requests, but he will be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunated, not in his owne regard, but ours, for he knoweth how backward we are to pray and call vpon him, and how soone we are weary of it; although we should desire
<pb n="329" facs="175"/>
nothing more in this world, for it is no small thing to speake vnto God. And which ought yet more to moue vs, is, that he doth willingly hearken vnto vs, and neuer puts backe those which come vnto him,</p>
   <p>I speake this, because I see not that by any other better meanes we can preuent confusion, than by prayer. Surely if euer men had need of this aide, we are in great necessity of it, in these last daies, and olde age of the world; for we must not doubt but that Satan now doth set himselfe in armes, perceiuing well that the howre drawes neere, that he shall not be able to doe that which hee hath done heretofore, and that the Sonne of God must be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to all creatures, and that then the perfection ought to come of the blessed and the finishing of their happinesse, of the which hee knoweth well hee hath no part. If then for his part he sets himselfe forth in his strength, it remaines that we should do the like for vs, that wee may be furnished with all celestiall armour, and that we bee not daunted with all his plots and treacheries; for surely the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is in our handes, so that we fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and not with him, as doth almost all the world at this day, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="330" facs="176"/>
that the most part thinke the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for so they haue the name of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and be without reproch before men, who are no better then thēselues, they then thinke themselues very well assured. Others thinke that they shall need but a good sigh, (as they say) at the last howre for to blot out all the rest of their life passed, and presently to transport them into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; but who hath assured them that God will giue them the grace to make that sigh, and to haue a true repentance of their sins, at the howre of their death? Where haue they had pattents and good assurance, that they shall not die a sudden death? Is not that to mocke God openly? If that may serue, verily S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Peter</hi> and S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apostles should haue bene much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to labour and to toyle so much, and to beare so grieuous a Crosse, if it were so easie a matter to enter into the kingdome of heauen; I meane, by the meanes which those Libertines doe pretend.</p>
   <p>Let vs assure our selues that the way is straite which leadeth to saluation, and that there are few that go therein. These words are no lies, but I pray God that we may not experiment the truth of them, to our great paine and griefe. I know well that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="331" facs="176"/>
of our God is incomprehensible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, but it is towards his seruants, it is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards those that feare and reuerence him.</p>
   <p>Besides I know that among the children and seruants of God, there are many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, euen a great imperfection in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and iustice, and which endures till death; but there is a great difference between your life, O worldlings, and the life of the elect of God. The iust man sinneth seuen times a day; but he shall be raised seuen times. Now you continue in your euill, and goe to bed with your sinne as with your friend and companion.</p>
   <p>Men will say an <hi>Aue Marie,</hi> beat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues on the breast, or perhaps will haue some distaste of their sinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But if we neerely looke into all, we shall finde that it is nothing but meere hypocrisie. If our friend or kinsmen dies, if we loose our goods, if wrong or iniury be offered vnto vs, if our good name be taken away, if we be stricken or hurt, behold we are presently in choller, or very extremely sad, our hearts euen closed vp with melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; but if our spirit dies, and if we loose the euerlasting riches by our transgression, we make no account of it, we are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with it, we grieue more for the losse of
<pb n="332" facs="177"/>
this world, which is nothing, then we doe for the losse of God, which is all.</p>
   <p>In seeing all which, cannot such men yet feele their griefe? can they not yet know how much the opinion which they haue of their vertue and prudence is vaine and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous? Can they not see how farre they are from their reckoning? Certainly the world is full of such people that haue no feeling of their sinne, but the prophesies must needs be accomplished, to the end when the Sonne of man shall come, he may finde no faith vpon the earth: Verily this howre commeth on a pace, the signes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are very manifest. But because we should not bee dismaid, seeing such a danger round about vs, let vs be sure that the Lord will bee with vs till the end of the world, prouided that our Lampes be burning, and in steed that the wicked euery day shall be worse and worse, for our parts let vs ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to goe forward in all holinesse and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. I know well, that they will mocke at vs, and at our simplicity, that we shall be cast out of their companies. But we shall be exalted of God, and receiued of the most blessed assembly.</p>
   <p>VVherefore let vs with all patience waite for the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ,
<pb n="333" facs="177"/>
and let vs labour that so we may be found of him without spot, and without reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Surely that day ought to be very feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the wicked, but as for vs we ought so much the rather desire it, knowing for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that there is no cōdemnation for those that are in Iesus Christ; knowing well the great goodnesse and kindnesse of him which is to come, with whom God grant wee may liue for euer and euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
   </p>
   <div type="prayer">
      <head>A Prayer vnto God on the same subiect.</head>
      <p>ALas when shall wee come before the face of God our Father, and when shall we haue a dwelling in his house, and vntill when shall we be in this exile, wherunto by sinne we haue bin regenerate? But how shall the sinner cōsist before this great God? How shall this poore flesh be able to go vp into this heauenly &amp; euerlasting Paradise? O how vncertaine should our hope be if we had not the true promises of our God, &amp; how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable should we be, if we did relie vpon our selues? But O great God, thou wilt that all things be possible to beleeuers, for the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers do trust only thy promise, &amp; in thy mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy. Do not then O Lord regard so many sins which are in vs. Remember rather that we are thy creatures, &amp; the worke of thy hands.
<pb n="334" facs="178"/>
VVe are vnworthy to be called thy children, but it pleaseth thee to be our Father; It was thy will that thy Sonne Iesus should come downe to vs here beneath, to make that we should go vp to thee. We feare not death O Lord; for thou hast promised to bee with vs; death lost her strength, when thy deere Sonne died, so that when our bodies shall be knawne with wormes in the sepulcher, our soules shall reioyce in heauen with the holy Angels. We desire then to die to see thy amiable and glorious face, to liue with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ out head. O our God open vs then the gates of thy Kingdome. Cause vs to heare that sweet speech which was spoken to the poore theefe vpon the crosse, which is, This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise. Alas Lord we are vnworthy of it; but thy mercy and thy promises do giue vs assurance. Giue vs also O heauenly Father, the strength to perseuer, and desire the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall and glorious life to come, which thou hast purchased for vs, through thy Sonne Iesus Christ, to whom with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the holy Ghost, be all honour, praise and glory for euermore. So be it.</p>
