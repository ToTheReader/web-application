   <head>TO THE RIGHT Honourable, GEORGE, Marquis of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Viscount <hi>Villiers,</hi> Baron of <hi>Waddon,</hi> Master of his Maiesties Horse, and one of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his Highnesse Royall Bed-chamber, Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, and of his most Honourable Priuy Councell.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is like, that in the divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating of these Papers, I shall meete
<pb facs="4"/> with a double censure: One, in that I doe so suddainely follow two such worthy Lights,<note place="margin">Episc. Roffens. &amp; Cestrens.</note> as haue lately gone before me in this subiect. Another, in that J presume to present the same to One so eminent.</p>
   <p>But for answer to the former; First, the principall of my taske is matter positiue, and the controuersie about Kneeling, is handled but <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiter,</hi> and <hi>obiter;</hi> yet I hope sufficiently to giue satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a peaceable spirit. And that which may seeme my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice, I esteeme my aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
<pb facs="4"/> For had I gone before them, my lot might haue beene like the Day-starre, which is obscured by the succeeding Sunne; whereas a small Starre shines in the Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
   <p>Againe, (that J may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my Metaphor) Hee that made the two greater Lights, made also the Stars,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.16.</note> and the Starres haue their influences, yea,<note place="margin">Iob 38.31.</note> the Starres fought against <hi>Sisera.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iudg. 5.20.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Had I no other Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, I hold it fit to shew my conformitie, and therein my
<pb facs="5"/> dutie to the Church, and the blessed nursing Father thereof. For as I would not bee like violent <hi>Euripus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">P. Mela. lib. <hi>2.</hi>
      </note> which is ready to tosse ouer all that comes into it; so would I not be like the Riuer <hi>Arar,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Caesar Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>. de bel. Gal. lib. <hi>1.</hi>
      </note> whose current is so slow, that a quicke eye cannot discerne which way it runnes.</p>
   <p>Neither is my presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in this my Dedication, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without excuse. For as the ancient interest I once had in the fauour of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Knight, your Lordships Father, my much-honoured Friend, some-what imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
<pb facs="5"/> mee: So, the interest that the Church hath in your Honour, and the neede shee hath of your assistance, for procuring her peace and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, doeth very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and encourage me in this my enterprise.</p>
   <p>If a Reuerend Bishop,<note place="margin">Episcop. Cestren.</note> who hath in some sort power co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actiue, did lately craue it at your Lordships hands: much more may J, who haue onely meanes perswasiue:<note place="margin">Persuadere quis aliquid potest inuito? Pacian. Epist. ad Sympron. Biblio. patr.</note> For <hi>who can perswade him that will not be perswaded,</hi> saith <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianus?</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <p>The GOD of Heauen, who hath made you gracious with a King of admirable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, multiply his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings vpon your Honour, that you may increase in grace and fauour with God and man.</p>
