   <head>A breefe waie how Ministers should order their studious exercises for to benefit themselues and their flocks, and also what good vse they may haue by travelling in the Common places of the Scripture, and in such bookes as are alreadie gathered to this purpose.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese things doo I write to the Ministers and Curates of the seuerall congregations, but speciallie to them, which hitherto haue not obserued anie conuenient order or method in their studies, wherby they might be able to edifie the Church, and discharge their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in so excellent and honourable a vocation. And first I exhort them, that they will giue themselues to a continuall and earnest reading and studie of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie scriptures, which is able to make them wise vnto saluation; and is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to teach, to improoue, to correct, and to instruct in righteousnesse. For vnlesse they haue the scriptures verie familiar vnto them, they will sticke at manie things; and while they haue not what to saie, they will either speake that, which rashlie commeth into their owne mind, or else what other men haue inuented. And they which giue themselues to this studie, it shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that they haue the knowledge of the toongs, especiallie of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue and Greeke; wherein the holie books of the scriptures were first writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Prophets and Apostles: for he that dependeth altogither of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, seeth with other mens eies, and speaketh in another mans mouth. Further, it is necessarie that a Minister be well acquainted with the histories and examples, not onlie of the holie scripture of the old and new testament, but also of all prophane writers: and that he be perfect in the histories and chronicles of his owne countrie, that he may shew vnto his hearers what in old time was either profitable or hurtfull to their ancestors. Besides this, to the intent he may reape some fruit of his studie and labor, two things aboue other are necessarie.</p>
   <p>First, that he conceiue a certeine summe of doctrine, which he must drawe togither as it were into one bodie, and distinguish the same againe into their members or common places; that while he teacheth, he may knowe vnto what places or cheefe heads the places of the scripture, which he will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret to the Church ought to be referred. The other thing is, that he knowe what waie of teaching to take for the commodious and profitable shewing
<pb facs="11"/> to the people that, which with much studie he hath learned: so as it may serue for the instruction, edification, and comfort of the hearers. An example of the first kind is the ten Commandements, which afterward both Moses and Christ himselfe drew into a shorter summe on this wise; <hi>Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy hart, with all thy mind, and with all thy cogitation, and thy neighbour as thy selfe.</hi> So as vnder this double loue, to wit, of God and our neighbour, Christ comprehendeth all the whole doctrine of religion and christian life. Howbeit, if ye looke more neerelie into the matter, both the loues are verie largelie extended: for the loue of God stretcheth vnto his seruice, as well inward as outward; and togither with faith it comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the obedience, which we owe vnto him: likewise, the loue of our neighbour is diuided into infinite kinds, according to the diuersitie of men with whom we deale. And in like maner did the Apostles, as <hi>Jraeneus</hi> testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, comprise in those few articles of the Creed the summe of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: which articles in their sermons and writings they did more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie expound.</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse, bicause such expositions are not taught in the holie scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one certeine place or continued order, so as they can be perceiued of euerie one, except he be a verie attentiue reader, it is altogither necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that they, which shall profit the Church, doo knowe not onlie the summe in generall of the heauenlie doctrine, but that they can distinguish it into parts and kinds, and distribute the same into their parts and places; both that they may vnderstand how largelie they extend, and what may be godlie and soundlie said as touching each one of them. Thus haue manie and godlie learned men of old, but especiallie of our time doone. And to this purpose are these Common places of our famous Diuine D. <hi>Martyr Vermilius,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which forme euerie learned and diligent man may gather to serue his owne vse, take out of such store-houses abundance of treasure when he shall instruct the people. And they that haue once promised so to doo, doo with greater diligence read ouer and studie both the holie &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane books, and doo more diligentlie weigh whither euerie thing must be referred.</p>
   <p>And bicause there be manie things found in the writings of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, which they by the common sense and lawes of nature did teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning maners and the studie of vertue: and that in the histories of strange nations there be store of all kind of examples, whereof commeth a singular vse in preaching; whether ye will reprooue the licentious life of our time, or exhort your hearers vnto vertue, you shall picke out of them things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for your Common places.</p>
   <p>But now it shall be necessarie for a Diuine, not onelie to haue matter of doctrine gathered abundantlie as well out of the holie scriptures, as out of the prophane writings; but to be also furnished with the abilitie of teaching, that he may knowe how to frame sermons rightlie, and aptlie to dispose the <pb facs="11"/> matter of them, which he hath gathered, and to bring in due place all sorts of arguments, with the testimonies and examples of others, and to speake those things in a right order, which shall be necessarie for the hearers to knowe. And herein shall the Minister obserue cheeflie two things: one, that he throughlie knowe the true and naturall sense of that place of scripture, which he hath purposed to expound: secondlie, that he applie the same to the capacitie and instruction of the hearers, according to the condition of the time and place. As touching the first; it shall be needfull aboue all things to knowe the argument and state of all that holie booke, from whence that place is taken; least by neglecting this, he labour without fruit, and speake those things, which neuer perhaps the author therof ment. As touching the other point, it shall be requisite to looke into our times also, and into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours and maners of our men; but especiallie to marke with all diligence the present state or condition of the Church which they serue, and when they preach, to warne diligentlie those that heare them, that those things, which the Prophets and Apostles spake in old time to the men of their age, doo verie fitlie agree with vs and our time. For this maketh them to be verie attentiue, and taketh awaie wearinesse, which oftentimes is woont to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade them, when they thinke, that whatsoeuer was spoken or written in old time, perteineth nothing vnto them, nor vnto these daies of ours. And this maner of application ought to be such, as the Apostle teacheth; that <hi>VVhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is said, should serue vnto edification of the Church.</hi> VVhich rule we shall then followe, if all things be applied to the comfort and instruction of the hearers.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, the present state, or some sudden chance otherwhile requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that they shall digresse into some common place: howbeit, this must be so doone, that it appeere they doo it not without a speciall cause. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, least it should be thought that they altogither go from the matter, which they tooke vpon them to handle, and to breake off rashlie from that which they purposed to speake, not without mistrust of some particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, the place of scripture which they haue in hand must be applied, as much as is possible, to the argument of their digression; and the words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in like maner must be repeated and vrged: and finallie, their speech must handsomlie returne from whence it digressed; that the hearers may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue nothing is spoken altogither from the state or argument of the place, which they handle. In like maner that digression must not be ouer-long and tedious, least both they forget the originall points and diuisions of the text, and also be induced thereby to mislike of the learning and teaching of their Minister.</p>
   <p>And as concerning the maner of speaking or vtterance, which also must be well considered of, that is best to be liked, which is spoken with a voice neither too high nor too lowe; neither with bitter taunting, nor with too much cockering; neither with one long continued tune, nor yet with anie <pb facs="12"/> rash raising or letting fall the voice; neither with ouer-dulnesse of vttering, nor yet with words drowned by hastie speaking. Finallie, it must be such, as is neither affected, nor more loftie than is conuenient, neither yet ouer-home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or vile. For since the greater part of the congregation is vnlearned, whatsoeuer carrieth a shew of a close cunning, and no vulgar maner of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, seemeth vnto these obscure and troublesome: and for this cause the hearing is tedious to them, and they reape but small fruit of that, which they vnderstand not. Againe, least the doctrine should be the lesse esteemed by reason of a base maner of speaking, their speech must be somwhat more lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and graue, than that which they familiarlie and commonlie vse, yet so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, that the grauitie thereof be tempered with perspicuitie and plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of vnderstanding. Againe, in admonishing and reproouing, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster must so vse the sharpenesse of the Euangelicall seasoning; that in the meane time he vtterlie absteine from bold railing and taunting, least he be thought rather to speake things of a stomach, or of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate hatred, than to seeke the saluation of them that haue sinned, and so to procure no fruit at all by his doctrine, but rather a contempt of the same, and a despising of his office and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie.</p>
