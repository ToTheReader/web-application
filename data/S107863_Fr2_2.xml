If I did not know by mine own obseruation, that your Lordship was a diligent Obseruer of all your Fathers Vertues (touching which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, you haue a daily Remembrancer) I would exhort you to behold the shadow of them delienated here, by those which much admired him liuing, and shall neuer cease to honour his Memory, and loue those that doe any Honour vnto him. The Lord increase the Honour of your House, and reioyce ouer you to doe you good, vntill hee haue Crowned you with Immortalitie.</p>
