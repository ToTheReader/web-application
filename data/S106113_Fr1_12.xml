   <head>To my approued good friend
M. THOMAS HEYVVOOD.</head>
   <l>OF thee, and thy <hi>Apology</hi> for playes,</l>
   <l>I will not much speake in contempt or praise:</l>
   <l>Yet in these following lines Il'e shew my minde,</l>
   <l>Of Playes, and such as haue 'gainst Playes repin'd.</l>
   <l>A Play's a briefe <hi>Epitome</hi> of time,</l>
   <l>Where man my see his vertue or his crime</l>
   <l>Layd open, either to their vices shame,</l>
   <l>Or to their vertues memorable fame.</l>
   <l>A Play's a true transparant Christall mirror,</l>
   <l>To shew good minds their mirth, the bad their terror:</l>
   <l>Where stabbing, drabbing, dicing, drinking, swearing</l>
   <l>Are all proclaim'd vnto the sight and hearing,</l>
   <l>In vgly shapes of Heauen-abhorrid sinne,</l>
   <l>Where men may see the mire they wallow in.</l>
   <l>And well I know it makes the Diuell rage,</l>
   <l>To see his seruants flouted on a stage.</l>
   <l>A Whore, a Thiefe, a Pander, or a Bawd,</l>
   <l>A Broker, or a slaue that liues by fraud:</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="8"/>
An Vsurer, whose soule is in his chest,</l>
   <l>Vntill in hell it comes to restlesse rest.</l>
   <l>A Fly-blowne gull, that faine would be a Gallant,</l>
   <l>A Raggamuffin that hath spent his Tallant:</l>
   <l>A selfe-wise foole, that sees his wits out-stript,</l>
   <l>Or any vice that feeles it selfe but nipt,</l>
   <l>Either in Tragedy, or Comedy,</l>
   <l>In Morall, Pastorall, or History:</l>
   <l>But straight the poyson of their enuious tongues,</l>
   <l>Breakes out in vollyes of Calumnious wronges.</l>
   <l>And then a Tinker, or a Dray-man sweares,</l>
   <l>I would the house were fir'd about their eares.</l>
   <l>Thus when a play nips Sathan by the nose,</l>
   <l>Streight all his vassails are the Actors foes.</l>
   <l>But feare not man, let enuy swell and burst,</l>
   <l>Proceed, and bid the Diuell do his worst.</l>
   <l>For Playes are good or bad, as they are vs'd,</l>
   <l>And best inuentions often are abus'd.</l>

      <hi>Yours euer,</hi>
IOHN TAYLOR.</signed>
