   <p>
      <hi>CHristian Reader,</hi> I heere present vnto thy view, and
prostrate to thy Censure, a compendious Summary of
those scattered Euidences; a concise Catalogue of those emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Writers, and illustrious Witnesses of our Mother
Church, since the beginning of her Reformation to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant;
who haue positiuely maintained, and punctually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
those 7. <hi>Anti-Arminian Theses,</hi> which I heere
prooue: but diametrally oppugned, yea constantly condemned
their 7. opposite erronious Arminian Tenents which I here
disprooue, to be, the ancient, established, and resolued Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of our English Church. The multitude of my other
distractions, and ineuitable interruptions, together with the
narrow scantling of those few Winter dayes, I had for to
compose it in, haue denyed it that exact mature Summer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which others may expect, my selfe desire. Accept
it therefore as a Winter fruit, impatient of a tedious Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ripening, which might perchance adde much vnto its
fulnesse, but derogate from its seasonablenesse. The Wise
man hath informed:<note n="a" place="margin">Eccl. 3. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>

      <hi>That to euery thing there is a
season, and a time to euery purpose vnder heauen: and
that euery thing is beautifull,</hi> (yea onely beautifull and
vsefull) <hi>in its time.</hi> I haue therefore chosen to thrust out
this <hi>Antithesis</hi> more incompleat and mutilated then I did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
hoping that its seasonable and timely birth (if the
vnexpected and vnhappy dissolution of our present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath not made it now abortiue, or vnseasonable) shall
excuse, will salue its hasty, its immature Natiuity. This
<pb facs="26"/>
Treatise consists of two parts; the one, the Records, the
Acts, and Monuments of our Church; the other, the Names
and Testimonies of our Writers.</p>
   <p>The speciall and more publike Records and Euidences of
our Church which tend vnto our purpose, I haue heere at
large recited: The Authors and Authorities, which are
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

quotation of their workes, their Chapters, Pages, and those
Editions which I fellow, (which I thought good to specifie,
for the greater certainety and more speedy search: Their
words, their copious passages, and discourses touching our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Conclusions, I haue purposely omitted, not related,
for sundry swaying reasons: First, to auoid prolixitie, and
to keepe this petty Treatise from swelling into an excessiue
Volume, which it must needs haue done, had I transcribed
the one moity of the ensuing Quotations in their latitude.
Secondly, because the most, the chiefe of all these Bookes,
and Authors, are obuious and common vnto all mens view;
so that their bare Quotation is sufficient, their Transcript
needlesse. Thirdly, to encourage learned Readers, (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
our young vngrounded Schollers, and Diuines) who
desire satisfaction in these much agitated and perplexed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies,
to reade, yea, studiously to peruse the workes, and
writings of our vnparalleld home-bred Authors,<note n="*" place="margin">See Bishop <hi>Halls</hi> Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

how the excellent, Orthodox, eminentest, and learned Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of the most transplendent Lampes, and Ornaments
of our Church (whose very names strike terrour into our Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish

      <hi>dishonoured (as Prophets for the
most part onely are) in their owne natiue soyle, and
Fathers house,</hi> that many young pragmaticall Schollers,
some graue, more young Diuines, who reuerence and adore
all Popish Schoolemen, (which oft impoyson, and corrupt
their iudgements,) as if they were some Saints or petty

How venerable are the names and memoryes; how
sweet, how gracefull, and delightfull the poysonous VVorkes
of <hi>Aquinas, Lombard, Scotus, Suarez, Bellarmine,</hi> and
such like Popish Schoolemen (whom many make the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke

VVorkes <hi>of Caluin, Beza, Zanchie, Iunius,</hi> or other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
forraigne Protestants: much lesse, reuolue, digest,

Vsher, Prideaux, Benefield, Ames,</hi> and the like; who far
transcend all Popish Writers, not onely in Orthodoxic of
Matter, but in Art, Solidity, and depth of Learning.
Alas, it grieues me to consider (and I hope our vigilant
Watchmen will lay it neere to heart, as being an ominous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
a fatall preamble to our Religions downefall, if it bee
not in time preuented:) that not onely all kind of <hi>Pseudo-Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi>
and <hi>Arminian;</hi> but euen of <hi>Iesuiticall Popish books</hi>
(which haue arriued here of late in<note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therstones</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues, and Mr. <hi>Gees</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue.</note> great varietie and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
without the least restraint,) are now more diligently
inquired after, more speedily and greedily bought vp and
vented, though at excessiue rates; more studiously, more
commonly read, more generally quoted, more plausiblie vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in Sermons, Schooles, and Writings; more highly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
in the hearts and lips of many, then the best and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedest
of all Forraigne, or our owne vn-matched protestant
VVriters, whose Impressions almost canker for want of vse,
and sometimes perish in the Printers hands, for want of
Chapmen for to vent them.</p>
   <p>It is the pollicy of our Romish Achitophels, to traine vp
<pb facs="27"/>
their Schollers in their owne Popish Authors, and to inhibit
the transportation, much more the reading of any Protestant
(yea of some Popish) VVriters, without a speciall licence,
vnder paine of their Inquisition Slaughter-house; for feare
they should conuert their Readers, yea quite subuert their
Antichristian Babell, and shake the rotten Pillars of their
Machiauillian state-Religion, (consarcinated and made vp of
Heresie, Pollicie, Luxury, Pride, and Couetousnesse, the
greatest Opposites to Religion,) which cannot once withstand
their strong assaults: And shall we then giue free allowance to
their pernicious Bookes, who thus exile our true soule-sauing
Authors? Is it no blow, no danger, thinke wee, to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to suffer or perswade young Schollers to skip from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi>
to some Popish Schoolemen; or to giue open Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality,
and free welcome to all Popish, Arminian, and other

VVriters, (which will prooue our combustion, our

and cheerefully betake our selues vnto the serious and
delightfull study of our owne incomparable Authors, (who
are therefore vnderualued by vs, because they are our owne)
who will re-establish, re-confirme vs in our Ancient Faith,
reduce vs to our true Religion: exile all Popish Ceremonies,

that so Romes grand Impostors might possesse their throne:
to make way and passage for an vniuersall Spanish, Papall

but a desperate, and bloudy Error, which cuts off all peace, all

with totall and finall Apostasie from the State of

and sundry other iudgements, on all those Protestant
States and Churches where it hath bene harboured, which
haue neuer thriuen since this contagious, blasting Heresie
(which must needes be accompanied, with the very wrath
and curse of God, because it nullifies his fauour, and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowes

an vsher vnto Popery, and all Popish Ceremonies, which
winde themselues into our Church apace (if Parliament
complaints prooue true) by their Arminian Agents, as some
new erected Altars, Images, Tapers, and late vsurped Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-adorations,

be but safe, our Church, our State, our Goods, our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb facs="29"/>
our very soules and bodies, all we haue, are then secure:
if we hold but this, all else is sure; if we part with this, then
farewel all; let vs neuer expect one halcion happy day or houre
more,. Whiles Religion flourished and grew great among vs,
wee were then the head of Nations, the dread, the honour, the
mirrour, and paradise of the World: since the Tares of Popery
and Arminianisme haue sprung vp within our Church, since
we haue halted and declined in our Faith, wee haue beene the
very obloquie, scorne, derision, and taile of all our neighbour
nations: Plagues haue deuoured, Diuisions weakned, discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
decay of Trade, with sundry other grieuances impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerished
vs, at home: Enemies, tempests, vnskilfulnesse, and
ouer-reaching Policies, consumed, defeated, and dishonoured
vs, by Sea, by Land abroad: All our counsels haue beene
infatuated, our designes frustrated, our hopes dashed, our
prayers vnanswered, our Parliaments broaken vp in discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
the curse and vengeance of God hath clinged close vnto
vs to our great destruction: and for all this, we see, we finde,
we feele, (and I pray God wee may be truely sensible of it ere it
bee too late,)<note n="a" place="margin">Isay 9. 12. 17. 21.</note>
      <hi>Gods anger is not yet turned away, but
his hand is stretched out still against vs,</hi> because<note n="b" place="margin">Isay 1. 4. 5.</note>
      <hi>wee

      <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
whence we are falne, and doe our first workes;</hi>
Let vs<note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 4. 14 Tit. 1 9.</note>
      <hi>hold fast our first professed Religion, constant
to the ende:</hi> VVe were borne, we were baptized, bred, and
nursed in it; we haue growne vp safely, wee haue prospered
happily vnder it; we haue hitherto liued in it, by it: Let vs
now die in it, yea, with it, for it, if God calls vs to it; lest we
all suddenly perish, consume, and die eternally without it, because
we haue thus backe-slided from it.</p>
