   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T being but a Poeticall fiction, that this whole world was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning framed of <hi>Chaos,</hi> vpon better aduise and reason one may change opinion, or at least haue his owne cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure by himselfe: it seeming vnto mee a more probable thing, that from the beginning of Forme, which the philosophers hold to be perfection, this world groweth daily to <hi>Chaos</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. But if the materiall frame be any waies answerable to him, who is the epitomethereof (man being termed <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosmos)</hi> I am sure this assertion may well be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For Nature (diuine ministresse) contending in the creation of all things, to imprint in them the seale and forme of Diuinitie, shee findeth no enemie nor obstacle to this her perfect worke but matter, which still encreaseth according to the augmentation, and growth of things created. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon commeth the great difference betweene the superiour immortall, and the inferiour corruptible parts of man, the faculties of the soule and minde, being choaked in all her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine intentions, by the grosse humours and temperature of the bodie, wherein as in a darke and loathsome prison, it is while the gayle deliuerie of death inclosed. And from hence in like manner doth it arise, that this wittie, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Author, obserueth in the tree of humaine conceit and vnderstanding, so many grafts of follie and fopperie inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that no man how mightie or profound soeuer he be in his owne sight, is exempted from some measure or proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these dottrell drammes. In religion (which is the
<pb facs="7"/>
highest action amongst men) is it not a woonderfull thing to see the obstinate opposition of some more fantasticke, then truely zealous: one iudging euerie decent formalitie, deepe and dangerous superstition; another abandoning all true ground and substance, for naked traditionall rite and forme. Next vnto this in the second cure of our bodies, how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite are the follies of Phisitions in the practise of their Art, into whose hands notwithstanding at one time or other are cōmitted the liues of almen, wading through such a number of incertainties before they attaine to one sound <hi>probatum,</hi> and making their trials &amp; experiments vpon the poore car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases of men: and yet for all this, looke what through an whole age, hath beene receiued for holsome &amp; healthfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, in another succeeding, is reiected as most preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall and pernitious. So that the applications and medicine of their first founders, is now of no woorth, except they haue recourse to minerals, wherein likewise as they confesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues they haue attained to qualitie; but of quantitie are as yet altogether ignorant. The like may be said of all Arts and professions amongst men, wherein there is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and incertaintie, as the doings of one are reprehended by another for most vaine and foolish. But if you enter into the particular humours and enclinations of each one, Lord, what a pell-mell of conceit and muention you shall discouer, this seed being so thicke sowen in all their operations, that after their deepe consultations, firme resolutions, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent circumspection, of all this their labour, there commeth vp nothing but tares and folly, which the wisest man, after due consideration so often affirmed. One is ambitious, and hauing brought his thoughts and imaginations to a good passe, some instant folly, they being reared to a great height, (like the Babilonian tower) vtterly ouerthroweth them to
<pb facs="7"/>
the ground. Another puts on the Foxe with temporizing humilitie, and yet omitting some small circumstances in his complots and contriuance, a momentarie error confoundeth all his laboured and prouident deuises. For as violence set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth hatred and disdaine in the harts of men, <hi>Nam oderint quem metuunt:</hi> so absolute humilitie breedeth contempt; and the Italian Prouer be can tell you, that <hi>Chi pecora si fá, il lupo lo mangia.</hi> Well, hauing in this Hospitall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued so good comfort, and succour my selfe; in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous charitie I could not but make knowne vnto you this worthie Italian worke, framed peraduenture vpon their yeere of Iubilee, or grace, and therefore propounded in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to all men, for reliefe and cure of their giddie maladies. I craue no pardon of my errors or faults (yet are they many, and onely mine owne) beeing but a Foole, in reporting to Fooles what an other hath censured of humaine folly: And therefore you see I neither incite you to gratitude, by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> receiuing a cup of water so thankfully, nor to reward in distributing of your goodwils, by imitation of that noble Prince, who so kindly remunerated the taking of alowse from his garment. <hi>Tullies</hi> sentences lye dead in my minde, and I haue vtterly lost the memoriall of <hi>Lycosthenes</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophthegmes: this I did carelesly, accept you of it as lightly. Yet consider what patience you haue with the wine you drink in Tauernes, and beleeue me (as a poore Traueller) it is all exceedingly bastardiz'd from his originall purity: and euen your Phisicall drams, that are so greedily sought after, suffer a little sophistication by the hands of the Apothecarie. Thinke not much therefore, if so tickle and foolish a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie as this is, be somewhat endamaged by the transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it out of Italy, but making some pleasant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable collection out of the same, let vs leaue all preeminence
<pb facs="8"/>
of folly to themselues, as I ascribe all due reward and deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to my originall Author. It is certaine, that there is few names of men or places, in all the moderne examples of this Booke, but haue agnomination or proximitie with the humours &amp; qualities of the partie described: but this would haue made too homely an hotchpotch in English, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured so much wit as shineth through this whole miste of folly, by too palpable and triuiall scurrilitie. If any man finde helpe, or cure of his maladie, by deuout inuocation on his proper Saint, or Patron, let him ascribe the principall glorie thereof to him, and yet be thankfull to his earthly founder.</p>
