   <head>TO THE COVRTEOVS Christian Reader whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether of the Clergy, or of the Laity. More especially, To my loving and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Auditors of the Town of <hi>Plymmouth,</hi> Grace, Mercy, and Peace.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have now at length sent abroad into the world, what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended many days ago, but could not compass till this present time. Many, the most
<pb facs="5"/>
of these Notions touching the Sacraments, have I preached now and then, in the course of my Lecture, as the Text in hand presented an occasion to me. In the delivery of which, because I could not be so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as to give that cleer, that full satisfaction which I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, at least, not to all my Hearers, I set pen to paper, and out of those severall Notes disperst here and there, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially out of some explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Church Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, have I concinnate and fitted up this Treatise, which I now present to your view.</p>
   <p>The last yeer, after that by the advice of some judicious Friends, to whom I imparted the sight therof, I had altered, and amended what was thought needfull, I presented a Copy therof to our Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Diocesan, with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
<pb facs="5"/>
that to his Censure it should stand, or fall: if he thought fitting, it should pass abroad; if not, I should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the Dust and Moths, the just destiny of unhappy scriblings. To whom should I give an account of my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, rather than to Him, by whose favour and permission I enjoy my Licence, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my Lecture, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall labours?</p>
   <p>It pleased his Lordship after the perusall of my papers, to redeliver the Copy to me, with that Approbation, of which I confess my selfe to be still am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, <hi>viz.</hi> That hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the substance of my Book to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ound and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall, agreeable to the Truth of God, and consonant to the doctrin of our present Church. Nor did his Lordship spare to advise me, and put me upon
<pb facs="6"/>
the Publication of it: alledging that tho the same things are already published: yet to see them laid together, (as here they bee) and brought into a frame, and uniform discourse, would quit the cost, and be worth acceptance.</p>
   <p>A willing mind is soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded: to say the truth, I was easily induced to send it forth into the World. In generall: for the publique benefit of the Church of God; as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Argument to bee no less needfull, than usefull to advance that respect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which is due to this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ordinance. In speciall: to plead my Cause, to give sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to some of my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: whose Ey perhaps, may now resolv them, in that wherin their Ear, hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (tho unjustly) detain'd them doubtfull. I blame not
<pb facs="6"/>
not any, who doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently receiv what is suggested by the New-come Preacher: I commend the inquisitiv Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who will examin the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of S. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, before thy will adhere unto it: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I would pray the Hearer, I would intreat the Reader, not therfore to neglect the truth of God, nor less regard the Doctrin of our Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the person that now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it to the publique view, is not of greater place, of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parts, of more ability. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Goats hair was usefull, and Badgers skins accepted towards the erecting of the Lords Tabernacle. And this poor Treatise of mine, may through Gods blessing, bee profitable (I hope) to some, and do some good in the Church of God. Howsoever: I have done what I could: The
<pb facs="7"/>
rest I leave to God.</p>
   <p>How needfull the Argument is, you shall find observed and breefly touched in the preface; which when you have read, the rest of the discourse is subdivided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three generall parts. In the first of which I have endevoured to shew what a Sacrament is: The end and issue whereof is, to determin the Number of true-born Sacraments.</p>

   <p>And thus have you the summe of this Treatise: By which you may guess whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be worth the reading, yea, or no: I have been (as you see) larger in the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call part, than in the Theore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall:
<pb facs="12"/>
this third generall part being equall to the other two. And yet I have not been so large as some Readers would think fitting; neither in this later, and much less in the two former parts therof. My A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie is: This is not an age to blot paper in: They that most commonly bestow time in reading books, are of the Clergie; and to them five words spoken with reason, and understanding, are better than five thousand tautologies, and iterations. Among the Laity, if any one find not full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the Minister is at hand in every parish, of whom he may inquire. And I humbly intreat my brethren of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery (what I faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to them in the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) to do me right, in helping their people, that desire it, to
<pb facs="12"/>
apprehend the best constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what may seem doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: imitating therin that of Saint <hi>Austin, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>De A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima, ad Renatum, Vbi mihi animus ergame hominis ignotus est &amp; incertus, meliùs arbitror meliora sentire, quam in-expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata culpare.</hi> As for the truth of what I have set down do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally, and positively, I know my Brethren of the Clergie (if Ministers of the Church of England) may not desert me, much less oppose me, except they will desert their own subscription, in as much as what I have written, hath been collected (<hi>totidem ferè verbis</hi>) out of those books to which they no less than I have heretofore subscribed.</p>
   <p>To this Treatise I have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, and printed with it the copy of a Sermon, preached lately (<hi>sc. Iun.</hi> 24. 1638) in
<pb facs="13"/>
the publique Sermon appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross. So much the rather, because, as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Matter is an argument co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen-german to the former trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise: so in it I have the more largely insisted upon that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin which is most doubted, and discussed, <hi>viz.</hi> The efficacy of Baptism.</p>
   <p>In this Sermon (to give you a taste therof) <hi>After the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the Text, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the phrases: you have something interserted tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this Doctrin,</hi> That death doth free us from the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinn. <hi>The which, tho a truth, and very usefull, as there I shew for consolation against the fear of death: yet is but briefly touched, and passed over, as not being that which the text in hand doth chiefly aym at. This is indeed, as then I come to shew</hi> That Christians are dead men
<pb facs="13"/>
and therfore free-men. <hi>Dead, while they are alive, not in sinn, but to sinn, as</hi> Theophylact (<hi>which I pray the Reader to set down in the margent) doth out of</hi> vers. 2. <hi>supply the text, thus reading:</hi> Qui mortuus est pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato, justificatus est à peccato. <hi>This is by being baptised into the death of Christ,</hi> i.e. <hi>either into the profession of conformity with Christ in his death, or else into the participation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the power, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Christs death.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>The first is a Truth, and the ground of a good Doctrin,</hi> viz. That by the vow of Baptism Christians are dead to sin. <hi>An Argument of confusion to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall-Gospellers. But the second I pitch upon, because, as</hi> Beza <hi>well noteth:</hi> Non ex confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate communio, sed ex com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munione conformitas; <hi>becaus we partake of the power of
<pb facs="14"/>
Christs death: thence it is that we are conformable to him in mortification.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Now, to be baptised into the Communion of Christs death: what is it else, but by Baptism to be partaker of his death, and consequently discharged from the Dominion of sin: So the Doctrin.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Doct.</hi> Christians howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before their Baptism, they be servants of sin, yet by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism they are freed from the service, and dominion therof.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>The uses of this Doctrin are three-fold.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>First, for instruction, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the efficacy of Baptism; touching which, two cautions</hi>:
<list>
         <item>1. <hi>That the efficacy of the Sacrament is but instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.</hi>
         </item>
         <item>2. <hi>That it pre-supposeth a right Qualification in the Receiver.</hi>
         </item>
      </list>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="14"/>
      <hi>Secondly, For consolation to Parents in respect of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren dying in infancy.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether all infants be regenerate in Baptism.</p>
      <p>An Answer set down in two conclusions.</p>
      <p>An objection taken from the usuall phrase of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in pressing the duty of attendance upon the means of grace.</p>
      <p>The answer to it.</p>
   </q>
   <p>
      <hi>Thirdly, for exhortation, And this directed:</hi>
      <q>
         <p>First, to Parents, To watch carefully over their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enslaved.</p>
         <p>To acquaint them with this benefit: to call upon them &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Secondly, To all Christians.</p>
         <p>In generall: to walk as Free-men.</p>
         <p>In speciall: to hinder the
<pb facs="15"/>
reign of sinn in themselves.</p>
         <p>
            <hi>Object.</hi> I fain would do so, but am not able.</p>
         <p>
            <hi>Sol.</hi> Christians have helps to subdue the power of sinn; <hi>sc.</hi> An interest.</p>
         <p>First, In the blood of Christ streaming in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
         <p>Secondly, In the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints: the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Prayers.</p>
         <p>A Caveat. That if Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans desire this benefit, they must not forfeit their interest by running into tentation.</p>
      </q>
Hitherto the copy of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
   <p>These two little books, not much unlike to the poore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows two mites, have I cast into the Treasury of the Church; I pray God they may be no less accepted with
<pb facs="15"/>
God, and all good men; that so the succesfulness of these my poore endevours may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me to go on cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the work of my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and to bestow some big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger volumn upon the Library of this Church, and Nation. I know we are not born for our selvs alone, not for this present age alone. I should choose rather to be too busie (in this kind) and to over-do, rather than to be wanting to my place, and people.</p>
   <p>I cannot hope to live (at least not here wher I am) til I see the harvest of my seeds time, the fruits of my labour here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed. We of the Ministery, commonly our greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, in the happy growth of grace in those, whom at our first entrance we find to be of tender years. Nor do I doubt but that amongst these, there
<pb facs="16"/>
will be found some, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after will rejoyce in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of those holy truths, which they have heard, received, and gathered up in their attendance upon my poore labours: and they will say, this, and this did I then heare, and learn: and tho for the present I felt no great sweetness in it, yet do I now taste it, and know it to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truth of God. In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, this Doctrin of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and their efficacy, which seemed so strange, and uncouth in the ears of divers of the elder Audience, will by the younger sort be received now, and hereafter remembred with happy congratulation.</p>
   <p>Now then for their sakes that they may keep fresh in memory what they have heard, that they may recall to mind what perhaps hath slipt,
<pb facs="16"/>
and is forgotten, have I sent abroad these, and if God say amen, I shall send abroad some other of my notes. For their sakes, I say, that they may have wherwithall to perswade others what themselvs do know: <hi>viz. That those things</hi> (to use the phrase of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in a case not much unlike) <hi>that those things wherof divers have been informed concerning me, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that I also walk order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and keep the Law:</hi> The law I mean of holy teaching, and edification; not wasting the time in curious, and needless speculations; but endevouring (<hi>pro posse meo</hi>) both plainly to explicate, and profitably to apply, what the text of Holy Writ hath led me to.</p>
   <p>In the prosecuting of which, if I have proceeded otherwise (as some say) than others have
<pb facs="17"/>
done before me; let the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Reader do that, which those Hearers should have done, <hi>sc.</hi> try, and examine which of us doth most neerly follow the steps of the holy Scripture, and tread in the path of our Mother-Church. To me I confess, it is a scruple to depart from the pattern of wholsome Doctrin, to the which I have subscribed: if it be not so to others, it is not my fault if I dare not follow them. But there is a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, who have learned to pretend the authority of such Worthies, and such grave Divines, meerly to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance what themselvs have pitcht upon, in prejudice, and opposition of the present Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery. This was (say they) the Doctrin, this the opinion of such, and such; when, upon
<pb facs="17"/>
due examination, their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was nothing so, but clean contrary. That this may not hereafter befall me, this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise shall be a witness to the world, what I beleev, what I have taught as touching this Argument. The scope wherof in brief is to shew: That the effect of the Sacraments is ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> union with Christ: The fruit is communion in his Merits, and Graces; in his merits for Remission, in his Graces for Regeneration: both which are begun in Baptism, and perfectly consummate in the Lords Supper. This is all: Farewell dear Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; pray for him, who hath devoted himself, and the strength of his labours to the advancement of thy spirituall welfare. Let thy prayers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me and my labours to
<pb facs="18"/>
the blessing of our heavenly Father.</p>
   <p>In whom I rest, Thine.</p>
