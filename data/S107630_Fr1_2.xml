   <p>The Almighty providence was pleased to exalt him to an higher station, that like some malignant Contet or Prodigie of nature, hee might be more eminently discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and possesse the remotest and dullest eyes, with admiration and horror. But a land: mark that shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Rock, is as usefull in navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="3"/> as a compasse that guids directly, and examples instruct as well by avoidance as imitation: And if those Ancients, that erected statues and trophies by the way side, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the memory of their worthies did wisely to place Gibbets there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, to affright passengers with the memory of notorious malefactors; then certainly a most effectuall spur to Religion and Vertue may her drawn from the contemplation and horrour of this Monsters impleties and vices.</p>
   <p>The truth of the history being selected out of <hi>Iosephus</hi> and other approved writers, may passe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further warrant: The collection and composition, which is as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments and colours, (or indeed the spirit and motion of the picture) we owe to a forraine, but a judicious and fortunate Pencill, of one, whose
<pb facs="4"/> name among the most discerning spirits, hath affectionately received the highest attributes, the judicious and eloquent <hi>Causinus;</hi> who collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the materials and substance from more ancient and authentick records, hath added shape and var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish according to the Idea of his own iudgement: And exposing it to the world in a French attire; I presume it will prove nothing the lesse attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

      </gap> gracefull to an English eye. The habit it weares in English, it owes to a Translatour, that needed not have suppressed his name, if his modesty would permit him to accept that Testimony, which I think, hee hath iustly gained, to have retained in this last draught, (so neere as imitation can expresse Copies, or a second draught taken from a former Picture, can match that which was first taken from the face,) the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="4"/> and native beauty, and in this small Peece to have had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est hand.</p>
   <p>So that if either truth and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of example, Art &amp; Elegancy of composition, Activenesse and life of expression, Fidelity and Felicity of translation may affect thee, I hope this short History, if it faile of thy applause and acclamation, shall assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly finde thy excuse and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. To either of which, (as thy iudgement shall incline thee) I leaue it, and Thee (after an houre or two's vacancy to this recreation,) to thy more serious and usefull employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
