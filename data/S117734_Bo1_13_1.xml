   <p>REader, these Trauailes of mine into <hi>Scotland,</hi> were not vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
neither in imitation, or emulation of any man, but onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
by my selfe, on purpose to make triall of my friends, both in
this Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and that of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and because I
would be an eye-witnes of diuers things which I had heard of that
Countrey; and whereas many shallow-brain'd Critickes, doe lay
an aspersion on me, that I was set on by others, or that I did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rgoe
this proiect,
either in malice, or mockage of Master <hi>Benjamin Ionson,</hi> I vow
the faith of a Christian, that their imaginations are all wide, for he is a Gentleman,
whom I am so much obliged for many vndeserued courtesies that I haue receiued

      </gap>, to make so bad a requitall, for so much goodnesse formerly receiued; so much for

   <lg>
      <l>That I should write of Cities situations,</l>
      <l>Or that of Countries I should make relations:</l>
      <l>Of brooks, crooks, nooks; of riuers, boorns and rills,</l>
      <l>Of mountaines, fountaines, Castles, Towres and hills,</l>
      <l>Of Shieres, and Pieres, and memorable things,</l>
      <l>Of liues and deaths of great commanding Kings,</l>
      <l>I touch not those, they not belong to mee:</l>
