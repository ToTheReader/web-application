RIGHT REVEREND
AND
RIGHT HONORABLE
PRINCE, AND LORD,
LORD IOHN SVICARD,
Arch-bishop of the holy Sea of Mentz, Arch-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
of the Sacred Roman Empire through

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here came of late (right Reuerend
and right Honorable Prince) two
bookes out of England; one whereof
bare title of the Renowned King
<hi>Iames;</hi> the other of his Chaplain:
both which, as manifestly oppugning the Roman
Church, I haue, for the loue of truth, refuted as
modestly as I could. As for the former I haue dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Confutation therof to the Inuincible Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Rodulph,</hi> and the other renowned Kinges, &amp;
Illustrious Princes of the Christian world (among
whome you are one:) But the later I haue thought it
not amisse to dedicate specially vnto your magnificēt
Name; and that for two reasons. The one, that
for so much as I haue taken this paines for defence
of the Catholicke faith and Religion; it seemes vnfit
that the same should be published vnder the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
of any other, then your selfe who are so great a
professor and protector of the said faith in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
The other reason is, for that your meritts and
benefitts towards our Archiepiscopall Colledge of
<hi>Mentz,</hi> do by a certaine right challenge, and exact
the same at my hands. You will, I trust, take i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
in good part, and fauourably accept this my sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
token of Duty and Reuerence.</p>
