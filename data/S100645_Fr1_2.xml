<pb facs="8"/>
may by such meanes as these discover their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, &amp; secure those that love the truth, from their delusions.</p>
   <p>These, and such like reasons as these, have induced me (Christian Reader) to take hold of this present opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to offer unto thy view this usefull Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of a Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine now with God. A faithfull and a paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labourer in the Lords Vineyard above the space of 30. yeares. A man he was one of a


<pb facs="8"/>
thousand, an eminent light, mighty in the Scriptures, and a happy interpreter of them; of a sound judgement, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide and dexterous in unfolding difficult que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions; besides his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, mildnesse, and meekenesse of spirit, affablenesse in conver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sation wherein hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled the most. A man retired and drawne much up into himselfe, neither thinking great thoughts of himselfe, nor seeking great things for himselfe;


<pb facs="9"/>
but seeking him, and conversing much with him that is invisible; hee attained a great measure of divine wisedome, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindednesse: So that wee that knew him looked on him, and judged much of him to bee in heaven already: Of whom it may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, as once of a worthy Divine of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that hee did even eate, and drinke, and sleepe eternall life: Whom if thou didst not know in his life

time, yet now learne to be acquainted with him in his labours; who will converse sweetly with thee in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, speake to thy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart, and counsell thee as from God.</p>
   <p>Concerning the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise it selfe, I shall spare to speake much of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is so well able to speake for it selfe, as thou findest so judge: Many choyce truths there are handled in it, many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture profitably opened, many secret p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="10"/>
the Conversion of a sinner lively discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Thou mayest take notice also of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wayes of dealing, in bringing home lost creatures. Some hee draggeth as by the haire of the head painfully; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he leades as by the hand gently: of which, the subject of this book is a notable example.</p>
   <p>I had thought to have offered it unto thee by the hands of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more eminently gifted, &amp; better known in the Church, on


<pb facs="10"/>
whose judgement thou mightest with more safety have reposed thy selfe; but well knowing the worth of it to bee such, as will easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it selfe; and by reason of my interest in the Author, and some trust reposed in me this way; I rather chose to let my meanenesse ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, than not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that debt of love which I owe to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of my deceased friend.</p>
   <p>The Lord blesse these things unto thee, and


<pb facs="11"/>
teach thee to profit; and do thou blesse God for the labours of the dead and living, and let him begge a prayer of thee, who being affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately devoted to the good of thy soule, doth rest,</p>
