   <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, I am constrained in commending this spirituall blessing vnto thee, to begin with the excuse of a good deed. For although it be a good deede to commend this commendable worke, yet must I plead the pardon of my defectiuenes in doing it, by alleaging my calling thereto; and impleade the fulsomnes of the maligners of such holy enterprises, who for the most part distast all things but vanitie.<note place="margin">Iob. 34.3.</note>
      <hi>The eare</hi> (saith <hi>Elihu) trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meate,</hi> to wit, if the eare be truly spirituall; otherwise there is an vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised eare,<note place="margin">Act. 7.51.</note> where there is an vncircumcised heart: and he that hath an vnmortified eare, which is an affection to carnall eloquence, cannot escape a reprobate sense in iudging of the wisedome of God. An itching eare requireth a clawing stile, and the most readers seeke after that which this treatise purposely eschueth. <hi>But wisedome will be iustified of her children,</hi> and the godly hearted will lay that vnlooked for imputation vpon affectation of braue words, which the holy Ghost laieth vpon wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens brauerie, mentioned in the <hi>3.</hi> of <hi>Esay,</hi> which soone after in the <hi>4.</hi> chap. vers. <hi>4.</hi> by passage of speech he calleth <hi>the filthines of the daughters of Sion.</hi> Something I graunt may be yeelded by way of indulgence to the weake; but he that seriously see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Lord, will not be offended nor cloyed with that simplicitie, which offendeth not God by turning away the mind by trifles from a bent purpose of sound edification.</p>
   <p>The matter of this booke is right worthy to occupie the minds of men, and will be receiued of the gracious perusers of it. The rest of the professors, which like wanton and full fed children begin to play with their meate, &amp; brooke nothing but conceited writing and speaking, are to be bewailed; and as for the dogs they are to be detested and denied holy things. The blessing and comfort of grace brought S. <hi>Paul to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all things as dung,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Philip. 3.8.</note> in comparison; and their illumination (how great soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) is vnsanctified, which are not so minded: and if any man loue godlines indeed and be good mettall,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.17.</note> he will blesse the fire which is ordained to melt him, and the mould which is made to cast him in: but they which make the founder to melt in vaine,<note place="margin">Iere. 6.29.30.</note> shall be called reprobate siluer. It is part of the blessing of a worke to bee wrought by a blessed instrument: and although it be sacrilege to interuert the praise of God; yet it is of religion to take notice of Gods chosen vessels, and all men are more affected by such. This is the aduantage of this booke, I meane the long approued god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the Author, as he is a Christian; and his zealous painfulnes, as he is a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. And if it please God that his pen may be as his tongue hath been, a tree of life, the very leaues thereof will cure him of the sting of Serpents tongues. That which <hi>S. Luke</hi> testifieth of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> may (after Gods admeasurement) be spoken of him, and hoped of his labours,<note place="margin">Act. 11.24.</note>
      <hi>that he was a good man, and full of the holie Ghost and faith, and much people ioyned themselues to the Lord.</hi> Receiue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (good Reader) this prouision which he hath made for thee of holesome meate, not caring for conceited cookerie, but remember that godly hunger is the best sauce for heauenly foode.</p>
