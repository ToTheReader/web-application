      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou maist wonder perhaps (Gentle Reader) why amongst so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and learned Phisitians of this Citie, I alone haue vndertaken to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the expectation of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, &amp; to beare the heauy burthen of contentious Critiques and deprauers: But when the cause shall be examined, and the reasons considered, I hope to resolue thee so well, as thou shalt haue no cause to condemne me: There haue beene lately certaine <hi>Thessali</hi> that haue bestowed a new Printed liuery on euery olde post, and promised such myracles, as if they held the raine of desteny in their own hands, and were able to make old <hi>Aeson</hi> young againe: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these, one by fortune is become my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, who because at the first he vnderwrit not his billes, euery one that red them came flocking to me, coniuring me by great profers and perswasions to store them with my promised preseruatiues, and relieue their sicke with my Cordiall waters: These importunities of theirs made mee both agreeued, and amazed; agreeued, because of that loathsome imposition which was laide vppon me, to make my selfe vendible, (which is vnworthy a liberall &amp; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle minde, much more ill beseeming a Phisitian and
<pb facs="4"/>
Philosopher, who ought not to prostitute so sacred a profession so abiectly, but be a contemner of base and seruile desire of mony, as <hi>Galen</hi> witnesseth in his booke, <hi>Quod optimus medicus, idem sii &amp; Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus:</hi> amazed, to see the ignorance and error of the multitude, who dare trust their liues to their hands who build their experiēce on hazard of mens liues: and are troubled with the scab of the minde, which <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Alcibiade</hi> calleth <hi>Probrosam imperitiā,</hi> and <hi>M. A. Natta,</hi> in his <hi>5.</hi> booke <hi>de Pulchro,</hi> voluntary igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Herevpon (by the earnest solicitation of my friends) and vnder a great desire to doe good vnto my neighbors, I haue faithfully gathered out of the most approued Authors, (especially out of certaine notes which I receiued from <hi>Valenolaes</hi> sonne now Doctor of Phisique in <hi>Arles,</hi> in <hi>Prouince</hi>) a true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode how to knowe and cure the Plague, which freely and charitably I offer to the reliefe of those who want meanes to relieue their estates in this time of visitation, and the rather because the world might conceiue of me in such sort, that I preferre a common good (according to <hi>Platoes</hi> counsell,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the gaping desires of gaine and profit in this world. An other reason was, because such bookes as already are past abroad, are confusedly hudled vp, without either forme or Methode, which is an vnpardonable errour in those that indeuour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct others. For these causes haue I bene drawne to write and expose my selfe to mens iudgements. Now that I study not in this Treatise to hunt after vain-glory, God can beare me witnes, and the plain stile I haue vsed therein may easily make knowne,
<pb facs="4"/>
which had I a mind to bewitch the eares and minds of the reader, might perhaps haue bin better tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: neither haue I a setled purpose to wound other mens fame, (as all men may coniecture) since ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing iust occasion offered me to reproue them, yet had I rather conceale that wherein they erre, then discouer their <hi>Scribendi Cacoethen</hi> (as the Poets saith) to their disgrace. Truly my resolution is to prouoke no man, and those that know me inwardly of late time can witnesse, that I resemble the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> Mare (of whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> maketh mention) which being led to the water, &amp; seeing her shadow therin, suffereth her selfe afterward to be ridden by Asses: I thanke God I haue indured wrongs, tho I haue had power to reuenge them. But because my desire is to leaue all men satisfied, I must a litle retire my selfe to yeeld men of worth &amp; learning satisfaction in a matter wherein perhaps they might except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me. There is a lerned Phisitian that hath lately writtē against <hi>Amuteles</hi> or cakes of <hi>Arsenick,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may cōceiue vnkindnes against me, because in this Treatise I haue set downe the vse therof as a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraine preseruatiue against the Plague, where he hath condemned them; but he must excuse me in this case, for I haue no intent to commend the same because he condemneth it, but by reason of their authoritie and experience who haue bin the lights and honors of Phisicke, as <hi>Mercurialis</hi> in his book <hi>de Venenis,</hi> chap. 13. <hi>Capiuachius</hi> in his book <hi>de Febribus</hi> chap. 13. &amp; <hi>Heurinus</hi> in his booke <hi>de Febribus,</hi> chap. 19. <hi>Valeriola</hi> and diuers others, who by vniforme consent do allow the same either worne vnder the
<pb facs="5"/>
arme pittes, or about the region of the heart, by reason that by a certaine similitude one venome draweth an other with it, as <hi>Arsenick,</hi> which voideth the poison of the Plague insensibly, <hi>Quod venenum &amp; corpore attrahat &amp; tota forma, &amp; ratione caliditatis.</hi> This <hi>Antipathie</hi> in <hi>Arsenick</hi> experience doth allow, authoritie doth confirme, and reason (which is an other of the feete whereon Phisicke walketh as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> testifieth) doth assist it, which he may easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that readeth <hi>Mercurialis,</hi> in the place afore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. But for that I intend onely to iustifie mine owne actes &amp; not to impugne others, let this suffice. And to conclude, if any man in the ripenesse of his iudgement be more <hi>oculatus</hi> in this cause, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these Fathers of Phisicke or my selfe am, I enuy him not, but leaue him to his better thoughts, till I may be more fully satisfied. Thus committing you to him on whose mercy I depend, I take my leaue of the gentle Reader, desiring no other reward at thy hands but a fewe deuout praiers for me, which I wil pay thee againe with double vsury whilest God len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth me life. <hi>Vale.</hi>
