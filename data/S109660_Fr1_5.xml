they looke for (gentle Reader): euen so many haue
not such thankes for their gifts as they deserue: And
as a great sorte are better rewarded for their giftes,
than either they hope or deserue: So, many are neuer
a whit rewarded therefore, cleane contrary to their
hope and desert: yet some (rather by lucke than lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and by chaunce than cunning) haue bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for their giftes farre aboue their expectation,
as the poore Cobler was of the Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi>
for his Crowe, by an extraordinarie meanes when all hope was past. Which pleasant
example is this: A poore Cobler brought vp a Crowe with great trauell and paine to
make him speake these wordes, <hi>All haile woorthy Caesar and victorious conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi>
(which was immediatlie after he ouercame <hi>Anthoninus</hi>) whiche birde was so
dull of learning, that he did beat hir cruellie, and in beating hir he saide many times
(when she would not talke as he taught hir) All our labour and charges is lost. At
last when the Crowe had hir lesson something perfectlie, the saide Cobler vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the Emperour would come through the streetes, wayted purposely therefore,
and when the Emperour came by him, the Crowe by and by (hauing some priuie war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
when to tell hir tale) suddenly vttered, <hi>All haile woorthie Caesar and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
conqueror:</hi> wherof the Emperour made small accompt, saying, I haue such Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luters
inough at home (for he had birdes giuen him before that could speake the
same woordes,) and as soone as the Emperour had saide so, The Crowe answered (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the expectation of the Cobler) <hi>All our labour and charges is lost.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
the Emperour smiling, he then gaue more to the sayd Cobler for that Crowe, than
he gaue for any other birde before: though by the Emperours first woordes he was
without hope of any thing. Among which number of giuers I accompt my selfe, for
as the poore Cobler had brought the Emperour a Crowe not trained vp without tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
to pleasure him, without hope of any rewarde therefore: so I haue presented to
you a Booke, (not pende without paine) to pleasure and profite you, being vtterly in
dispaire, to be gratified therefore of euery one with my wished rewarde, (though it
be not much that I craue for the same) for though the Cobler gaue his gifte for a
great rewarde but to one: I haue giuen this my gifte for a small rewarde to many.
(which is, good will and thankes). But if this my Booke declare vnto you a profitable
extraordinarie talke, as the Crowe vttered to the Emperour a pleasant extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
tale: I trust you will as willingly giue me great thankes for my Booke, as the
<pb facs="5"/>
Emperour gaue the Cobler a riche rewarde for his Crowe, which if you should not do,
I then should be inforced, to saie with the Crowe, <hi>then all my trauell and labour
is lost.</hi> But so to say, I hope I shall not be driuen, for I doubt not, but that many will
therefore thanke me: though some should vncortuouslie discommende me. Such as
rewarde good giftes with deprauinges and detractions, are not of so good nature,
as this woorthy Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> was: who on a time when a cert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ine Greeke had
giuen him a fewe fine verses, (hoping thereby to haue some good rewarde) The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
then with his owne hand, wrote very apt verses in Greeke, and sent them to
the sayde man (comming towardes him) and so the Emperour gaue him verses for
verses. Thus such ought to learne at <hi>Augustus,</hi> to gratifie their giuers of Bookes,
with writing againe as good, or aswell as they can, or at least to thanke them and not
to detract or deride them. But as the sayde learned man politikely, to allure the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
to giue him a rewarde, did take out of his purse a fewe pieces of siluer, and did
offer them to the Emperour for his verses that he gaue him, saying: It is no rewarde
for your estate (worthie Emperour) but if I had more, more would I giue: wherewith
the Emperour called his purse bearer, and commaunded a thousand markes forthwith
to be giuen him. Euen so if any should do, (as many haue done) write and set forth
Bookes, for my commoditie: if I could not rewarde them with my purse, I would (as I
haue done) thanke them with my tonge, whereby I would learne and allure them to
gratifie me and such other with the like. And now for that many did well accept and
thankefully take, my Booke called <hi>Too good to be true,</hi> I haue the rather, newly
framed &amp; published the Second part therof, called <hi>The knitting vp of Too good
to be true:</hi> which I haue onely done, to please, pleasure, and profite many, and
not to displease, displeasure, or disprofite any. Crauing (most gentle
Reader) nothing of you therefore, but good will for my gift, loue
for my labour, and thankes for my trauell: which is more
easie for you to giue vnto me, than for me to make
this that I haue giuen vnto you. And thus I
wishe you as well as my selfe.</p>
