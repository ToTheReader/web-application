Whereunto are added in the end of euery centurie treatises arising vpon occasion offered in the historie, clearely declaring the noveltie of popish religion, and that it neither flowed from the mouthes of Christs holy Apostles, neither was it confirmed by the blood of the holy martyrs who died in these ten persecutions</title>

But now <hi>(Madam)</hi> the course of the History hath led me so far forward, that I must touch the very apple of their eye, and enter into their most holy place, and declare, that their seruice, which they count most holy, is but vile abomination in the sight of GOD: And their doctrine concerning the Vicar of Christ, the successour of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the holinesse of the Masse, and the plurality of their Sacraments added to Baptisme, and the Lordes Supper, is but like wind: And wee are warned by the Apostle <hi>Paul, that wee should no more bee children, waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and carrie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap> about with euery winde of doctrine:</hi> for false <note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 14</note> doctrine is justly compared to winde in the baddest qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it: Sometimes it is easterne, cold, stormy, &amp; withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, so that the eares of corne (blasted with the easterne wind) are counted thinne, and empty eares: Euen so, false doctrine exicateth &amp; dryeth vp that appearance of sap &amp; <note place="margin">Genes. 41</note> grace that seemed to be amongst people.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Romane</hi> Church in our dayes bring vp their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as the harlots of <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in <hi>Phaenitia</hi> brought vp their children before the dayes of the good Emperour <hi>Constantine.</hi> These children afore-saide knewe not their Fathers, for they were strangers: and the Harlots of <hi>Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> had liberty to prostitute themselues to the lust of strangers: so it came to passe, if children had bene procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this <hi>libidinus</hi> copulation, the stranger was gone, and the procreated child depended onely vpon the mother, for hee knewe not his father: Euen so, in the subsequent
<pb facs="275"/>
      <hi>Centuries,</hi> the <hi>Romane</hi> Church disacquaint their children with the voyce of God, sounding in Holy Scripture. It is now enough to beleeue as the <hi>Romane</hi> Church (the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Churches) beleeueth: and the chaire of <hi>Rome,</hi> in matters of Faith, it cannot erre. But wee must depende vpon the voyce of God our Heauenly Father, who hath begotten vs by the vncorruptible seede of His word, who <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. &amp; 2</note> hath also fostered vs with the sincere &amp; reasonable milke of His word, who hath anointed vs with the Balme of <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ierem. 8. 22</note> who maketh glad His owne citie, euen with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of His own Sanctuarie. The lowde sounding trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet <note place="margin">Psalm. 46. 5</note> of vaine and railing wordes, wee leaue to the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the trueth: for that is their armour, wherewith they fight against the Gospell of Christ. Yet let them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that God hath hanged vp a thousand shields in the towre of <hi>Dauid,</hi> euē all the targats of the strong men. <note place="margin">Cant. 4. 4</note> Thus leaning vpon the strength of the armour of God, I set forward to the Historie and Treatises, beseeching the Lord of His vnspekeable fauour and grace to blesse your Ladiship, and all your Noble house for euer,</p>
