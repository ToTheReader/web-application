   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>YR, I am bould to present vnto you these few <hi>MADRIGALES,</hi> and I pray you as you haue heeretofore (rather for your exceeding loue to mee, then for any worth that I acknowledge of the Songs) giuen them your priuate applause &amp; liking, when I sent them to you euer as they were composed in loose papers, so you wil much more now, (for now in-deed when they come to the worlds eye and censure, they had more need of it then euer) Vouchsafe to giue them your good countenance and publick patronage. In trueth I must confesse, they are like young birds feared out of the nest before they be well feathered, &amp; finde no place so fit to light on as on the braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of your fauour: where (such is your loue to mee and Musick) I hope they wilbe so shrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the leaues of your good liking, that you will giue leaue neither to any rauenous Kite nor craftie fowler (I meane neither to any open mouthed <hi>Momus</hi> nor more slie detractor) to deuoure, or harme them, that cannot succor nor shift for themselues. I could wish them a Cage of as many sweet singing <hi>Nightingales</hi> to salute your eares with the choisest of delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Notes and the melody of most eare-pleasing harmony, that your idle time might not passe without delight, if they might yeeld it to you. But whatsoeuer they are, yours they are, &amp; for you onely they were made. It was your good countenance that did encourage mee to this; Your loue to Musick doth not onely chalenge it of mee, but euen the vttermost that Musicks art can afford; which if it were in mee, I would most willingly offer to you; Now let these my affectionate indeuours be accepted, since this is all that I can performe: except the honoring of your Vertues, and obseruance of your worthinesse.</p>

      <signed>Yours in all loue and so obliged, <hi>Thomas Bateson.</hi>
