   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Catholicke Reader, (whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou art) hauing taken some paines in collecting these differences, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto thee, the vsing &amp; perusing of them. Come with a minde voide of preiudice, and behold the schisms of the Church, the lamentable and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull ruine of Christian people; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse men by speedy repentance and earnest deuotion to God, the Authour of peace and concord, preuent these sure imminent perils and dangers. The coate of Christ is rent, his garment
<pb facs="5"/>
is torne in peeces, the world is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and distempered with the rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waues of opinion. Some Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, either in ambitious and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagant thoughts are become furious, giuing out idle fancies for sound and solid nourishment;<note place="margin">Iere. 14.14.</note> (the Prophet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them false visions and the deceite of their owne heart,) or else (as it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in schisme) are misled, yea rather muzled by preiudice: so that there is no sauce, (be it neuer so sweete) which can taste well to their pre-ocupied pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, but only that, which relisheth the venemous gall of bitternes, whereby they may worke the bane and vtter ouerthrow of them which are of a contrary mind▪ the first sort of these men are led to foster Schisme against conscience; to maintaine themselues in Dignities, Wealth, Peace and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. Of which is a number of the learned'st, and most polliticke Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Prelates, Cardinalls, Doctors,
<pb facs="5"/>
and Preachers in the Romish Church. The second is hurled forward, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect, only blowne vp with foolish zeale lacking knowledge; so that there is not a moule-hill this day in Religion betweene the one side and the other, which to them seemeth not to bee an high mountaine. They can see nothing but through perspectiues, making things a far distant seem to be very neere. Or rather they behold the controuersies of Religion, as they doe the Moone in the Horizon, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee a great deale bigger, (though more distant thē the Zenith) then when shee hath iournied a good way in her course. And that, because of the transparant and watrish bodies of the Clowdes interiacent, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the rayes of their sight, and let them not behold that luminous body <hi>in rei veritate,</hi> as it is, but so farre as they can: till the impediments be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued. The first sort, though their
<pb facs="6"/>
power and meanes be greater, yet their action is lesse; nor yet is it so rigorous in playing a part in this dolefull Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie of Church and State deuision: seeing preferment breedeth emulation from without, and arrogancie as a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticke and indiuiduall <hi>Achates,</hi> which let neuer the giddy multitude so doat and admire their actions, as that they can lead by their carriage this wild and vntam'd Colt, to be the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of vpholding Schisme and idle o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. The other sort despising (as it were) dignities, misregarding mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, leauing Father and Mother, Wife and Children, yea all things (so they say) for Christ and his Gospell, (well) take themselues either to a speculatiue and retyred life; and so they shunne the thunderbolts of enuie and hatred; or else they choose an actiue kind of life, to preach the Word in pulpits, to teach it in Schooles, or to giue priuate informations in doctrine and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb facs="6"/>
by conference, disputations, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings, by writing to those, who are farre distant from them, and by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing monuments of their diligence and industry to future ages, for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing their name and pofession. Both these sorts bring admiration, admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enquirie, enquirie notice of the reasōs of their doings, notice breedeth liking of their persons and profession, (especially whē the dunghill of foolish and idolatrous opinions is lustred &amp; guilded with the glistring colours of Rhetoricke, which in the eares of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance soundeth as sweete, as the harmonicall concords of the sweetest-breasted Quiristers.) Liking of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is that, which maketh men now a daies runne to all these heady courses, to murder &amp; massacre poore Christians, to ruinate Cities, dispeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Kingdomes, kill Princes, inuent Gunpowder Treasons; yea what not? And doe the inuentors of these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes,
<pb facs="7"/>
&amp; deuisers of diuersitie, with the vpholders thereof, come first vpon the Stage to act the Prologue of these turbulent Tragedies? No surely. They lie securely all the night long in their beds, in the day time they meditate quietly in their closets how to vphold these pretty tricks, when as the poore Christian world is trauelling thorow moore and marrish, casting ditches and Trenches to defend or offend. And finally the common-wealth is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumētall cause led by the circlings of these vpper powers, in zeale and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to rippe out her bowels from her belly. Good Lord Iesu! when shal these endlesse &amp; needlesse iarring haue an end? when shall the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke liue in vnion of Faith, and communion of Charity? When will the Romish Cleargie lay aside (yea rather banish to Hell) preposterous (yea rather hellish) meanes, vsed for the obtaining of secondarie ends, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb facs="7"/>
and Lucre: for which they so maintaine the lamentable rent of the Christian world? Good Iesu! when will the Laytie (the wiser and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neder sort I meane) see with cleere-sighted eyes, and vnderstand with minds free of preiudice; how they are hood-wincked in an implicit and heart-tongue-tyed faith, beleeuing all things, yet beleeuing nothing; seeing they know not what they beleeue; being like that mad franticke fellow in the Poet, who thought hee was sound in health, though possessed with a deadly ague? Poore people the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie must instruct you; but you should be <hi>Berians;</hi> the Clergie must direct you in <hi>materia fidei:</hi> yet, you ought to enquire for <hi>via trita &amp; regia,</hi> the common path, the by-wayes of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Schoole quiddities,</hi> and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary scar-Crowes, (heresie, to their conceite) and (as they informe you) the contrarieties in matters indefini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb facs="8"/>
the positiue resolutions of matters coniecturall; yea of some things that are not, haue not beene, nor euer shall be, haue so marred the Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: that now adayes most men are become <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> (not in matters of opinion, which would to God all men were, but in things most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to bee done and beleeued) neither hot nor cold. The rest in the fierie hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of contention, thinke verily that it is impossible that their brethren should be saued, if they keepe their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, whereas their brethren are more assured of their owne saluation then they of theirs, though they thinke that they haue their saluation sealed by a most euident and manifest demonstration.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.30.</note> O cruell madnesse so to incroach vpon Gods propertie, who saith, <hi>Ʋengeance is mine, and I will repay.</hi> In whose hands is life and death, who only in his secret Cabinet hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled Fate, fortune, and all the vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb facs="8"/>
diuination of these perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie diuinators, who likewise keepeth cursing and blessing to himselfe. Where is that wonted charity, when it was said, if any man thinketh other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, God shall reueale it. <hi>Origen Hom.</hi> 5. <hi>in Leuit.</hi> saith that there bee some doctrines in Scripture so secret, that euen Priests shall not find them out. But that golden sentence of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. in Genes. ad. lit. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. must be euer in my mouth and in my heart, <hi>Ea moderatio est seruanda, vt in profundo scripturae sensu, praestemus diligentiam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirendi, quam affirmandi temeritatem,</hi> as for the deepe meaning of Scripture, we must be of such a moderation, that wee may rather seeme to be diligent searchers then bold and rash in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. <hi>Cyr. Alex. contra Anthrop. C.</hi> 2. <hi>Subtiles eiusmodi at{que} admodum tritae quaestiones non tam demonstratione dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, quam dubitatione &amp; discussione con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecturali indigent,</hi> such subtil questions
<pb facs="9"/>
stand more in need of doubting thē of demonstration. And so he endeth <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque ergo sacra scriptura non dicit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertè, latere oportet &amp; silentio praeterire,</hi> whatsoeuer things the Scripture spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not plainely, they must not bee expressed, but rather past ouer with silence. If this moderation of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this day were in the Christian Churches; Greeke or Romish, should the Turkish tyrannie of the faithlesse <hi>Ottoman,</hi> so ouer-rule the flourishing and most famous part of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Could the sworne enemies of Christ erect their blasphemous Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues and Mahumetan worship, euen in the gorgious and stately Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall Basilicks? Should <hi>Constantinople</hi> that Queene of beauty and once Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of <hi>Europe,</hi> now bee a denne of Dragons and a mansion of Infidels? Should the inuincible Islands of <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lespont, Aegaeum,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mediterranian</hi> Seas guarded by Nature wonderfully, with
<pb facs="9"/>
Rocks and steepe Mountaines for walls, with the waues of the Ocean beating their sides vncessantly for ditches: Should they (I say) now bee subiect to that monster of Man-kinde, terrour of the Earth and waster of Christendome? <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> sheweth the reason, <hi>Euery man see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his owne things; and not the things of Christ.</hi> This is that, which bringeth this depopulation and seruitude, this hard and cruell yoake both vpon soule and body. Discord and dissention is is the <hi>puppis &amp; prora.</hi> Men should la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to pluck out those things which either hinder the growth of the good seede of the Word, or which let the Word from being receiued; and so all men should liue in charity, for as <hi>Greg. in post.</hi> saith, <hi>discordes tamdiu nullum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni operis sacrificium deo immolant, quamdiu a proximorum charitate discordant,</hi> Men can offer no acceptable sacrifice to God, so long as they are at variance
<pb facs="10"/>
with their brethren. S. <hi>Hieron. ad Rom. Vbi dissentio &amp; invidia, ibi chorus non est:</hi> Where there is discord and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, there is no friendly fellowship; and where there is no fellowship, there is no strength, but all are weake: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they would ioyne hands toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they would be strong enough for all their aduersaries.</p>
   <p>O poore Christians, running to your owne murder, and which is worst, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in selfe-killing, thinking all is well, if you die in your own conceited cause, with the approbation of your hooded Conscience. I aske you, what thinke you shall be your reward from God for dying in such quarrells, as the most part of you doe? The Romish Church will condemne the Greekish, as Schismatike, for her <hi>Fermamentum;</hi> The Greekish will excommunicate and abiure the Romish Church for her <hi>Azyma.</hi> And so the wiser sort can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but either laugh with <hi>Democritus,</hi>
      <pb facs="10"/>
or lament with <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> beholding this mad folly. Greece will not fast vpon Saterdayes, yet Rome will: and herein lieth the plea and action. Good Lord! what shall wee say? I must heere insert the speeches of <hi>Manuel Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leca,</hi> a Greeke, from whom I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all these foolish and futile diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences for the most part, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>contra Graecos, cap. de Ieiunio. Omnino autem de cibis &amp; potibus, &amp; indumentis quae{que} ipse &amp;c.</hi> The Grecians (saith he) make the Latines Heretikes, because they vse not the customes in meat, drinke, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which they vsed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: for they would haue all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth (if it were possible) to obserue the same Ceremonies, which they doe; not knowing that they themselues may bee also rebuked in the same, and such like. And yet it is not impossible, that all the world should be brought vnder one and the same rule, the differences of tongues,
<pb facs="11"/>
of manners, and such like things being no hinderance for the effecting of this; for when the Apostles had visited the whole world, they inforced none to change their ceremonious Customes in common things; but exhorting them to hold fast 10. or 12. princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Articles of Religion, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse them; they made no mention of any thing else, vnlesse it did openly gain-stand the former articles. <hi>O aureum dictum!</hi> a saying to be registred in the hearts, &amp; printed vpon the fore-heads of turbulent and furious spirits now adayes, who cannot indure, but with gnashing of teeth, that any Church or Countrey baptize with crossing after, haue Organs or Altars, Curats, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benders, vse Cap or Surplise, because they haue them not, or rather will not haue them at all; or else because they are in vse in the Popish Church, (a fine reason indeed.) I wonder that these men can indure preaching in a Church
<pb facs="11"/>
built by a Papist, or ringing of Bells, this being a custome vsed by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, or giuing of thankes after meat, seeing the Papist doth the like. And as those men loathe euery Ceremonie which the Romane Church hath: so doth the Romish Church detest the Greeke Church, and shee no lesse the Romish: so that this question being propounded to <hi>Chomatianus,</hi> by a Greeke, Whether it was lawfull for a Greeke to enter into a Latin Church, and worship there being desired; he answered negatiuely, <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Iuris Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum. Balsamon</hi> saith, That all the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Latin church diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the ceremonies of the holy Catholike Church, (he meaneth the Greeke Church) are to be reiected, and no societie to be kept with the Latines, <hi>Ibidem. Cabasila</hi> propounded a question to <hi>Iohn Bishop Citrius,</hi> if the Greeks which were buried in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Churches, and had Hymnes sung
<pb facs="12"/>
at their Funeralls, could be subiect to censure. Yea, after the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> the rage of the Grecians was so great against those that were at the Councell, and accorded to some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles for the purchasing of ayd against the <hi>Turke,</hi> who at that time tooke the neuer enough lamented citie of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> that when they came home, though subiect to the vncertaine and faithlesse mercy of the barbarous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, they excommunicated all those who accorded to the Articles: and when their soules had taken their good night in parting from the body, they cast them like dogs into ditches, and denied them most barbarously the benefit of Christian buriall.</p>
   <p>The Latine Church not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be inferiour to her sister in these prankes, doth serue the Protestants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the like manner: for if any of the reformed Church die amongst them, his soule is determinately sent packing
<pb facs="12"/>
to Hell by the Popes<note n="*" place="margin">For euery Holy Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day he curseth all Protestants.</note> cursing; his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it must either lie vnburied at all, or else it must be carried to some place where Protestants vse to interre their dead. O my soule! what shalt thou think? How must thou meditate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the barbarous and beastly crueltie against the dead bodies of them, who liued to the eyes of all, vnblameable, (perchance) and died in the faith of the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> holding him onely their Redeemer, Sauiour, and Mediatour, baptized in the Name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, giuing testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their comfort and gladnesse in the houre of their death, shewing by their cheerfulnesse the Prognosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and infallible tokens of their entrance and fore-smelling of endlesse glory. Such mens bones doe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists debarre from resting in that Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Grand-mother <hi>Tellus,</hi> where the former Saints bodies, which now in part triumph in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
<pb facs="13"/>
rest, waiting for a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, a perfect beatitude, with a full and plenary indulgence &amp; acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from sin, and her reward, death: for death is the wages and stipend of sinne. Is not this a tyrannie going far beyond that of <hi>Nero,</hi> surpassing that of <hi>Decius,</hi> and an hundred times more execrable than that of <hi>Heliogabalus?</hi> These men can suffer him whom they haue seene with their eyes die in a ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, stabbing and stabbed in a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken humour; or him, who all his life time hath played the throat-cutting Ruffian, or the leacherous whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, and who at last hath dyed in the Poxe, without so much as <hi>poenitendi animus;</hi> yea, him, whom they haue heard with their eares awake <hi>Stix, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,</hi> and <hi>Acheron</hi> with hideous and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bannings, abuse with thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts, and cannon-shot volies of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable oathes the great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name of the euerliuing God: such
<pb facs="13"/>
men (I say) they can indure to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed &amp; incoffined with them, and to haue their portion in their ground, and to lie among them with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of peace, whereas they would striue to ransacke Heauen and Earth; yea, <hi>Acheronta mouerent;</hi> they would euen trouble Hell it selfe, if they did know that any Protestants ashes did rest there. O Lord, how long wilt thou delay, and suffer this vnheard of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? To returne to my purpose. The reason of all these things, is either the want of charitie, or of prudent discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things necessary from things indifferent. This age is pestered, yea, it is consumed with these fire-brands in matters indefinable. Many good Christian people haue vsed direct and indirect meanes to cure this sore, to quench these faggots with their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings full of prudence and pietie; but behold their reward, both the parties haue persecuted them with calumnies,
<pb facs="14"/>
calling them Neutralls, neither <hi>hic,</hi> nor <hi>haec,</hi> Nullifidians, Vbiquitaries: yea, the ordinary censure goeth so far, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out soule and conscience now to call them Atheists; Or else both the parties hate them in such a measure, that they thrust them from their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This maketh the Speakers in this businesse to bee few, but Writers almost none.</p>
   <p>I remember that conferring with a learned man concerning this subiect, I asked him why he did not write his iudgement in these controuersies. His answer was, <hi>Cui vsui reip. Christianae, et cui bono mihi?</hi> telling me, that it could not helpe the generall cause one whit, but doe much hurt to the doer. I know many such on both sides, who lament the Schisme, and yet cannot helpe it. Oh that the Roman Church, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the beautifullest amongst wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that fairest and most glistering Church amongst all her Sisters milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb facs="14"/>
vpon Earth, would acknowledge her selfe to be a Sister and not a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris. There was a time when she gaue her helping hand, (as at the famous Councells of <hi>Nice, Ephesus, Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi>) and did not rule with a dictatory power. There was a time, when in an harmonicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord she was moued with the rest of her planeticall and wandring Sisters in this vaile of sorrow and triall, by the reuolution of her first mouer, and did shine amongst them all like <hi>Phoebus</hi> in his Spheare; imparting out of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion and charytie that portion of light, which her Redeemer had made her Hand-maide of euen then, when <hi>Arrianisme</hi> had ouer-runne all the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient</hi> and <hi>Affrick,</hi> when <hi>Ierome</hi> cried out of it, <hi>Ingemuit mundus se Arrianum esse factum;</hi> but now the fogge of her smoakie vapours obscureth the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rayes of Religion and Charity, which in the latter ages are so fast
<pb facs="15"/>
rushing to their Sun-set, yea to their lamentable and darkesome midnight. Alas, who shall furnish my eyes with floods of waters? &amp; who shall make my head a liuing spring, that from henceforth I may water my Couch with sorrowfull teares? Let mee mourne with the Turtle, and chatter with the Crow, for the losse of my beloued: Hee is gone and left his people to their own fancies and luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke toyes. Our sinnes haue banished him; let repentance recall him. Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in faith hath lost him; let feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie find him. Vnsetled hope could not keepe him; let steadfastnesse lay hold on him. Periurie, Swearing, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, Idoll-worship, haue shut the doore of our soules vpon him: Let feare, reuerence, with regard of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Maiestie and illimited power open againe vnto him. Contempt of his Sabbath made him loath vs; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting his Sanctuary will force him
<pb facs="15"/>
to loue vs Mis-regard of Superiours, Parents, &amp; Magistrates, hath made vs Tutorlesse; obedience to our Prince, loue to our Magistrates, regard to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, will make him haue a care of vs. Lying, Slaunderous Callumnies, Backbiting our Neighbours, haue made him suffer these intestine Iarres in Religion and worship; loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Brethren will make him reunite our affections in one.</p>
   <p>This Treatise of differences I col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, partly by reading partly by the helpe of some acquaintance of mine tenne yeares agoe in the <hi>Low-Countries. Petrus van Heiffen</hi> (one of my owne profession) at my request collected all he could finde by his reading in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and searching of Libraries; <hi>Iekan Heymer</hi> (a Papist) by his trauailes to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> helped me with the oddest peeces he could finde, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing also trauailed in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, where by conferring with
<pb facs="16"/>
some <hi>Grecians,</hi> he got most sure intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of their opinions. These scrowles I kept these tenne yeares, to see if any other had handled this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect before in the English tongue; and hauing found by diligent enquirie and scruteny, that no man heretofore hath touched this matter in this tongue, I thought good (Christian brother) to let thee smell these differences, that perceiuing the stinking streames which runne from these impure and muddy Springs, thou maist learne to haue a care of thy selfe. <hi>Aristotle</hi> taught Sophisticall captions, not that his Schollers should practise Sophistry, but that they should be able to repell it. The <hi>Persians</hi> were wont to paint a whore with one hand in the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans pocket, and with the other hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a knife to cut his throat; not that their youths should frequent the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of naughty and lewd women, but that they should seek by all meanes
<pb facs="16"/>
possible to shun them and their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable tricks. <hi>O how ioyfull a thing is it to see brethren hold fast the bond of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and amity.</hi> If a man would but behold these Controuersies as a neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall only, thē should he plainly see the errours of both sides, where as spleene and choller doth hinder any man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged on either side from searching the truth. The <hi>Turkes</hi> in their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>Mahumetan</hi> worship, the <hi>Pagans</hi> in worshipping the Sunne &amp; Moone, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in their <hi>Isis</hi> and <hi>Osyris,</hi> the <hi>Numidians, Lybians,</hi> in their seruing of cats, dogges, onyons and leekes, vse diuersitie of Ceremonies and Rites; yet they still retaine the<note n="*" place="margin">Because there is no good bond of friend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship but that which is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God and his worship.</note> ill-tied knot of friendship in their Idol-seruice. But Christians thunder calumnies and bolt excommunications one against another, if there be but a difference in any kinde of Ceremonies. Christian brethren, this maketh those that are without to be scandalized by vs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
<pb facs="17"/>
to loath our profession, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our faith, to persecute our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to ouerthrow our Kingdomes, to spoyle our Countries, to depriue vs of our liberties and priuiledges, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force many weake ones to imbrace I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, to torture the constant with intolerable, yea vnexpressable tormēts, to the end they may make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Christianitie; yea, which is worst of all, they by our diuisions, are kindled with such hatred against vs, and with such zeale to their owne profession, that they thinke they doe God good seruice, and a great benefit to poore soules, when they make them abiure their faith and baptisme. O mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Christians! returne, returne vnto the Lord, for you haue falne by your iniquities, returne (I say) vnto him, and he will cure you of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities. Earnest prayer, endlesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, volumes of mourning Madri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galls, like <hi>Dauids</hi> Penitentialls, clouds
<pb facs="17"/>
of watry sighs; <hi>Nineuies</hi> fasting, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses</hi> repentāce, <hi>Peters</hi> weeping, with <hi>Pauls</hi> reformation, is the sole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridaticke, the soueraigne <hi>Pandoron,</hi> the true <hi>Alexipharmacon,</hi> the purest sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the rarest compound that can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen this vlcer, ransacke this botch, and cure this incurable, and neuer enough to be lamented dissease of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world. <hi>O vtinam tantum facerent qui possunt, quantum volo qui nil valeo,</hi> Would to God the Potentates &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of the Earth (the Kings and Princes I meane of Christendome) would ioyne hand in hand to build the walls of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to raise vp the Towers of <hi>Sion.</hi> O where is there a <hi>Zorobabel</hi> to re-edefie the walles of the old Temple? the Temple had a <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to build her, a <hi>Zorobabel</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build her, though not so sumptuous as she was at first, yet in great pompe and glory.</p>
   <p>I sue for no new <hi>Salomon:</hi> there
<pb facs="18"/>
must be but one, euen he who foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Church with his blood, the Lambe of God, <hi>Mactatus à iactus mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di fundamentis,</hi> the Prince of peace, the Authour of loue; yet we may haue, yea, we haue presently many <hi>Zoroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> many Masters of worke in the Christian world: some Greekish, some Latine, and some Reformed; some Russian, some Armenian, some Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, some Abissine; euery one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the measure of his iudgement and Learning, would helpe to repaire those Breaches. And that this may be effected, you sacred Monarchs vse your authoritie, you nursing Fathers, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise with the rod where there is need of the same: Cut away with the Sword of Iustice, (which you carry not in vaine) the trunkes of Pride, Vaine-glory, and Selfe-loue, which ouer-whelme the Clergie for the most part: Learned Schoole men, leaue the brainsicke and foolish inventions of
<pb facs="18"/>
      <hi>Aristotle, Philoponus, Themistius Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,</hi> leaue (I say) to mingle them with the pure and liuing Christall Springs of the Word. Writers of Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies hunt not after Victory ambitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>vbi lis est de lana caprina,</hi> for the most part: But search Truth, <hi>sincero, &amp; animo candido,</hi> knowing that your account shall be great before God, if you leade the poore ignorant to fall in the ditch. And this I say not so much for any danger that is in any moderne opinion, but in respect of the great and dangerous scandall, whereby wee offend the weake and tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the poore and ignorant Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which solemnely sweareth (being so by vs informed) that euery poynt of Controuersie is either an Article of a new Creed, or else a new Article ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Creed; and the Laitie erring in Iudgement, doe thunder all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minds to hell for euer. And so the sinne of the people is not so much
<pb facs="19"/>
an errour of beleefe, (though muzled vp like blind bayards in ignorance, and implicite faith) as it is the defect of charitie towards their brethren, which is the greatest sinne a man can commit against his Neighbour: yea, it maketh a man hard in his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and without repentance, and therefore damnable.</p>
   <p>I remember, that once conferring with a Cousin of mine, a prudent and learned Gentleman, compleat in all endowments of body and mind, (his want of charitie onely being excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) he said, Woe is mee, that you should be in Hell, when I am in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, seeing you are an Heretike, (Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant he meant) I answered, Well Sir, you are too rash in iudging. I am as sure (said hee) of your damnation, if you die a Protestant, as that Christ is in heauen at the right hand of the Father. I answered, You that are Papists are very sure of our damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="19"/>
I wonder greatly, that your are neuer sure of your owne saluation: But thus much I tell you, I will not sit vpon Gods Tribunall, to giue out the Sentence of condemnation against you; yet since you lacke charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me your Christian Brother, and giue out the sentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against me so peremptorily, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Gods part vpon you: I thinke you will be damned, except you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent you of your speech. And take not my Iudgement for rash, since I iudge the Tree by the Fruit, and you by your Charitie, which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and cardinall Vertue of the law. Deuout Preachers, fill your Sermons from the Store-house of Scripture: informe in faith from Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and from the first and second of <hi>Iames:</hi> reforme manners from <hi>Ieremie, Ezechiell, Hosea,</hi> and <hi>Ioel:</hi> denounce iudgements from <hi>Zacharia, Amos, Ionas, Michaiah:</hi> teach your
<pb facs="20"/>
selues from <hi>Titus,</hi> and <hi>Timothie.</hi> This is all your taske, and to liue well, and goe before the people like the fierie Pillar in the night, and the Cloud in the day, to guide them, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue them from Schisme and Heresie. Doe not spend your time in inventing Rhethoricke to admiration, critticke Methods for emulation, vnprofitable Questions breeding Controuersies: Feed not the itching eares of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous people with Nouelties, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse questions, and vnhandsomely borrowed Similies. In touching and taxing your Aduersaries in Pulpits, (which would to God you did more seldome) doe not so much endeauour to make them odious to your people, as to make your hearers commiserate their estate, for whom Christ died; and to mooue your Auditorie to pray for their conversion, and not for their confusion. Our prayer to God should be to suspend his Iudgements,
<pb facs="20"/>
and to helpe vs with grace, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to giue it for measure, and when hee pleaseth to giue it for time. Prayer should bee Optatiue, desiring and wishing with feare and humilitie, no wayes Imperatiue, enioyning sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and circumstance to God, that he would inflict such punishment, at such time, and in such place, vpon such and such persons. Popish curses and Excōmunications, (the Sword which vntie the Gordian knot of the Church, the Hammer which broake the wall in the mids, the noyse which must not be heard at the rebuilding of the Temple.) I abhorre with my soule, since the peremptory and rash Excommunications, the drawing of the Sword of God vpon euery idle oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion scandalously, and many times in derision of God and his Church, the cutting off men from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for little causes, for no causes; yea for vertuous actions, and reproouing
<pb facs="21"/>
of sinnes offensiue to God, and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious to man, haue occasioned, bred, brought to light, nourished, and yet still foster the rent of the Church. Lord giue vs affections to loue peace, hearts to bewaile the Schisme, and then will we hope for Vnion. Which (O Lord) in thy due time performe to thy glory, the honour of thy Sonne, and the comfort of those who shall perseuere in thy grace to the end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
