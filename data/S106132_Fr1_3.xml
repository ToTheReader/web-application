   <l>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen first by happy chance I cast my fight</l>
   <l>Vpon the sparkling lustre, beauty bright</l>
   <l>Of your rich jewell lockt-up &amp; enclos'd</l>
   <l>In a neat Cabinet: I, strait suppos'd</l>
   <l>It was great pitty, such a pretty jemme</l>
   <l>Should be shut up from publike view of them</l>
   <l>Who could not with the Latine Key unlocke</l>
   <l>Your Casket, and partake of your rich stocke.</l>
   <l>I therefore have (most worthy Sir) made bold</l>
   <l>To ope the Locke, lay ope your jemme of gold,</l>
   <l>To every gracious eye and godly minde</l>
   <l>That in such Iewels can pure pleasure finde</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="4"/>And, thus with my weake breath your Trump to sound</l>
   <l>In a knowne tone, whose eccho might rebound,</l>
   <l>And on the hearers hearts reverberate</l>
   <l>To minde their present and their future state.</l>
   <l>And (hence) I must ingenuously confesse,</l>
   <l>I primely should and would the same addresse</l>
   <l>Vnto your worthy-selfes sole acceptation</l>
   <l>Were I not bound by most strict obligation</l>
   <l>To those my honour'd friends forementioned</l>
   <l>By cords of many favours thereto led.</l>
   <l>But next to them, accept, I humbly pray</l>
   <l>This borrowed-light from your suns lustrous ray;</l>
   <l>These bubling streames, weake straines that have their motion,</l>
   <l>From your full fount, as tribute to your ocean.</l>
   <l>In confidence of which great courtesie</l>
   <l>Thereof perswaded, by your piety,</l>
   <l>Praying your Worship may be aye possest</l>
   <l>Of all true holy, happy joyes; I rest,</l>
