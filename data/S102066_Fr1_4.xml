      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is some time since, good Christian Reader, that lighting on the Iesuits Apologie, I receiued the same with purpose to refute it, if the matter so imported. Perusing it ouer, I found it curiouslie penned with picked termes, and beautified with plausible and popular persuasions &amp; reasons: but as for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stāce or learning, or weight of proofe, I saw nothing in it that should occupie a meane Scholer the space of two daies. Laying that booke therefore aside I determined at mine own choice and libertie to handle the matters there most impugned, I meane <hi>the othe</hi> and the <hi>Princes supremacy,</hi> in such sort as men of meane capacitie, abused by their secret whisperinges and open raylings might plainly perceiue, both the Princes power to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund</hi> for truth to be lawfull and good, and the Iesuits cauils impugning the same to be vaine and childish.</p>
   <p>As I was in this resolution, &amp; saw no cause, for that I should refute no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect aduersarie, to make more hast than both health, which was not great: &amp; businesse, which I cannot want, would suffer me: there hapned an iniurie to bee offered to the inheritance of the College where I am, by a false title de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from before the foundation of the house, and so strengthened on euery side with auncient deedes and euidence, that the forgerie was hard to bee discerned and harder to be conuinced but by infinite searching in the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niments of many churches and Bishopricks as well as in our owne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examining sundrie large and laborious commissions which they had taken out before my time, to testifie the keeping and iustifie the deliuering of those suspected deedes and ligiers. To the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ecting and impugning of this, no person was or would be vsed (I speake for the paines and not for the skill) but my selfe, the cause was so huge, the comparing of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and contrarieties both of deeds and witnesses so tedious: the proofe so perplexed and intricate: and the daunger so neerely touched the whole state of the house: I was forced for two yeares to lay all studies aside and addict my selfe wholy first to the deprehending, and then to the pursuing of this falsehood.</p>
   <p>No sooner had I breathed from this vnwoonted trauell, and betaken my selfe to my former purpose, but my happe was to light on the Iesuites <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of English Catholikes,</hi> not hauing the Authors name, but in order of writing and phrase of speech resembling right D. <hi>Allen</hi> the maker of their Apologie: Looking earnestly into the contents thereof, I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the pen-man to haue such confidence in his tongue that hee doubted not but to ouerrule the world with words, &amp; his pretensed policies. So far he wadeth in other mens causes and common wealthes: So boldly he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth what himselfe pleaseth of Popes and princes, and of their titles, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selles, Lawes and actions, neither alloweth hee any man to bee religious or
<pb facs="8"/>
catholike but such as him-selfe liketh: and euerie-where hee sheweth a speciall care to smooth and stroke his holy Fathers indeuors and censures, actes and iudgementes, warres and wickednesse with termes of the greatest deuotion and reuerence: subiecting all things vnder his feete, inuesting him with both swords, and suffering no man, king nor Cesar to haue assurance of honor or life longer than he kneeleth downe and adoreth <hi>the image of the beast.</hi> In this maiestical course &amp; surrly conceit hee goeth on, thinking he can captiuate kingdomes with the volubilitie and intemperauncy of his tongue; which is so swift to furnish a lie, that he disdaineth the basenesse &amp; plainesse of trueth.</p>
   <p>The saucinesse and egernesse of that <hi>Defence,</hi> I was then, and am yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded to ouerskip: as hauing learned that princes affaires and actions are aboue my vocation, and wholy without my profession: neither doe I thinke it lawfull for priuate men rashly to speake, or possible for them vprightly to iudge of Princes doinges, vnlesse they be fully acquainted with the secretes and circumstances of the things, which Princes vse not to commit to many, nor to any but those that are of their counsell. I therefore then did &amp; now do determine to leaue this peremptorie prater, whosoeuer he be, to his own vaine: knowing that besides open rightes and titles, secret preuentions are often vsed betweene Realmes, and sometimes reuenges, which Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates by lawful meanes may procure. <hi>Onely the Popes power to depriue Princes,</hi> which with all his skill, learning and eloquence hee seeketh to proue and perswade to the people of this Realme, (as the chiefest Bulwark of their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> that were condemned, he saith for religion, we say for treason, and in deed the very ground of all their actions) I thought needefull to examine; and to let the simple see, on what a sandy slime they haue built as well their consciences as their Colleges, and in how wretched and vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous a quarell they haue hazarded their liues in this world, and their soules in the next, to inlarge the power and make vp the purse of their Rhemish founder.</p>
   <p>Taking that therefore in hande I haue worde by worde refelled the fifth chapter of their <hi>Defence</hi> which purposely treateth of this matter: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted so much of the fourth as tended to this ende, the rest being a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie pang of their vnbridled eloquencc: as also I haue ripped vp the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full attemptes and tumults of Popes these last fiue hundred yeares, (for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time Antichrist neither was, nor durst be so bold) presuming to displace &amp; depose their Lord &amp; Maister, the Romane Emperor, &amp; incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering him &amp; other Princes with treasons, poysons, battayles, bloodsheds, periuries, &amp; treacheries, such as Christendom neuer before tasted of, &amp; euer since rued. Where, I haue not only opened the facts &amp; noted the meeknes of their martial spirits, but haue vnfoulded the causes &amp; quarels for which those Princes were thus pursued with such excommunications and depriuations from <hi>Rome</hi>; shewing as I go, the Italian stories in fauour of their countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and foreman the Pope, to bee exceeding partiall.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>The like order I would haue followed in their <hi>Apologie,</hi> but that, as I first protested, I found nothing in it worthy to bee refuted, vnlesse I should haue banded their idle and emptie termes backe againe to them with others of the same making, and so brought the cause of Christ and trueth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to a warfare of woordes: which I neither ought, nor would. If any man thinke me no indifferent iudge of their paines, it may please him to cast his eye on the second sheete, and hee shall find all the proofes and places of their <hi>Apologie</hi> aunswered in three leanes: and of those fewe and weake quotations to haue made a conquest in open writing had beene incke and paper ill imployed. I would therefore not take that course, which seemed to me neither needeful nor profitable: but to benefite the poore deceiued subiectes of this Realme and bring the Iesuites cause to the touch-stone in deede, I haue chosen the principall intentes of their <hi>Apologie,</hi> on which their whole foundation standeth; and after mine owne course debated them more exactly and largely than the confutation of their <hi>Apology</hi> would haue suffered me.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The chiefest matters of the Apologie.</note>For where they pretend they departed for lacke of the <hi>Catholike Sacrifice, Sacramentes and Seruice,</hi> which want in this Realme;<note place="margin">

      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.</note> who seeth not that these assertions being the seueral brāches of their <hi>Apologie,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend either on religion, that is in strife betwixt vs: or on the Princes power, which they impugne: or on the Popes claime to bee head of the church, which we deny? And therefore the proofe or disproofe of their particular actions, must be fet and deriued from those chiefe and capitall springs.</p>
   <p>The consideration whereof first induced mee to neglect the rouing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, and vaunting florishes of their <hi>Apologie</hi> no lesse voide of trueth than of proofe, and to betake my selfe to a stricter and directer kinde of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the most materiall pointes on which the rest did hang: as first their running to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; siding themselues with the Pope as Christs Vicar gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall against their Prince, for which they haue no president in the primatiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Church. The next is the princes power to commaund for trueth, and right to beare the sword within her owne Realme ouer all persons for thinges and causes as well Ecclesiasticall as Temporall, without any subiection or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Popes tribunall, which I prooue is agreeable to the Lawes of
<pb facs="9"/>
God and practise of Christes church: and therefore the oth importing the same to be good and godlie. Thirdly the Popes censuring and depriuing princes of their crownes, I shew to be nothing else but a wicked &amp; vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> pride &amp; contumelie not long since deuised by Antichrist to frustrate the word and ordinance of almighty God, and to make himselfe great: and so of force the subiects, which be partakers with him in that hainous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie, by perswading, assisting, executing, or defending the same in worde or deede against their princes, to bee traytours and not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, if they die for that quarell: Lastly the publique reformation of diuine Sacramentes and Seruice made by her Maiestie, I declare to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and Catholike: and the partes of poperie repealed and abolished by the lawes of this Realme, to be repugnant, (I speak for the substance of thē, and not for certain indifferent ceremonies in them) to the sacred scriptures and ancient fathers.</p>
   <p>Other incident and adiacent matters I haue handled, and those not a fewe, as the generall and speciall contentes before and after will better insinuate: but these foure bee the pointes that beare the burden both of their first <hi>Apologie</hi> for their Seminaries, and last <hi>Defence of English Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes.</hi> By these shal we soone discerne the truth or falshood of their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; clamors against the Princes Lawes and such as are authorized by her highnesse: &amp; therefore from the sober &amp; sad discussing hereof, if they get them, as they haue done to outragious and tragicall exclamations, we must leaue them as men wilfully diuerting from the right way, &amp; crying as loude as they can for life, to drowne the voices of such as woulde recall them.</p>
   <p>If they looke that all the parts of their <hi>Defence</hi> should haue bin answered in like sort as the fifth chapter is, that labour I say for a man of my calling wold haue bin as fruitles, as it is needles: the proofs that are not here discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>afely be despised, the rest of their rolling rhetorik, a diuine neither need regard, nor should repeate. As much as is inforcing, &amp; to their purpose, is here cōprised: their politik obseruations, as they be for the most part fals &amp; passing slāderous: so to their defēce are they idle &amp; altogether superfluous; and argue rather mindes loaden with malice, and tongues fraighted with poyson against the present state euen for very temporall and ciuill affaires: than anie religious or dutifull respect of authoritie and submission to the Magistrate. But such is the doctrine and education of their Romish semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: they fell first to flattering, and because that tooke no place, in a rage they be now run to leude and open slaundering. An example whereof, to him that hath the booke, and may read it, appeareth, as through the the whole, so in fewe lines pag. 177. more spitefull wordes than which the rankest caterpiller in Rome could not haue vttered against the state and kingdom where wee liue: not touching the persecution which they suffer, but obiecting in plaine wordes to the whole body of her Maiesties most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable

   <p>This is one of the reasons why I neither might nor would at large refell their Iesuiticall <hi>Defence of English Catholikes,</hi> as they terme it: in deede an artificiall inuectiue defacing and slaundering the publike Gouernment of this realme to the vttermost of their powers. The other is for that the summe and effect of those chapters which I haue omitted, and might not without offence to the state be published, are wholy reduced to those principal que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions which I haue handled.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The summe of the Defence.</note>In their first, second, and fourth chapters their chiefe scopes are these, that <note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>cap.</hi>

      </note>
      <hi>behaued them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues verie discreetly, and nothing seditiously in their answeres to the questions of the Bull of Pius Quintus.</hi> In these the wise Reader soone perceiueth the whole contention toucheth the Popes iurisdiction and claime denied him by the Lawes of this Realme, and his power to depriue the Prince of her crowne and scepter, which was the sole respect the Bull of Pius Quintus had. The iustifying then of these two foundations with cleare and pregnant proofes had beene requisite for the Iesuites, if they had purposed to manifest the innocencie of their brethren: where nowe by their rhetoricall vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries inucighing at the partes and circumstances of their inditementes, conuictions and executions, they storme at the course, which the Iudges obserued, but saie nothing to the crime wherewith the guiltie were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened.</p>
   <p>The Popes power to depriue Princes, they will say, they haue fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and so their brethren in trueth and equitie to be cleared. If that were so, they sayde somewhat: but as I haue shewed they profferre it often, they neuer proue it. And therefore on the contrarie part, as I neede not strengthen the publike iudgements of this Realme with the particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes, behauiors, hopes and enterprises of the Iesuites hauing their triall in Courtes of Recorde and places of vsuall and open iustice: neither is that incident to my calling or requisite in these cases: so for the maine and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ground of the crime there fastned on them, and after punished in thē; which was, that to aide, assist, persuade or defend the Popes Bull depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Prince of her crowne and throne, to incourage her Subiectes or enimies on that pretence to rebellion or inuasion, was high and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous treason, the trueth, I say of this illation, is euident by the third part of this my booke, where that point of their <hi>Defence is refuted.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>So for the rest, which would needes venter their liues in the like quarell: I meane for inuesting the Pope with the princes sworde: the Iesuites should
<pb facs="10"/>
haue brought sound and sufficient proofe that the Pope by Gods lawe hath a <hi>Soueraigne and supreme</hi> power ouer this Realme, to make Lawes, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point penalties, to dispose the goods, landes, and bodies of Clerkes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for such causes and crimes as they count spirituall. For this is the power which the Pope lately vsurped in this Realme; and from which hee is now rightly and orderly repelled by the Lawes of the same. It is no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with vs to make him chiefe Pastour of your soules, nor to giue him an Episcopall or Apostolicall authoritie ouer the whole Church, though that also bee a wicked and frantike Heresie: but to giue him an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall dominion, and coerciue iurisdiction ouer this Realme aboue and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Prince, which the Apostles of Christ neither had, nor could haue without apparent iniurie to the Magistrate: this is it the <hi>Execution of iustice</hi> doeth duelie respect, and this is farre from any matter of faith or religion. Right to commaunde, and power to compell belong properly to the sworde by the Lawe of God: which they can not attribute to the Pope, but they must make him a Superiour Magistrate to the prince in guiding and prescribing the vse of the sworde, and consequently the prince to holde her sword and scepter at his pleasure: and if she refuse, to be streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way displaced.</p>
   <p>This wilie conueiaunce to tie Princes swordes fast to the Popes side, and to spoyle them of their Crownes, if they doe not execute his rage, is the chiefest plotte that Iesuites haue at this instant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settle the kingdome of Antichrist, for which they haue not so much as the paring of anie Scripture or Councell, or Father in the Church of Christ for a thowsande yeares: and yet in our dayes it must bee a <hi>meere matter of Religion</hi>: and the forefront of their brethrens defence. But no maruell if they, which make open rebellion a point of their faith, so soone consent to haue the Popes presumption holden, as the surest key of their Religion.</p>
   <p>To their thirde chapter, that <hi>they haue great cause to complaine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust persecution, intollerable seueritie and crueltie towardes Catholikes in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande: and wee no reason to doe the like for the iustice (as thy call it) doone on vs in Queene Maries and other Princes dayes,</hi> I neede not replie. To this conceite of the Iesuites, that they may consume whome they will with fire and faggotte, and no man must stoppe them of their passage, or hinder their pastimes without iniustice and crueltie: what shoulde I saie, but that I thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e the Scribe was skant waking, whiles hee was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this drowsie Diuinitie? What learning, I will not aske what witte, was in this, to make such definitiue resolutions that no Prince may amerce or imprison their adherentes without intollerable seueritie and crueltie? forsooth, they might hang and burne olde and young, men and women, for doubting of their Decretalles, and all this with prayse, though <hi>it neuer pleased anie good man in the Catholike Church</hi> that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes
<pb facs="11"/>
should be put to death for onely religion as S. Augustine verie ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly auoucheth?</p>
   <p>Their sixt chapter is a maruelous profound Rhetorication, that <hi>it is much to the benefite and stabilitie of Common wealthes and specially of Kinges Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>

      <hi>that the differences betwixt them and their people for Religion or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause for which them may seeme to deserue depriuation, may rather be decided, by</hi> (the Pope as the Iesuits would haue it, and so they shall be on the surest side) <hi>than by Popular mutinie and phantasie of priuate men as</hi> (wee) <hi>desire and practise,</hi> or else they bely vs, which is no wonder in such Seminists. To these trifling and tedious discourses of men trusting wholie to their tongues, and seeking with deintie speach and couched termes to hoodwinck Princes eyes, and delight subiects eares, that all the world may daunce in a string, after the pope and his nourceries, what other aunswer should we giue, then, that, if there were not a God to be serued and honoured, who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the sword to Princes, and will exact at their hands the well vsing of the same for the publike maintenance of his will and worship, surely Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces should doe more safely to followe that aduise of the Iesuits. For their holie father will neuer leaue practising by all the meanes hee possibly may to subuert their states, and shorten their liues, except they receiue his keyes and busse his shoes.</p>
   <p>The warres of Ireland and dangers of England, which this roming man so much bableth of, as matters of State, I referre to such as be Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth men,<note place="margin">The defence <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>fol.</hi> 140.</note> I will not passe the bounds of my profession; the Pope may continue his olde worme-eaten <hi>claime to the Soueraigntie of Ireland,</hi> which these louing subiects pleade in open writing against the Crowne of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: and God no doubt hath meanes enow to visite our sinnes, vnlesse it please him to be mercifull and gracious to this Realme; but as we from the bottome of our harts, submit our selues to his holy will, and wisdome, as well to tast of his chastisement, whereof all his children are partakers, as to enioy his blessings: so let these prophane Rouers and Vaunters vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the arme of God is long enough to reach euen them and their holy father at Rome, and to take from him his desired vsurpation of the kingdomes of England, Scotland, Fraunce and Spaine, &amp;c. though he shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle neuer so shamefully to keepe them in his obeysaunce.</p>
   <p>For the matters handled, this may suffice: for the manner, I haue not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges, good Christian Reader, to warne thee of. By forme of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues I thought best to lay open the whole before thine eyes, as well for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding of tedious repetitions, as for adding of perspicuitie, to the pointes, which I would haue knowen to the simpler sort, as farre as the nature and weight of the thinges them-selues permit. And being to refute no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine text, I was constrained to take this course, that I might in the aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries person obiect not only what they had said, if it were worth the hearing, but I am sure what they could say, that the matter might be more manifest.

If any thinke I fauour my selfe in opposing:<note place="margin">I catch not after cauils nor vse to seek for nouelties, as hauing to doe with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping &amp; quicke eyed aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</note> besides that in euery part I bring the very choice of their strongest and latest proofs, as in the first and second part, their <hi>Apologie</hi>: in the third, their <hi>Defence of Catholikes</hi>: in the fourth, their <hi>Rhemish Testament</hi>: whether I spare to presse and persue the same to the vttermost, let the Christian Reader in Gods name be my iudge. It may be the aduersarie would haue often replied in hotter and larger manner: but my intent was to discusse the thinges, and not to holde on a brable in wordes: and of that which to any purpose might bee saide I haue omitted nothing.</p>
   <p>And yet somtimes though seeldom where the place so forceth, I stick a little at a letter, and shew howe greate a chaunge it maketh in the sense, which is soone missed in the printe:<note place="margin">Part. 4. pag. 583. Part. 1. pag. 53. Chrysost. epi. 1. ad Innocen.</note> As where in Sainct Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine they printe <hi>Esset,</hi> I thinke it should bee <hi>Esse</hi>: And so likewise in Chrysostome, (whose Greeke exemplar I then hadde not when I first mistrusted the Latine) the worde is printed <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>Suffer thy selfe to bee intreated to write.</hi> Which the verbes precedent &amp; consequent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port should be <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. <hi>Suffer your selues to be intreated to write,</hi> &amp; so the other parte of the sentence doth plainly conuince where hee saith <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, and graunt vs to enioy your letters still, &amp; your loue, and all other things as before. for is easily ouerseene: and yet in the matter the difference is much, though not so much that it shoulde either helpe them, or hurte vs: as they perhaps will imagine. In these and such like corrections of words or printes I leaue the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reader to his iudgement when he considereth the sentence: and yet I see no reason why the aduersarie should builde himselfe on such sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected places.</p>
   <p>In the fourth parte, I haue examined the chiefe and publike actions of the Rhomish Church, which are nowe reformed by the lawes of this Realme: and not only refuted them as vncatholike, but confirmed the Sacramentes and Seruice of the Church of England to bee conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the sacred Scriptures and Catholike Fathers. In handling the which, where their Rhemish Testament offered any shew of proofe, I haue particularly refelled their authorities: where they fayled, I was constrained to make the Iesuite supply of his owne the best obiections that they haue. <hi>Other thinges named in the beginning of my fourth parte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the volume increased, and they were not so materiall partes of the Church Seruice as the former, I haue reserued to bee handled by themselues in a seuerall treatie.</hi>

   <p>Of quotations and translations I had speciall care in my copy, that they should be direct and true, howsoeuer the Composers haue now and then displaced the one, and in the other not distinguished my additions, which I sometimes interserted to illustrate the rest, with an other letter and two inclosures in my copy: and this caueat I am forced to giue thee gentle Reader, that whatsoeuer in alleaging is inclosed with two halfe

Moones () though it bee the same letter with the rest, yet it is no part of that authoritie which I cite, but my adiection to shewe the force of the place I produced, because I could not stand beating on euerie word, without extreme losse of time and labour.</p>
   <p>The Lord treade downe Satan vnder our feete, that the honour may bee his, and the comfort ours, and abolish the strength of wickednesse till his comming.</p>
