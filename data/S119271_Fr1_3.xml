   <p>THis Dedicatory custome (as <hi>Lactantius</hi> testifies) hath beene since the time of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> and as I conceiue) will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue during the time of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that <hi>is,</hi> the Planet so called, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that a booke set forth
<pb facs="3"/>without a Dedication, doth inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or raise a suspition in the Reader, that the Author studies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute (as one vnworhy of a <hi>Mecoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</hi> For which cause, when I had finished this Translation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my slender skill and weak wit, whereof I may say with <hi>Ouid,</hi>
      <q>
         <l>Ingenium fregêre meum mala, cuius &amp; ante,</l>
         <l>Fons infecundus, paruaque vena fuit.</l>
      </q> Musing with my selfe, to whose Patronage I might especially commend it, your noble worth worthy Sir, which way so soeuer I turn'd me, did still present it selfe to my vnsetled mind, considering
<pb facs="3"/>the generall fame of your pious inclination to vertue and good discipline (both which are copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously taught and exprest in these Epigrams) with detestation of the contrary. Yet (worthy Sir) more exactly weighing that Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble course of life, wherin your set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led industry (by no vicious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cize interrupted) hath proued so proficient, that diuers yeeres si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence you haue meritoriously at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Worshipfull degree of Barrister (which is rare in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so youthfull) and are growne old in wisdome, learning, and experience, I conceiued this pety Paper-present, as well for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of its subiect from the
<pb facs="4"/>matter of your practice, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of my rude workemanship hereupon bestowed, to be farre be-beneath and come short of your illustrious merit. Howbeit <hi>Plinie</hi> saies, it was vsuall with Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to make supplication vnto the Gods with Milke, and when they wanted Frankincense, to sacrifice with a Cake made of meale, water, and salt, which (as hee thought) was no lesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted then the most costly and odoriferous burnt-offerings.</p>
   <p>Let therefore (worthy Sir) your nobly-disposed hart with a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full benignitie, entertaine this gratefull and zealous oblation, how meane and vnmeet soeuer it
<pb facs="4"/>is, from the hands of him that will not only pray for your health and prosperous proceedings, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to deserue your fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble regard by all respectiue seruice in his power, and approue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe</p>
