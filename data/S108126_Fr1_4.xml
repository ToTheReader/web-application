      <l>THE British soyle, with all therin that lies,</l>
      <l>The surging Seas, which compasse it about</l>
      <l>In what estate of heate, or colde of skies</l>
      <l>It stands, with many thinges of other rout:</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Lhuyd</hi> in this booke hath put thē out of doubt.</l>
      <l>Which though in viewe, it be of body smale:</l>
      <l>in breif discourse it doth comprise them all.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>
         <hi>¶ Ptolom</hi> his pen it seemes he had in hand.</l>
      <l>Somtimes in Seas, with NEPTVNE he did dwel</l>
      <l>IVNO to skies pluckt him to view the land,</l>
      <l>Els surely could he not haue done so well,</l>
      <l>That thus so right of euery thing doth tell,</l>
      <l>As though he stoode aloft, and downe did looke,</l>
      <l>And what he saw: wroat straight into his booke</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶Ech Hill, ech dale, ech water worth the name,</l>
      <l>With Forests wide, and many a standing Wood,</l>
      <l>Ech Citie, Towne, ech Castle great of fame,</l>
      <l>Ech King, &amp; prince spronge forth of noble blood,</l>
      <l>Were bad his reigne, or were it iust and good,</l>
      <l>So much as skild him for to touch therin:</l>
      <l>To tell the truth he forced not a pin.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶Thy coūtry <hi>Lhuyd,</hi> is bounden much to thee,</l>
      <l>Which makest it vnto vs not only knowen:</l>
      <l>But vnto such as in far countries be,</l>
      <l>Wherby thy fame the greater way is flowen,</l>
      <l>And eke thy countries praise the more is growē,</l>
      <l>So by one deede two noble thinges are chanced:</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Britayne,</hi> and <hi>Lhuyd,</hi> to heauen are aduanced.</l>

      <l>¶ In Latine thou, the learned sort to please,</l>
      <l>In single payne, a double skill didst show.</l>
      <l>In English <hi>Twyne</hi> hath turned, for greater ease</l>
      <l>To those, the ROMAN tongue that do not know.</l>
      <l>The worke is one, though tongues be twaynel trow.</l>
      <l>The Latin thou, the English <hi>Twyne</hi> did twyst,</l>
      <l>The learned laud you both, disprayse who lyst.</l>
