                 <title>The light of navigation : Wherein are declared and lively pourtrayed, all the coasts and havens, of the VVest, North and East seas. Collected partly out of the books of the principall authors which have written of navigation, (as Lucas Iohnson VVaghenaer and divers others partly also out of manie other expert seafaring mens writings and verball declarations: corrected from manie faults, and inlarged with manie newe descriptions and cardes. Divided into tvvo bookes. Heerunto are added (beside an institution in the art of navigation) nevve tables of the declination o the sonne, according to Tycho Brahes observations, applied to the meridian of Amsterdam. Together with newe tables and instructions to teach men the right use of the North-starre, and other firme starres, profitable for all seafaring men. By William Iohnson)</title>

   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat great good and profit (gentle Reader) is procured unto all Seafaring men by Books of Seacardes / which heeretofore have bin made and composed by Lucas Iohnson Waghenaer / Albert Hayen / William Barents and others / wherein they with most great diligence have written the situation of the Streames / Havens and Chanels of the Seas in divers Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys / it is impossible to declare / for that thereby not onely manie Ships and Merchants goods / but also manie Men have had their lives preserved / which is so manifest and well knowne unto everie man / that it were altogether needelesse and in vaine to illustrate it by examples.</p>
   <p>It is also well knowne to everie Seafaring man / how much some Havens and Chanels in the Seas / are and have beene in processe of time cleane altered and changed / specially in these Countreys of Holland / Zealand and Freesland / which also for the most part are so much altered / since then were described by the said Authors / that some of them have now no likenesse nor similitude thereof / some are allmost spoyled / and some wholly abolished / and cleane stopt up: for the North Chanel / which by Waghenaer and Albert Hayen was described to be the best Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Vlie / at this present reacheth out cleane contrarie / and therewithall it is so much altered / that it can not be used but by small ships. The North Elve / which by them is described to be a deepe and faire Chanel / is also cleane spoyled / but in steede thereof the South Elve is broken out againe with a faire deepe chanel. And the place where yet within these fewe yeeres the steeple of Huysden did stand / lyeth now so farre into the Sea / that Ships full laden runne over it / both entring into / and comming out of the Texel: whereby such descriptions at this time are not onely unfit / but verie hurtfull / if a man should rule himself by them.</p>
   <p>This considered / I (according to my abilitie / for the good and benefit of Seafaring men) have taken the Books of the aforesaid Authors in hand / to clense / correct and amende them of all their faults (besides that which I have newely gotten and collected to adde unto them) as much as possible I can: wherein I have neither spared trouble / labour nor charges / that by the aide and furtherance of manie expert and skilfull Sailers / Pilots and Masters (of whose stil and knowledge I was well assured) I might describe and declare the same / in such manner as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent worke / and the necessitie and worthines thereof requireth. Lucas Iohnson Wagenaer himself (not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed) hath also by writing shewed manie notable faults / which in his Book were necessarily to be corrected and amended. As touching the Cardes / I have especially much bettered them / with the reaching of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes verie necessarie to be used / and also enlarged them / and according to the examples of the best Cardes so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them / that therein you not onely see / how you may saile into / and come out of all Havens and Chanels / but also how farre they reach / and are in widenesse and length distant from each other: which never heeretofore (be it spoken without boasting) was so perfectly and so beneficially done for the good of Seafaring men. I have also placed all the places of the West Seas under their right heights: but touching the East Seas / I could not bring that to passe before this time / because we wanted the true collection thereof / for that the same which Lucas Wage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naer
<pb facs="4"/> writeth thereof / is false / and he contradicteth himself / which may partly be perceived by that which ensueth. He writeth / that the Sond lyeth under 56 degrees and 12 minutes / and Schagen under 57 degrees and 48 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes / whereby it should followe / (for that the said two places lye distant southeast and northwest) that they should be distant one from the other 33 or 34 Dutch myles: whereas notwithstanding he himself writeth / that they are but 25 myles distant from each other: but that both these positions are false / I prove it thus. The middle of the Ile of Ween lyeth just under 55 degrees and 54 minutes / and seeing that the Sond is but a myle and an half or two myles distant from thence / and rather westerlyer then north / then of force the Sond can not lye higher / then under 56 degrees: and so / if wee (according to the common gessing) reckon / from the Sond to Schagen 25 myles / then the Point of Schagen must lye under 57 degrees and 11 or 12 minutes / which differeth from Wagenaers posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion almost two third parts of a degree. Or if Schagen laye under such a heigth as Wagenaer writeth / then Schagen and the Sond should be distant from each other about 38 myles / which is not credible. Manie such like / and (as I thinke) much greater faults should be seene / if the certaine truth thereof could be found.</p>
   <p>Besides this / I have heereunto added a Brief Institution touching the Arte of Navigation: wherein is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed / what knowledge of Astronomie is necessarie for a Seafaring man: wherein hitherto there hath beene much abuse committed among them. But unnecessarie things / wherewith some Seafaring men trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in vaine / I have omitted and wholly left out: as / what the Eccentricities / Augeas and Apogeas / the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude / Latitude / and the Paralaxes of the Planets are: all which things (as also manie other Astronomicall high Speculations) have no use in Seafaring / nor can by anie meanes further a Seafaring man.</p>
   <p>I have likewise omitted and forborne to write anie thing of the Lengths / which men commonly call / the East and West / whereof some men boast and vaunt themselves / to have found great matters / and that a man may finde the waie from East to West so perfectly / as from South to North: but all that which hitherto / touching that matter is come to light / is not onely unprofitable / but also (if a man should trust thereunto) both hurtfull and deceitfull: whereof in the fourth part of this Book I thinke to write more at large / as also / what good and benefit a Pilot may have by the Direction of the Needle / or altering of the Compas / whereupon these newe found Lengths are built / although without ground or true foundation.</p>
