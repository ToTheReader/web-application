      <hi>TO THE RIGHT honorable, my very good</hi> Lady, the Lady Dacre <hi>of the South.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant (right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable &amp; vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Ladie) how poore a help the light of a candle giues vnto the cleere light of the Sun, nor how meane a meanes these my labours are to eternize the memory of those your honourable virtues, which
<pb facs="3"/>like the Sun in his sphere disperse their gracious raies to as many as know you, or heare of your name. You are like the Sun adorned with your owne light as with a garment, like the rose in the garden an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your selfe. Your honorable progenitors ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor you, your honorable virtues your progenitors. And therfore far be it from you to thinke that my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is hereby to giue light to the Sun, honor to your honors, but as <hi>Dauid</hi> out of a consideration of the manifolde blessings he had receiued at Gods hands,
<pb facs="3"/>cried out, <hi>What shall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto the Lord for all his benefits bestowed vpon me?</hi> and presently answered, <hi>I will take the cup of saluation, and call vpon the name of the Lord:</hi> so I entring into a consideration with my self, what I might returne for those great and manifolde bounties receiued from the hands of your worthie and honorable husband; when I had considered what I might consider (being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of mine owne inabilities to returne one for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand) I was inforced to say with <hi>Dauid,</hi> I will take and not giue, I will requite by
<pb facs="4"/>asking more. My humble petition therefore to your Ladiship is, that you would be pleased to honor this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle booke with your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable protection, which though it be offered to the publike view of the world, yet it was written for you, as not vnbefitting your yeers, your zeale, your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, your religion, your honour. This if you do, you shall adde vnto the heape of your manifolde virtues; and if (with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable minde) you shall take this, from his hands, whose custome it hath euer been rather to receiue than
<pb facs="4"/>giue, you shall double your bounties, be liberall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing and giuing too. And thus wishing to your Ladiship a long life in this world, and an eternall in the world to come, I rest</p>
