   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>FOr the First Part of this Worke, it containes only a briefe narration of daily iournies, with the rates of Coaches or Horses hired, the expences for horses and mans meat, the soyle of the Country, the situation of Townes, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions thereof; together with all things there worthy to be seene: which Treatise in some obscure places is barren and vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant (espetially in the first beginning of the worke,) but in other places I hope you will iudge it more pleasant, and in some delightfull, inducing you fauorably to dispence with the barrennes of the former, inserted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the vse of vnexperienced Trauellers passing those waies. Againe, you may perhaps iudge the writing of my daily expences in my iournies to be needles &amp; vnprofitable, in respect of the continuall change of prices and rates in all Kingdoms: but they can neuer be more subiect to change, then the affaies of Martiall and ciuill Policie: In both which, the oldest Histories serue vs at this day to good vse. Thirdly and lastly, touching the First Part of this VVorke, when you read my expences in vnknowne Coynes, you may iustly require the explaning of this obscurity, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the values in the English Coynes. But I pray you to consider, that the adding of these seuerall values in each daies iourny, had been an Herculean labour; for auoiding whereof, I haue first set before the First Part, a briefe Table expressing the value of the small Coynes most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly spent, and also haue expresly &amp; particularly for each Dominion and most part of the Prouinces, set downe at large, how these values an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the English Coynes, in a Chapter written of purpose to satisfie the most curious in this point, namely the fifth Chapter of the third Booke, being the last of this First Part: in which Chapter also I haue briefly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of the best means to exchange monies into forraigne parts.</p>
   <p>Touching the VVorke in generall, I wil truly say, that I wrote it swiftly, and yet slowly. This may seeme a strange Riddle, and not to racke your wit with the interpretation, my selfe will expound it: I wrote it swiftly, in that my pen was ready and nothing curious, as may appeare by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and stile: and I wrote it slowly, in respect of the long time past since I viewed these Dominions, and since I tooke this worke in hand. So as the VVorke may not vnfitly bee compared to a nose-gay of flowers, hastily snatched in many gardens, and with much leasure, vet carelesly and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently bound together. The snatching is excused by the haste, necessary to Trauellers, desiring to see much in short time: And the negligent bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in true iudgement needs no excuse, affected curiositie in poore sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, being like rich imbroidery laid vpon a frize ierken; so as in this case, onely the trifling away of mxch time, may bee imputed to my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb facs="4"/>
dulnes or negligence, if my iust excuse be not heard: in the rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whereof I must craue your patience. During the life of the worthy <hi>Earle of Deuonshire,</hi> my deceased Lord, I had little or no time to bestow in this kind: after his deth, I lost fully three yeers labor (in which I abstracted the Histories of these 12 Dominiōs thorow which I passed, with purpose to ioyne them to the Discourses of the seuerall Commonwealths, for il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration and ornament: but when the worke was done, and I found the bulke there of to swel, then I chose rather to suppresse them, then to make my gate bigger then my Citie.) And for the rest of the yeers, I wrote at leasure, giuing (like a free and vnhired workeman) much time to pleasure, to necessary affaires, and to diuers and long distractions. If you consider this, and with all remember, that the worke is first written in Latine, then translated into English, and that in diuers Copies, no man being able by the first Copie to put so large a worke in good fashion. And if you will please also to take knowledge from me, that to saue expences, I wrote the greatest part with my owne hand, and almost all the rest with the slowe pen of my seruant: then I hope the losse of time shall not be imputed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. Againe, for the worke in generall, I professe not to write it to any curious wits, who can indure nothing but extractions and quintessences: nor yet to great States-men, of whose reading I confesse it is vnworthy: but only vnto the vnexperienced, who shall desire to view forraign king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. And these may, the rather by this direction, make better vse of what they see, heare, and reade, then my selfe did. If actiue men neuer reade it, I shall wish them no lesse good successe in their affaires. If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue men shall reade it at leasure, making choice of the subiects fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their humours, by the Table of the Contents, and casting away the booke when they are weary of reading, perhaps they may finde some delight: only in case of distaste, I pray them remember, to and for whom it was written. To conclude, if you be as well affected to me, as I am to you, how soeuer I deserue no thanks, no doubt I shall be free from blame. And so I wish you all happinesse, remaining</p>
