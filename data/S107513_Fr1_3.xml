      <salute>SIR;</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the great Workes
of God ought to be
had in remembrance
of <hi>all men,</hi> so this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is more required
of <hi>Princes</hi> then of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men. Because
<hi>their</hi> charge is greater then the charge of
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>other</hi> men: for they must answer both
for the government of <hi>themselues,</hi> and of
<hi>others</hi> vnder them. Wherefore having
observed the Workes of God in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> from the cruell
plots of the Adversaries, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to this time:
I found my selfe most obliged to present
this to your <hi>Highness;</hi> both because my
service, next to his <hi>Maiestie</hi> is most due to
your <hi>Highness;</hi> and because the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the great Workes of God is a
<hi>Glasse</hi> fit for a <hi>Prince</hi> to <hi>looke</hi> on. For your
<hi>Highness</hi> may be assured that the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
will not change their disposition,
vnlesse either we were reduced to their
<hi>blindness,</hi> or they drawne to imbrace the
<hi>truth</hi> with vs. I haue made this <hi>Collection</hi>
that by examples of <hi>things past,</hi> We may
better iudge of <hi>things to come.</hi> My labour
herein is nothing. For I <hi>make</hi> not the
Story, but <hi>take</hi> it of others. And when I
light vpon the best Narration, as that of
the <hi>Gun-powder treason,</hi> I haue set it downe
as I find it without alteration. Because as
that cannot be mended, so to set a worse
<pb facs="4"/>
Narration in the place thereof, were no
lesse then to abuse the Reader. I leaue
the honor entire to them that haue made
the Story, I take no part thereof to mee.
Onely my care hath beene to <hi>obserue</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those great deliverances <hi>the Workes of
God,</hi> that God may be <hi>glorified,</hi> and the
cause <hi>iustified</hi> which God hath maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from Heaven. SIR, I suppose it is
hard to finde a Narration containing
more <hi>miraculous</hi> Protection of Gods
<hi>Church,</hi> since that time wherein God
shewed his <hi>Miracles</hi> in protecting the
people of <hi>Israel.</hi> Which consideration
may serue to <hi>fasten</hi> your <hi>Highness</hi> to the
loue and <hi>service</hi> of that great God, that
doth so <hi>strongly</hi> maintain his <hi>servants.</hi> That
as hitherto you haue had a gracious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of his grace and goodnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, so your noble heart may
grow every day more and more in the
loue and obedience of the truth. We are
all charged by Gods Word to <hi>pray for
Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes.</hi> That charge which
God hath layd vpon vs all, no man can
put off: But when your <hi>Highness</hi> hath
<pb facs="5"/>
effectually made knowne your singular
care and loue to the common good, to
the rejoycing of all faithfull men; this
must needs draw the hearts of all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men nearer to your <hi>Highness.</hi> And
this is a part of your happiness; for the
feare of God and loue of Subiects is able
to make <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> strong against
all their enemies <hi>God giue his iudgements to
the King, and his righteousness to the Kings sonne,</hi>
and therewith, all blessings; <hi>grace</hi> and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
here, and <hi>glory</hi> hereafter.</p>
