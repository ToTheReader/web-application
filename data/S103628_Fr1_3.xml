   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He good opinion which I long since conceiued of your woorship, ioyned with an infallible experience of your curtesie and friendlines toward me, hath beene (as it were) a continuall spurring of me forward to render againe some token of a duetifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and of a well meaning minde towarde you. Whiche was the cause, that when I had gone through with the translation of these short Sermons vppon Ioel, I thought with my selfe, that I could not better bestow the fruite of this my labour (such as it is) then vppon
<pb facs="3"/>your worship. And as touching the argument of the Prophet (to speake in a word what I thinke) because it conteineth nothing else (in effect) then an earnest and vehement exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiō of al estates of men vnto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (a thing very necessary to bee practised and put in vre in these our dayes) I was perswaded it would be to some purpose, if the same were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen forth &amp; declared in as plaine &amp; familiar a method as was possible. Which thing (being accomplished in this treatise) may (as I trust) mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster occasion both of good liking to your worship, &amp; also of increase of spirituall knowledge &amp; comfort to so many, as shall not disdaine the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised reading &amp; perusing of the same. I might enter here (I confesse) into some larger discourse of &amp; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the seuērall circūstances apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning to the summary declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the argumēt of this Prophet
<pb facs="3"/>as the time, place &amp; occasiō, when, where, &amp; for what cause, hee tooke vpō him this prophesy, the matter &amp; substāce of the doctrines which hee handleth, &amp;c. But because all that is sufficiently touched &amp; expressed in the preface of the author following, &amp; also in the work it selfe, the godly reader may there find whatsoeuer is requisite to this purpose. only (to end withall) I am to craue of your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that according as god hath enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched you with many singuler orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēts both of mind &amp; body, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beseeming a gentlemā of your cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling, but also far surmoūting many other of like estate &amp; degree, so you woulde againe dailye more &amp; more carefully apply thē to the furtherāce of his glory, the benefit of his church &amp; the cōmō weal of this your natiue coūtry. And thus (briefelye) praying pardō for my boldnes &amp; resting my selfe vpon hope of your fauourable
<pb facs="4"/>acceptation of this my poore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, proceeding onely of good will to your woorshippe, I betake most humbly the successe of al to the most highest, who together with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall peace, whiche hee hath giuen you in greate measure, graunt you also the fruition of that peace that passeth all vnderstanding.</p>
