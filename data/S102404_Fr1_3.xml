      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O prevent a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, I was drawne to let these notes passe with some review; Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring there was an intendmēt of publishing them, by some who had not perfectly taken them. And these first, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next at hand, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had occasion lately of some fresh thoughts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this argumēt, by dealing
<pb facs="12"/>
with some the chiefe groūd of whose trouble, was the want of cōsidering of the gracious nature and office of Christ. The right conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ipt of which is the spring of all service to Christ, and comfort from him. God hath laid up all grace and comfort in Christ for us, and planted a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sweetnesse of pitty and love in his heart towards us. As God his Father <hi>hath fitted him with a body,</hi> so with a heart to be a mercifull <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 7.</note> Redeemer. What doth the Scriptures speake but Christs love and tender care over those that are humbled: and besides the mercy that resteth in his owne brest, hee workes
<pb facs="12"/>
the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. It cannot but cheere the heart of the spouse, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider in all her infirmities and miseries she is subject unto,
<pb facs="13"/>
that shee hath a husband of a k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>nd disposition, that knowes how to give the honour of milde usage to the weaker vessell. That will be so farre frō rejecting her, because she is weake, that he will pity her the more. And as hee is kinde at all times, so especially when it is most seasonable, he will speake to her heart, <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <note place="margin">Hosea 2. 24.</note> in the wildernesse.</hi> The more glory to God, and the more comfort to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian soule ariseth from the beliefe and application of these things, the more the enemy of Gods glory &amp; mans comfort, labours to breed mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perswasions of them, that if hee cannot keepe men from
<pb facs="13"/>
heaven, and bring them into that cursed condition he is in himselfe, yet he may trouble them in their passage. Some and none of the worst, Sathan prevailes withall so farre, as to neglect the meanes, upon feare they should (being so sinfull) dishonour God and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their sins: &amp; so they lie smothering under this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as it were bound hand and foote by Sathan, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to make out to Christ, and yet are secretly upheld by a spirit of faith, shewing it selfe in hidden sighes and groanes unto God. These are abused by false representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Christ; all whose waies to such, being wayes of mercy
<pb facs="14"/>
and all his thoughts, thoughts of love. The more Sathan is malicious in keeping the soule in darknesse, the more care is to be had of establishing the soule upon that which will stay it. Amongst other grounds to build our faith on, as the free offer of grace to all that will receive it; the gracious invitation of all <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 17. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

Ioh. 16. 9. 2 Cor. 3. 20.</note> of not beleeving, being shut up prisoners thereby under the guilt of all other sinnes, the sweet intreatie to beleeve, and ordayning Embassadours to desire peace, putting tender
<pb facs="14"/>
affections into them answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their calling, ordaining Sacraments for the sealing of the covenant. Besides these (I say) and such moving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, this is one infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vigor and strength in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the rest, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Christ, a person au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, and from those bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels that moved him not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to become a mā, but a curse for us, hence it is <hi>that hee will not quench the smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wick or flax.</hi> It addes strength to faith, to consider that al expressions of love is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue frō nature in Christ, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> is constant. God knowes that as wee are prone to sinne, so when conscience is throughly
<pb facs="15"/>
awaked, wee are as prone to despaire for sinne; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee would have us know that hee setteth himselfe in the Covenant of grace to triumph in CHRIST over the greatest evills and enemies we feare, and that his thoughts are not as our thoughts are, that he is God <note place="margin">Es. 5. 8.</note> and not man, that there is heights, and depths, and <note place="margin">Hos. 11. 9.</note> breadths of mercy in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 18.</note> all the depths of our sin and misery; that wee should never bee in such a forlorne condition, wherein there should be ground of despaire, considering our sinnes bee the sins of men, his mercy the mercy of an infinite GOD.
<pb facs="15"/>
But though it be a truth clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then the Sunne beames, that a broken hearted sinner ought to embrace mercy so strongly enforced: yet there is no truth that the heart shutteth it selfe more against, then this, especially in sense of misery, when the soule is fittest for mercy, untill the Holy spirit sprinkleth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science with the blood of Christ, and sheddeth his love into the heart, that so the blood of Christ in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may cry lowder then the guilt of sinne; for onely Gods Spirit can raise the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with comfort above guilt; because he is only grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the conscience. Men
<pb facs="16"/>
may speake comfort, but it is Christs Spirit that can onely comfort. Peace is the fruit of the lips, but yet created to bee <note place="margin">Es. 57. 19</note> so. No creature can take off wrath from the conscience, but he that set it on, though all the prevailing arguments be used that can bee brought forth, till the Holy Ghost ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually perswadeth by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine kinde of rhetoricke, which ought to raise up our hearts to him who is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter of his people, that he would seale thē to our soules. Now God dealing with mē as understanding creatures, the manner which he useth in this powerfull worke upon their consciences, is by way of
<pb facs="16"/>
friendly entercourse, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, and perswasion, and discovery of his love in Christ, and Christs gracious inclination thus even to the <note place="margin">Loquitur Deus ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

         </gap> nostrum, agi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap> ad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum suum.</note> weakest and lowest of men. And therefore because hee is pleased by such like motives to enter into the heart, and settle a peace there, we ought with reverence to regard all such sanctified helpes, and among the rest this of making use of this comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble description of Christ by God the Father, in going boldly in all necessities to the throne of grace. But wee must know this comfort is onely the portion of those that give up themselves to Christs
<pb facs="17"/>
government, that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in all things to be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of by him. For here we see in this Scripture both joyned together, mercy to bruised reedes, and yet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment prevailing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees over corruptions. Christ so favoureth weake ones, as that he frameth their soules to a better condition then they are in. Neither can it be otherwise, but that a soule looking for mercy should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it selfe at the same time to be guided. Those relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of husband, head, shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, &amp;c. imply not onely meeknesse and mercy, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment likewise. When we become Christ ans to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb facs="17"/>
we live not exempt from all service, but onely wee change our Lord. Therefore if any in an ill course of life snatch comforts before they are reached out unto them, let them know they doe it at their owne perills. It is as if some ignorant man should come into an Apothecaries shop stored with varietie of medicines of all sorts, &amp; shold take what comes next to hād, poyson perhaps in stead of Physicke. There is no word of comfort in the whole booke of God intended for such <hi>as regard iniquity in their</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 66. 18.</note>
      <hi>hearts,</hi> though they doe not act it in their lives. Their onely comfort is that the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb facs="18"/>
of damnation is not executed, and thereupon there is yet opportunity of safer thoughts and resolutions, otherwise they stand not onely convicted, but condemned by the Word, and Christ <hi>that rideth on the White horse</hi> will spend all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes <note place="margin">Rev. 6. 2.</note> upon them, and wound them to death. If any shall blesse himselfe in an ill way, Gods wrath shall burne to hell against such. There is no more comfort to bee expected from Christ, then there is care to please him. Otherwise to make him an abetter of a lawlesse and loose life, is to transforme him into a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, nay into the likenesse of
<pb facs="18"/>
him whose workes hee came to destroy, which is the most detestable Idolatry of all. One way whereby the Spirit of Christ prevaileth in his, is to preserve them from such thoughts; yet wee see people will frame a divinity to themselves, pleasing to the flesh, sutable to their own ends, which being vaine in the substance, will prove like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vaine in the fruit, and as a building upon the sand.</p>
   <p>The maine scope of all, is, to allure us to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christs milde, safe, wise, victorious government, and to leave men naked of all pretences, why they will not have Christ to rule over
<pb facs="19"/>
them, when we see salvation not onely strongly wrought, but sweetly dispensed by him. His government is not for his owne pleasure, but for our good. We are saved by a way of love, that love might be kindled by this way in us to God againe, because this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection melteth the soule, and mouldeth it to all dutie and acceptable manner of performance of dutie. It is love in duties that God regards more then du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themselves. This is the true and Euangelicall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition arising from Christs love to us, and our love to him againe; and not to feare to come to him as if wee were
<pb facs="19"/>
to take an Elephant by the tooth. It is almost a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall mistake, to think that God delights in slavish feares, when as the fruits of Christs Kingdome are peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, for from this mistake come weake, slavish, superstitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.</p>
   <p>Two things trouble the peace of Christians verie much, their weaknesses han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <note place="margin">1. 2.</note> upon them, and feare of holding out for time to come. A remedy against both is in this Text, for Christ is set out here as a milde Saviour to weake ones; and for time to come, his powerfull care and love is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="20"/>
interrupted, untill hee bring forth judgement to victory. And thereupon it is that both the meanes of salvation and grace wrought by meanes, and glory the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of grace, come all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one name of the KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOME of GOD so oft; because whom by meanes he brings to grace, he will by grace bring to glory.</p>
   <p>This maketh the thoughts of the latter Iudgement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable unto us, that he who is then to be our Iudge, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but judge for them who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ve beene ruled by him here, for whom hee gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>des by his <note place="margin">Psal 73. 24.</note> counsell, those he brings to glory. If our saith were
<pb facs="20"/>
but as firme as our state in Christ is secure and glorious, what manner of men should we be?</p>
   <p>If I had gone about to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect writing in a high straine, I should have missed of mine end, and crossed the argument in hand. For shall we that are servants quench those weake sparkes which our Lord himselfe is pleased to cherish? I had rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the censure of some, then hinder the good of others; which if it be any wayes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by these few observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I have what I aymed at. I intended not a treatise, but opening of a Text, what I shall be drawne to doe in this
<pb facs="21"/>
kind must bee by degrees, as leisure in the midst of many interruptions will permit: The Lord guide our hearts, tongues, and pennes, for his glory, and the good of his people.</p>
