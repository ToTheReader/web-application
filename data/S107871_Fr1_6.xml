   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hosoeuer thou bee (gentle Reader,) into whose hands this booke shall come, in any case I would not haue thy minde troubled with this discourse, as if we did reuerse som graund Article of thy faith, when wee doe but restore, (for so we holde it behofefull) the graue Senat of Bishops into the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches (so called.) Doe we crosse herein the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some late writers of great name? Why then iudge you, (and iudge me worthie of double blame) if I should be either so frontlesse, or so forgetfull at least, as to aduenture vpon this contradiction, of mine own head: suppose ye me at the least, backt with the piller of truth, (the sacred scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) and borne out with the consent of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and countenaunced with the continued custome of the whole Church. What then? (Will you saye) did they, whome you cal men of name, see nothing? I answere, they did see indeede, that which I see: But as they which take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them to repaire an old house, albeit within dores there bee many pretie romes, and necessarye corners, which they would willinglie, and might well bee reserued; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, when they beholde on euery side, the most partes rotted and ruinated, and those good partes to hang togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by putrified and imperfect ioyntes, they are in dispaire, that the house can not bee well turguised, except the whole frame should be ouerturned: Euen so the reformers of gods house, albeit they did see to their greife, manye excellent things which might well, and well worthie, bee reserued, yet perceiuing them to be either vtterly disteined with supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or doubtfullie entangled therewith, and consequentlie dispairing, that they could not roote out the grounded su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and tyrrany of the pope, vnlesse they plucked vp by the roots many singular ornaments of the church; in the anguishe of their zeale they cried at once, downe with it, downe with it, euen to the ground. And so is it come to pas that togeather with impietie and Idolatrie (if not before
<pb facs="15"/> them both) such and so many instruments are taken away, as might haue beene verie great helpes to the Church, both for the preseruing of Discipline, and also for the retaining of that dignitie to the Ministerie, which is decent and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in a ciuill societie.</p>
   <p>But to the purpose: although in materiall thinges, that which we haue exemplified before, many times must be so of necessitie: yet in morall causes there is no such necessity. The state therefore of this question (friend reader) is not of thy faith in Christ, or of thy souls health, but by what guides especiallye, and gouernours, thou maist bee best lead in the way of truth, and kept in the path of eternall life. And vpon this point is all this variaunce. For there are some of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all discipline of maners, is to be referred to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, and that the Minister is to be restrained to the bare Preaching of the worde, and ministring of the Sacraments. The which fancie of men, seeing it hath neither the word of God to confirme it, nor any president of our Elders to giue countenance to it, I can but wonder, howe so friuelous an opinion, could once either creepe in, or peepe out of the heads of Diuines. But there are other which yeild (as they ought to doe) the power of Ecclesiasticall censures to those Bishoppes and Elders, which are such, both in name and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: vnto whome, they deny not that authoritie which God gaue vnto his Apostles, and their successours the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. And last of all, there is a third kinde of them, which reiecting the order of Bishops, ioyne with the Pastor certain annuall Elders, vnto whome they commit the regiment or the Church, and the ordering of Ecclesiasticall Discipline. Thus did the Philosophers of old, when it came in question, what kinde of Gouernment was best: Of whome, some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the Monarchie of one, and that (as it is indeed) they iudged the best: yet others maintained, that an Oligarchy or ioynt gouernment of a few, was as good as the best: again there were others, who for a Democratie, or state popular, would yeeld to none of the rest. And last of all, there were some, who to the former three added a fourth, which they
<pb facs="15"/> indifferently, (not equally) mixed of all three; and that they would make good, to be as good as they al, and better then any of the rest. But in the meane while they considered not this, that any kind of gouernment as it is in it selfe, is not so much to bee considered in gouernance, as is the nature and condition of them, who are to be gouerned, and for whose good that kind of gouernment is ordained. So that nowe, that forme of pollicie is to bee accounted best, not which is such in his owne nature, but that which is most necessary for the people, the time, and the place. For which cause, (as I conceaue) GOD himselfe in the secrecie of his wisedome, hath not set downe vnto any nation, any perpetual forme of gouernment, the which it was not lawful to alter according to the incidencie of time, place, and persons.</p>
   <p>But in the gouernment, of the which we dispute, the case is far otherwise: for in that it proceedeth immediatly from God, men maye not alter the same according to their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, neither is it necessary: For the wisedome of God hath so tempered the same, that it repugneth no form of ciuil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. In deede, where any one whole state is become Christian, the gouernment happelie may receiue some kind of alteration, but not such as shal alter the nature of it. Were they before in gouernment diuerse, and in no one thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like? nowe they consort in one, and lend each other their mutuall aide. Wherefore, whatsoeuer other men thinke in this matter: doubtlesse the Christian Magistrate, in a well ordered state, ought not to bee held as a priuate person, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Church or common-wealth. The which distinction beeing not sufficientlie looked into, hath distracted vs into diuerse errors in Church Discipline. For my part, (and the best wil take my part,) I hold, that the state of Bishops is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in the Church, &amp; that Discipline is best and from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, in the which, godly Bishoppes, with the not nick-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Elders do sit at the helme.</p>
   <p>And yet when I consider with my selfe, the badnes of these times, and the badde condition of some places, in the which it hath pleased God, by the hands of learned and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb facs="16"/> men to gather togeather his dispersed flocke out of the captiuity of Babilon. I doe not see indeed, how the true Bishops could haue bene restored. In the Churches of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Holland, my selfe haue susteined the office of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor: but shall I tell you? I cannot easily tell, how many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments I there found in this busines. But shal that which was done extraordinarily, and partly of necessity, and that but in a certaine fewe places, and that but in our age onely, prescribe a law to the world besides? This diuorce of minds and opinions had neuer bene, were it not for the tyrrany of some misrulie Bishops, a nouell opinion is crept vp, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it selfe against all antiquitie, which holdeth all Bishops generally in iealousie: and yet, the like and no lesse suspicion is raised of our newe consistories also, wheather rightlye or wrongfully, I will not say.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, he that will vndoubtedly attaine to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge of these thinges indeed, must bee sure, that he examine and try the cause him selfe, deuoyd of all passion or preoccupation of affection. Many times within these sixe and twentie yeares, haue I deliuered my minde vnto my friends in familiar conference, (though not at all times, nor to all) concerning the gouernment of Bishops. What they would conceiue of mee for so doing, I might easily coniect by others, who had in like maner reueiled themselues vnto their brethren. For as it happened, a certaine disputation fel out between certaine Ministers, concerning the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: in the which M. Doctor Villerius, (whose name I cannot remember without due reuerence) assumed, that the authority of Bishops was not so rashly to haue bin reiected. But Lord, how they were netled and nestled with this? as if with that one word, he had vtterly ouerthowen that equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which they expected in the French churches, and which they thought requisite in all Ministers. O griefe: to me they made knowen their griefe, and (pittifull complaining) they complained to me thereof. But what should I heere do? de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him I dared not, (and yet I liked well the cause of his opinion,) least I should incur the like suspicion of aspiring
<pb facs="16"/> thoughts. But from that time forwarde, that conference gaue mee occasion to search and sift out more narrowlye, those matters by my selfe. And that which then happened to me, I doubt not but is incident to many others with me, who in wisedome see, also and consider, that the authority of Bishops is greatly wanting in ours, and al Churches.</p>
   <p>There are some which can indure, nor equall, nor su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour: I giue God thanks, I can see my superiour without enuy, and sustaine my inferior without contempt. But now, seeing I am heere in England, no man can chalenge my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as guiltie of a Bishoppricke, or as if I seeke dominion ouer my brethren: (the calling I affect, but not to be called.) And therefore now I dare more boldly, and will more freely speake what I thinke, then before I thought it requisite; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it conuenient, when I conuersed among brethren neuer-a better.</p>
   <p>Yea, but I may seeme in this action, to sooth vp the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and seeke their countenance: countenance? nay then must I seeke further, and neuer look the Bishops in the face, whose condition in this thankles age, is more subiect to the enuie and obliquie of men, then my selfe am. And indeed, if that were all, and all but so little, it were the part of a warie child, and him that would husband his credite to make the most of it, rather with safetie and silence to say nothing, and with patience and pollicy, to expect the issue of these things. The which I dare saye, I also could haue doone as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without displeasure to my selfe, or disfauour to anie. But what moued me, God knoweth: men may construe my fact as themselues affect: but it is the Lord that iudgeth my soule. Notwithstanding, let the curteous Reader conceiue my meaning in few words: I desire to benefite the churches alreadie, and to be reformed, to extirpate Scisme where it is rooted, and to preuent it where it is rising. He that thinketh this cannot be done by these meanes, shall haue his own say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for me: but yet the euent of things (mother of fooles,) will one day make it plaine, howe good and profitable my meaning was; and in the meane while, the Church (if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
<pb facs="17"/> not) maye receiue that detriment, which it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire.</p>
   <p>The ground of our saluation, is to know God, &amp; whom hee hath sent, Iesus Christ our Lorde and Sauiour, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of of our soules. But as in euerie thing which men goe about: whether weauing, caruing, or any other craft, of the which, either the Citie, or the ciuill Magistrate hath any care, that it should bee well done, there must bee a decent order kept, and a diligent ouer-sight had of the works, the which by how much the more curious it is, by so much the things themselues doe flowrish the better, and continue the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: So likewise in Religion, the same order and ouer-sight ought to be had, if we wil haue the same to flowrish amongst vs, or to continue pure and intemerate for euer. But that al men doe not agree about the maner of ordering and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church, why should that trouble the quiet of anie peace-able man? Doe yee not know, that the more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and necessarie a thing is to bee vsed, the more lets and delaies are made by the enemy, either to infect, or els to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the vse thereof? Was there euer at any time, anie thing so cleare and manifest among men, that was out of all controuersie? How then knowest thou this, that thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est nothing? Or how commeth it in question among men, whether a man seeth, or doth that, which in very deede, hee both seeth and doth? Without controuersie there is no part of Philosphie, or precept of Diuinitie, no point of Religion, which hath not bene called into controuersie; <hi>This sore tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile hath God giuen to the sonnes of men, that they might be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therein.</hi> But the vanitie of mans will, detracteth nothing from the veritie of anie thing. And therefore, goe to gentle Reader, be doing with the sequell, and doe well by it.</p>
