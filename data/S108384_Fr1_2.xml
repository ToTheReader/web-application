   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not Sathans weakest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion, in these our dayes, to set the fairest glosses vpon the foulest matters; and to dresse his deadliest hookes with the most delightfull baites: It is my purpose therefore (gentle Reader) to let thee vnderstand somewhat concerning this Sect of Brownisme; which miserable experience, (the mistresse of fooles) hath made knowne vnto me, desiring that my mis-hap may preuent others harmes. I haue not, in the manifesting of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties of this Sect, written any thing, but that which I can of my owne knowledge, with good conscience, affirme; although I haue aledged sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry authors for the proofe therof; yet it is not for want of knowledge in my selfe; but rather for thy rresolution, that in the mouth of so many witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, euerything might be cōfirmed vnto thee, that thereby thou mayst take heed lest thou tread that schismatical trace; the trauelling of which, I (with many more of my penitent brethren) do now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile.
<pb facs="3"/>And I haue the rather chosen, at this time, to deale in this maner, with this their discription; because knowing that many of their Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call bookes are brought in, and spread abroad in this land, whereby many good Christians are troubled and intangled, not discerning the errors therein, which they haue so cunningly hid and cloked with the manifold allegations of holy Scripture, the abuse where of is not (by the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) easily perceiued; among which this descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the least, but rather a principal perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to inuite guests vnto their Pharisaicall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship; hauing heard sundry (my selfe) confesse that this booke of their description hath beene the onely cause that brought them vnto <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme.</hi> But now the visard of their profession be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pluckt off, and the hookes of their heresie laid bare; I am not without hope that the reader shall reape such resolution thereby, that some shall thereby be staid from vndertaking that hard and dangerous voyage of <hi>Separation,</hi> from the which so few haue euer returned to communion with the Churches of Christ. And thus wishing it for thy wealth, for which end I vndertooke it, I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily bid thee farewell in the Lord.</p>
