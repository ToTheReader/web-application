   <head>A memorable caueat to the gentle
Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue imployed my whole industrie and
best indeuour (gentle Reader) to doe thee
good, and to confirme thee in the truth of
Christs gospell, who, if I shall vnderstand,
that my paineful labours for thy sake, shall
be accepted in good part, and be an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vnder God, to direct thee the readie
way to eternall life; shall doubtlesse attaine my desire, and hold
my selfe fully satisfied for my paines. Now, for the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of mine expectation herein, I haue thought
very expedient and necessarie, to instruct thee in some generall
points, without the knowledge whereof, neither canst thou
fruitfully read this discourse, nor fully and perfectly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the same.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Primò prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipaliter.</hi> Peruse the second booke, the fift chapter in the first section, &amp; note it wel: see also the second se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and forget it not.</note>First therefore, the gentle Reader must obserue seriously,
(though some, otherwise learned, be of an other opinion,)
that the discontented secular Priests, are in truth and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubt, at vtter defiance with the Arch-Priest and the
Iesuites; that they condemne the proceeding and dealing of
the Arch-Priest; that they vtterly abhorre and derest, the
licentious liuing, the vnchristian coozening, and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
practises, with infinite other badde dealing of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites;
as also that they write nothing of or against the Arch-Priest
or the Iesuites, but that onely, which they thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
bound in conscience to write, and to make the same
knowne vnto the world. I my selfe am thus perswaded of
them doubtlesse, and I prooue the same many waies.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, because the Secular Priests haue a long time suffered
intollerable iniuries, at the hands of the Iesuites; because they
haue often insinuated so much one to another; because they
haue often complained, of the hard vsage of the Iesuits against
them, because they haue often repined at their partiall dealing
<pb facs="10"/>
with their fauorites, and rough dealing against such, as would
not bow and bend to their designes at a becke: this my selfe
know to be so, as also that it hath euer beene their vsuall prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
euerie where.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because the Secular priests were most vnwilling
to reueale the turpitude, and the villanous dealing of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
fathers the Iesuits, (as who professe one and the same
religion with the Iesuits, &amp; saw rightwel, that it could not but
tend to the great scandall, &amp; vtter disparagement of their Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
religion) vntill necessitie it selfe enforced them therunto.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, because their Seculars write nothing of our English
Iesuits in deed,<note place="margin">See the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond book, fourth chapter, &amp; sixt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</note> but the French papists haue in effect and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
made the same knowne vnto the world; affirming ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
that for their seditious and treacherous dealing, they
are wholy banished out of the kingdome of France; and that
by a publike decree of Parliament. Hereof none be ignorant,
that shall throughly and duely peruse the Iesuits Catechisme,
and the Franke discourse, lately set foorth by the Catholike
Frenchmen in the french tongue, and since translated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
by some of the Secular priests.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, because neither the Iesuits nor the Seculars do spare
one another, in catching and snatching the least aduantage,
that they can finde or picke out of their reciprocall writings,
so to reproach and giue the foyle one to another.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, because other English Secular priests, &amp; lay-papists
of best account beyond the seas, seeing such endlesse conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betweene the Iesuits and the other priests, and knowing
the badde dealing of the Iesuits against them, haue thought
themselues bound in conscience to take part with the Seculars
in England, and thereupon haue written verie sharpely against
the Iesuits, on their behalfe.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, the same is proued by many inuincible reasons, which
the Reader shal find set down at large, in the last section of the
fift chapter of the fourth booke, all which in regard of breuitie
I heere omitt.</p>
   <p>Againe, the gentle reader must obserue seriously, that though
I do charge the seculars with treasonable practises, and dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in state-affairs, &amp; haue proued the same out of their own
<pb facs="10"/>
bookes and writings in rigor of wordes; yet will I not denie,
but they may haue a better meaning toward the state, then
their bare words externally seeme to insinuate &amp; purport. For
albeit they professe themselues wholy deuoted to the Pope, &amp;
do submit their bookes, their writings, their opinions, and their
own selues also to his censure; yet do they seeme vtterly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of many of his proceedings; yet do they flatly condemne
all English popish treasons; yet do they renounce the doctrine
of <hi>Sanders, Allen,</hi> &amp; Iesuits, in state-matters of wars, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes:
yet do they write plainly and resolutely, that the Pope
hath no power to depriue kings of their royal scepters &amp; rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
nor to giue away their kingdomes to another. In which
opinion likewise, the French papists do concurre &amp; iump with
them. For though Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> affirmed roundly, that all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
were bound in conscience to ioyne with the Pope, and his
power, in all maner of wars for religiō; &amp; though also the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
priests do highly cōmend him for many respects; yet doth
it not follow of necessity, but the seculars may take part with
our soueraigne against the Pope, &amp; fight on her side in defence
of their natiue country, as they professe; to do in their bookes.
The reason hereof is this; because the Seculars, though they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Popes power supereminent <hi>in spiritualibus,</hi> yet
do they disclaime from it <hi>in temporalibus,</hi> when he taketh vpon
him to dispose kings of their Empires, and to translate their
kingdomes.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, the gentle reader must obserue seriously, that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
the seculars may be doubted and suspected, to dissemble
or equiuocate in state-affaires, which are not articles of popish
faith; yet may we safely beleeue them, and securely giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to their words and writings, whensoeuer, and how often
soeuer, they speake, write, or deliuer their opinions, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of popish faith and doctrine. For to make equiuocation
lawfull, euen in popish manner of proceeding; these three
things must all concurre, or else it may not stand. First, the
matter must not be an article of popish faith. Secondly, it
must bee before an incompetent iudge. Thirdly, it must
be in a matter of moment, as to redeeme ones vniust vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the like.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="11"/>
Fourthly,<note place="margin">Quodl. 1. art. 4. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>. 9.</note> the gentle Reader must obserue seriously, that the
secular priests acknowledge themselues bounde in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to detect the Iesuits to the vttermost. For these are their
owne words; all priests and others, that are not of that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
Iesuiticall and Spanish faction, are bound in charitie,
as now the case stands, to detect them to the vttermost. First,
for a caueat to the ignorant multitude seduced by them, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to beware of them. Secondly, <hi>per legemtalionis,</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their malice, detraction, defamation, calumniation, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie,
and what not inuented by them against the innocent,
vpon their owne heads: thus it is written <hi>verbatim. Quodl. 1.
art. 4. pag.</hi> 9. the Reader must likewise obserue,<note place="margin">Quodl. 9. art. 4. p. 304</note> that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
confesse treason to be now by Iesuiticall proceeding,
linked inseperably with Priesthood. For these are their owne
words; The execution of Priesthood and treason are now so
linked together by the Iesuites in England; as they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
any to the Catholike faith, but <hi>Dogmatizando,</hi> in so doing
they draw him in effect to rebellion; thus it is written, <hi>quodl. 9.
art. 4. p.</hi> 304. The Reader must further obserue, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
priests know where the Iesuits vsually reside, where their
walkes are, and with whom they doe conuerse. For these are
their owne words; which of the Iesuits hath hitherto beene in
danger of apprehension by our means, and yet we know all, or
most of their residences in England, &amp; their walkes? I am sure
he will say, that if we were so lewdly disposed, we would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
with them first. Thus is it written <hi>verbatim,</hi> in the
replie to <hi>Parsons</hi> libell. <hi>fol. 57. a. in fine.</hi> The reader must yet
further obserue, that the English penall lawes are iustly made
against the Iesuites. For these are their owne words; vntill at
last they were intangled by penall lawes, which were iustly
made against them equally, as against the Iesuites: thus it is
written, <hi>verbatim,</hi> in the Preface to the Quodlibets, towards
the end of the sixt page. And when the gentle reader hath
well obserued all these foure points; first, that the Secular
priests are bound in conscience, to detect the Iesuites to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost;
secondly, that treason is inseparable to Iesuitical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
&amp; can no way be seuered from them; thirdly, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
know the walkes of the Iesuits, the persons with whom
<pb facs="11"/>
they conuerse, and the houses where they reside; Fourthly,
that the seculars acknowledge and willingly confesse, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
lawes of this Realme to be iustly made against the Iesuites;
then may he rightly informe himselfe therewith, and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold this opinion, as built vpon a sure and sounde foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>viz.</hi> that if the secular priestes be indeede as they write,
sincerely and loyally affected to her maiestie, and fully resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to spend their liues and best bloud in their bodies, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of her sacred person, and of their natiue countrey, against
the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Pope, and the Iesuites; then doubtles
they will make knowne those disloyall persons, who haue cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
with the Iesuites in their bloudie treacheries; the persons
who haue and still doe, harbour, aide, and releiue them; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that haue deuoted and consecrated themselues, to the
king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Pope, and the Iesuites, against their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
soueraigne and deare countrie. Then doubtlesse they
will disclose to her maiestie, the howses where the traytorous
Iesuites reside, and the walkes which they frequent. That so
her maiesties person may be secured, and their natiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
preserued, form the treasonable practises of those tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
villaines. For if they say, they may not this doe, least
so they become the cause of their imprisonment, exile, or
death; that cannot serue there turne, nor be a sufficient excuse
for them in this behalfe. I proue it.</p>
   <p>First, for that they shal no otherwise become such a cause, thē
they haue beene the same alreadie, by reuealing their tresona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
plots and bloudie treacheries. Secondly, because thereby
they shall doe nothing els then that; which (as themselues
write,) they are bound in conscience to performe. Thirdly,
because in so doing they shall onely effect that, which the law
of iustice requireth at their handes, as themselues doe graunt.
Fourthly, because how often soeuer two euils doe so concurre,
that both can not be auoyded, but that of necessitie the one
must happen; then it is not onely charitie, but euerie man is
also bound to preuent the greater euill, with the permission
of the lesse, For the clearing hereof, I will here recount the
priestes their owne expresse words; which though they be
longe, yet doe I with the reader to marke them attentiuely,
<pb facs="12"/>
because they are verie important, &amp; plainly conuince so much
as I intend.</p>
   <p>First, you know, (say the Priestes,) it is a generall receiued
ground by all, that when the actions of any particular man
or men, (be they of what degree they will be, secular or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
ecclesiasticall or lay,) doe tende to anie generall or
common huit of a communitie; (as for example, the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of some particular seruant in a familie, to the ruine or
ouerthrow of the familie; the actions of some particuler scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
in a colledge, to the subuersion of the colledge; or the
actions of some particuler men in a common weale, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of a common weale;) It is then not onely lawfull to
disclose these particuler men, and their particuler actions,
though otherwise priuate &amp; diffamatorie to the said particuler
parties, (as all such actions of their owne nature must needes
be) but also euerie honest seruant, euerie faithfull seruant, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
true scholler, and loyall subiect, is bound in conscience
vpon his dutie to his master, faith to his colledge, loyaltie to
his Prince, and loue to his countrie; to disclose such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and their facts or intentions, without regarde or respect
vnto the hurt or damage, that may redound to the said par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler
parties so offending. The reason hereof is this, because a
generall good is alwaies to be preferred before a particuler, and
a greater hurt to be eschewed before the lesse. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when two euils concurre so, that both cannot be auoyded,
but that necessarily the one must happen; it is not onely cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
but euerie man is also bound to preuent the greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
with permission of the lesse rather then the contrarie.
These words are set downe at large in this manner, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
to <hi>Parsons</hi> libell. <hi>Fol. 28. a.</hi> This is a goodly foundation
which the Priests haue laid, as which indeede is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the verie law of nature. And out of this grounde may so
much fitly be deduced, as is sufficient to conclude my scope
and purpose. If therefore the secular priestes doe▪ in deede
meane truly to their Prince and countrie, as they pretend in
outward shew of words; then no doubt they will doe as
is alreadie said. But if they refuse thus to deale against the
traytorous crew of Iesuites, for the common good of their
<pb facs="12"/>
natiue countrie; then doe they but dissemble and equiuocate,
when they tell vs they will take part with our Queene and
countrie, against the Pope and king of Spaine. Thus much
I thought good to set downe for a caueat to the reader. For
these obseruations being well remembred, the reader shall be
more able to iudge of the discourse following. This caueat
must be well pervsed, throughly vnderstood, and faithfully
remembred; or els the reader cannot possibly be able, to
yeelde a sounde censure vpon the whole worke. First therfore
reade it; then vnderstande it; that donne, giue thy
iudgement, as indifferencie and right reason shall pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe.</p>
   <div type="notice">
      <head>An admonition to the Reader.</head>
      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Anie bookes are lately written, by the Iesuites and
secular Priests; <hi>viz</hi> the Relation; the Sparing disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie;
the Important cōsiderations; the Hope of peace
the Copies of discourse; the Quodlibets; the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue;
the answer to the Iesuited gentlemā; the Letters of <hi>A. C;</hi>
the Apologie; the reply to the libell of <hi>Parsons</hi> the Iesuite; <hi>the
aunswer to the Apologie,</hi> compiled by Master <hi>D. Ely; M. Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
defence; the manifestation of folly; the Replie to the Apologie;</hi>
the <hi>Franke discourse; the Iesuites catechisme.</hi> Which two last
bookes, the learned Papistes of France haue lately published.
All these bookes I haue pervsed verie seriously, and drawen
the summarie and chiefe points of them all, vnto certaine
heads, distincte bookes, and chapters. So as the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
reader may in a few houres, vnderstand the effect of the
whole proceeding, betweene the Iesuites and the secular
priestes. I haue like wise compiled an Alphabeticall table, in
which the reader may easilie finde out at his pleasure, any
principall matter handled in this discourse. To read all the said
bookes, is a labour both tedious and painefull. To buy them,
is too chargeable for manie. To vnderstand them, as they
are cōfusely published, is a thing not easie for the greater part.
The defect herein, my annotations and compendious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations
will supplie. The argument of the booke is so necessary
<pb facs="13"/>
for all true hearted English subiects, that I wish euerie one to
be well acquainted therewith. The reader may at his pleasure,
and that with all facilitie, turne to the originall in euerie booke
by me named, and by the helpe of my quotations, finde out
roundly the verie wordes which I put downe. For I alwaies
name both the booke and the page, and doe euer alledge their
owne words. That done, I haue inserted some speciall notes
&amp; obseruatiōs, as I deemed it expediēt for the good of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<hi>Paule</hi> planted, &amp; <hi>Apollo</hi> watred, but the God of heauen
gaue the increase. The same God I most humblie desire, so to
water the hearts of the readers with the dewe of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
blessing, that they may thereby learne to detest
all Iesuiticall treasons, and seditious Popish
factions. Fare-well.</p>
