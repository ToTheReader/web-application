And since this Church of Christ was founded among the Colossians, these three Cities mentioned in this Epistle, Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Colosse, were much shaken, if not vtterly ruinate with an Earthquake (which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <note n="c" place="margin">Paulus Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius. lib. 4. c. 10.

Num. 14. 11.</note> contempt of the Gospell, as we may see the Citie of Corinth for the same cause, euen then, smitten with the Pestilence, for the instruction, no doubt, of all succeeding ages to the worldes ende.</p>
   <p>As touching the writing of this Epistle, albeit this blessed Apostle had trauailed twise or <note n="e" place="margin">Acts. 15. 32. &amp; 16. 18. 23.</note> thrise thorough Phrigia, where these three Cities were, yet came he not to Colosse, for that <hi>Epaphras, Onesimus, Tychicus,</hi> with others, had first planted the Church of Christ in those parts. The reason is rendred by himselfe, when he saith, <hi>I</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 15. 20. 1. Cor. 3. 9.</note>
      <hi>enforced my selfe to preach the Gospell, not where Christ was, least I should haue built on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
      <pb facs="232"/>
      <hi>mans foundation.</hi> Being therefore afterwards oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned, as is most like by <hi>Epaphras</hi> and <hi>Tychicus,</hi> with other seruants of Christ, he wrote this worthy Epistle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prisoner in Rome, to the Colossians for their further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and confirmation in the faith of Christ.</p>
   <p>The argument is this in effect: Because the turbulent and superstitious Iewes disquieted the peace of the Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, intending, as else where often, to make a mixture of the Lawe and the Gospell: therefore the Apostle giues <note place="margin">The argument of the Epistle to the Colossians.</note> in this Epistle, a short abridgement of all the heauenly doctrine of our saluation, describing vnto vs in a most liuely manner what Christ is in his natures and offices, working most powerfully in all his liuing members vnited vnto him: and not to be (as the world imagineth) a dead, deformed, idle, painted, Popish Christ. So that this Epistle will teach Christians, soundly and truly, to discerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the shadow and substance of true Religion, betweene the true Christ and fained, and consequently betweene the true and false professors of the Gospell.</p>
   <p>There are seuen parts of this Epistle: I finde them so <note place="margin">Seuen parts of the Epistle to the Colossians.</note> set downe in Maister <hi>Rollocks</hi> latine Commentarie, very briefely and truly obserued as followeth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first part is the Salutation, chapter <hi>1.</hi> verse <hi>1, 2.</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second is the Preface, wherein he reioyceth for their faith in Christ, and loue to the Saints, from the <hi>3.</hi> verse to the <hi>12.</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third part containes his doctrine of Christs benefits to the Saints, namely their calling and redemption, where the Apostle proceedeth vnto an high description of the Sonne of God, into whose kingdome they were called and translated by the Gospell, applying all things to the Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, from the <hi>12.</hi> verse of the first chapter, to the <hi>23.</hi> of the same. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> In the fourth part, he exhorteth to perseuerance
<pb facs="232"/>
in the faith, and admonisheth that they take heede of false teachers, from the <hi>23.</hi> verse of the first chapter, to the end of the second chapter. In this part he intermingleth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition with exhortation, for verse <hi>23.</hi> of the first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he exhorteth to perseuerance in the faith: verse <hi>4.</hi> of the second chapter, he admonisheth them to take heede of false teachers, and in the sixt verse of the same chapter, he returnes againe to his exhortation: but verse <hi>8.</hi> he fals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to his admonition, and doth insist therein to the end of that chapter. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fift part begins at the third chapter, verse <hi>1.</hi> and continueth to the seuenth verse of the fourth chapter. This part containeth exhortations to holinesse of life. And here yee haue againe admonitions partly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, concerning all Christians, from the first verse of the third chapter, to the <hi>18.</hi> of the same, partly speciall, which concerne certaine particular states of men, as of Husbands and Wiues, Children and Parents, Seruants and Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, from the <hi>18.</hi> verse of the third chapter, to the second verse of the fourth chapter, where he returnes againe to generall exhortations, which be continued to the seuenth verse of the fourth chapter. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The sixt part is from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth verse of the fourth chapter, to the tenth of the same: wherein he signifieth to the Colossians, that as touching his priuat affaires, he had committed them to <hi>Tychicus</hi> and <hi>Onesimus,</hi> who should report of all things vnto them as they desired. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The seuenth and last part, is the conclusion of the Epistie, containing Salutations mixt with some Apostolicall iniunctions, and this is from the tenth verse of the last chapter, to the end.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, as concerning Maister <hi>Rollocke</hi> and his workes: because this is the first fruite of his labours, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in the English tongue: he was (as may appeare by
<pb facs="233"/>
many testimonies) a most reuerend and faithfull seruant of Iesus Christ. His name is very pretious and great in all reformed Churches and Nations, which haue receiued the Gospell of Christ. His learned and holy Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on the Prophecie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> on the Gospell of <hi>Iohn,</hi> on the Epistle to the <hi>Romans, Ephesians, Galathians, Colossians, Thessalonians,</hi> with his other workes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the Latine tongue, testifie aboundantly of his gifts and graces. And least any should except against my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">Epistola in Tractar. de vocatione ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficac. ad D. Iohnston.</note> which I confesse is but meane, or nothing, heare one to speake for all, whose wisdome and learning is reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of all the godly Churches (I meane Maister <hi>BEZA)</hi> concerning this mans workes. He saith, <hi>That his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours on the Epistle to the</hi> Romans <hi>and</hi> Ephesians, <hi>be as a rich treasure sent from God to his people. Next</hi> (saith he) <hi>without all flatterie be it spoken, I haue neuer as yet read any thing written in this kinde, more briefe, more eloquent, and more indicious.</hi> And then he proceedeth, saying, <hi>When I had viewed his workes, I could not containe my selfe, but as I was bound, I gaue God thankes for him, reioycing for his blessing on the Churches.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This part of his workes, I meane these Lectures on this Epistle, they were first preached in the Scottish tongue, not much differing from our speech specially in the North parts of this land; but now they are published in the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and vsuall English phrase, for the comfort and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I trust, of all such as vnderstand not the Latine tongue in both kingdomes. I could wish in mine heart, that all Preachers in both Churches, would learne of this man to Preach the Gospell of Christ; who, wanting neither wit nor learning to set forth his exercises: yet respects he
<pb facs="233"/>
(as the Apostle taught him) neither excellency of words nor humane wisdome, nor desires to sauour of any thing, but of Iesus Christ and him crucified. His continuall care is so to speake, as that the spirituall power and grace of the <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> Gospell, might speake onely to the consciences of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to worke in them: and not himselfe by any perswasions of his learning and eloquence. These workes are now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished after his death, so that he hath not performed what he could and would haue done, if his owne hand had been last vpon them. The Christian readers will therefore par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don (I doubt not) all faults louingly, which haue past in this first impression. And thus hauing commended this worke vnto thee, recommend me and it vnto the protection and blessing of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie in Christ Iesus.</p>
