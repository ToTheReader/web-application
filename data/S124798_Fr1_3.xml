   <head>The generall Epistle to the Readers.</head>
   <l>COme gazing world whose restles mind wold see &amp; read each thing</l>
   <l>And mark what wonders wit may find, that in this booke I bring,</l>
   <l>Note now howe nature is beguild, and God the nature takes</l>
   <l>Of euery wonder vnder Sunne, and thereof triumple makes:</l>
   <l>Come searching heads that finely shifts, the grosest bran from flowre,</l>
   <l>Who knows (through suttel sleights of world) no more thā naturs pour</l>
   <l>And marke what maruels mighty God, with maiestie doth shoe</l>
   <l>Our simple age and carelesse time, where lewde like learned goe:</l>
   <l>Come you that liues like Epicures, and likes no world but this</l>
   <l>And thinks when your bad life is gone, there is no other blisse,</l>
   <l>And note another kind of cause, that can constraine vs all</l>
   <l>In prostrate maner humble wise, with face on floure to fall.</l>
   <l>Come proudest peacoks in your plumes, with ruffling painted robes</l>
   <l>Come you that lookes when starres will fall, &amp; staers on goodly globes</l>
   <l>And veiw how starrs and planets falls, and earthly causes too</l>
   <l>If God when nature is at worst, strange things himselfe will doo.</l>
   <l>Come stubborne men that will not stoupe, at fearfull signes and shoes</l>
   <l>Nor care for trembling of the earth, which wonders comes and goes,</l>
   <l>By course of nature as some say, but therein make a pause</l>
   <l>Though kind commands amasse of things, there is a greater cause</l>
   <l>That moues the earth, &amp; shakes the world, wel worldlings come &amp; see</l>
   <l>What wonders God hath wrought for men, that wise and thankful be,</l>
   <l>And see what warnings God hath sent, to those he meanes to stricke</l>
   <l>Preserues the good wher fauour leads, &amp; plagues wher growes mislike.</l>
   <l>You stout stifnecked people proud, that stands on reasons ground,</l>
   <l>Come heere how farre past reasons earth, in learned eares doth sound,</l>
   <l>Make faith a proofe of your hard harts, and so let nature guide</l>
   <l>And you shall see who shootes aright, and when your shafts are wide:</l>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <l>If natures law and reasons rules, might run with right away,</l>
   <l>No place were left for God that rules, to rule and beare the swaie.</l>
   <l>O wily wits and babling tonges, yeeld vp your reasons lore</l>
   <l>And folllow our great captaines steps, that marcheth still before:</l>
   <l>Who leaues them lagging far behind, that lookes not after grace,</l>
   <l>And in their owne opinions dwell, with bold and shamelesse face.</l>
   <l>Come all the flocke of new found sects, that swarmes to much this day,</l>
   <l>And you shall see what glory great, Gods goodnes doth bewray.</l>
   <l>Come Deitists and Athists all, bring brabling bookes and wordes</l>
   <l>That you in bitter sorte let fall, sometime with iests and bords,</l>
   <l>And see his mighty workes aboue, that rules all at his will,</l>
   <l>Who makes earth ayre and waters moue, to make men muse on still.</l>
   <l>Come cunning brains whose quick conceits, are ripe and in their prime</l>
   <l>Come read strange things that wonders are, bestow therein some time.</l>
   <l>Come souldiers that loues sword &amp; fire, &amp; mark what wars God makes</l>
   <l>With kings and kingdomes in his ire, when he the quarrell takes,</l>
   <l>Come see the fall of mighty men, that many battayls won,</l>
   <l>Yet dropt downe headlong now and then, as fatall chances run.</l>
   <l>Come you that thinke you sit so fast, you can ne slip nor slide</l>
   <l>And thinke by gesse of wonders past, what you may iudge this tide:</l>
   <l>Come hither high aspiring mind, that hopes the cloudes to clime,</l>
   <l>And by these warnings heere you find, reforme your selues in time:</l>
   <l>Come you that please I say no more, my verses so I ende</l>
   <l>And craue that you with patience read, that I with paines haue pend.</l>
