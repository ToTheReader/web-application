      <salute>MADAM,</salute>
   </opener>
   <lg>
      <l>SO sleeps the Anchoret on his cheap bed,</l>
      <l>(whose sleep wants only length to prove him dead)</l>
      <l>As I last night, whom the swift wings of Thought,</l>
      <l>Convey'd to see what our bold faith had taught;</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Elizium,</hi> where restored formes nere fade;</l>
      <l>Where growth can need no seeds, nor light a shade;</l>
      <l>The joyes which in our flesh, through fraile expence</l>
      <l>Of strentgh, through age, were lost t'our injur'd sense,</l>
      <l>Wee there doe meet agen; and those we taste</l>
      <l>Anew, which though devour'd, yet ever last:</l>
      <l>
         <pb n="23" facs="21"/>The scatter'd treasure of the Spring, blowne by</l>
      <l>Autumn's rude winds from our discoverie;</l>
      <l>Lillies, and Roses; all that's faire and sweet,</l>
      <l>There reconcil'd to their first roots we meet:</l>
      <l>There, only those triumphant Lovers reigne,</l>
      <l>Whose passions knew on earth so little staine,</l>
      <l>Like Angels they nere felt what sexes meant;</l>
      <l>Virtue, was first their nature, then intent:</l>
      <l>There, toyling Victors safely are possest,</l>
      <l>With servent youth, eternitie, and rest;</l>
      <l>But they were such, who when they got the field;</l>
      <l>To teach the conquer'd, victorie, could yeeld</l>
      <l>Themselves againe; as if true glorie were</l>
      <l>To bring the foe to courage, not to feare.</l>
      <l>There are no talking Greeks, who their blood lost,</l>
      <l>Not for the cause, but for a theame to boast;</l>
      <l>As if they strove enough for Fame, that sought</l>
      <l>To have their Batailes better told, than fought.</l>
      <l>There I a <hi>Vestal's</hi> Shadow first did spy,</l>
      <l>Who when a live with holy huswifry,</l>
      <l>Trick'd up in lawne, and flow'ry Wreaths (each hand</l>
      <l>Cleane as her thoughts) did'fore the Altar stand:</l>
      <l>
         <pb n="24" facs="22"/>So busie still, strewing her Spice, and then</l>
      <l>Removing Coales, vexing the Fire agen,</l>
      <l>As if some queasie <hi>Goddesse</hi> had profess'd,</l>
      <l>To taste no smoak that day, but what she dress'd:</l>
      <l>This holy coyle she living kept; but farre</l>
      <l>More busie now, with more delightfull care</l>
      <l>Than when she watch'd the consecrated Flame,</l>
      <l>Sh'attends the <hi>Shade</hi> of gentle <hi>Buckingham;</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Who there unenvi'd sits, with Chaplets crownd;</l>
      <l>And with wise scorne, smiles on the Peoples wound;</l>
      <l>He call'd it so; for though it touch'd his heart,</l>
      <l>His Nation feeles the rancour, and the smart.</l>
