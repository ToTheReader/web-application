May this last yere.
1574. trauayling
frō <hi>Florēce</hi> towards
<hi>Millan,</hi> I by chance
met with a <hi>Florentine</hi> gentleman,
who, after certayne embrasinges
and acquaintance taken by reason
of some former knowledge both
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
at the court and at <hi>Paris,</hi> vsed such
courtesy and honesty towards me,
that of force I was compelled not
to leaue his companye, before I
had visited hys mansion house,
whereas hauyng for the space of
two dayes enterteyned mee w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good cheere, I hauing pulled on
my bootes, determining to returne
whither as especially my way lay,
and being ready to take my leaue
of him, he brought into my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
a pourse, conteyning by esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
(cōsidering the greatnesse
and weight of the same) a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande
or xii. hundred crownes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
me to take so much thereof
as my selfe thought good, for the
which, (notwithstanding I had
thereof great neede,) yet determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to make of necessitie vertue
according vnto my duetie I than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
hym, perswading my self tha<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb n="3" facs="3"/>
at <hi>Millan</hi> I shold meet some frend
who would lend me so much. But
he hauing shewed me, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> knowing
from how long and tedious a iour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ney
I now was returned, he was
not also ignorant how sore it had
consumed my coyne, wherefore he
earnestly entreated me not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
my necessitie, but willed mee
in any wise to take my commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of his store as him selfe in lyke
case would doe with mine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
doubtynge leaste some of
my trayne had reuealed vnto
hym my estate, as in very deede
the nexte day I learned who had
committed this offence) I made
hym answear that seing he would
needes doe me such a pleasure, I
wold willingly borow of him two
hundred crownes, I had scarcely
sayd the word but presently he told
me out three hundred pistolets vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
my own band which I deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto him sealed and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
with my owne hande, which
with great dificoulty I forced him
to take, and besides that hee vsed
toward me so much verteous and
honest communication with suche
thanckes for that I had so muche
pleasured him as to come and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
his house, and so largely ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
my selfe vnto him, that if the
opinion of <hi>Pithagoras</hi> were as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
as in deed it is false, I shuld
haue occasion to thincke that the
soule of some Frenchman of the
former time, reteyning yet the tas<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>
of his former <hi>Adam,</hi> had bene lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the body of this man, euen
from the day of his birth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
I am so greatly bound vnto
him, that I doubt I neuer shal be
able sufficientlye to discharge my
selfe, and yet is it but small, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="5" facs="4"/>
of that wherein all French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are bound to him generally,
and my selfe perticulerly, in that
after large communication of the
miseries of <hi>France,</hi> with the water
in hys eyes, he drew out of a smal
boxe two leaues of paper written
in Italian speach and letter, and
deliuered them vnto mee to read,
wherin I satisfying hys expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and being come vnto the last
syde, not geuing me leaue to finish
the same, he desired mee to keepe
and translate it into French, to the
ende I might send the copyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my frendes, bicause he knew it
most necessary to publishe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes
therof. Oh how good a man
he was, I would to God that all
Italians which be in <hi>France</hi> were
lyke to him, and that they were as
good Christians as I know hym
to bee: Wherefore seeing that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="6" facs="5"/>
the promise which I made
vnto him, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in this his request, I
would not faile him, touched no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but him self only, yet could I
not be quiet▪ before I had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
hys entent, so highly doe I
finde my selfe bonnde vnto him,
with much more reason thē ought
I now to proceed in the same, least
I should to greeuouslye swarue
from my duetie toward my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
in as much as indifferently it
concerneth all frenchmen in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
also bicause the effecte of the
publishing of the same, may stoppe
the course of the most cruell and
tirannous practises that euer
were conspired in Christendome,
as all men may perceaue in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
so much peyne as to read my
translation of the afore named
two sheetes of paper. The which
to the same ende I haue dedicated
<pb n="7" facs="5"/>
vnto all my Lordes the princes of
the blood, other Princes, Lordes
and gentlemen, and vnto all other
good and legitimate Frēchmen, of
what estate or condicion soeuer
they bee, as well of the one religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as of the other, according to the
counsell of this honest <hi>Florentine,</hi>
with most humble supplication vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
all such as I doe owe the same,
and most earnest request vnto all
other, that they wil accept the zeale
and good will as well of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine,</hi>
as of the translator hereof
with as good a harte, as the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator
doth pray vnto God long and
blessedly to preserue thē in health
and prosperitie, attendyng hys
owne opinion herevpon, which he
will place in the ende of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayde
discourse.</p>
