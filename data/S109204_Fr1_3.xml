No rytches, no substance, no posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,

   <p>Kynge Codrus<note place="margin">Codrus.</note> ascertayned by y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>

aunswered wyth a lustye harte and
sayd, whan he went forthe vnto the

that he should dye, or els slay them?
<pb facs="7"/>
It is more mery to heare that he is
dead, as it was worthy hym, and y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>

lyue all his lyfe lyke a dastarde, and
shew no poynte of valeaūce. O hart
more courageous, thā the feminine

wonte for the mooste parte to loue
theyr neuewes and childres chyldrē
more tēderly than y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> very mothers.
Yet this granddame Gyrtias lamē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted

This semeth to smell barbaryke im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manite,

pyle a worke moche longer than the

yea I shoulde not only farre excede

myght in ony poynt do good to the
publique weale of Englond. Whan
I sawe this valeaūt courage in thē,
and perceaued theyr vnfayned affec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion
&amp; loue toward theyr countrey,
Lorde God, wyth how great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion
and stupore was I affected
&amp; striken? My ioye was surely grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
thā I cā here expresse, to se this
faythfull obedience in them toward
the Kynges graces maieste, this fer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uent
loue toward theyr countrey,
this harty affecte toward the cōmō
weale of Englonde. And I doubte
not, but that lyke obeysaunce and
prōptitude was also found in other
places of this Realme.</p>
   <p>These thynges thus done,<note place="margin">The good mynd &amp; fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent affecciō of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Author towarde his countrey.</note> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to thynke with my selfe on this
manner, Lord God, vnder howe vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fortunate
starre was I borne, that
am endewed neither with wyt, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecy,
<pb facs="11"/>
valeaunce, strength, wysdome,
rytches, or ony other thynge, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wythe
I maye do good to my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
as other men do. The vayne of
my wytte is barren, my pollecye is
grosse, my valeaunce is nothynge,
my strength is lytle, my wisdom is
base, my riches are not worth a Gal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
halfe peny besydes a few bokes &amp;
a lytle slender apparell. Alas what
shall I do? Shall I shewe my selfe
in no poynt thanckefull to my coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey?
Shal other men ieopard both
theyr lyues and goodes for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
of the publique weale, and I
in the meane season do nothynge?
Shall I be founde an vnnaturall
braūche and a corrupte seed: It sha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth
me to lyue, and I maye ryght
well recount my selfe moost misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
seynge I am coniecte into suche
vnfortunate state, that I am able
by no meanes to do that for my coū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trey
<pb facs="12"/>
in acte, whiche my mynde coue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth
in wyll.</p>
   <p>At the last I remembred y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> poore
wydowe of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Gospel,<note place="margin">Luke. xxi.</note> which althogh
she were not able to cast into y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury
so moche as the rytche mē dyd,
yet offered two minutes &amp; ware ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
for her good wyll. I called al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so
vnto remembraunce, howe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylly
king Artozerzes,<note place="margin">Kyng Arto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerzes.</note> with diuers
other were wont to receaue base, sī<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
homely &amp; cōmon gyftes of theyr
subiectes, &amp; to geue them rewardes
worthy a Prīce for theyr good wyl.
Whan I perpēded these thynges w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
my self it encouraged me to do some
what (althoughe y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> somewhat maye
ryghte well be recounted some lytle
nothyng) that I may shew my selfe
not altogither vnworthy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
of my countrey. And for as
muche as I haue bene trayned vp
from my cradles in the court of La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
<pb facs="12"/>
Mnemosyne &amp; her doughters, &amp;
exercised in the wrastlynge place of
Apollo (althogh I maye iustly seme
to haue bene there but a vayne ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer
and ydle spectatour) I thought
it not vndecente accordynge to my
profession of letters to bryng for the
some litteral lucubraciō which beīg
diligentely red and followed of my
coūtremē, shoulde not be altogither
vnfruytfull to our cōmon coūtrey.
I haue therefore in thys tumulte &amp;
noyse of warres compyled a certen
lytle Treatyse, entitled, The polle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of warre,<note place="margin">The cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>tes of thys boke.</note> not vnworthy the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
chefely at this tyme. <q>In it I
haue declared in howe pitefull case
y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> christen publique weale consisteth
almoost vniuersally. I haue shewed
also what is the cause of these cruell
warres, that reygne n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>we almoost
thorowe out the whole worlde, &amp; by
what meanes they maye be ceased.
<pb facs="13"/>
I haue furthermore openned after
what manner we maye get the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of our enemies. Agayne I haue
shewed howe y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Souldiours ought
to behaue them selues bothe whan
they go to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> warres, and whā they
are in them, that God maye be on
theyr syde. Moreouer I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red,
howe they that tarye at home,
oughte also to behaue them selues,
vnlesse that for theyr iniquite &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryghteous
behauoure God forsake
our army. Finally I haue here opē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
how christen men shall returne
frō the warres after they haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the victory, and on what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they shall behaue them selues, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg>
theyr countrey may enioye peace &amp;
tranquilite euer after.</q>
   </p>
   <p>All theyse thynges haue I done
in this lytle treatyse followyng,<note place="margin">Si quis lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur ut sermones Deiloqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng
as I trust, to the vayne of
the holy scripture And as gladly as
<pb facs="13"/>
I haue compiled this shorte worke,
so gladly would I haue done ony o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thynge for the incolumite and
safegarde of my countrey, yf it had
lyghen in my power. Uerely let all
men beleue me, if my rytches &amp; wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
had bene equall withe Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
if my pollecy &amp; strengthe had
bene lyke with Sāpsons, I would
no lesse hartelye haue employed thē
all for the wealthe of my countrey,
than I haue bestowed my labour in
settynge for the this lytle treatyse.
But whan I maye not do y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> one, let
it suffice that I do the other. The
Poet sayth, <hi>In magnis uoluisse satest.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
is he altogyther ingrate &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynd,
which for his puissaūce mayn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
cōtēdeth to shewe hymselfe thāke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full
and kynd agayne, although his
acte at all tymes dothe not greatly
aunswere his good wyll. Notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng
I trust, yf this my worke
<pb facs="14"/>
be diligently read, marked and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
it shall not onlye declare my
honest and naturall harte towarde
my countrey, but also teache men a
more godly fashō in the warres, thā
hathe bene hytherto vsed of many.
I praye God, it maye brynge forthe
no lesse frute, than I haue entēded.
But this my labour what so euer it
be I offer to your ryght worshypful
mastershyp, both because ye are one
whom God aboue many other hath
endewed w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> moost goodly qualities,
worthy the renowne of worshyp, &amp;

Languages, than in the actiuite of

as ye haue euer hytherto earnestely
embrased not only the studies of hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mayne

<pb facs="14"/>
y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> ye wyll accepte this my lytle gifte

me hereafter to attēpte some other
enterprises of no lesse weyghty and
