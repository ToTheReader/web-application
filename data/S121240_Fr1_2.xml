   <head>TO THE RIGHT Reuerend Father in God, my honourable Lord, <hi>Iohn Thornburgh,</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> health and happinesse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Fowlers of the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall Bird (Right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Prelate) being of so different quality, that some liue in extreme po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty to the very last point of their age, others in plenty; as I haue obserued these eight yeeres, in my trauels through <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> maketh me to thinke that the
<pb facs="4"/>
Poets haue described <hi>Atalanta</hi> for a type of <hi>Alchymie.</hi> She being a maid of most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable swiftnes, in which gift she ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed all mankind, did couenant with her suters to runne for life and death, vnder condition of marriage; that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer of them were ouerrunne, should be put to death, but who did ouerrunne her, should liue and marry her. Many did runne, many were ouerrunne, many killed. Vntill that <hi>Hippomanes</hi> running with her, and almost ouercome, threw downe three golden Apples one after another, the gifts of <hi>Venus.</hi> Which, <hi>Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanta</hi> stooping to take vp, hindred her course, was wonne and obtained in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Whereby the dangerous course of <hi>Alchymie</hi> in many is manifestly seene, that who doth not ouercome it, peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth; and whosoeuer is to ouercome it, must first receiue three golden Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from <hi>Venus.</hi> The Philosophicall Mythologie thereof, none that I haue knowne or heard of, can better explaine than your Lordship, whose singular
<pb facs="4"/>
learning, not in shadow or superficiall, but solid and in substance, from time to time vnder two glorious Princes, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iames,</hi> hath exalted you to higher and higher degrees of Ecclesiasticall dignity, and whose cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, generous, graue, and comely hauiour in speech and actions, doth declare your Lordship to beare so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a mind, that it dwelleth rather in an heauenly Palace, than an earthly body. Your diuine studies requiring healthfull intermission, hath admitted no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of Spirit, than the most worthy sight of philosophicall trialls. Wherein God hath so blessed your Lordship, that albeit you haue largely bestowed char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges therein, yet without decay of any part of your estate, or losse of time, or failing in expectation, you haue found out most rare secrets, as well for profit as for the health of man, approued with great admiration of many, both the noblest Patients, and best Physitians of the Kingdome: neither is that all, but
<pb facs="5"/>
imitating the bounty of GOD, whose glory is most eminent in the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of goodnesse vnto others; your Lordship to benefit the whole world, and to saue the painfull searchers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from dangerous and chargeable courses, hath most learnedly, most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and most curiously penned and published your late Treatise, LITHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THEORICOS, of <hi>nihil, aliquid, omnia.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>These considerations haue moued me to esteeme none worthier than your Lordship, vnto whose honour should be consecrated, this Philosophicall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypsis with the exposition thereof, much esteemed amongst the learned in <hi>Italy,</hi> but in <hi>England</hi> regrated to bee heretofore so put in print, that it seemed to be a Leopard spotted with diuers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; so that one part thereof was Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, and another Latine. Whereby they who vnderstood the one part, could not vnderstand the other, vnlesse they were skilfull in both the Languages. I haue now reduced it all to one language
<pb facs="5"/>
so neere as could bee done, word by word, without addition or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing in any thing, that your Lordship may the better iudge thereof. Which I doe heartily offer vnto your Lordship, as a testimony not onely of that respect, which generally all men of learning doe owe vnto your Lordship (your house being vnto them for an Apollinian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, as a liuing Library, a flourishing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy, or a religious Abbey) but speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the whole Scottish Nations sake, which hath alwaies found your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship a constant and effectuall friend, a louing Father, a royall Maecaenas, and a vertuous patterne of all goodnesse. In this Dedication may bee found my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention honest, the gift small, your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour great, the euent happy; if your Lordship accepting thereof, doe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your accustomed prouidence, carefully proceed in the practical search of that Chrystalline central Salt, whereof this Treatise wittily handleth, which all that know your Lordships most worthy
<pb facs="6"/>
disposition, doe earnestly wish vnto your Lordship, with all felicity both corporall and spirituall, temporall and perpetuall, and in that wish I rest</p>
