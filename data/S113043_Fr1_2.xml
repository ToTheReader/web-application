   <head>TO THE HONORA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE, SIR GEORGE CAREY, KNIGHT MARSHAL OF HER MAIESTIES HOVSE, <hi>GOVERNOVR OF THE ISLE OF VVIGHT, and sonne and heire apparant to the Lord of Hunsdon▪ Lord Chamberlaine, &amp;c.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>EORGE CASTRIOT the Prince of EPIRE ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing long soiorned amongest the French, is now come as a traueller to see the entertainment of the English: his desire is, to be made knowne vnto some honorable personage, vnder whose fauour and protection he may passe freely amongst the English without being wronged or iniured in his trauell: but to whom should he haue recourse? or to whom can he be better recommended then to your selfe? whose respectiue regard of strangers, and Honorable hospitality continued without match or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare: and whose Noble descent vnited in consanguinitie to the thrice honored house of the most renowmed Empresse of our English nation, promiseth acceptance of his deuoted affection and Honorable patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, against all such dangers as commonly accompanie trauellers in forreine countries. He hath heard in places farre distant from this Isle, aswell of your succesfull imploiments in ambassage for Prince &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie (as best can witnesse the French and Scottish nations) as of your grounded experience in militarie profession, wherein you haue bene trained from your younger yeares: and being himselfe a souldier, hath therefore resolued to presse into your presence, and in your loue of Martialists, entirely to commend himselfe to the assurance of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. If his attire wherein he is clad, be plaine and simple, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sumptuous: if his habit do seeme either too base for the state and presence of the Court, or too contemptible for the nice curiositie of the citie, or too stale for the variable fashions of the countrie: yet for
<pb facs="3"/>
that vnder the meanenesse of his attire are hidden most rich treasures of incomparable knowledge, and rare experience: I doubt not but you will grace the desert of his vertues without respecting his outward shew and apparance: to the intent that so admirable an example of all mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie perfections, and the singular precepts which may be deriued out of this historie of his life and actions, may haue that due applause and commendation of the world, which the greatnesse of his exploits, and the worthinesse of the worke do iustly deserue in the eye &amp; iudgement of the wise. VVhatsoeuer defects do appeare about him: you may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them to the ignorance and ouersight of his guide, who knew not better how to direct him: and whose willingnesse was greater to cause this stranger to see England, then his skill and abilitie to giue him the rightes that belonged vnto him. Notwithstanding, if it may please you in regard of the honorable bountie shining in your noble mind, and for Scanderbeg his owne sake to giue him a gratious welcome: I make no doubt, but others likewise, either all, or the most, or the best will be glad to entertaine him: by meanes whereof my selfe also who haue conducted him to your presence, shall both hold me highly fauored, and I shall euer liue in the continuall contemplation of your honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertues as a vowed Orator for the greatnesse of your fortunes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fauour whereof, I desire most humbly to be reputed.</p>
