   <head>THE COPPIE OF A Letter, written by a Gentleman that had sometimes serued the King of Spaine: To a Catholike Gentleman his Kinseman and Friend.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR,</hi> vnderstanding as well by your Letters, as also by the message lately done vnto mee by the mouth of <hi>R. B.</hi> of the greate longing and desire you haue to come into these partes, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your selfe heere in seruice of the Spanish King: And percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing also not onely by your sayde Letters, but by the Gentleman that brought the same, &amp; by the report of sundrie others, that many young Gentlemen of our Countrie are of your minde in that point: Some thereunto (as I gesse) moued of a youthfull and vaine tickling humor, to be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb facs="4"/>abroad in strange and forrein Countries: others in hope there to grow to great preferment, aduāncement, imployment, &amp; wealth: other some pretending matter of conscience, seeme to haue sure confidence that there they may liue with more liberty &amp; ease of minde, than that which within our Countrie they inioy: I haue thought good for the particular loue which I beare, and alwayes haue born towards you, vnto whom I wish as to my self (but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in respect of that due humble regard, and zealous reuerent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which I beare to the seruice and sacred person of our most gracious and princely Soueraigne, the Queenes most excellent Maiestie, and to my most dearly loued natiue Countrie &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen) to set downe some notes and obseruations, which by a long and dangerous experience in this place I haue heedfully gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, By which (I hope) I shall make manifest, as well to you, as likewise to all other my Countrymen (howsoeuer in humor dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) by apparant examples, and vndeniable truthes, how greatlie you and they (that desire to repaire hether, by anie of the motions before expressed, are in anie hope of good to bee receiued from the sayd King of Spaine or his ministers,) do erre and are deceiued. I heartely and most earnestly desire you &amp; all other that shall reade this Treatise, deeply to iudge and consider of these pointes, which I shall heerein set downe, which (God willing) I will doo with such fidelitie, true meaning, and sinceritie, as that no parte of the same shall be truly to be gainsaid or refelled, and my selfe by the persons, times, and places, and other circumstances, shall make most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and plaine, to anie that shall doubt of the truth of the same, or anie part thereof. And I shal take great ioy and comfort, if my self hauing vndertaken an vntowardly &amp; dangerous course, though with better successe than hath happened to many hundreds, may be as a caueat to all the young Gentlemen of our nation, how they hazard themselues so daungerously: and that my painfull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb facs="4"/>may be to them as a Looking glasse, wherein they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the spots &amp; errors of their conceiued fansies, or as a marke set vp for them, whereby they may auoid the perills and most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rockes and shelfes, to them yet vnknowen, and lying hidden vnder the smooth, faire, and delightfull conceiued, and fantasied pleasures suggested vnto them by their owne imagination, the same being vnexperienced, and therefore without mistrust. And surely I cannot too much commend the saying of that excellent Romane Orator, who placed in the first degree of wisedome, those that were of themselues best able to giue good aduise, and in the next, those that were willing, and inclinable to follow it.</p>
   <p>But some man may here perchance aske me, whēce I haue such an assurance of my wit, that I will take vpon me to aduise others, who are perchance better able to counsell me? To this I answere, that if anie man how meane so euer, will for my profite and good go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to instruct mee in anie thing, wherein himselfe hath made so long experience, and will confirme the same with so many sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall proofes and examples as I will doo this, hee shall finde mee easie to be perswaded, without straining himselfe to the search of anie high points of wit, or subtiltie of well couloured speech, for so manifest a truth needs no disguising, but rather is by a plain and simple nakednesse the more commended. But as for those that with fore-possessed mindes, regarde not what daunger so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they throwe themselues into,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Circe</hi> was a greate Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse, who transformed such into beastes and monsters as hearkned to hir allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</note> greedily with a new-fangled appetite swallowing downe anie licour that presents it selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in a glistering cuppe, I thinke neither wit nor truth will bee of much auaile, though those that are of greater discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and more temperatly disposed, will (I doubt not) reade it wyth indifferent eyes, and conceiue of it as it deserueth. For if they were to saile along the perillous rockes of Circe or the Syrenes, I thinke
