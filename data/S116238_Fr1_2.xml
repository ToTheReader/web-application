      <salute>Most dread Soueraigne:</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O heauy, for many yeares, hath been the hand of Protestant Ministers, vpon vs Catholikes, your auncient and faithfull subiects, that heauen is ful with our cries, the world with our afflictions; the earth is drunk with our bloud, the aire a receptacle for our quarters; prisons are filled with our bodies, and Pursuiuants, infamous men, at their pleasures inriched with the spoile of our goods; in such sort, as with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> liuing in like persecution, we may truly say: <hi>Wee</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 9.</note>
      <hi>are made a spectacle to the world, and to Angels, and to men:</hi> that the extremity of our afflictions enforceth vs to Appeale vnto your <hi>Maiesty,</hi> prostrate at your feet, in most humble manner, to beseech your Highnesse to heare the truth of our cause, and take notice of the sincerity of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to <hi>God,</hi> your Person and State.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>God</hi> Almighty out of his infinit goodnesse hauing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs, <hi>according to his owne Image,</hi> and after our fall <note place="margin">
         <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27.</note> redeemed vs from eternall paines; in token of homage, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth of vs the practising and professing of that Faith and Religion, which was planted vpon earth by his only Son our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Sauiour Iesus Christ,</hi> and that with such rigor; as whosoeuer at his death shalbe found faultie herein, shall not onely lose the inheritance of the kingdome of heauen, and the happie vision of his diuine Maiesty, but also <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned into fire euerlasting, which was prepared for</hi>

      <hi>the Diuell and his angels,</hi> there to endure the wrath and vengeance of <hi>God</hi> for euer and euer.</p>
   <p>And lest any one should doubt, which was this Faith or Religion; he swore he would multiply it in men, <hi>as the</hi>

      <hi>Starres of heauen;</hi> that remaining in all ages and times
<pb facs="4"/> visibly seene and professed; none could or should haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of doubting, which was this Faith or Religion, vnto the which he was so straitly bound; vnlesse he would wilfully be obstinate and blinde: And yet notwithstanding your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Ministers, contrary to the oath of <hi>God,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect of the penalty of eternall damnation imposed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on misbeleeuers, would perswade vs that their Religion, which about threescore yeares agoe was inuented in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by Queene <hi>ELIZABETH</hi> (only to keepe your <hi>Maiesties</hi> Mother, and her issue from their lawfull right to the Crowne of <hi>England)</hi> is the Religion which was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Sauiour; and afflict vpon your ancient subiects, (who haue maintained your Progenitors in the state of Kings and absolute Monarkes, many hundred yeares) confiscati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of goods and lands, imprisonment, losse of liberty and life, and the benefit of all Ciuil and Humane lawes and conuersation; for that we wil not beleeue them, to the losse of our owne soules, and in continuance of time, the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of your Monarchie; according to the Prophecies, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>I will blesse them that blesse thee, and curse them</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3.</note>
      <hi>that curse thee: In thee shall all the Kindreds of the earth be blessed. The Nation and the Kingdome that</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Isay</hi> 60. 12.</note>
      <hi>shall not serue thee shall perish.</hi> Which we haue seene so manifestly fulfilled in al ages &amp; times amongst Christians, that hitherto neuer any Nation, People, or Countrey of Christian men, did separate it selfe by Schisme from the Catholike Church, the spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> dilated ouer the world; but it was within few yeares conquered by barbarus people.</p>
   <p>Whereupon, we your ancient subiects, feareful lest we should be forsaken of <hi>God,</hi> and fal into these euils, and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous in any thing to offend your <hi>Maiestie,</hi> our dearest Soueraigne; prostrate at your feete, doe humbly offer vnto your <hi>Highnesse;</hi> the grounds and foundations of our Faith and Religion; by which we proue that it is the same Faith
<pb facs="4"/> and Religion, which was planted vpon earth by our Lord and Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> in which al the Kindreds of the earth were to be blessed: hoping therby to remoue away from your <hi>Majesties</hi> minde, these sinister false informations, which such as neither wish well, either to your Person or State, more then may serue to the accomplishing of their designes, daily publish in your presence, viz. <hi>That we are wilfull disloyall Subjects, who vnder pretext of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, pretend Rebellion. Ignorant blinde people, that haue nothing to say for the Religion we professe. Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to your</hi> Maiesty <hi>and State, &amp;c.</hi> That your <hi>Majesty</hi> being better informed; we also may taste of the sweetnesse of your Gouernment, who are at al times, and in al things, as readie to obey and serue you, our dread Soueraigne, as our Auncestors haue serued and obeyed your Progeniters, Kings, and absolute Monarkes of this Iland; or as the Catholike subiects of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> or of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Polonie,</hi> do serue their Soueraignes: And in testimony hereof, we offer to binde our selues, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to remaine loyal &amp; faithful Subiects vnto your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi> your Heires, and lawful Successours, by amoath; whereby we may not, in effect and deed, sweare that <hi>God</hi> Almighty is forsworne, in violating his oath and promises, which he made to the Patriarks and Prophets, euery where spoken of in the Scriptures, to be fulfilled in that Faith, Seede and Religion, which was to be planted vpon earth by his only Son, our Lord and Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Your <hi>Majesty</hi> wel knoweth, that it is not yet much about threescore yeares, since these your Kingdomes of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> were Catholike, and the most of vs, together with our Auncestors, neuer were of any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <note place="margin">See this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter▪</note> then this we now professe, since our Conuersion to Christianity from Paganisme: And if we should now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it, for feare of the losse of temporall goods, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and hanging; and not out of information in beleefe,
<pb facs="5"/> we should be but Atheists, and be worthy to be hanged vp indeed, for dissembling with men, and violating all obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Moreouer, the meanes which <hi>God</hi> Almighty appointed his Officers to vse in the conuersion of Kingdomes and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was, Humility, Patience, Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> saying: <hi>Behold</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 16.</note>
      <hi>I send you, as sheepe in the middest of Wolues:</hi> he did not say, I send you as Wolues amongst sheepe, to kill, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, spoyle, and deuoure those vnto whom they were sent. Againe he said: <hi>They</hi> (to whom I send you) <hi>will deliuer</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 17.</note>
      <hi>you vp in Councels, and in their Synagogues they wil scourge you. And to Presidents, and to Kings shall you be led for my sake:</hi> He doth not say, you whom I send shall deliuer the people, whom you ought to conuert, into Councels, and put them in prisons, and leade them to Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and Tribunall seats, and make their Religion Fellony and Treason. Againe he saith: <hi>When yee enter into</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 12.</note>
      <hi>the house, salute it, saying, Peace be to this house:</hi> He doth not say, you shall send Pursuiuants to ransacke and spoyle the house. Againe he saith: <hi>The good Pastor gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth</hi>

         <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.</note>
      <hi>his life for his sheepe. The theefe commeth not but to steale, and kill, and destroy:</hi> He doth not say, the theefe giueth his life for his sheepe; and the good Pastor commeth not but to steale, kill and destroy.</p>
   <p>Wherefore, so much as is lawful for poore subiects, wee humbly beseech your <hi>Majestie,</hi> that conuerting of vs by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, imprisonments, confiscation of goods, ransacking and spoyling by Promoters and Pursuiuants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> laid aside, (at which the Christian world is scandalized) it would please your <hi>Majestie</hi> to giue order, that Disputations, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and sweet meanes may be vsed for the discussion of truth, according to the doctrine of our <hi>Sauiour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> which is <hi>Peaceable, modest suasible, consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the good, full of mercie:</hi> and by those meanes, if <note place="margin">
