   <p>I Writ not this (gentle Reader) to derogate from his worth, whose labor first brought this worke within the rules of Arte, and hath thereby, as Virgill for the tillage of the earth, Vige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius for Millitary profession, Hipocrates and Gallen for Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, Iustinian for the Law, Aristotle, Tullie, Euclides, Boetius Ptolomeus, for the liberall Sciences, Pomponius Mela, for Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mography, or Marcator for the Globes of the world, (thought his matter may be of some accounted as the least) yet for his forme deserued commendations with the best: but for his learned style, exceedeth the capacitie of the greater part of men, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it selfe being so necessary for all, I haue, (as I could) gathered his worke into a briefe compendium, for theyr better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that are ignorant in the Latine tongue. Thus not to gaine the reward of other mens labours, nor to attribute to my selfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens vertues, but to vncurtaine that to the view of all, which was onely appropriated to a fewe, haue I vnder-gone this taske▪ which I doubt not will proue as profitable as pleasant.</p>
