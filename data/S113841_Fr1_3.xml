      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was not in vaine (Christian reader) that the ancient fathers of the Church, worthy and Godly wryters vsed alwayes preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in some preface or Epistle before their workes to reclaime their writinges from suspition and reproch: in so much as the Church of God neuer wanted enuious, malicious and captious aduersaries, who with their slaunderous tongues and dispightfull lawes sought to teare in pieces, or by Zoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous vpbraydings to blemishe, or by reprochfull speeches and lyspings to cancell the credite of whatsoeuer was god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wisely, carefully and to good purpose penned downe by them. These times yeelde occasion of no lesse suspition of like intertainment to be giuen to good thinges written for the comfort and help of the simple and ignorant: especially whē they are to proceede from so vnworthy an instrument and so vnskilfull an indictor as my selfe, when the writings and workes of so famous &amp; godly men haue gone before as great torchelights, or as the Sunne at noone dayes, and I to come after in so lowe a course, should seeme as a starie borrowing light from others, and yet so, as giuing light to some. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath his glory aswell of the interiour plances and fixed startes in their order and degree, as of the Sun and the great lights in their excellencie: I doubted not but was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that in my calling, degree, measure &amp; place assigned me of God, I should both do good and be helpful to the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at least &amp; ignorant (if not to the learned) and also should bring some glory vnto that God from whom I haue receiued that vvhich I haue. Casting mine eyes therefore of from the scornefull reproches of the worlde, from the malice and enuie of the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>pers, and from the suspitious heart of them which suspect all things, and finally from the regard of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men my heart being directed to the Lord on whom ono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="7"/> I waite, mine eyes turned toward his Church whō I dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tender in the Lord, I was forced to yeelde to this worke which I haue taken in hand: yet so that after the request of many which hard these fewe Sermons that follow (not with out some comfort and profite as they saide) I yeelded to trie what I coulde doe in penning of them as I vttered them so neere as I could, after which thing done and beeing seene of some, altho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>gh I neuer thought to haue it passe out of my hands, yet had I it not onely coppied out by others, but also I was exceedingly charged by them that I should dishonour God in concealing of the thing, and should doe great iniurie to many soules which might reape special comfort thereby, themselues being witnesses against me of that comfort and benefite which they should want by the withholding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of insomuch as it was likely to be preferred vnto publishing without my knowledge or consent if I had not yeelded. For which causes I haue taken in had to prefix these few words Humbly intreating that no man misiudge of this my poore trauaile. Now if any marueil at these long excuses preceeding any other matter, it is therefore, that I might satisfie the god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in rendring a reason of the publishing hereof, being of my selfe timerous and suspicious of mine owne workes, as such which I recken vnworthy the publike view of men. But God grant it may profite the simple and godly at least, for whose sake I haue chiefly done it. Also of the otherside, to staye the mutterings of the malicious enuions &amp; suspitious men. Now in that I haue laboured so neere as I could to pen it downe in such maner as it was vttered by me (hauing some notes of the same deliuered vnto me), so as by the reason of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations the matter will seeme more rarely a great deale in reading then when it is vttred with liuely voyce and godly zeale, vvhereby it hath the greater force to moue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordinarie meanes appointed of God to saue men, yet because writings do longe seede memorie then vvords spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they vvhich wanted the vse of the first, shall yet haue the benefite of the vvritten letters to their longer remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. I am therfore humbly to craue of the (christiā reader) that thou accept these first fruites of my labor in this kind of vvriting, if ther be any thing vvorth the accepting, as I hope and am persvvaded thou shalt finde them not altogether ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin▪ though the homlinesse of exhortation and basenesse of style may want plausibilitie to some, yet the matter

         </gap>ch or faithfull.</note> and are therewithall carefull to make supply of their vvantes by thirsting after grace &amp; the means wherby the same is offered &amp; conueied into the faythfull. For my labour was (in the handling of this fifth Chapiter of the CANTICLES) to lay forth as I could the calling vvhereby Christ calleth his Church and faythfull to the participation of his heauenly riches, and the suite which he maketh to bee entertained of his Church, with some reasons of waight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto his suite, to make it the more forcible, that men might be made priuie vnto the means of their calling, which is the first part of the Chapiter in generall. Then secondly I haue noted hovve the faythfull come on by degrees and in what manner they obey their Christian calling,<note place="margin">The second part, the maner of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying of their calling.</note> what stovve proceedings they make, vvhat lets they meete withal, &amp; how they hang of and on a long time with the Lord or euer they conclude and make vp the match with him in their heartes. Novv though these things are displayed in figures and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to vs in darke speeches by SOLOMON, yet shall vve by the grace of God see the sence, meaning and vse of them by the Scriptures. In these two parts of this chapter with the particulers that shalbe noted out of them in the processe of the matter, I doubt not but vvhosoeuer shal read with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle eye vnto the ende, shall finde both instruction and much comfort to his soule and conscience therein. For in the first Sermon and part of the second, the suite of Christ calling his Churche to obedience and to the pertaking of his grace, is handled with such reasons alledged by him, as might mooue any tractable nature to yeeld vnto his suite. The other three Sermons with most of the second, are spent in shevving the manner how the godly come on in their calling &amp; how they obey.<note place="margin">First the lets which the saints of God meete withall.</note> And first the manifolde lets and incumbraunces both at home in themselues and abroad in others, which fetter &amp; tye the children of God are discouered, hovv hardly &amp; slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they proceede in their christian course, yea, howe long or they enter into it, till the Lord as it were force them forward and finde them out in their delayes.

For the Cloudes of the infirmities of the Saintes of GOD are so greate sometimes in their ovvne sighte (vvhen they are truely humbled) and so thicke that they blem sh the sighte of Gods fauoure, so as they can not discrye the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof, at times when they couet moste to feele it. Yea when they groane in the secretes of their heartes for it vnto God, calling after him by Prayer, beeing Sutors for it a long time betweene hope and dispayre, not fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge the comforte of his fauoure but suspecting rather, vvhen yet they are in best state: yea, in best assuraunce of his grace (though they feele it not for the time). Sith they retayne a true heartye and vnfeyned desire, to taste of that fauoure which for the time they can not feele. For t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>at desire after his fauoure vvith a loathing of oure selues for sinne, is an infallible argument of the interest which the Spirite of God hath in the beleeuers. Especially when that desire inforceth them to vse the meanes wherebye God offereth himselfe vnto vs. Namely to heare the word preached vvhere God is residente vvith his perver, and to praye often and heartilye,<note place="margin">Math. 18.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Thus it pleaseth the Lorde to exercise his Sayntes by holding aloofe from them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, that they mighte bee made priuye to their ovvne infirmityes, and mighte see the lettes that lye hidde in them selues which hinder them, and so laboure to shunne them.
