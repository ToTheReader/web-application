   <head>To the Gentlemen. <hi>Readers.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, the strong faith you haue conceiu'd, that I would do works of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogation in answering the Doctor, hath made mee to breake my daye with other important busines I had, and stand darting of quils a while like the Porpentine.</p>
   <p>I know there want not welwillers to my disgrace, who say my onely Muse is contention; and other, that with <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> pretending to see in the darke, talke of strange obiectes by them discouered in the night, when in truth they are nothing else but the glimmering of their eyes.</p>
   <p>I will not holde the candle to the Deuill, vnmaske my holyday Muse to enuie; but if any such deepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted detracter will challenge mee to whatsoeuer quiet aduenture of Art wherein he thinkes mee least conuersant, hee shall finde that I am <hi>Tam Mercurio quàm Marti,</hi> a Scholler in some thing els but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
   <p>If idle wittes will needes tye knottes on smooth bulrushes with their tongues, faith the worlde might thinke I had little to attend, if I should goe about to vnloose them with my penne.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>I cannot tell how it comes to passe but in these ill eide daies of ours, euery man delights with <hi>Ixion</hi> to beget children of clouds, digge for Pearles in dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils, and wrest oyle out of iron.</p>
   <p>Poore <hi>Pierce Pennilesse,</hi> haue they turnd to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuring booke, for there is not that line in it, with which they doo not seeke to raise vp a Ghost, and like the hog that conuerts the sixth part of his meate into bristels, so haue the<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap>nuerted sixe parts of my booke into bitternes.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Aretine</hi> in a Commedie of his, wittily complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that vpstart Commenters, with their Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and gloses, had extorted that sense and Morall out of <hi>Petrarch,</hi> which if <hi>Petrarch</hi> were aliue a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Strappadoes might not make him confesse or subscribe too; So may I complaine that rash heads, vpstart Interpreters, haue extorted &amp; rakte that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerent meaning out of my lines, which a thousand deaths cannot make mee ere grant that I dreamd off.</p>
   <p>To them that are abused by their owne iealous collections and no determined trespasse of mine, this aduice by the way of example will I giue.</p>
   <p>One comming to Doctour <hi>Perne</hi> on a time, and telling him hee was miserably raild on such a day in a Sermon at Saint Maries in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> I but quoth he (in his puling manner of speaking) did he name me, did he name me, I warrant you goe and aske him, and hee will say hee meant not mee; So they that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groundedly offended at any thing in <hi>Pierce Penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,</hi> first let them looke if I did name them; if not, but the matter hangeth in suspence, let them send to mee for my exposition, and not buy it at the seconde hand, and I doe not doubt but they will be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>Hee that wraps himselfe in earth like the Foxe, to catch birds, may haps haue a heauy cart go ouer him before he be aware, and breake his backe.</p>
   <p>A number of Apes may get the glowworme in the night, and thinke to kindle fire with it, because it gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters so, but God wote they are beguiled it proues in the end to be but fools fire, the poore worme alone with their blowing is warmed, they starud for colde whiles their wood is vntoucht. Who but a Foppe wil labour to anatomize a Flye <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ables were free for any bondman to speake in old time, as <hi>Aesope</hi> for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, their allusion was not restrained to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular humor of spite, but generally applyed to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vice. Now a man may not talke of a dog, but it is surmised he aimes at him that giueth the dog in his Crest, hee cannot name straw, but hee must plucke a wheate sheaffe in pieces, <hi>Iutelligendo faciunt vt nihil intelligant.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>VVhat euer they be that thus persecute Art (as the Alcumists are said to persecute Nature) I would wish them to rebate the edge of their wit, and not grinde their colours so harde, hauing founde that which is blacke, let them not with our forenamed Gold-falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers, seeke for a substance that is blacker than black, or angle for frogs in a cleare fountaine.</p>
   <p>From the admonition of these vncurteous miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterers. I come to <hi>The kilcow champion of the three bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>; he forsooth wil be the first that shal giue <hi>Pierce Penilesse</hi> a <hi>non placet.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It is not inough that hee bepist his credite about twelue yeeres ago, with <hi>Three proper and wittie fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar letters,</hi> but still he must be running on the <hi>letter,</hi> and abusing the Queenes English without pittie or mercie.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>Bee it knowne vnto you (Christian Readers) this man is a forestaller of the market of fame, an ingrosser of glorie, a mounte bancke of strange wordes, a meere marchant of babies and conny-skins.</p>
   <p>Hold vp thy hand <hi>G. H.</hi> thou art heere indited for an incrocher vpon the fee-simple of the Latin, an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to Carriers, as one that takes their occupation out of their hands and dost nothing but transport let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vp and downe in thy owne commendation, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiratour and practiser to make Printers rich, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thy selfe ridiculous, a manifest briber of Booke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers and Stationers, to helpe thee to sell away thy bookes (whose impression thou paidst for) that thou mayst haue money to goe home to Trinitie Hall to discharge thy commons.</p>
   <p>I say no more but Lord haue mercie vpon thee, for thou art falne into his hands that will plague thee.</p>
   <p>Gentlemen, will you be instructed in the quarrell that hath causd him lay about him with his penne and inckehorne so couragiously. About two yeeres since (a fatall time to familiar Epistles) a certayne Theologicall gimpanado, a demie diuine, no higher than a Tailors pressing iron, brother to this huge booke-beare, that writes himselfe <hi>One of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Iustinians Courtiers,</hi> tooke vppon him to set his foote to mine, and ouer-crow mee with comparatiue tearmes. I protest I neuer turnd vp any cowsheard to looke for this scarabe flye. I had no conceit as then of discouering a breed of fooles in the three brothers bookes: marry when I beheld ordinance planted on edge of the pulpit against me, &amp; that there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy but the blind Vicar would needs let flie at me with his Churchdore keies, &amp; curse me with bel, book and candle, because in my Alphabet of Idiots I had
<pb facs="5"/>
ouer-skipt the Hs, what could I doe but draw vppon him with my penne, and defende my selfe with it and a paper buckler as well as I might.</p>
   <p>Say I am as verie a Turke as hee that three yeeres ago ranne vpon ropes, if euer I speld eyther his or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his kindreds name in reproch, before hee barkt against mee as one of the enemies of the Lambe of God, and fetcht allusions out of the Buttery to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base mee.</p>
   <p>Heere beginneth the fray. I vpbraid godly predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with his wicked conuersation, I squirt inke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his decayed eyes with iniquitie to mend their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased sight, that they may a little better descend into my schollership and learning. The Ecclesiastical duns in stead of recouery waxeth starke blind thereby (as a preseruatiue to some, is poyson to others) hee gets an olde Fencer his brother to be reuengd on me for my Phisicke; who flourishing about my eares with his two hand sworde of Oratory and Poetry, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shakes some of the rust of it on my shoulders, but otherwise strikes mee not but with the shadowe of it, which is no more than a flappe with the false scabberd of contumelie: whether am I in this case to arme my selfe against his intent of iniurie, or sitte still with my finger in my mouth, in hope to bee one of simplicities martyrs.</p>
   <p>A quest of honorable minded Caualiers go vppon it, and if they shall find by the Law of armes or of ale, that I beeing first prouokt, am to bee inioynde to the peace, or be sworne true seruant to cowardize &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, when wrong presseth mee to the warres; then wil I bind my selfe prentise to a Cobler, and fresh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlay all those writings of mine that haue trodde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrie.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>Be aduertised (gentle audience) that the <hi>Doctors</hi> proceedings haue thrust vpon mee this sowterly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, who first contriuing his confutation in a short Pamphlet of six leaues like a paire of summer pumps: afterward (winter growing on) clapt a paire of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soales on it like a good husband, added eight sheets more, and prickt those sheets or soales as full of the hob-nayles of reprehension as they could sticke.</p>
   <p>It is not those his new clowted startops iwis, that shall carry him out of the durt.</p>
   <p>Sweet Gentlemen, be but indifferent, and you shal see mee desperate. Heere lies my hatte, and there my cloake, to which I resemble my two Epistles, being the vpper garments of my booke, as the other of my body: Saint Fame for mee, and thus I runne vpon him.</p>
