It turneth soules (saieth Dauid.) It maketh of an vnfaithfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> man, a faithfull beleuer, as the Apostle saieth: Faith cōmeth by hearyng,<note place="margin">

Likewise said the Angell of Iohn Baptist to his father Zacharie the priest, concernyng his preachyng: He shall turne many of the son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Israell vnto the Lorde their God. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Helias, to turne the herts of the fathers to the children, &amp; the vnbeleuers to the wisdome of the iust mē, to make redy a perfect people for the Lord.

         <hi>Math.</hi> 3. <hi>Luc.</hi> 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.3.4.</note> it is manifest in the Euāgelical history. What great multitudes of people S. Peter (as I may speake nothing of the other apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels) turned vnto Christ by preaching the word, blessed Luke in his Chronicle of the Apostles acts doth partly declare. Was not the holle world in a maner turned vnto the faith of Christ thorow the preaching of the word? As sainct Paul saith: Faith cōmeth by hearing,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.</note> and hearing cōmeth by the worde of God. But I aske: Haue they not heard? No doubt their sound went oute into all landes, and their woordes into the endes of the worlde.<note place="margin">In matters of cōtrouersye we must haue recourse vnto the worde of god.</note> In matters of controuersie concernyng religion, it declareth and sheweth, who maintaineth truthe, and who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth falshode.

And therefore it is called of the Psalmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> the faithfull testimonie or wytnes of the Lorde.
