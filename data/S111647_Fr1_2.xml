   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I should goe about to fashion a title, on a fit block for <hi>bellua multo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum capitum,</hi> the many headed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, it would bee <hi>hic labor, hoc opus,</hi> as hard as to paint a <hi>Camelion,</hi> (which is very variable in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour) or to fit <hi>Proteus</hi> with a sute, who is alwayes changing his forme. As for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon titles, kinde, gentle, louing, and courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; they are so stale (and therefore out of fashion) that they would scarce bee respected, so neare of a size, that they will hardly fit such variety of sconces and therefore I refuse them: and though I should turne ouer whole volumes of <hi>Synonimaes,</hi> I should not finde any so significant, to bee correspondent to the fashion, or faction, of the rable of Readers, for some you shall haue, so high in the fore-head, that the Tankard fashion will bee too low, and they will be pushing at me: some Weesill pated, hauing little heads, and lesse wit, and yet with their dudgen iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they will generally stab at what-so-euer their slender capacities cannot conceiue: other there are,
<pb facs="3"/>
whose heads indeed are of a block in <hi>Folio,</hi> but their witte is in the least <hi>decimo sexto,</hi> so that it must bee that <hi>Locus</hi> is not <hi>aequalis locato,</hi> and by consequence a great <hi>vacuum,</hi> or else their skuls are of such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thicknesse, that one must (as artificers do when they would enter a nayle into a hard peece of wood) bore a hole, before he can make a iest haue cleare passage, into their grosse <hi>Caputs,</hi> and they will stand with hum, and ha, three parts of an houre ouer one poore Epigram, and at length (because <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis</hi>) they will giue sentence that it is dull. Such a number there are of these sorts of vnmercifull iudges, that it is enough to make a man turne <hi>Satyre,</hi> and teare them limme meale with bitter words. But for my part, I appeale from their censures, and not liking them, I will leaue them, and come to my purposed Reader.</p>
   <p>Intelligent Reader, hauing at idle times scribled a few rimes, or Epigrams, and being willing to set them out to the view of the world, as <hi>Apelles</hi> did his pictures. But not being able to lye vnder the bulke of euery mans censure (as he did) and so to mend any thing I see is a fault, as also to reprehend any prating Cobler, with <hi>ne sutor vltra crepidam.</hi> I haue chosen thee my onely reader if it were possible, at least my patron against all causelesse fault-finding fooles, hoping that (being 'tis the first lesson I haue taken in Wits-schoole) thou wilt fauor me if I be not
<pb facs="3"/>
witty. (The first time I haue made a shew of Poetry) thou wilt pardon me, if I be not Poeticall. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, <hi>non mihi Suffenus ero,</hi> whether thou speakest with me, or against me, I will subscribe to thy iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and so wishing thee as much pleasure in reading my Epigrams, as I had recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in writing them, I rest.</p>
