THere be some men perhappes will
maruell, why we haue annexed the
priuate letters of these learned and
reuerende men to these Treatises,
seeing that it may seeme some iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vnto them, for that their consent
is not there vnto. And besides, not
written so aduisedlye, as the publy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
in Print woulde require, whereout things may
be drawne agaynste bothe parties, being written for
stay of strife betwene bothe. But we trust that bothe
the one &amp; the other will beare with vs in this behalfe.
Firste, bicause the godly Brethren haue beene often
pressed with priuate letters, as not to be of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the best learned, and that therfore we are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
contentions, and so vnstayed, that we seeke we
can not tel what. Againe, we haue for our example the
reuerende Byshops, who to gette the better credite to
theyr cause, haue shewed vs a president of imprinting
some priuate letters, though we must needes say ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in so good a cause, nor with halfe so muche equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And what thanke they had for so doing, as well
D. Bullingers letter written to a Noble man in thys
realme is witnesse, as also this of Maister Gualters
which followeth. That whiche they did, was in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of corruptions, and no small discredite to the
Authors, that which we do is in defence of the truth,
and to Gods glory, and no doubte to a singular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendacion
of the wryters. Albeit we must nedes say
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> the truthe of thys cause craueth no credit, neither
of theyr letters nor authoritie. For the scriptures are
manifest, and the woorkes of these godly and learned
men, I meane bothe of D. Bullingers, and M. Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
testifie howe farre of, they are from maintaining
any of the forenamed filthy corruptions. We beseeche
thee therefore gentle Reader to iudge the best of our
doings: howsoeuer it fall out, this shall be our cōfort
the testimonie of a good conscience, wherin we mind
to rest, and to suffer willingly what so euer shalbe laid
<pb facs="21"/>
vpon vs. These godly men I hope will not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with vs, seeing we doe it for the truthes sake, and
to purge them from such a iudgement to defende cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
as the Bishops by setting out theyr letters,
would seme to charge them. As for the former admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
if in the print they fynde many faults, let them
remember it was done speedely, and as the extremitie
would suffer. For the matter, if any thing be iustly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued,
it shall be amended, for the Treatise, if it be
thought too short, it shall by Gods grace be enlarged.
We thoughte at the fyrste onely to giue but a taste of
these corruptions, to prouoke the patrons thereof to a
more full defence, which when it shall be set oute, we
minde more fully to shewe our meanings. In meane
time we beseeche God to appease these troubles, to
worke his peoples deliuerance from all Antichristian
slauerie, to preserue our Queene in peace wholely to
seeke the Reformation of his Churche whiche shalbe
to his glory.</p>
