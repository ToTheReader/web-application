   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you haue read this, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued any content, I am glad, (though it bee not so much as I could wish you) if you thinke it idle, why then I see wee are not likely to fall out; for I am iust of your minds; yet weigh it well before you runne too farre in your censures, lest this proue lesse barren of Wit, then you of courtesie. It is very true (I know not by what chance) that I haue of late been so highly beholding to <hi>Opinion,</hi> that I wonder how I crept so much into her fauour, and if I did thinke it worthie the fearing) I should be afraid that she
<pb facs="76"/>
hauing so vndeseruedly befriended mee beyond my Hope or expectation, will, vpon as little cause, ere long, againe picke some quarrell against mee; and it may bee, meanes to make vse of <hi>this,</hi> which I know must needes come farre short of their expectation, who by their earnest desire of it, seem'd to be fore-pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest with a farre better conceite, then I can beleeue it prooues worthy of. So much at least I doubted, and therefore loth to deceiue the world (though it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten beguile me) I kept it to my selfe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, not dreaming euer to see it publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But now, by the ouermuch perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some friends, I haue been constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to expose it to the generall view. Which seeing I haue done, somethings I desire thee to take notice of. First, that I am <hi>Hee,</hi> who to pleasure my friend,
<pb facs="77"/>
haue fram'd my selfe a content out of that which would otherwise discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent mee. Secondly, that I haue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueted more to effect what I thinke true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honest in it selfe, then by a see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming shew of Art, to catch the vaine blastes of vncertaine <hi>Opinion.</hi> This that I haue here written, was no part of my studie, but onely a recreation in imprisonment: and a trifle, neither in my conceit fitting, nor by me intended to bee made common; yet some, who it should seeme esteemed it worthy more respect then I did, tooke paines to coppy it out, vnknowne to mee, and in my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence got it both Authorized and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Presse; so that if I had not hindred it, last <hi>Michaelmas-Tearme</hi> had beene troubled with it. I was much blamed by some Friends for withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="77"/>
it, to whose request I should more easily haue consented, but that I thought (as indeed I yet doe) I should thereby more disparage my selfe, then content them. For I doubt J shall bee supposed one of those, who out of their arrogant desire of a little preposterous <hi>Fame,</hi> thrust into the world euery vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasoned trifle that drops out of their vnsetled braines; whose basenesse how much I hate, those that know mee can witnesse, for if I were so affected, I might perhaps present the World with as many seuerall <hi>Poems,</hi> as I haue seene yeeres; and iustly make my selfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to bee the Author of some things that others haue shamefully vsurped and made vse of as their owne. But I will be content other men should owne some of those Issues of the <hi>Braine,</hi> for J
<pb facs="78"/>
would be loath to confesse all that might in that kinde call me Father. Neither shall any more of them, by my consent, in hast againe trouble the world, vnlesse I know which way to benefit it with lesse preiudice to my owne estate. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any of those lesse serious <hi>Poems</hi> which are already disperst into my friends hands, come amongst you, let not their publication be imputed to me, nor their lightnesse be any disparagement to what hath been since more serious writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, seeing it is but such stuffe as riper iudgements haue in their farre elder yeeres been much more guilty of.</p>
   <p>I know an indifferent <hi>Crittick</hi> may finde many faults, as well in the slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this present <hi>Subiect,</hi> as in the erring from the true nature of an <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue:</hi> moreouer, it altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
<pb facs="78"/>
my self, which diuers may dislike. But neither can bee done on iust cause: The first hath bin answered already: The last might consider that I was there where my owne estate was chiefly to bee looked vnto, and all the comfort I could minister vnto my selfe, little enough.</p>
   <p>If any man deeme it worthy his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I shall bee glad: if hee thinke his paines ill bestow'd, let him blame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for medling with that concerned him not: I neither commended it to him, neither cared whether he read it or no; because I know those that were desirous of it, will esteeme the same as much as I expect they should.</p>
   <p>But it is not vnlikely, some wil thinke I haue in diuers places been more wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton (as they take it) then befitting a <hi>Sati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rict;</hi> yet their seuerity I feare not, because
<pb facs="79"/>
J am assured all that I euer yet did, was free from <hi>Obscaenity:</hi> neyther am I so <hi>Cynical,</hi> but that I thinke a modest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of such amorous conceits as sute with Reason, will yet very well become my yeeres; in which not to haue feeling of the power of <hi>Loue,</hi> were as great an argument of much stupidity, as an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sottish affection were of extreame folly. Lastly, if you thinke it hath not well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Title of the <hi>Shepheards Hunting,</hi> goe quarrell with the <hi>Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,</hi> who bid himselfe God-Father, and imposed the <hi>Name</hi> according to his owne liking; and if you, or hee, finde any faults, pray mend them.</p>
