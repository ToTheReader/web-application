   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome peraduenture may, and will also, Vertuous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, marueil not a little, what moued me to dedicate this booke rather vnto you, then to diuers other persons of no meane calling in our nation, whoe might with great reason haue expected the same at my hands, especially I being, as they will suppose, obliged to sundry of them for diuers res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. To whome, for satisfaction of my
<pb facs="3"/>part, and that this their woundring may cease, I answere in fewe words: that as touching particular obligation to any person, I found none in my selfe, that might with iust cause haue moued me to alter this my intended course, other then that,
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8</note> to which the Apostle exhorteth say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Nemini quidquam debeatis, nisi vt inuicem diligatis;</hi> Owe no man any thing, but that you loue one an other. More ouer, if any obligation there be towards others, certes it is most towards you, for whome I haue giuen my word in such sort, that I am bound by all the meanes I pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly may, to further your spirituall good, &amp; aduance you in that kind of perfection, to which you so much aspire. Whereunto I add, that if this my labour, such and so much as it is, be aniwise due to those, which were the cause I first tooke it in hand, I neither can, nor will deny, but that your often, and feruent calling vppon me, to aford you sufficient matter for medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the manner how to performe the same, in such sort as it ought to be donne; was the occasion, that hauing seene this
<pb facs="3"/>worke, I tooke in hand to translate it, findinge it to be such, as in it selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all that, which either you with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son could require of me, or I thinke good to performe of my part, as necessary for your spirituall instruction, &amp; profit in this kind of exercise. And heere I wittinglie, and willinglie leaue to speake of your godlie and vertuous behauiour; of your feruent affection in the seruice of almighty God; of your holie desire to conforme your selfe in all your words, thoughts, and woorks, to his most holie will and pleasure; of your renouncing the world, and the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, with so generous a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; of the continuall mortification of your selfe with so inuincible courage; which all, and many more your rare vertues, vnknowne to others then to those, whoe of dutie ougt to knowe them, had ben suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, without anie further cause, to haue presented you these my small paines, such as they are; thereby to forward you in this happy course of life, which you haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, &amp; to perfect you in the same, as much as in me lieth. As for my labour, if
<pb facs="4"/>it may with Gods holie assistance profit others then your self, let them con you thankes, whoe haue ben the motiue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: but if it may further your owne spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good, as I nothing doubt, but with the grace of God, and your owne vertuous endeauour it will, if you perseuer, and continue in the practise of meditation as you haue begunne; I hope I shall not be defrauded of your good merites, &amp; praiers, in which I hartilie desire to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, wishing you all abundant increase of grace and goodnes in this world, that growing from vertue to vertue,

         <hi>Psal.</hi> 83.8</note> you may at the length, as the Psalmist saith, see the God of Gods in Sion, that is, see his diuine Maiestie face to face, and inioy him for euer and euer in the world to come.</p>
