This wickednesse is growen now so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, as if the true <hi>Christ</hi> could not be found otherwhere, then without in Woods, Mikes, by-Stables, Barnes, and Hay-loftes; wherevpon, all the speach now, is, Goe out, goe out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> come into the secret places.</p>

time) <hi>Stand apart, come not neere to mee, for I am holier then thou.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Isai. 65.5.</note> And of such sort (sayth the Apostle vnto <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>) are these,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.6.</note>
      <hi>which creepe into houses, and lead captiue simple wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men laden with sinnes, &amp; led with diuers lustes; which women are euer learning, and are neuer able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The Spirit of Prophecie, hauing so plainely fore-prophesied of our times, and false-spirites, what are we, that we should be negligent in trying the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whether they be of God? And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that these spirituall Wolues, shall for their outwarde cariage and life, seeme to be Christes Sheepe and poore innocent Lambes (and <hi>for that,</hi> many times be more worthy reuerence, then some of the truest Teachers) it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth people therefore vpon, not to be caryed with a few painted flimflams, but by the speare of Discretion, to gage the side of the <hi>Grecians</hi> wooden
<pb facs="4"/>
Horse, for trying out, whether the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes be not planted with engines of death. <hi>Latet anguis in herba</hi>; the fairest face hath not alwayes the truest heart. <hi>Satan</hi> in policie, would haue his <hi>Seminaries,</hi> in th'outwarde appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to excell <hi>Christes</hi> Ministers; that so, as them selues be deceiued, they may likewise deceiue others. As for the true Ministers of <hi>Christ, Satan</hi> must needs labour to spot them outwardly, seeing he cannot keepe backe the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinall sappe of Gods spirit; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling from the lippes of the Teacher, is to beget and feed many.</p>
   <p>Herevpon it is, that true Doctrine is often reiected, because of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall want in the Teacher. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, because of some excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable outward things (in a <hi>Duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frier,</hi> or a smooth <hi>Pharise,</hi>) any doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is easily swallowed, be it schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, hereticall, or trayterous: A plaine signe, that such people are yet
<pb facs="4"/>
destitute of that spirit, whereby they should be able to try Doctrine, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Spirits. And not onely that, but also full of giddy passions, and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong affections; as wil appeare in the ensuing Dialogues: where the very naturall character of such spirits, is by mee set downe; not without sundrie yeares experience had of them all: as also with no small expences.</p>
   <p>If thine heart be vn-hardned, it will easily ioyne with mee: If other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, yet herein I shall be comforted, that in this worke I haue serued God and his Church truly, though weakely. If something in the Conferrours seeme too light, consider first, it is but the naturall character of that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and secondly, that it is but as a feeling of that spirites pulse, without any commoration or dwelling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it.</p>
   <p>As I could, I haue done. If it please, it is that I pray for: if it displease any,
<pb facs="5"/>
I shall (through Gods grace) not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peaceably passe by it; but also, with patience awayte the change of their iudgement and affection. Farewell.</p>
