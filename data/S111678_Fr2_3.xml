                 <title>The English myrror : A regard wherein al estates may behold the conquests of enuy: containing ruine of common weales, murther of princes, cause of heresies, and in all ages, spoile of deuine and humane blessings, vnto which is adioyned, enuy conquered by vertues. Publishing the peaceable victories obtained by the Queenes most excellent Maiesty, against this mortall enimie of publike peace and prosperitie, and lastly a fortris against enuy, builded vpon the counsels of sacred Scripture, lawes of sage philosophers, and pollicies of well gouerned common weales: wherein euery estate may see the dignities, the true office and cause of disgrace of his vocation. A worke safely, and necessarie to be read of euerie good subiect. By George Whetstones Gent. Malgre. Seene and allowed</title>

      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendly Reader, the good Oratour <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> pleading the iniuries of a poore Widdowe before the <hi>Athenian</hi> Iudges, was of the sayd Iudges so lightly regarded, as he left his purpose, and told them that <note place="margin">A pollicie of Demosthenes to get audiēce.</note> he had a strange tale of the shaddow of an Asse to deliuer: the Iudges eares were by and by quickned, and with great earnestnesse desired <hi>Demosthenes</hi> to tell on his tale. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> by this pollicie hauing got full audience, openly rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the follie and iniustice of the Iudges, who had their eares bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepared to heare the tale of the shaddow of an Asse, then the oppression of a poore VViddowe, and so through verie shame, obtained iudgement in the VViddowes behalfe: and certainely, a <note place="margin">Varietie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to the reader.</note> pleasing enterance, and vnexpected varietie many times, causeth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious tales to be fully hard, and long Bookes to be throughly read, which otherwise, how good so euer they be, the one might be smallie regarded, and the other lesse perused. But friendly Reader, I salute thee not with this following Epistle of the <hi>Athenian Senate,</hi> with this bare respect, that thou mightest with expectation of nouels bee drawne to reade out the blessings of our English peace, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and heroycall vertues of our most good Queene <hi>ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH,</hi> when with the fulnes of thy owne benefites thou hast large cause hourely to contemplate of the one, and the admiration of the whole world to allure thee to gaze on the other, but rather writing of so diuine a subiect as Peace, I thought no commendation (the holie Scriptures reserued) so excellent, as the iudgement of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian Senate,</hi> who set light of the verie gaine of warre, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of peace, and by semblable iudgement arose this proue be, that <hi>vnlawfull peace, was to be preferred before lawfull warre.</hi> For one other especiall regard, I commend this graue letter vnto thy censure, which was, the high accompt that the <hi>Athenian Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates</hi> made of the renowmed Philosopher, and good common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes man <hi>Euxin,</hi> that with like reuerence thou mayst honour, loue, and obeie our capitall Magistrates, and common wealthes men, placed by God and her Maiestie in Authoritie, as the pillers and strength of this happie Gouernement: for thy further instruction,
<pb facs="48"/>
I referre thee to the letter it selfe, which, with the cause thereof fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Betweene the</hi> Athenians <hi>and the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>arose a most cruell warre about a contention for certaine townes seated vpon the riuer of</hi> Milin, <hi>the day of battaile was assigned, and bloodelie fought on either part, but in the end, the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and ouercome by the</hi> Athenians. <hi>The vanquished demanded truce of the victorers, and the more easely to obtaine this grace, they sent as Ambassador the renowmed Philosopher</hi> Euxin, <hi>who before the Senate set foorth the commendations of peace, with such elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and withall approoued his message with such grauitie, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and sounde reasons, as he not only obtained a truce from the</hi> Athenians, <hi>but ouercome with the power of</hi> Euxins <hi>Oration, they gratified the</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>with the gift of the confynes which they had but lately conquered, and of long challenged as their owne right: &amp; by</hi> Euxin <hi>as assurāce of loue &amp; amitie, returned this leter.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The Senate and people of <hi>Athens,</hi> greeteth the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> with a hartie desire of health, and peace.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>WE call the Gods to witnesse, that through the passed battaile we haue sustained more greefe to see you so bloodely vanquished, then we haue receiued pleasure to behold our selues conquerours, vpon iudgement that in the end the effects of war are such, that to the vanquished the dammadge is certaine, and to the vanquisher the profite doubtfull, we would haue beene right glad that you had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome vs with</hi> Euxins <hi>words, before we had vanquished you with our swords. What pleasure would it haue beene to either, if the chance had vnfortunately falne vpō vs both, sithēce the rule is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, that all that which the Gods haue ordayned, may not be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by mans wisedome, iudgement, or power, euen this, you shoulde haue lost much by this war, and we should haue gained no good by your losse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>You demaund of vs a truce for three monthes, to this end, that during this space there may be treatise of an accord betweene vs: we answere you, that the Senate of</hi> Athens <hi>haue not accustomed to make a truce, afterwards to begin war againe, but haue an auncient law either freely to accept of cruell warre, or freely to accord to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual peace, we indeuour in the time of peace to attire our Accade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
      <pb facs="48"/>
      <hi>with wise men, to strengthen vs with their counsell in the time of war, and by thē are now aduised to graunt no truce vpon suspitious conditions, and it seemeth to vs that their counsell is good, for a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling peace is much more dangerous then open war.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>The Philosopher</hi> Euxin <hi>your Ambassador hath so eloquēly spoken in this Senat, as it should be an vnreasonable thing to deny him what he demādeth: also a more honest graunt sealeth a peace required with words, then demanded with the launce. Now we say, and giue you to vnderstand, that our Senate accordeth vnto you</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>with a right good will, a loyall peace, deliuering you withal from the suspition of war. And to this end we do it, that the world may know that the</hi> Athenians <hi>are so strong harted against the ouerproud, and so great louers of wise men, as they know how to chasten the foolishe Captaines, and suffer themselues to be cōmanded of the wise Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. You know that all our contention is sprong for the possession of the townes seated vpon the borders of the flood</hi> Milin. <hi>By this letter we certify you, and by the immortall Gods sweare vnto you, that we renounce and render vnto you all the right that we haue or pretend to haue in the said confines, with charge that on the contrary part you bestow on vs</hi> Euxin <hi>your Ambassador, for the happy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> Athenians <hi>esteeme more of a philosopher in their Academy, then of a whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince for their common wealth. And you</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>repute it not an act of lightnes to haue exchanged the Empire and segniory of many, for the liberty to command one only man: for this Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher shall teach vs to liue well, where the possession of that Countrey may giue occasion to die euill. And sithence of such auncient enimies we declare our selues such perfect friends, we will not only deliuer you of this war and send you peace, but in aduantage we will giue you councel to cōserue the same: for the medicin which preserueth health, is of far more excellency then that which chaseth away sicknes, &amp; now regard the remedy. Vvhereas you greatly desire that your yong men should be exercised in armes, so be you diligēt that your infants be in time instructed in good letters, for as the one with blooddy launces raise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap> war, so the other with sweete words obtaine peace. Thinke not</hi> Lacedemonians <hi>that we perswade you this without cause, for in neglecting the councell of the wise, and in suffering idlenesse to grow among the people, the same engendreth seditions and ciuill warres, and so death to the one and other.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="49"/>
      <hi>Vve would not that you should repute vs louers of much talke: for our auncient father</hi> Socrates <hi>ordayned, that the fyrst lesson</hi>
      <note place="margin">A law of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</note>
      <hi>that the tutor reade to his disciple in the Academie, should be, that he should not in two yeares after dare to dispute: for it is impossible, that anie should be prudent in speach, that is not patient to holde his toong. Let it then please you that</hi> Euxin <hi>remaine with vs, and imagine you, that if we hope for profite in his presence, you may be assured, that of the counsels which he giueth vs, you shall receyue no dammage: for it is a verie auncient lawe in</hi> Athens, <hi>that the Senate may make no enterprise of warre, vnlesse the Philosophers first examine whether it be iust. No more vnto you, but that we praie the immortall Gods, yours and ours, that they will prouoke both you and vs, and that it will please them for euer to preserue vs in this peace, for that only is euerlasting, which is confirmed by the will of the Gods.</hi>
