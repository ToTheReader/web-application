   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Rest assured this small volume (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Elephantine load of Mogou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian story, compiled by the wandring Pawne-Knight of Troy) will bee bought and read ouer by manie, how it will be censured. I know not, or how I shall be reputed for publishing it, to deale plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I care not, so it bring future benefit to my Countrey, <note n="*" place="margin">And some present bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to my selfe.</note> and content to the iudicious, to whom I commend it for two especiall reasons. The first stands grounded on these three points▪ a <hi>Prospectiue Glasse,</hi> an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structiue</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Booke,</hi> and a <hi>Suspectiue blow.</hi> For as <hi>Prospectiue</hi> set to the sight of a mans eye, will draw the <hi>Obiect</hi> so neere the sence, that hee may discerne whether his opposite be friend or foe, and make haste too, either to embrace the one, or shunne the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he come neere him: so in this glasse, a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman may plainely perceiue the folly that raignes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and seeke to eschew them before they take hold, which will hurry him into these inconueniences. It is a booke to instruct young heires to keepe out of books and bonds, which oftentimes are the maine cause of their ouerthrow, and brings that long suspected blow vpon their shoulders, which if it chance to light heere, they may cleerely discouer the Keepers large conscience, and be throwly instructed to shunne their extortion. My second reason is an Apologie, to shield mee from those wounding tongues, that may perhaps taxe me for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so harshly against <hi>Citizens, Prodigals, Sarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants</hi> and other <hi>Officers,</hi> to such I answer, let the gall'd iade winch till he breake his heeles against my buckler, which thus I aduance. How much I reuerence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the Right Worshipfull Order of this famous City in their iust proceedings, let my best and vtmost ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice be a true witnesse. Neither seeme I to carpe at the bounty or large expence of young Gentle-men, whose meanes and birth are correspondent. No, no, I rather encourage and commend their worths, for of such there are too few, and for their sakes onely, I haue discouered what trappes and snares are daily set by carelesse Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts, to winde them into the like ruine they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are in▪ They haue strange deuices, and a certain kinde of longing to cast their estates in a consumption,
<pb facs="3"/>
by which their persons may lie languishing vnder that infectious disease, wherewith they themselues are poysoned, by the incurable plague of pouerty. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Sargeants,</hi> I hope there are none so shallow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, to thinke my pen so full of vineger, to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their meere profession, which in a well-gouern'd State is so necessary. I rather wish they were as free from abusing their place and office, as I am from disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, and then a shorter chapter would serue to discouer their sinister deuices &amp; treacherous dealings, which I haue obserued so carefully, that if any of the fraternity of the Mace-mongers chance to fall sicke at the conceit, let them but diligently view it ouer, and they shall finde as comfortable cordials to refresh the heart, as I did from that colde cawdle when they first arrested me, which I willingly bestow vpon them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall. But me thinkes I heare some curious Criticke murmure before he hath read ouer halfe the preamble, because I entitle it a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and begin it so singly with my selfe: to such I answer my vnwilling experience and not reports of that they shall read here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, emboldened mee to write the truth, that I haue tried, which may beget beleefe in those that read, if not, I wish it may be their good fortunes to goe the voyage, and let them confute me if they can. If any shall obiect what reason I haue to discourse of the foure branches, before I come to the maine body of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> and stand so long on them, deferring their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, let them rest satisfied with this answer. A building cannot be raised without a ground-worke, or a tree will seeme naked without branches, and a man wanting limbs to support him, is but a decrepit bodie,
<pb facs="4"/>
which I considering haue adorned this <hi>Ocean</hi> with compleat <hi>Riuers,</hi> which are indeede the best <hi>Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours</hi> that belong to it. The first three chapters shew how distresse and oppression ioyn'd hands to wound my weake and vnprouided estate, by which single exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, all o her may discerne the true vsage they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from the kinde Keepers, if their meanes once faile or their friends for sake them. The foure chapters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, lay open the foure armes or currents, with their seuerall natures, that bring supply to this body or maine <hi>Ocean,</hi> which in the last three chapters is liuely ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomized. The cruelty of Keepers and the misery of Prisoners. For the truth of which I haue quoted an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the margent, and for your delight mingled it with many pleasant discourses, which I freely send a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to all, either to those that haue beene passengers through this troublesome <hi>Ocean,</hi> and know the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or to any that shall heereafter, vpon speciall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, before'd to make proofe of this relation. Lastly, to those that haue no desire to venture this voyage, but will rather be contented to sit at home and read the the discouery. I commend it with as much loue as Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers beare to prisoners purses when they haue money in them, wishing it might proue as delightfull to them, as their ill dealings were hatefull to me, and so farewell. From the Compter in <hi>Woodstreet.</hi> 1616. Octob. 23.</p>
