      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to speake
in the Esche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
Chamber
in <hi>R. C.</hi> Case
(which is now
commonly called, the Case of
<hi>Post-nati,)</hi> I considered mine
age and infirmities, and how
long I had discontinued from
<pb facs="3"/>
such Legall Exercises. I might
hereupon haue iustly challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the priuiledge of silence: But
greater and weightier Reasons
ouer-ruled mee, and enforced
mee to waiue the benefit of that
priuiledge: For, looking into the
nature of the Question then in
hand, and examining the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstaunces,
I found the Case
to bee rare, and the Matter of
great import and consequence,
as being a speciall and principall
part of the blessed and happy V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of great <hi>Britaine.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I heard many learned and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Arguments, made by
the reuerend Iudges: and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that they did not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
<pb facs="3"/>
in Opinion (though the
number was indeede so few, of
them that differed, that in <hi>Greeke</hi>
it woulde not make a plurall
number) and that some things
were by them omitted, which
seemed to mee to be both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to the Matter, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to bee knowne, and more
proper and fit to bee spoken by
me, respecting the place I hould,
than by them, that did wholy
binde themselues to the forme
and rule of legall Argument and
Discourse: I thought that I
coulde not, in duetie, sit as a
dumbe and idle Hearer onelie:
The Cause being iudicially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
in the high Court of
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>Chancerie,</hi> where I was to iudge
of it according to Lawe, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the rule of mine owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and the measure of mine
owne vnderstanding, and not
to bee swayed vvith the vveight
of other mens opinions.</p>
   <p>I considered also, that althogh
<hi>Silentij tutum proemium</hi> is often
true in humane policie, yet
sometime, there is <hi>Crimen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticentiae;</hi>
and therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
said, <hi>Vae mihi quia tacui.</hi> And
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> obserueth, that, <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
modis in veritatem peccatur: 1.
Ʋeritatem prae timore tacendo: 2.
Ʋeritatem in mendatium Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tando:
3. Ʋeritatem non defenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi>
Remembring this, my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb facs="4"/>
tould me, that howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

      </gap>
Silence might in this Case
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>e excused mee of the second,
but I could not haue escaped by
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>ence, from offending in the
first &amp; last. And if <hi>Festus</hi> thoght
it not reason, to send a prisoner,
without shewing the Causes
which were layed against him,
I might haue beene worthily &amp;
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ustly censured, if vpon other
mens arguments, and as it vvere

         <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>implicita,</hi> I should haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
my iudgement and
sentence in so great a Cause,
without declaring the grounds
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>d reasons vvhereupon I stood.
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>r, <hi>ratio sapienti necessitas)</hi> were
<pb facs="5"/>
the causes that induced mee to
speake in this rare and weightie
cause, and the force of truth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
mee to speake that which I
did speake, without respect of
pleasing or displeasing any. And
so, hauing the warrant of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
conscience, which is truly
said to be, <hi>veluti Comes, &amp; Testis,
&amp; I<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>dex actionum,</hi> I haue in the
Chancerie iudged and decreed
the Case for <hi>R. C.</hi> And the like
Iudgement is also giuen by the
Iudges of the Kings Bench, in
the Assise depending in that
Court. The decree and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being thus passed, diuerse
vnperfect Reports, and seuerall
patches and pieces of my Speech
<pb facs="5"/>
haue bin put in writing, &amp; disper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
into many hands, and some
offred to the Presse. The Kings
M<seg rend="sup">ie.</seg> hauing knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
misliked it, &amp; thereupon cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to deliuer to him in
writing, the whole discourse of
that which I said in that Cause.</p>
   <p>Thus I was put to an vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
new labour, to reuiew my
scribled &amp; brokē papers. Out of
which (according to the charge
imposed vpon me) I gathered all
which I had before spoken, &amp; so
set it downe faithfully &amp; plainly,
and (as neare as I could) in the
same words I vttered it: it pleased
his sacred M<seg rend="sup">ie.</seg> to take some view
of it, &amp; taking occasion thereby,
<pb facs="6"/>
to remember the diligence of the
L. chiefe Iustice of the common
place, for the summary report he
had published of the Iudges Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
he gaue mee in charge
to cause this to be likevvise put in
Print, to preuent the Printing of
such mistaken and vnperfect
reports of it, as vvere alreadie
scattered abroad.</p>
   <p>Whatsoeuer it is, it vvas first
conceiued &amp; spokē out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
&amp; duty; and is now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in humble obedience to
my most gracious Soueraigne.
And so I offer and commend it
to your good acceptance and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
interpretation.</p>
