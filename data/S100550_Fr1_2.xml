      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I liue a farre off from you, yet God knowes that I haue not beene vnmindfull of you in my daily prayers to God, which was the best good which I could doe vnto you. And when I heard that God did beginne to shine in loue vpon the City againe, God knowes that I was not vnmindefull to bee thankfull to him that is the sole Author of it. I thought not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: therefore as before I had spent many dayes in fasting, and prayer, for our selues in body; so did I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
<pb facs="3"/> (hauing that blessed liberty) to spende one day in fasting, prayer, and thanksgiuing for you: what good it wrought vpon my owne people and those of your body who heard me, I am not worthy to know: but what good I aymed at my conscience is priuy to, &amp; what my desire is to do more. I consider how louingly I haue beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of many of you when I was assistant to a Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Diuine amongst you, who is now with God. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider<note place="margin">Master Haiward of Wool-Church.</note> that I haue many brethren, sisters, and kins-folke, who haue fellowship with you, &amp; whose soules I tenderly affect. In which respects though (as it is wittily said) some more Learned, and godly men are Fathers, Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and murtherers to their owne Children, in beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, kissing, and burying the fruits of their owne braines, yet am I still aduenturous to shew others what God hath giuen me (vnworthy wretch) to bring forth, and to say vnto you; Behold I and my child. I haue not trimmed it with ornaments and laces of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> nor sweetned it with the Frankincense and myrrhe of the Christian Synagouge: but as God hath sent it with the lawe of God written in the fore-head, hands, feete and heart of it, so send I it vnto you, desiring God to make this seruice acceptable and profitable vnto you: And so I rest,</p>
