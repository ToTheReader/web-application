   <l>Rare in thy bewtie, in thy state diuine,</l>
   <l>Ripener of Haruest, thou it is whose birth</l>
   <l>Yields full encrease vnto the fertile earth:</l>
   <l>Thou art that cheering mother that renues</l>
   <l>The Plow-mans hope, and giues their toile those dewes,</l>
   <l>Which makes them happie, may my Poems please</l>
   <l>Thy honourd selfe, that glads vs with encrease▪</l>
   <l>Yet in my mirth I cannot but repine</l>

   <l>Faire in thy selfe, making our fields as faire,</l>
   <l>With thy ender'd respect, should be exilde,</l>
   <l>Of due content, by loosing of thy childe,</l>

   <l>Yet be contented, manie one there bee,</l>
   <l>Yea I know som which may lament with thee</l>
   <l>For their straide daughters, who I much doe feare</l>
   <l>Are lodged now, or will be lodged there.</l>
   <l>Lasse it is nothing for maides now adaies</l>
   <l>For which of them (though modest) hath not straies,</l>
   <l>In youth, in age, which straying I doe call,</l>
   <l>Dotage in maides, and that is worst of all.</l>
   <l>How manie haue wee in this error swerud,</l>

   <l>Thy daughter was vnchast▪ &amp; so were they.</l>
   <l>And (pray thee <hi>Ceres</hi>) credit me in this,</l>
   <l>Though my proceeding was not to my wish,</l>
   <l>Yet this to thy due comfort I must tell,</l>
   <l>Thy daughter doth not liue in Hell</l>
   <l>Without acquaintance, yea I know there are,</l>
   <l>Though they in sumptuous raiment and in fare</l>
   <l>Seeme to excell the worthies of our Land,</l>
   <l>Yet being iustly poized vnder hand,</l>
   <l>They are as neere to <hi>Pluto</hi> and his heire,</l>
   <l>As if those persons that lesse gorgeous were,</l>
   <l>May I speake more, for I am in a vaine,</l>
   <l>To cull strange things out of a stragling braine,</l>
   <l>That there's no wench truly ingenious,</l>
   <l>Wittie by nature, or ambitious</l>

   <l>That she will wander full as farre from home,</l>
   <l>As ere thy deare <hi>Proserpina</hi> distraide,</l>
   <l>Transform'd from beauty of a louely maide.</l>
   <l>To be a drudge ('lasse I am forc't to tell)</l>
   <l>Vnto the base-borne Skinkird bred in Hell.</l>
   <l>Doe I not know thee <hi>Ceres</hi>? yes, I know</l>
   <l>Far more of thee, then I intend to shew</l>
   <l>In publique eie: 'Lasse I doe know thy worth,</l>

   <l>Honour of ages, and successe of time,</l>
   <l>Errecting to thy selfe that noble shrine,</l>
   <l>Which nere shall be defaced by time or age,</l>
   <l>The best of labour in our Pilgrimage.</l>
   <l>Then <hi>Ceres</hi> let thy daughter work, for one</l>
   <l>Thou art in due respect admir'd alone</l>
   <l>To be the soueraignesse of <hi>Albions</hi> Ile,</l>
   <l>Who when retired braines doe sleep the while,</l>
   <l>Shalt shew thy selfe worthy a sacred power,</l>
   <l>Though thy vaine daughter play in hell the whore.</l>
   <l>Yea fit it is, and suting to her birth,</l>
