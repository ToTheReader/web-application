   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>t was my good hap gentle Reader, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes agoe, to hit vpon this discourse of London Triacle: which after I had shewed vnto diuers of iudgement and skill in such matters &amp; found that they iudged the booke well worthy the setting out, especially in this infectious season. I resolued thereupon to publish it to the world, that therby the fruite and benefite thereof might the better be imparted to our whole nation. It should seeme the discourse was fully ended before the plague in London began this last Summer, for otherwise it is not to be thought but the authour would somwhere haue made mention ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Notwithstanding, I my selfe hauing made diligent enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as wel of Phisitions as of Surgeons &amp; Apothecaries what tryall hath bene made therof in the time of pestilence, I am by many of good iudgement assuredly certified that amongst the poore especially (whome it most haunted) this Triacle by good triall and experience hath beene found to be of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular vertue, and to haue saued the liues of hundreds which haue taken it: for very few which in the first or second day of the dissease took any reasonable quantitie of it (for litle of it as of all other preseruatiues can haue small force) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall laid themselues to sweate, very few I say miscaried: yea the most part did within few houres perceiue the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of the disease to be driuen cleane from the heart to the outward partes, wherby within a day or two after, they found themselues past all daunger. But because it is no part of my
<pb facs="3"/>
meaning, neyther presume I to haue skill enough to set down at full the due prayses of so pretious a preseruatiue. I will surcease to proceed any further in commending the same vnto you: and that so much the rather, because the Authour in the discourse it selfe hath at large declared the vertues thereof. Onely this I will say therof by the way, that I can in nothing resemble this Triacle better, then to the most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and victorious champion <hi>Hercules</hi> for his worthy actes and conquests canonized amongst the Gods. For as <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> is reported to haue trauailed continually from countrey to countrey throughout the whole world, euery where as he went destroying monsters, slaying Tyrantes, murtherers &amp; robbers; clearing high wayes, cleansing all pestiferous ayres and noysome waters, whereby he deliuered infinite nations from thraldome and slauery, freed all passages for trauailers and waifarers, and restored the interrupted intercourse and trade with forraine countreyes, to the wonderfull and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable benefit of all mankind: Euen so this Triacle being by good aduice recieued into mans body, destroieth all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome and poison, killeth or expelleth all corrupt vapors and humors, and scoureth all the pipes &amp; conduits whereby it sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the heart and chiefe intrailes from suffocation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, freeth all the vaines and vessels and restoreth free recourse and passage of the liuely and cheerefull spirits and nourishing humors into all the members of the body, to the singuler comfort and refreshing of the whole man. What should cause or induce the Authour so long to stay the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of so fruitefull or rather necessary a discourse, in this so fit an opportunity, it is hard to guesse, vnlesse peraduenture it be that he perceiued straight vpon the perfecting of his booke the plauge to begin, and therefore thought it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse to deferre the setting out therof vntill eyther by him selfe or some learned men, sufficient triall might be taken of the forcible effects thereof in the plague it self, as already ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good experiment had beene prooued in many other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, Wherein if I haue guest aright, I hope the Authour
<pb facs="3"/>
hath lesse cause to be offended with me considering I haue but done that which he meant to haue perfourmed himselfe, in making him do his countrey good a litle sooner then he intended. And my hope herein is the greater, because it is apparant by the suppressing of his name, that he neither am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiously therby hunted after praise, nor greedily gaped for gaine, but wholy respected the benefiting and profiting of his countrey, By how much the more his good meaning is of all men to be taken in good part. And thus presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that the Authour will beare with my boldnesse and not doubting but so well a meant worke shall be acceptably receiued of the gentle Reader, I commit them both vnto the almighties protection.</p>
