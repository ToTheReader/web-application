   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, IAMES LORD HAYE, BARON OF <hi>Saley,</hi> Viscount <hi>Doncaster,</hi> Earle of <hi>Carlile,</hi> one of the Lords of his Maiesties most Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Priuie Councell.</head>

      <salute>RIGHT HONORABLE:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot but thus gratulate to you your happy returne from your many, and noble imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which haue made you, some yeeres, a stranger at home; and sorenowned abroad, that all the better parts of Europe know and honor your name, no lesse, then if you had beene borne theirs; Neither is any of them so sauage, as not to say, when they heare mention of your worth, that <hi>Vertue is a thousand Escuchions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Jf now your short breathing-time may allow your Lordship the freedome of quiet and holy thoughts, cast your eyes vpon Jsrael and Judah, vpon the Kings and Prophets of both, in such beneficiall varietie as prophane historie shall promise in vaine. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship shall see <hi>Rehoboam</hi> following <hi>Salomon</hi> in nothing but his seat, and his fall, as much more wilfull then his father, as lesse wise; all head, no heart; losing those ten Tribes with a churlish breath, whom he would (and might not) recouer with blood. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> as crafty, as wicked; plotting a reuolt, creating a religion to his state, marring Jsraelites to make subiects, branded in his name, smitten
<pb facs="667"/> in his hand, in his loynes. You shall see a faithfull messenger of God, after miraculous proofe of his courage, fidelity, power, good nature, paying deare for a little circumstance of credulous disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; The Lyon is sent to call for his blood, as the price of his forbidden harbour; You shall see the blinde Prophet descrying the disguise of a Queene, the iudgement of the King, the remouall of a Prince, too good for <hi>Ieroboams</hi> heire. You shall see the right stocke of Royal succession flourishing in <hi>Asa,</hi> whiles that true heire of <hi>Dauid</hi> (though not without some blemishes of infirmity) inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits a perfect heart; purges his Kingdome of Sodomy, of Jdolatry, not balking sinne, euen where he honored nature. You shall see the wonder of Prophets, <hi>Elijah,</hi> opening and shutting heauen, as his priuate chest; catored for by the Rauens, nor lesse miraculously catoring for the Sareptan, contesting with <hi>Ahab,</hi> confronting the Baalites, speaking both fire and water (from heauen) in one eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; meekely lacquaying his Soueraigne, weakely flying from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel,</hi> fed supernaturally by Angels, hid in the rocke of <hi>Horeb,</hi> confirmed by those dreadfull apparitions, that had confounded some other; casting his mantle vpon his homely successor, and by the touch of that garment, turning him from a ploughman, to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. But what doe J with-hold your Lordship in the bare heads of this insuing discourse? Jn all these, your piercing eies shall easily see beyond mine, and make my thoughts but a station for a further discouery. Your Lordships obseruation hath studied men, more then bookes; here it shall study God, more then men; That of bookes hath made you full, that of men, iudicious, this of God shall make you holy, and happy; Hitherto shall euer tend the wishes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours of</p>

      <signed>Your Lordships humbly deuoted in all faithfull obseruance, IOS: HALL.</signed>
