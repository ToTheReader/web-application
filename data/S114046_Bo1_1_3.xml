      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I had taken in hande, and beganne the printing of this treatise or declaration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaide, a gentleman of good vnderstanding and learning, came to me, and being made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted by mee with the former treatise, hee saide, that hee had by conference with diuers that were at the araignement of this traytor, where also he himselfe was present, collected together the whole proceeding against him, and had also attained to the viewe of all his cōfessions, his letters, and other writings there published against him: by all which, hee had gathered into a shorte Treatise most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest proofes of the horrible treason intended by the Traytor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her Maiestie.</p>
   <p>And although the former treatise doeth at length manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the same, yet I required this Gentleman my friende, to graunt mee the copying of his collections, which hee was willing to doe: And so I haue bene bolde, for the more ample satisfaction of euery reader, to adde the same hereunto. Wherein also (gentle Reader) thou shalt finde inserted these Figures, 1.2.3.4. &amp;c. till 13. And the like in the Traitors owne Confession, by which is noted the principall pointes of the drift of this most horrible Treason.</p>
