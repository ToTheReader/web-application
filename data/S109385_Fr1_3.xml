   <head>❧To the right Honourable, my very <hi>good L. Robert Earle of Essex and Ewe,</hi> Viscount of Hereforde, and Bourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier, Lorde ferrers of Chartley, Bourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chier and Louayne, hir Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Warde. &amp;c.<lb/> (.?.) </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, your absence late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Funeralles of my L. your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was lamented by such in VVales as would gladly haue beheld the liuely Image of him in you: and if the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse of your yeares (vnmeete for so tedious and so vnseasonable traueyle) had not by necessitie disappoynted their hope, then shoulde the lamentable speache of the graue and reuerent Father, the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of S. Dauies (expressed wyth abundaunce of dolour and teares) haue left in you a deepe impression of griefe for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable losse of so Honorable a parent: But it may be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that God hath turned your absence to your more benefit. Since, the importunacie of such as loue and honour you, and who couet to haue your Fathers vertues discende with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce, hath obtayned the publishing of that learned Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: wherein your L. may at good leysure view in the iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his lyfe and death the paterne and forme of true Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
   <p>The Heroicall discription that the Byshop maketh of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, comparing it to a mountayne from which foure famous ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers must issue, (the Mountaine true Religion, the riuers, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Iustice, Fortitude, and Temperaunce) is a rule to you▪
<pb facs="4"/>
first to follow your Father in truth of Religion, then to be as he was, wyse, iust, valiaunt, and temperate. The naturall and vnforced courtesie and affability that was in your Father, and that excellent mixture of disposition and aptnesse, both for warre and peace, doth promise to the worlde a singular perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in you hereafter. For, as your Grandfather (who dyed in his young yeares) dyd make shewe of much more Honour then was in the Noble Viscount his Father: And this our Earle by famous actions dyd altogither eclips the vertuous hope cōcey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of your Grandfather: so considering that God in nature continueth as it were the race by outward shew of good partes in you, and that you haue more aduauntage of education, both by the place where you liue, and by the Honour and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of your patrones then your Grandfather or father had, we cannot but hope of a further degree of excellencie in you to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uershine the goodnesse both of your Father and Grandfather. Some people there be that can hardly discerne betwene honour and profit, that doe ouer much thinke of the disaduantage offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you by the Earle your Father, in diminishing some part of his patrimonie in his forrayne Seruices, and will wish you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with a contrarie course to deserue more of your heire, and woorse of the worlde: But as I wishe in you a liberall frugalitie vnder this rule and protestation, that nothing can be profitable that is not honest: so to deserue well (as your Father dyd) of your Soueraigne and countrey in matters appertayning to hir Maiesties obedience, rather throw the helue after the hatchet, and leaue your ruynes to be repayred by your Prince, then any thing to degenerate from Honorable liberalitie. And as in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting great things, it is good to be circumspect, and wyth iudgement wysely to foresee the ende before you beginne: so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing entered into any Honourable attempt that may be iustly grounded vpon reason, follow the same with such inuincible cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
<pb facs="4"/>
in all extremities as your Father dyd, for so shall you iustly deserue lyke testimonie as hir Maiestie gaue to him in hir gracious letters: namelye, that he was a rare Iewell of hir Realme, and an ornament of hir Nobilitie</p>
   <p>True Religion and wisedome (vpon whome Iustice depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth) doe proceede from God by grace, and therefore by inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prayer and studie to be obtayned: but the other vertues as Fortitude, temperaunce, courtesie, affabilitie, liberalitie and constancie, be peculiar to your house, discending by nature, and graffed as it were in your principles, so that to degenerate into the lothsome contraries of these, and in steade of habite of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to disguyse your selfe with vice, shall be harder to you and more impossible for the contrarietie of your nature, then to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne in good things to the perfection of excellencie. And to the end that you may know what you are by birth and bloud, and that you shoulde not by ignoraunce or lacke of knowledge of your selfe, doe any thing vnworthy the Noble houses from whence you are discended: a welwiller of yours hath ioyned to this Sermon (amongs other Epitaphes contayning your Fathers due prayses) his stately discent in well digested Latine verses: not to puffe you vp with any swelling vaniteis, but to giue you a reason how you beare your Armour and Badges of Honour, and to remember you what errour you enter into, if you should blemish the vertues of your Noble Auncestours, or to doe any thing (as I sayde) vnworthy your birth and calling.</p>
   <p>Lastly, my L. haue alwayes before your eyes the feare of God, and the Counsell of the Earle your Father at his death: namely, that you shoulde euer be mindefull of the moment of tyme, assigned both to your Father and Grandfather, the eldest ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing attayned but to sixe and thirtie yeares, to the ende that vpon consideratiō of the short course of lyfe that you in nature are to looke for, you might so imploy your tender yeares in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb facs="5"/>
studies and exercises, as you might in the prime of your youth become a man well accomplished to serue hir Maiestie and your Countrey, aswell in warre as peace: wherevnto he commaunded you to bende all your indeuours, and with those conditions heaped his blessings vpon you. I pray therefore that God will increase those condicionall blessinges, and the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of them in you, to the ende that hir Maiestie may thinke of you hereafter as of a true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt and humble subiect, one of the pillers of hir estate, hir Maiesties kinsman by many allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the sonne of a most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Father.</p>
