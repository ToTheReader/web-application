   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough (friendly Reader) I haue read that the Emperour Tiberius, so little conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended to any purpose or motion of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in himselfe that hee would openly say: <hi>In a free Citie tongues should be free,</hi> yet in the bodie of this simple treatise, wherein I seeme in part to haue some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with them that be nymble and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at the weapon of tongues, I trust I haue not ouer-lashed my selfe to the misusing or offence of my owne tongue, well I wot that folke shall giue an account for idle wordes, but those bee not idle that are meant to admonish, exhort, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue, commende, or misprayse, so long as they bee spoken truely and soundly. If any wordes of this kinde be more than the infirmitie of any woman or man would willingly heare of, let him wit, that which they dislike or finde not belonging to themselues it pertayneth to some others as an admonition of the fault. I wot well that besides Nightcrowes, there be <hi>Noctuae &amp; Vespertiliones.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>There be also <hi>Momi</hi> which be <hi>mimi,</hi> in English: I meane bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie controullers, and but small dooers themselues: as light and trueth is delectable to all other birdes and creatures of sound eye-sight, so vnto these, playne truth without starching and setting foorth in order is eyther so offensiue or seemeth so boysterous in their tender eyes, and they can as ill away with it as that mother in lawe which deserueth to bee called a Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, can abide to take delight in her husbands first chirdren. Neither commeth this woorde Stepdame of the speakers ill speech or terming, but in deede is drawne from the parties ill doing: although perhaps the Grammarians will say, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerca</hi> is a compound worde, <hi>quasi noua furca,</hi> in english, a newe frame of three peeces prepared and set vp for some pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. By that word God forbid I should meane all mothers in lawes of whome I dare vowe and affirme there bee a great number so kindly to their husbandes children, that they may
<pb facs="5"/>well be called mothers. The abuse of a fewe sometime maketh all of that sute or sort, to be blamed, <hi>propter paucas inuisa su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus omnes mulieres</hi> sayth Terence: for a fewe Stepdames sake we are all called Stepmothers. To be short, I would constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beseech all mother in lawes in generall, to haue this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my meaning that haue aduentured to meddle in this kind of matter, chiefely in fauour of the ouerborne, motherlesse and of the poore innocents, whose Angels be before the throne of God, that as we are sure one Crowe pulleth not out anothers eyes, so I hope this my Nightcrowe shall spiritually or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally doe good vnto many, euen of them that rightly deserue that name.</p>
