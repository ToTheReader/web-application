Or, the balance of Gods sanctuary to discerne the weight and solidity of a true and sincere, from the leuitie, and vanitie of a false and counterfeit profession of Christianity.

A sermon preached at Pauls Crosse the 16. of Nouember, 1623. by Robert Barrell, Master of Arts, and minister of Gods word at Maidstone in Kent</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous and charitable Reader; not so much the importunity of my friends, (though I haue been much solicited therevnto) hath caused me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish this Sermon to the view of the world, as that Eye which I had therein to Gods glory and thy good: for being pressed by some of my especiall friends to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish it as a Sermon, which in these dayes, of too much tottering inconstancie in Religion, might be some stay to wauering and vnstable soules, and so doe some good in the Church of God: I thought my selfe most vnworthy to receiue a mite, (much lesse a talent) from the Lord, if I should not most willingly and cheerefully cast it into Gods treasurie: for although of late, many other worthies of our Israel haue<note n="a" place="margin">Luc. 21.1 &amp;c</note> out of the superfluity and abundant riches of their knowledge, cast in much more: yet I hope this mite (which I haue cast in with as good an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as any, though much more able than my selfe to doe good in the Church of God, (will be accepted of him who loues a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full giuer, and whither it be little or much)<note n="b" place="margin">2.

      </gap>, <hi>Let all things be done to aedification: 1.</hi> Cor. <hi>14.26.</hi> My scope therefore in this sermon is to teach thee the art of <hi>Spirituall Architecture:</hi> that is, how to build vp thy selfe to be an house or temple for the Lord, an habitation of God by the spirit: which J teach thee as my selfe haue learned it from that greatest, and chiefest <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect Christ Iesus.</hi> by the direction of his holy word. For all that be in Christ are likewise<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 16, 19.</note>
      <hi>Temples of the holy Ghost</hi> to be built in this world, but to be dedicated in the world to come: (where the glory of the Lord shall fill thee with ioy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable and glorious, as earst his glory filled the materiall Temple. <hi>Exod: 40.34</hi>) And as the building of these spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Temples here is painefull and laborious to flesh and bloud, so the dedication of them there, shall bee most ioyfull and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
<pb facs="5"/> To encourage thee to build, God himselfe hath laid the chiefe corner stone, yea<note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet 5.6.</note> himselfe is the chiefe corner stone, elect and pretious: and all the faithfull are liuing stones to bee laid vpon this foundation, and to be built a spirituall house:<note n="a" place="margin">Aug.
