   <head>A Praise of the Bovve and
Commendation of this Booke, written by
Thomas Churchyard Gent.</head>
   <l>IN forraine land and natiue soyle, where soldiars I haue seen:</l>
   <l>And chefly in the martial dais (whē youth was fresh &amp; green)</l>
   <l>I haue beheld both Bow &amp; shot, the Bow for Archers meet:</l>
   <l>The shot for vse of powlders force, and lads of liuely spreet.</l>
   <l>And iudging by experience great, in place where both were tried:</l>
   <l>I found where shot was graunted good, the Bow was not denied.</l>
   <l>First ere we found out shot aright, the Bow great battels won:</l>
   <l>And long the Bow great glory gate, before we knew the Gun.</l>
   <l>As lo this Booke doth mention make, &amp; shewes in verses good:</l>
   <l>For murthering shot came in of late, when <hi>Bovv</hi> in honor stood.</l>
   <l>In elders daies when manhode shone, as bright as blasing starre,</l>
   <l>And christian hart and noble mind, disdaind this turkish warre.</l>
   <l>The Bow was vsed as force of mā, &amp; strēgth of arms might draw</l>
   <l>To glad the frend and daunt the foe, and hold the world in awe.</l>
   <l>But whē that strēgth and courage fail'd, and cūning crept in place</l>
   <l>The shot and roring Canon came, stout people to deface.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>
The Bow not fit for cowards hand, for cowards strēgth doth faile:</l>
   <l>VVhen man drawes arrow to the head, and then doth foe assaile.</l>
   <l>with sword and dagger Lion-like, that bends both brow and taile</l>
   <l>And grins and gapes with gnashing teeth, to make his enemy quail</l>
   <l>The shot lies lurking in a hole, and spies aduantage great:</l>
   <l>Then bullet, match, and powders force, do work a wicked feate.</l>
   <l>The Archer showes a manly face, in field and euery where:</l>
   <l>And when his arrowes all are spent, he dies with courage there.</l>
   <l>The shot no sooner all discharg'd, but legs for life must shift:</l>
   <l>These bold and venterous nimble boyes, can find no further drift.</l>
   <l>But geue the charging horsmen place, the Archers do not so:</l>
   <l>For foure and twenty headed shafts, belongs to euery <hi>Bow.</hi>
   </l>
   <l>And surely shoote the Archers may, at many a thing ye know.</l>
   <l>When men in broyles and battailes doubt, how warres and world
wil goe.</l>
   <l>There is a knight a soldiar great, in court doth white staffe beare:</l>
   <l>That knowes what Bowes haue done in field, against both shielde
and speare.</l>
   <l>Yea many more are yet aliue, that honours <hi>Bovv</hi> indeed:</l>
   <l>And can record what noble actes the Bow hath done at need.</l>
   <l>I saw in sundry soyles my selfe, much shot discharg'd in vaine:</l>
   <l>Yet graūt we must that through the same are thousands daily slain</l>
   <l>But enterlard the shot with Bow, and tel me then your mind:</l>
   <l>A gallant course of wars vnknown, in field then shal you finde.</l>
   <l>Fiue thousand Bowes that shooteth still, in Battel may do good:</l>
   <l>They gall the horse, or kill the man, or draw some desperate blood.</l>
   <l>And thick as moates in ayer they flee, which hinder much the sight</l>
   <l>And haply makes when horses is hurt, the mounted man alight.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="6"/>
VVel, speak of shot what best you may, the <hi>Bovv</hi> is braue in field:</l>
   <l>And sure in skirmish Archers oft, makes f<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ble shot to yeelde.</l>
   <l>A rare deuise I will set out, to strengthen Man and <hi>Bovv,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>And when the plaine deuice thereof the world shall see and know.</l>
   <l>The <hi>Bovv</hi> shall come againe in fame, and win his wonted grace:</l>
   <l>Looke out of hand for my discourse, til then come <hi>Bovv</hi> in place,</l>
   <l>And take thine Ancient, rowme &amp; vse, as <hi>Arthures</hi> Knights thee gaue,</l>
   <l>Thou art a fearfull fore in field, and yet a pastime braue.</l>
   <l>That brings vp youth, and pleasures age, a noble thing in view</l>
   <l>An auncient arte, a worthy guise, that scornes all practise new.</l>
   <l>An exercise that all men loue, an vse of Armes and strength,</l>
   <l>And to this English soyle of ours, wilt bring great fame at length.</l>
   <l>So cease I heere, in prayse of <hi>Bovv,</hi> thinke of me what you please,</l>
   <l>A longer matter shall I show, before I crosse the Seaes.</l>
