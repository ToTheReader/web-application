   <lg>
      <l>
         <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ooks, like superfluous humors bred with ease,</l>
      <l>So stuffe the world, as it becomes opprest</l>
      <l>With taking more than it can well digest;</l>
      <l>And now are turnd to be a great disease.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>For by this ouer charging we confound</l>
      <l>The appetite of skill they had before:</l>
      <l>There be'ng no end of words, nor any bound</l>
      <l>Set to conceit the Ocean without shore.</l>
      <l>As if man laboured with himselfe to be</l>
      <l>As infinite in writing, as intents;</l>
      <l>And draw his manifold vncertaintie</l>
      <l>In any shape that passion represents:</l>
      <l>That these innumerable images</l>
      <l>And figures of opinion and discourse</l>
      <l>Draw'n out in leaves, may be the witnesses</l>
      <l>Of our defects much rather than our force.</l>
      <l>And this proud frame of our presumption,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="4"/>This <hi>Babel</hi> of our skill, this <hi>Towre</hi> of wit,</l>
      <l>Seemes only checkt with the confusion</l>
      <l>Of our mistakings that dissolueth it.</l>
      <l>And well may make vs of our knowledge doubt,</l>
      <l>Seeing what vncertainties wee build vpon,</l>
      <l>To be as weake within booke as without;</l>
      <l>Or els that truth hath other shapes then one.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But yet although wee labor with this store</l>
      <l>And with the presse of writings seeme opprest,</l>
      <l>And have to many bookes, yet want wee more,</l>
      <l>Feeling great dearth and scarsenesse of the bell;</l>
      <l>Which cast in choiser shapes haue bin produc'd,</l>
      <l>To giue the best proportions to the minde</l>
      <l>Of our confusion, and haue introduc'd</l>
      <l>The likeliest images frailtie can finde.</l>
      <l>And wherein most the skill-desiring soule</l>
      <l>Takes her delight, the best of all delight,</l>
      <l>And where her motions evenest come to rowle</l>
      <l>About this doubtfull <hi>center of the right.</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Which to discouer this great Potentate,</l>
      <l>This Prince <hi>Montaigne</hi> (if he be not more)</l>
      <l>Hath more aduentur'd of his owne estate</l>
      <l>Then euer man did of himselfe before:</l>
      <l>And hath made such bolde sallies out vpon</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Custome,</hi> the mightie tyrant of the earth,</l>
      <l>In whose <hi>Seraglio</hi> of subiection</l>
      <l>Wee all seeme bred-vp, from our tender birth;</l>
      <l>As I admire his powres, and out of loue,</l>
      <l>Here at his gate do stand, and glad I stand</l>
      <l>So neere to him whom I do so much loue,</l>
      <l>T'applaude his happie setling in our land:</l>
      <l>And safe transpassage by his studious care</l>
      <l>Who both of him and vs doth merit much,</l>
      <l>Having as sumptuously, as he is rare</l>
      <l>Plac'd him in the best lodging of our speach.</l>
      <l>And made him now as free, as if borne here,</l>
      <l>And as well ours as theirs, who may be proud</l>
      <l>That he is theirs, though he be euery where</l>
      <l>To haue the franchise of his worth allow'd.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>It be'ing the proportion of a happie Pen,</l>
      <l>Not to b'invassal'd to one Monarchie,</l>
      <l>But dwell with all the better world of men</l>
      <l>Whose spirits all are of one communitie,</l>
      <l>Whom neither <hi>Ocean,</hi> Desarts, Rockes nor Sands</l>
      <l>Can keepe from th'intertraffique of the minde,</l>
      <l>But that it vents her treasure in all lands,</l>
      <l>And doth a most secure commercement finde.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Wrap <hi>Excellencie</hi> vp neuer so much,</l>
      <l>In Hierogliphicques, Ciphers, Caracters,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="4"/>And let her speake neuer so strange a speach,</l>
      <l>Her <hi>Genius</hi> yet finds apt discipherers:</l>
      <l>And neuer was she borne to dye obscure,</l>
      <l>But guided by the starres of her owne grace,</l>
      <l>Makes her owne fortune, and is ever sure</l>
      <l>In mans best hold, to hold the strongest place.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And let the <hi>Critick</hi> say the worst he can,</l>
      <l>He cannot say but that <hi>Montaigne</hi> yet,</l>
      <l>Yeeldes most rich pieces and extracts of man;</l>
      <l>Though in a troubled frame confus'dly set.</l>
      <l>Which yet h'is blest that he hath euer seene,</l>
      <l>And therefore as a guest in gratefulnesse,</l>
      <l>For the great good the house yeelds him within</l>
      <l>Might spare to taxe th'vnapt conuayances.</l>
      <l>But this breath hurts not, for both worke and frame,</l>
      <l>Whilst England English speakes, is of that store</l>
      <l>And that choyse stuffe, as that without the same</l>
      <l>The richest librarie can be but poore.</l>
      <l>And they vnblest who letters doe professe</l>
      <l>And have him not: whose owne fate beates their want</l>
      <l>With more sound blowes, then <hi>Alcibiades</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Did his Pedante that did <hi>Homer</hi> want.</l>
