      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Suppose there is not one thing
more common and lesse thought
of then death.<note place="margin">Heu viuunt homines tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam mors nulla sequatur, aut velut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernus sabula vana foret.</note> All men must die,
yet most men liue, as if they
thought they should neuer die.
Wherein men are very iniurious to them selues;
the sad and setled remembrance of death being a
notable furtherance of Repentance, and a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
meane to keepe vs from eternall death. For
I pray you, why should man lift vp himselfe against
his Maker, who ere long must fall into the earth?
Why should we be proud and insolent, who are but
dust? Why should we insult ouer any man, because
wee surpasse him in wit, wealth, strength, honor,
beautie? Are we not all food for the Wormes? Will
not death knocke all our bones together? Is not our
life a breath, a bubble? Why should a man pinne
his heart to the earth, and set his loue on the
World? Shall not the earth deuoure him? Will not
the world forsake him?<note place="margin">Note.</note> Shee is certaine in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb facs="5"/>
but in vncertainetie, vncertaine in nothing,
but in her certainetie. If she doe not him, yet of
necessitie <hi>Hee</hi> must forsake her. We are here but
<hi>Pilgrims,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 11.</note> and Forrainers: <hi>Mors manet omnes:</hi>
and we know not how soone our Pilgrimage will
end: neither can we carrie the world away with
vs. We come naked, and we go naked. Why then
should we wed our soules to the World? Riches, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
wife, children, friends, honors, and all the
things that the world can afford,<note place="margin">Linquenda tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, &amp; domus, &amp; placens vx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. Hor. Carm. l. 2. od. 14.</note> are all mutable,
momentanie, mortall: but mans soule is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall:
wherefore then should it be set vpon these
things? Why not vpon God, who is an <hi>immortall,</hi>
and <hi>immutable Good,</hi> only indeede able to giue
true and full contentment to the soule?<note place="margin">2. Tim. 6. Iam. 7.</note> And finally
why should men wallow in their sinnes, and deuote
themselues vnto their lusts? Shall we not all die?
And as the tree falleth, so shall it lie. In what estate
we die,<note place="margin">Eccl. 11. 3.</note> in that we shall be iudged. Oh that we
would therefore remember our latter end! Oh
that wee would number our dayes, and thinke of
our death, that we might apply our hearts vnto
wisdome!<note place="margin">Note.</note> Lie is vncertaine, Death is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
if men could duly meditate of this, that is
most certaine, they could not abuse and mispend
that so much, which is precious, but most vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
But besides that <hi>all men</hi> must once die,
<pb facs="5"/>
euen by the course of nature; death being by sinne
bred in the bone, and will neuer out of the flesh:
God, who hath the keyes of life and death in his
hand, doth by many meanes bring men vnto
their ends: and sometimes he doth punish vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wretches by vntimely and vnexpected death,
shewing his anger by the manner and occasion
of his punishing. Famous were the Iudgements
of God vpon those persecuting Tyrants; <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
Hadrian, Valerian, Dioclesian, Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Aurelian, Arnolphus, Baiazet</hi> the <hi>Turke,</hi>
and <hi>Mamucha</hi> a <hi>Saracen.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The former was slaine with Daggers by his
<hi>owne Seruants,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Domitianus. Apud Sucton.</note> in his <hi>priuie chamber,</hi> his
<hi>Wife</hi> consenting.</p>
   <p>The second hauing caused ten thousand <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
at one time to bee crucified,<note place="margin">Hadrian. Spartian. lib. 2. cap. 12.</note> and still raging
against them; God tooke him in hand at last, smit
him with an <hi>issue of bloud,</hi> then with a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi>
of his <hi>lungs,</hi> and <hi>lights,</hi> which he spat
out, thirdly with a <hi>dropsie,</hi> and being in horrible
torment he would haue killed himselfe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hindred, he died in that miserable estate.</p>
   <p>The third being taken prisoner in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
warres,<note place="margin">Valerian. Euseb. hist. lib. 7. cap. 30.</note>
      <hi>Sapor</hi> the King of <hi>Persia</hi> vsed him
as a blocke or <hi>stirrope</hi> to get on horsebacke,
and (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith) made him to be <hi>slayed
<pb facs="6"/>
aliue, and</hi> powdered with salt.</p>
   <p>The fourth in hatred of <hi>Christianitie</hi> by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
edict commanded the <hi>Christians</hi> Churches
should be beaten downe,<note place="margin">Dioclesian.</note> and their Bibles burnt and
torne, and themselues to be put out of their offices
in the Common-wealth,<note place="margin">Ruffin.</note> which had any: but God
met with him, plagued him with strange diseases,
fired his house with lightning, and terrified him
with thunder so, as that not knowing where to
hide himselfe he fell mad, and killed himselfe.</p>
   <p>The fift was smitten with a most stinking and
vile disease,<note place="margin">Maximinus.</note> which increased his crueltie, and at
last killed him;<note place="margin">Nicephor.</note> his carkasse being rotten and full
of wormes. <hi>S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. Chrysostome</hi> saith the Apple
of his eye fell out before his death.</p>
   <p>The sixt had his throat cut by his owne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.<note place="margin">Aurelian.</note>
   </p>
   <p>The seuenth rotted liuing, and sending forth
lice and wormes continually,<note place="margin">Arnolphus.</note> at length died mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
in the twelfth yeare of his tyrannie.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Baiazet</hi> was taken captiue by <hi>Tamerlaine,</hi>
caried about in a <hi>Cage,</hi> and vsed as his <hi>stirrope,</hi>
and ended his daies miserably.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Mamucha</hi> returning from the slaughter of
many Christians, was with his whole Armie swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp of the Sea, few or none escaping of an
hundred saile of ships.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
What need I say so much? The iudgements of
God are many and fearefull in all the world. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindus</hi>
a cruell Tyrant in this Iland, was deuoured
of a Monster that came out of the Irish Seas.<note place="margin">Stow Anno mundi. 3659.</note>
      <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piel</hi>
a King of Poland, an Vncle-murtherer, and
a notable curser,<note place="margin">Munst. Cosm. lib. 1. cap. 32.</note> was with his wife (who consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Vncles death) eaten vp of Rats. <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi>
perished with the fall of an hot-house vpon
him. <hi>Arrius</hi> voided his guts. The Emperours
<hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Valence,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Socrat. Zozom</note> both <hi>Arrians,</hi> were
punished by God; the former by a sodaine, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Apoplexie, whereof he died; the latter
was burnt in a little house,<note place="margin">Ruffin. l. 2. c. 13</note> in which he had hid
himselfe in his slight from the Gothes. But what
need I goe so farre for examples? All ages are
full of them. And we see how God suffers Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
Drunkards, and other sinners which scape
often vnpunished, to fall into thefts and murthers
whereby they come vnto their deaths. Which
things, if men would duly consider, it would rouse
them vp by the grace of God vnto better care and
conscience: which God grant vnto vs. But I will
hold thee no longer, but leaue thee to consider the
things I haue prepared for thee.</p>
