judicious view a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Tractate of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymion,</hi>
vulgarly styld, <hi>The
Man in the Moone:</hi> a Discourse
intermixed, as well with Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall
rudiments, as Poeticall
raptures: The matter sublime, the
stile succinct; neither ought it to
be any way mis-censured for the
Title: For all that trade with <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
are not therefore to bee held
<hi>Lunaticke;</hi> neither are all things

for rare fruites may grow of
rugged trees, and golden truths may
be gathered from leaden Fables.
But to such as are not throughly
Verst in this subiect, it shall not
be amisse to speake something brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerning <hi>Endymion</hi> and the
<hi>Moone,</hi> (the argument of this
present Fancy) the better to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
them in the perusall thereof.
She is called <hi>Trivia,</hi> for so saith
<hi>Virgil,</hi> Prince of Poets, in these
words.
<q>
         <hi>Tria virginis,</hi> or a <hi>Diana</hi>
      </q>
And that by reason of her three
shapes, <hi>Coelestiall, Terrestriall,</hi>
and <hi>Infernall:</hi> when she shineth
in Heaven, she is <hi>Cynthia,</hi> or
<pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>Luna:</hi> when shee appeareth on
Earth, <hi>Latonia virgo,</hi> or <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi>
being resident in Hell, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi>
or <hi>Proserpina:</hi> And for two
reasons said to bee enamoured on
<hi>Endymion:</hi> The one, in regard
he was the first that studied to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the course of the <hi>Moone,</hi>
and therefore was thought to have
slept thirty yeares, because hee spent
so much time in solitude, to find
out that secret. The second, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the humour of the nightly
Dew, dropping from the Starres
and Planets, is sucked in, and
commixed with the moysture and
juyce of the Hearbs and Plants,
to their better animating &amp; cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing;
<pb facs="7"/>
as also being profitable to
flocks of Shepheards, in whose
number <hi>Endymion</hi> was ranked
as the most eminent amongst them.
It is the Translation of a French
Coppy, three severall times imprest,
and in the Originall cry'd up, even
by the most supercilious Criticks:
with many curious Copper Prints
decorated, and to one of the greatest
Princesses in <hi>Europe</hi> at first De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated:
and for Mr. <hi>Richard
Hurst,</hi> the Translator, he was not
onely knowne to be a Traveller, but
withall an excellent and learned
Linguist, of an accute wit, and a
mature iudgement; who in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
thereof, hath not onely
<pb facs="7"/>
equald, but transcended it, in the
elegancy both of phrase and stile:
But why should I so much labour to
recommend that, which in the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
can sufficiently approve it
selfe, onely let me intreate thee to
Read favourably, as it is rendred
unto thee faithfully, and with this
Caution, I commit it to thy free and
friendly Censure.</p>
