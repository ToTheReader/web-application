   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing more then one yeare passed (right courteous and Christian Reader) si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence I was entreated to peruse Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chaine, for setting it on vnto a second Edition; I therupon (by Gods helpe togither with that labour) tooke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and courage to contriue this little work called <hi>Saint Peters watchworde;</hi> which may either passe alone by it selfe, or bee ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to that Chaine, according as it shall bee fitting and expedient: the mettall both of the one and the other, being finest golde of the truest touch; first hammered vpon the
<pb facs="5"/>Anuill in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> forge, by that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle himselfe, and whatsoeuer is added vnto it, and howsoeuer vnpolished, yet you shall finde it weighed, I trust, in the vpright ballance of the Lords Sanctuarie.</p>
   <p>Which Watchworde of the Apostle if it waken them that are sound a sleepe in sinne; and warne them that are alreadie waking, to stand vpon their guard more warily then heretofore: it is the onely marke that I ayme at, and the verie blessing of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these poore and vnlaboured labours of mine, which I heartily desire.</p>
   <p>And because (as all men know) it is a very vnpleasant thing, any whit to trouble them that are asleepe: and euen breuitie it selfe to them that are napping, is counted tediousnesse: I haue therefore not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured, to be as briefe as conueniently I might throughout this whole Treatise, that so I might not offende them that are best disposed: but haue also cut or deuided this discourse into diuerse partes or Chapters; that so euen they that are drowsie, may at least wise take a taste thereof, in reading a Chapter betwixt euery nappe, and so happily
<pb facs="5"/>may be thereby incouraged to proceede with the rest as appetite and good desire shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease vpon them.</p>
   <p>Most humbly praying the holy spirit of God, who first mooued Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to giue this watchword, and inspired and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed my minde thus to explaine it, and to publish the same for the good I trust of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; to blesse this little labour of mine, and to make it fruitfull, with the dew of his grace, as well in the heart of the sower, as in the minds of those that shall reape any profit thereby. And so gentle Reader I wish thee well to fare, as thy soule fareth: and in thy prayers I pray thee, remember him that prayeth dayly for thee, and for all them that looke for the appearing of our Lorde Iesus Christ, to their immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. Veni citò do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Iesu.</p>
