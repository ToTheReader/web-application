   <head>The Author to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His latter age hath brought forth memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
exploits of war: &amp; <hi>Flāders</hi> (without strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from our subiect) to her losse, hath not
seene the least, being vexed with continuall
troubles since the yeere 1566. The sieges of
<hi>Harlem, Mastricke, Andwerp,</hi> and other
townes, haue beene goodly, according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Etimology which some giue vnto the word. <hi>Bellum, quod
minime bellum,</hi> and it seemes that the industry of men instructed
by the inuentions of former ages, and prickt forward by religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and other violent causes and coulours, hath added what she
could, and as it were made the vttermost triall of her forces. I
leaue it vnto the reader to make a comparison betwixt this siege
of <hi>Ostend,</hi> and the rest, but without doubt it exceedes them all in
length of time: the importance therof cannot be told, being the
most memorable occurrant of our age. The opinion I haue that
this small worke (recommended by truth it selfe, and as free from
passion, as voide of affectation) should be pleasing vnto many, is
the cause I haue set it forth, to represent (as in a table) the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable
things that haue happened on either side at this siege.
Many being interessed in the cause (as they say) will desire to
see it, and spirits prickt forward by curiosity would not loose their
partes. In the yeere 1599. the Flemings being molested with the
continuall courses of them of <hi>Ostend,</hi> caused certaine forts to be
made about the towne, to bridle them. It is aboue three yeeres
since this fiege begā, which was the fift of Iuly in the yeere 1601.
we may thinke that the importance of the place, hath (during this
time) furnished both the one &amp; the other withal deuises possible,
for the well assayling &amp; defending of the Towne. The discourse
which is briefe, frees me from giuing any censure: and the Law
which I haue prescribed my selfe, opposeth: Some not vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
call <hi>Ostend</hi> an <hi>Academie</hi> and an excellent Schoole, for
Gouernours, Captaines, Souldiers, Ingeneurs, Phisitions, Surgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Pilots and Mariners: and they finde it by experience, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one of these persons which hath continued but three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
<pb facs="3"/>
in <hi>Ostend,</hi> is become excellent in his art and vocation. A
Souldier when he comes forth speakes like a Maister in fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
of Ramperes, Bulworkes, Spurres, Counterscarfes, Raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,
Trauerses, Parapets, halfe Moones, Reduites or Blocke hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and such like, I will alledge one example among many, to
shew the valour of the Souldiers of <hi>Ostend:</hi> In the yeere 1603.
the Arch-dukes men hauing surprized the Castel of <hi>Wastendonck,</hi>
the inhabitants resolued to retrench themselues against it, setting
their Garison to worke, who were schollers newly from this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademie,</hi>
these good workmen made proofe in three houres what
they could doe, to the great amazement of the Spaniardes, who
said they could not be men, seeing the Canon did not force them
to retire a foote, or els that euery one had a new life in his cofers.
As for Phisitions and Surgians, Mounsieur <hi>Moerbeke</hi> of <hi>Haigh,</hi>
is held for a <hi>Phoenix, Alexander Courtmans</hi> of <hi>Andwerp</hi> is very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
&amp; all such as haue practised in <hi>Ostend,</hi> haue purchased a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue
aboue the rest. The like is of all men that haue bin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
there, finally this little booke is good for Souldiers, who
shall learne therein many excellent points of their profession, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the cost of other men, and ready to be put in practise: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall it be vnprofitable to any, seeing that we liue in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
age towards the dissolution of the world threatned of all
sides with wars, like vnto a poore traueller, which sees the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ouercast threatning a storme in the midst of a plaine Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
As for delight: If any one seeke to please his taste, the variety
of the discourse will minister sufficient matter: My intention in
writing these simple remembrances, free from all other affection,
was onely to serue the publike: If my labour may be as friendly
accepted, &amp; be pleasing to all good men, &amp; to those whose iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not obscured nor transported with passion, neither
that haue coniured against the trueth: I haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to my desire, and thinke my paines
well imployed. Farewell.</p>
