Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have beene superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, sometimes prophane, and for some yeares, some that have professed themselves best to God, have beene undutifull to thee. It is an ill signe, if children acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a father, and deny a mother, that all hath not beene well Doest

thou live in perpetuall adulteries and rebellions that thy children renounce thee? Surely thy love is to thy husband alone. Though when thy husband knowes of it, and hee doth not mislike it, nay, gives thee generall allowance, thou takest some ornaments and Iewels from blessed and good men▪ yet is thy heart to Christ continually, yea and all thy carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages are according to his will. Many of thy worthy sonnes have vindicated this truth both against <hi>Rhemes,</hi> and <hi>Amsterdame.</hi> They could not indure that their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should be called whore, much lesse prooved so. Amongst the rest, I thy unworthy sonne have appeared in thy cause, renouncing all the bloud in my heart that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth against Christ, and thee his spouse. If I appeare of too mild a
<pb facs="4"/>
temper, thou hast not begotten me of murthering mettle, but of that word which makes us turne speares, and swords into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks and sythes. How soever I look, I am sure I am thy child. And if I have done thee any honour in this poore service, I am glad: if not, yet I have done the best that I thought fit for these opposers; and so with my humble prayers for the flourishing, and increase of thy peace and truth, I kisse thy hand, and rest</p>
