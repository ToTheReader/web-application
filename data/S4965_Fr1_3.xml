      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Midst the numberlesse number of Bookes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in this scribling age the presses are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, there is scarcity enough of such as are usefull and profitable. As therefore the Art of Printing was a happy invention for the propagating of learning, so surely wee are beholding to those who write such things as are worthy to be published: Since (as one saith) Hee that speaketh profiteth for an houre, but he that writeth profiteth for ever. This subject thus handled by this worthy deceased Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour is an unbeaten tract, few (if any) having gone over the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samples of Scripture in such a doctrinall and practicall way both. It seemed to me in the preaching both pleasant and profitable;<note place="margin">Owne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci.</note> pleasant in regard of the explaining of divers stories; profitable in respect of the particular application of all, Hee being (according to his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) large and lively therein. Had it pleased God to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued him in life, untill hee had finished all the Examples of either Testament, such a worke from so able a Divine would have beene of singular use. But he was <hi>Frumentum Dei,</hi> as <hi>Ignatius</hi> said, by Mortification and Selfe-denyall, <hi>Hee was made cleane bread for Christ who was the bread of life for him;</hi> God therefore hath gathered this wheate into his garner,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.12.</note> and he now rests from this and all other labours. We thinke fitting also to give others to understand, which be M. <hi>Wheatelyes</hi> owne workes done by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and such as they may account genuine, <hi>viz.</hi> those onely

which come forth either in our names, <hi>viz. EDWARD LEIGH, HENRY SCUDDER,</hi> or with an Epistle at least from one of us. You may observe in the beginning of this Treatise, what was M. <hi>Wheatlies</hi> constant method in handling the Examples. In each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hee considered three things, His Birth, Life and Death. In his Life he observed his carriage and behaviour in respect both of the deeds hee did, good, bad, indifferent and doubtfull, and the things which befell him, either prosperously or adversly, in bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits or afflictions. This shall suffice in briefe to premise concerning this Worke, and so wishing thee much benefit by the same, I rest</p>
