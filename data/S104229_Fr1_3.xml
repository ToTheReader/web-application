   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLE</hi> and Christian Reader, miserie from our beginninge: and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranye of appetyte to our ending. The one will maister vs by that wee be borne: and the other disquyet vs to the verye momente that we dye. The selynes of miserye, shoulde, and might be cawse in vs to kill, and mortefie the appetyte: but we make the soueraintye of our appetyte, a speedie introduction to all kynde of myserie. Appetyte is one waye naturall, and so farre to be allowed of. Againe she is a lawles lustinge of the fleshe, the whiche fleshe is our owne, so that such appetyte, or luste, is our neare allye, and in dede altogether sibbe vs. By the whith knotte of alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce she will still be acquainted, and vppon longe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaunce growe to a stronge, and mightie credit with vs: as, to leade, &amp; misleade vs, and most vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye abuse vs, her owne naturall kinsefolke, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterers. The fleshe wisheth after sundrye thinges, and that in sundrye maner: All the whyche lustynge, is concupiscence, or appetite: so that Appetite is diuers, therfore her fruictes are manifold, her fruictes are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the gua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>don of synne is deathe: and because we are all lothe to dye, it were wel done we should marke some lessons auailable, and restoratiue to lyfe. Sinne is not onely fruitfull in springinge, but if she be crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, lyke <hi>Hydraes</hi> heades in multiplyinge. It is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore halfe a victorye to beate her downe: and a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphante conqueste to houlde her downe. Neither is shee more stronge then flye, so that when she can not ouercum vs by puissaunce, she will, and doth deceyue
<pb facs="3"/>
vs by guyle: and failinge to preuaile as a tyraunte, she neuer faileth to plaie her pagiaunte as an Hypocryte. Worthilye therfore is she portrayed of the beste prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tysed, and moste heedefull painters halfe cladde, and halfe bare. The philophers saye, the more grosse parte is apparant: and the more hurtefull parte couered or dissembled. So that here is wysedome There was neuer yet coyne so well stamped, but there hathe bene forged dyuers the lyke counterfeyts: and the better coyne, the more counterfeites thereof. The moste cleare and brighte vertue, that hathe, or shall florishe was neuer so modeste in attyre, but vyce (howe drabbishe so euer she hath ben) hath brought to passe to be comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as demure, and matrone like. The more beautifull the vertue is the more dangerous is her vitious coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terfaite. And because eche like thing tendreth his like, therfore, semblable vertues are deceiued in semblable vices. So that those vertues (sely innocentes as they be) receiue for frendes their enemies, for true and very sisters, vntrue and deceitfull foes. Under the winges of many a good vertue, slepeth soundly many a lewd vice. Likewise the likelyhode that hipocrites seme to haue with the best lyued, is to them frō tyme to tyme, a quiet and most easefull harbour. Yea, the godly oft tymes not so much had in price, as their counterfaits, dissemblyng naughtie packs. And how cometh (think you) to passe, this so blynde and disordered a tragedie? because (as I erst sayde) the more parte of vice is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. And as fewe or none with insyghte can pearce through her clothes: so fewe or none doo attempt to deuest or plucke of her vaile of hypocrisie. <hi>Horace</hi> was excellent good in his time, a muche zelous controller
<pb facs="3"/>
of sinne, but chiefly one that with sharpe satyres and cutting quippies, coulde wel displaie and disease a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser. The holy Prophete <hi>Ieremie</hi> dyd rufully and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly lam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>nte the deepe and massie enormities of his tymes, &amp; earnestly prognosticate and forspeake the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and sower consequents that came after, and sauce with teares the hard plagues that had gone before. Therfore as it is mete for a man of god rather to wepe then to iest: and not vndecent for a prophane writer to be iestyng, and merie spoken: I haue brought to passe that the plaintiue Prophete <hi>Ieremie</hi> shoulde wepe at synne: and the pleasant poet <hi>Horace</hi> shoulde laugh at synne Not one kynde of musike deliteth all passions: nor one salue for all greuances. If a man woulde ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender in mynde the sequele of tymes, and whome the world dubbeth as worthies, and culleth as her whel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and how for shewes and pratling of pietie, she pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>claimeth fooles holy, admireth fooles, magnifieth foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les: and how for not pratyng of pietie, or not glosyng, she misiudgeth the wise, discrediteth the wise, propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the wise: not a thousand <hi>Democrati,</hi> coulde suffise to laugh at the one, nor a thousād <hi>Heracliti</hi> be enough to wepe at the other. <hi>Horace</hi> because he was not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such time, wherin pretenced forwardnesse, was an haruest to those that pretended it, and a despoiling win<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter blaste, to that religion, wherfore it semed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tēded: he neuer se, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> with the view of his eie, which his pensiue translater can not but oueruew with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishe of his soule. Natheles such vices as were then flydge, and incident into that age, he assaileth fearcely, and ratleth vp bitterly. His eloquence is somtyme to sharpe, and therfore I haue blunted it, and somtymes
<pb facs="4"/>
to dull, and therefore I haue whetted it: helpyng hym to ebbe, and helpyng hym to rife. I began this worke (a thyng of small accompt) two yeres agone, or more, and haue dispatched it by piece meale, or inche meale, with smal preiudice or none to my studie or profession. In the first and second Satire I haue taken it a note beyond the text: afterward plodded on much more pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cisely. At y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> begynning he is loftie, but afterward won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derfully calmed. I dare not warraunt the Reader) to vnderstand him in all places, no more then he did me. Howbeit I haue made him more lightsom, well nie by the tone halfe (a small accomplishement for one of my continuance) and if thou canst not nowe in all points perceiue him (thou must beare with me) in soothe the default is thyne own. This is a true assertion: who so but knewe the least part of <hi>Horace</hi> his satyres, as they were before. may nowe vnderstande them all in their new Englyshe liuerey.</p>

      <hi>FYRST</hi> I haue done as the people of god wer cōmanded to do with their captiue women that were hansome and beautifull: I haue shaued of his heare, &amp; pared of his nayles (that is) I haue wyped awaye all his vanitie and superfinitie of matter.

If not aske counsaile at his interpreters: and if some thinge shall seeme to the straunglye, or not reasonablye done thou shalte fynde (I am sewer) that it came so to passe not vppon negligence but iudgemente. Otherwyse if anie will deceyue him selfe in mysiudgynge, he shall haue muche a doe to make me angrye. For what so is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of me sinisterlye through the speakers eyther euill will, or small skill, my fashion is to be loth to heare it: but not wrothe to reuenge it▪ The poet is thus: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes he wadeth verye farre in fetchinge out his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and somtymes he is brittle, and soone broken of from his matter: So that thou muste be deepe witted to begyn with him and wel witted to take him with thee▪ Thou must (gentle reader) bring in thy self help to the vnderstandinge of him, and will lykewyse to thyne owne amendmente.
