   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot to trouble you
with an <hi>Invective</hi>
against those multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of Pamphlets
which are every day
prest into the World; or an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi>
why this was published
amongst the rest (the usuall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for such kind of Epistles:) Let
me in briefe admonish you som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
concerning the
<list>
         <item>chiefe scope
and
manner</item>
         <item>of this following
discourse.</item>
      </list>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="132"/>
1 'Tis not the <hi>purpose</hi> of it, to
set downe an exact Treatise of
this kind of <hi>Astronomy;</hi> but rather
to remove those common preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
which usually deterre men
from taking any Argument ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this way, into their conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
For we may obserue, that
in those points which are cryed
downe by the more generall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
men doe for the most part
rest themselves in the superficiall
knowledge of things, as they seem
at their first appearances, thinking
they can say enough to any Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
against which they can urge
the most obvious and easie Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
and therefore seldome or
never search into the depth of
these points, or enter into any seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
impartiall examination of
<pb facs="132"/>
those grounds on which they are
bottomed. Which as it must needs
be a great hinderance to the profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie
of all kind of Learning:
so more especially is it in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
We might discerne a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
comelinesse and order in this
great Fabricke of the World, and
more easily understand the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
in Astronomy, if we could
with indifferencie attend to what
might bee said for that opinion
of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> which is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
   <p>2 <hi>For the manner.</hi> It is not
maintained with such heate and
religion, as if every one that reads
it, were presently bound to yeeld
up his assent: But as it is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Warres where <hi>victory</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee had, Men must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb facs="133"/>
with peace: So likewise is
it in this, and should bee in all
other Philosophicall contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
If there bee nothing able
to convince and satisfie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Reader, hee may still
injoy his owne opinion. All
men have not the same way of
apprehending things; but according
to the varietie of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
custome, and abilities, their
Vnderstandings are severally fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned
to different assents:
Which had it beene but well
considered by some of our hot
<note n="*" place="margin">Fromond. Al. Ross.</note> adversaries, they would not
have shewed more <hi>violence</hi> in
opposing the <hi>Persons</hi> against
whom they write, than <hi>strength</hi>
in confuting the <hi>cause.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>'Tis an excellent rule to bee
<pb facs="133"/>
observed in all disputes, That
Men should give <hi>soft Words</hi> and
<hi>hard Arguments,</hi> that they would
not so much strive to <hi>vex,</hi> as
to <hi>convince</hi> an Enemy. If this
were but diligently practised in
all cases, and on all sides, wee
might in a good measure bee
freed from those vexations in
the search of Truth, which the
wise <hi>Solomon,</hi> by his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
did so much complaine
of, <hi>Ecclesiastes, 1. 18. In much
Wisedome there is much Griefe,
and he that increaseth Knowledge,
increaseth Sorrow.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To conclude: Though there
should be nothing in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
conducible to your Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and Benefit; yet it may
serve in the <hi>Perusall,</hi> as it did
<pb facs="134"/>
in the <hi>Composure</hi> for the recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of such leisure houres, as
may conveniently bee spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
imploiments.</p>
   <closer>Farewell.</closer>
