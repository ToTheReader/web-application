      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Was bold (Madam) for two causes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this Nosegay vnto your ladishippe. The first is, the gentle acceptāce that I know it shal haue at your hands, who haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been a fauourer of learning, &amp; of them that are learned: The seconde is, that comming out vnder the name of so woorthie a Patronage, it shalbe the better accepted of all men. I am bounde also for twoo causes to doe the same, first to satisfie in part the duetie which I owe vnto you, and to shew some signe of the loue that I ow to you and yours: Secondly that the worlde may see that
<pb facs="3"/>alwayes a green tree is not fruitles: but that that garden which before bare brā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and thistles, if it be wel tilled, will beare also sweet smelling flowers. The slips hereof were set in sundry Italian gardens, &amp; with branches therof I met at Paris, which smelled so sweetely, that I tooke the paines to transport them hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into England, and to binde them vp in this small nosegay, the which I pray your Ladiship so to accept, as with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
