   <head>¶A Christian Prologue to
the Christian reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome wil count me
fond, that of myne
owne fansy vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned,
haue cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sen
rather to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarde
daunger of
blame, by entringe
to touche this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of vsurye, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
thereby to other mens curtesies, for par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don
of my faulte: then by sittinge still, as noe
medler in matters of the worlde, to be without
blame or fault at all. One sayeth to me, what
haue you to doe, to wrastle thus with vsurye?
what will you geat by it, not a peny the more
wilbe lent you for making any suche booke,
be you wel assured: nay, you shall the rather
want, when you would haue, trust vnto it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my woorde. In this firste onset, I am thus
iumped withal by some men, for dealinge in
this sorte with matters of vsurye. Well I am
sorie to offende any, and surelye my mynde is
to do good vnto al. For I protest before god I do
<pb facs="11"/>
not mean euill to any man, but wish the best I
cā, to one &amp; other. And sorie I am, that good
meanyng &amp; wel, should be hurtfull to me, or
offensiue to any body else. And yet such is the
worlde, the galde horse will not be rubde: men
that are most faulty, can least abide rebukes,
and plain men for telling trueth, many times
beshrewe them selues, being wel assured, that
it is as certayn a thing, as it is a common say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Veritas odium parit,</hi> Trueth purchaseth
hatred. I knowe in deede that playnenesse of
speache, and freedome of tongue, in decyphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
sinne, and aduancing vertue, are not the
best waies to thriue by, for it is not rare, that
many a man hath com to great wealth, which
neuer knew what vertue nor honesty mēt in al
his lyfe. Yea, ther be some that haue solemply
vowed, neuer to be of that religion, that smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
of pouertye, they had rather be riche with
Alexāder, then poore with Christ. A horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
kind of speache, fyrst money say they, and
then honestie will follow of course: for what is
wisedome, learnynge or honestie? It is money
(man) say they, that makes a man to be taken
for wise, honest, valiant, mightie, yea, and for
a kinges fellowe too. This opynion haue many
<pb facs="12"/>
men, and I feare it be the creede of the worlde
at this time. And thus I haue lost all my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
and shall not bee worth a grote here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yf wicked mammon or mans malyce bee
euer of power to keepe me vnder. And then
had it not ben a great deale better for mee, to
haue played and done nothinge, then thus to
take paynes, and lose al thinges? Well, of thys
one thinge I am wel assured, that god will not
forsake them, that put their trust in hym, but
wyll rewarde them more largelye then mans
wil is to geue or his power to get. And I hope
better of their courtesies, then to haue such dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>curtesy
at their handes. And this wil I saye,
he that wil do as I haue sayd, he shalbe richer
thā the proudest of thē al. And let thē not saye
that I am suche an enemye to vsurie that I
will haue none at all to bee vsed. For I am an
vsurer my selfe so farre forthe as I am able, I
woulde they knew it, and I will teache others
to be greater vsurers then I am my selfe, and
shewe them how to gaine more in a daye, then
others are able to geat in seuen yeres. Do ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
O ye men of this worlde, as I shall teache
you, and you shallbee suche men, as hereafter
you wil blesse me. Lēd to your poore neighbors
<pb facs="12"/>
in time of their great neede, for gaine on gods
name, and put out your money to them for v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie,
in suche sorte of vsurye I meane, as god
hathe commaunded you to vse, and you shall
yerely, daylie, and howerly reape infinit gain.
For as god is better able to rewarde you then
man: so will he for his promise sake, make you
recompēce with encrease infinytely. And as he
saieth, if you geue but a draught of water in
his name, and for his sake, you shall not lose
your reward. The iust man is ful of compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as the Prophet Dauyd sayethe, and dothe
lend. Be you therefore iust men, O ye world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges,
and let others haue that to occupye,
which lyeth idle by you, and lend freely, not
hopinge somuche as for the principall agayne,
that you may heape gayn to your selues, from
god plentifullie. For I tell you, this is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
vsury, which is the right vsurie in dede,
and suche as Christ woulde haue vsed in the
19. chapiter of the gospell after Saint Mathew
where he sayethe. Why wouldest thou not put
out my mony to the banker? that is, why didst
thou not bestowe my grace and my gifts to the
profite of others, by communicating the same
among them? Thus spiritual vsurie is called
<pb facs="13"/>
the multiplicacion of the giftes, and graces of
god. Thus by a litle trauaile, a man may win
an hundred fold meede in heauē. Who would
not labour in time of haruest to gette in corne?
And what other thīg is this world thē an har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uest
for good mē, to gleane the poore into their
barnes. And be it, that the party vnto whom
you haue lēt is poore &amp; not able to repay you,
yet you are sure of this, the partye that borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed,
will thanke you, if there be any honesty
in him at all, and wyll desire god to rewarde
and prosper your doings, &amp; god will heare his
prayer that is not hable to paye. And is not
this a good recōpence? But be it that some one
being able to pay, is yet not onely vnthākful
in words, but defraudeth you in dede of your
owne: as you maye haue your remedy against
the man, so assure your selfe that god euen in
such cases will reward you, with his grace &amp;
mercie without any asking or prayer made to
him at al. For it is thus written in the booke of
Iesus of Sirach. <hi>Qui facit misericordiam foe
nerat proximo.</hi> He that vseth pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
doth lend vpō vsurie to his neighbor,
and god wil pay that vsurie him selfe. And
therefore it is saide farther in that chapiter.
<pb facs="13"/>
There be many which are not glad for to lend,
not because of euill, but they feare to lose the
thinge that they did lend. Haue thou paciēce
herein O man with the simple (saith the text)
and withholde not mercie from him, helpe the
poore for the commaundements sake, and let
him not go empty from thee because of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie.
Leese thy money for thy brother and
neighbours sake, and burye it not vnder a
stone where it rusteth and corrupteth. Gather
thy treasure after the commaundements of the
highest, and so shall it bring thee more profite
then golde. Lay vp thy almes in the hande of
the poore, and it shall keepe thee from al euill.
Thus farre Iesus the sonne of Sirache with a
great deale more, full of muche comfort, for al
those that lende their money out, to receiue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie
at gods hands. Whiche vsury god grant
all men may vse dayly and howerlye to theire
Christian bretheren: for their rewarde shal be
great in heauen, that for Christes sake lende
freely vnto men vpon earth. Neyther is heare
any losse to him that lendeth in such sorte, but
rather vnspeakable gayne, suche as neyther
hart can thinke, nor tongue can vtter, nor eye
hath seene. If a man in this worlde gayne a
<pb facs="14"/>
pound for a peny, it is thought a wonder, and
yet god geueth to them, that geue for his sake,
thousandes more then is gayned in thys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porcion.
For he geeueth for transitorie trashe,
eternal treasure: for bryttle mettall, assured
welfare: for money, mercie: for golde, al good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
and for this fraile worlde here, the world
that neuer hath ende hereafter.</p>
   <p>Thus you see, thys vsurye is good and prayse
worthye, suche as will heape more treasure to
man in one moment, then al the golde moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vnto, that all the Banquers haue in the
wide worlde besides. Happye is he therefore,
that is suche an vsurer, and I praye god al
men maye be suche vsurers hereafter in dede.
For whatsoeuer men lose by thys meanes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
earthe, they are sure to finde the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in heauen. And what losse I pray you
hathe hee, that when hys debtour faylethe
hym, god receyueth hym? and when the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
payethe not, god payethe the debte for
hym? An happye eschaunge no doubte, saye
I, yea and a blessed alteracion. The poore
man is bounde to paye, and god is hys su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertie,
and wyll paye the debte hymselfe, yf
<pb facs="14"/>
the poore man bee decayed, and not able to
aunswere the summe: yea let men bee neuer
so vnthankefull, god wil for his promise sake
paye all mens debtes. And because a manne
maye bee the surer, god layethe in a pawne,
whyche is his heauenly gospel, than the which
no greater nor surer gayne can bee layde oute
for mans behoofe vpon earthe. We see if a man
neede moneye in this worlde, and hath a kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
riche man to bee his suertie, euerye man
is readye to lende for gaine. And is the lorde
of heauen and earthe, he that made the world
and all that therein is, a poore man in your
sight my ryche masters? wyll you not truste
hym, that made you al of nought? that gaue
you freely all that you haue, and wythoute
whom you can haue nothynge? that suffereth
the Sunne to shyne vpon you throughe hys
mercye, that sendethe rayne in due season,
that rulethe the heauens, and the course ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for your onelye benefyte? And doubte you
nowe good sirs, that thys lorde of oures, being
lorde of all lordes, is not a sufficyent suertye
to paye vnto you youre owne agayne, and to
recompence you to the vttermoste farthynge?
<pb facs="15"/>
If the seruant shoulde mistrust his iust mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
the tenaunt his good landlorde, the sonne
his louing father, it woulde be thought, that
any of these were lewd folke in their so doing.
And shall wee not thinke them most worthye
of blame, that mistruste the goodnes of god,
who is master, lorde, and father ouer all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
liuinge, and the onely creator of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
by whom all creatures breathe, lyue
and haue their being, and without whom all
flesh is nothing but confusion, shame, and the
verye outcastes of thys wretched worlde?
But now, touching the cōpany that is to talk
in this treatise, you shall vnderstande gentle
reader, that no man, nor yet any profession or
callinge is especially touched in thys reporte
that I haue to make, but onelye a rehearsall
made of speache that hath passed. Whyche I
thought good for the varietie thereof, and for
the better setting forthe of gods glorye, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to writing, and so to the printe, that all
men may see and reade the matter, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
doe, as god shall geue them grace. Theire
names I haue geuen vnto them in greeke and
Englishe, callinge the preacher, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
whiche I doe englishe, Ockerfoe, as enemye to
<pb facs="15"/>
vsury. The merchant I do name, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
whom I doe tearme, Gromel gayner, and for
shortnes, write him sometime Gromel, calling
him moste by the name of merchaunte. The
Ciuilian, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, and so aduocate or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilian.
The Lawyer, because I knowe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
lawe is whollye against vsurie, asmuch
as the Cannon lawe, or scripture it selfe: I doe
christen him, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, counting him heare
in deede not muche better then a petye fogger
in lawe, as one that sometimes hath studied a
litle lawe, beeinge yet neuer allowed in anye
Inne of Court or Chauncery for his learninge,
and assuring my selfe that no vtter barrister,
muche lesse any Counsellor in lawe, wyll al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
his opinion: callynge hym Lawyer not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
for modestie sake, because the
other name is odious, and none woulde wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
in dede be tearmed as they are, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when the name concerneth eyther wyt or
learning. And yet to see the worlde, none are
so readye to defend vsurie as those are, that
haue the least vnderstandinge in any profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
And so I am bolde to vse this name pety
fogger, whom for curtesie sake, and for good
manner, I doe call Lawyer, althoughe noe
<pb facs="16"/>
lawyer in deede, doth or wil allowe of vsury,
but the vnlearned onelye that presume often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to deale in higher matters, then the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and wiser sorte of men wyllingly doe, or
dare affirme certeinly vpon their knowledge.
God be mercyful vnto vs, &amp; make one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of al professions, good vsurers in the lord,
that we may lend plentyfully and freely, and
trusting in gods goodnes maye receiue reward
at his hande in that daye. And thus til then
fare you wel in Christ Iesu, to whom be al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
praise and glory for euer &amp; euer Amen.</p>
