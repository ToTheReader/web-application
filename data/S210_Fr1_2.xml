   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here commend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee Christian
Reader a table of
Repentance, now put into a
little Tract, collected from
that graue, learned, and
godly Diuine, Mr. <hi>Robert
Bolton.</hi> I could haue
beene content to haue stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the publishing thereof,
<pb facs="3"/>
vntill such time, in which
the Author might haue
beene preuailed with to
print it; for there cannot
but want much beauty and
lustre which it might haue
had, if it had beene set
forth or perused to be fitted
for the Presse by him that
first gaue life vnto it; but
being inforced to it by the
importunity of many well
affected, both farre and
neere; and I vnwilling to
haue such a pretious
fountaine sealed vp, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb facs="3"/>
the good that might
redownd to many in the
meane time by it. I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the Authors leaue
no longer to ingrosse the
same to a priuate vse, but to
impart it to a publike good,
especially considering, first,
how few are acquainted
with the right nature of
Humiliation, no more than
<hi>Nicodemus</hi> was with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation:
that though
many boast of it, few haue
it, when alasse it's plaine,
without true Repentance<note place="margin">Luke 13. 3. 5.</note>
      <pb facs="4"/>
there is no saluation. Now
this table hauing so perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously
vnfolded the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this grace: those
that haue a beginning of
it, may from hence adde an
increase to their store; and
they that want it, may here
see the way and meanes of
obtaining it. Secondly, the
extraordinary exercise of
fasting and prayer, a duty
of pretious account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Gods Children,
which hath alwayes beene
wonderfully blest with a
<pb facs="4"/>
happy successe, in so much
as albeit their ordinary
prayers returne not empty
without a blessing, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiuely
to those prayers
which are ioyned with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
they seeme barren
and blasted, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
are fruitfull and full
eared. How then could I
withhold this which by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
and the iudgement
of iudicious Christians,
cannot but bee of speciall
vse and helpe vnto such a
blessed and successefull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance?
<pb facs="5"/>
Thirdly, these
times call for it, to fast and
pray and cry mightily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God by our prayers, that
wee may stand in the gapp,
and make vp the breach:
and from this table wee
may receiue much helpe in
this particular. Wherefore
I hope I shall neede no
further perswasion for thy
gracious acceptance, than
that hereby if the fault bee
not thine owne, thou maiest
receiue much good and
comfort to thy soule:
<pb facs="5"/>
which if thou findest, giue
God the glory, the Author
thy thankes, and me
thy prayers.</p>
