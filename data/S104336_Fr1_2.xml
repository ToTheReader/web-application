   <head>W. C. ¶ To the Reader, the <hi>knowledge &amp; blessinges</hi> of the trueth.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the zeale &amp; strength of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, the Queene, was verie great to the prayse of God, and the blessednes of hir king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in bringing the Gospell by a reentrie into this lande, when the Lorde brought her, in his rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vnto the kingdome: So her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties care hath beene from time to time great also, by the preaching of the worde, by many good Lawes, by the authoritie and countenance
<pb facs="3"/>
of her Magistrates, to further the course and aduaunce the estimation thereof, to the releeuing of the people from that darkenesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they walked: that comming to the light of the trueth, they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come children of the light, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritoures of the life, which is in Christe Iesus. This hath appeared manie wayes in manie places, and namely in her Prouince of York, at a solemne assemblie of the honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and woorshipful of those partes: where after a verie learned and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Sermon, fitte for that assemblie and action, they were together par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Lordes table, to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to God their religion, to shewe their obedience to her Maiesties proceedings, and to leaue it witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the whole worlde, that they embrace the Gospell, and labour, by their example, to drawe others also
<pb facs="3"/>
to the loue of the same trueth.</p>
   <p>Touching the Sermon, For the Authors greate learning and good Spirite, it must carrie great prayse with as many as knowe him, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with them, that knowe him best. As manie as knowe him not, may in reading it, beholde the good graces of God in him, for the worke of the Gospell, and a notable spirite plainelie and soundly confuting the chiefest groundes of the Popishe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: vpon which sandie groundes notwithstanding (though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Peter to be the rocke) manie builde, not foreseeing the ruire and great fall of the house.</p>
   <p>For, Antiquitie and Generalitie are good markes of the church, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with better: alone, they may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well iustifie sinne and errour, as the Romishe Churche. Those other chiefe markes it hath not, the true
<pb facs="4"/>
and pure vse of the woorde and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, But as it wanteth the chiefest markes of the Churche of Christe, whiche deceiue not: So it hath vndoubted signes of the church of Antichrist, a doctrine preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the offices and merites of Christe, a foundation that GOD hath not layed, the persecutions of Antichrist, the blasphemies of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the marchandises of the greate whore of Babylon, and the marke of the beaste. O that they, which haue trafique with her, would come out of the Merchauntes false lighte, and might haue their eyes open, and their heartes also, to consider what stuffe they haue for their soules laid in pawne to her, for paymēt of their obedience and tribute.</p>
   <p>As for their iustification by workes and not by faith onely, it doeth plainely shewe, they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
<pb facs="4"/>
neither the imperfection of their perfectest woorkes, nor the grace of GOD, which saueth them, that beleeue thorow faith in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Christe alone. Whiche faith notwithstanding necessarily bringeth foorth good woorkes, not meritorious causes, but manifest notes to vs of our saluation in the merites of Christe Iesus the Lorde and Sauiour.</p>
   <p>In that they forbid the people to read the scriptures: they commit too too manifest violence, in withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our euidēce, in dispossessing vs of our fathers last will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How shall they demaund the legacie, that know not the gift? How shall they keepe the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that know not the couenaunt? If they say the scriptures are hard, they speake (to say no woorse) igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, of the will or power of God
<pb facs="5"/>
that either would not, or could not speake plainely, and to the hart of his people, to the vnderstanding of his children. But as the children of this worlde, they were wise in their generation: they kept that backe, which might bring the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God forward: they put the light vnder a busshell, that it might not shine to those that came into the house. Darkenes did best set out and most mainteine the workes of darkenes. Neuerthelesse, sure it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God for his glory, to shew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vnto manie, causing the light to shine out of darkenes, and bringing this euidence into light, and the light therof into the possessiō of the sonnes of men. They (as many of thē as appertaine to the holy electiō of God) haue had eyes to see, and hartes to consider, what it is to walk in darkenesse, and in the shadowe of
<pb facs="5"/>
death, what it is to lye fast bound in Babylon in miserie and yron, and what it is to dwell in the house of God, to beholde his beautie, and to visite his holy temple, to serue the Lord, and to wayte for the fulnesse of his rich mercies in Christ Iesus our Lorde. As for the sufficiencie of the Scriptures, if no man maye adde any thing, there wanteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: If no man may take any thing away, there is nothing too much. Wherevppon they that haue eyes to see and will see, may beholde that the scriptures are all sufficient and perfect: dangerous therefore is the cōtrarie doctrine of Hosius, one of the Maister Masons at the greate building of Trent: But his doctrine is lately and sufficiently confuted.</p>
   <p>Whereas they denye some, the lawful remedie against fornication, theire deeds bewray their doctrine:
<pb facs="6"/>
for they not regarding it, died in the disease, whereof they condemned the remedie.</p>
   <p>For the Inuocation of Saintes, and the doctrine of the newe media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourship to the Mediatour, which is but one, it sheweth a greate faith and trust in those Saintes, as being more readie and willing to helpe, where they promise no helpe, then God, that dooth both promise, and keepe the couenaunt of mercie made to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and his seede, euen as many of them, as seeke the face of God, and walke in newenes of life, which is the true seede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the <hi>Israell</hi> of God. But if Saintes can be neither so able, (if they be able at al) nor so willing to heare &amp; helpe vs, as is the mightie &amp; most louing God of our saluation, why doo any in a blinde nicenesse straine curtesie, to pray vnto God, which is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb facs="6"/>
and make no conscience to giue his honour to others, which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
   <p>Concerning the masse, it hath been long agoe publikelie indited, and truely condemned of grosse I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie and forgerie. Saint Paule in that greate mysterie, testifieth for himself to the Corinthians, That he added nothing to the simple institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lordes supper: but what he receiued, that he redeliuered, and what he receiued not, that he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not at all. But they of the Masse haue deliuered in charge to be bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and receiued, a bodie without quantitie or qualitie, a sacrifice for the quicke and deade, a woorship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, a reseruation, and such like su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions and abhominations, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique (I graunt) and olde borne in respect of these times: but neither they nor their mother conceiued in
<pb facs="7"/>
respect of the Apostles time.</p>
   <p>These pointes, that I haue but in a woorde or two noted, are plainely and learnedly handled in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: I trust in the mercie of God, to the redeeming of manie from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour that heard it, or, without a set iudgement against the truth shall diligently reade it. Others, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie embrace the truth, and yet in opinion rather then in reason and iudgement, (of which sort I would there were not many) may heere receiue reasons out of the woorde of god, to confirme their good zeale and iudgment, to answeare for them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues and their religion, when they shal either be asked a reason of their hope and faith of the brethren, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise shall be assayled of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie. For, good Reader, labour and prouoke others to labour, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those vnder thy charge, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
<pb facs="7"/>
to answeare for theire religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and to shew better euidence for their inheritāce in heauen, then any man can shew vppon record for his inheritance on the earth.</p>
   <p>Therfore I desire thee, not so much in these wordes, which I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in loue to the matter, &amp; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as I craue it in my heart at thy hand, to make thy fruite of this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mō first preached, to kindle flames of zeale in the hearers, to their increase of knowledg, &amp; a good conscience: And nowe allowed to the print in the same godly purpose, to nourish &amp; preserue the same zeale with great increase in all the readers, especially of those, that haue already heard it, &amp; may now reade the same againe: which will be as the former and latter raine, to make the fruite ripe, and full in Christ Iesus. Which fruite that thou maist reape, I leaue
<pb facs="8"/>
thee to the woorke and instruction of Gods holy Spirit, praying thee, when in hearing or reading these Sermons, thou findest the rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of knowledge and faith, to pray earnestly to God, that the same most rich treasure of his woorde may be plentifully bestowed vppon all men in all places farre and neare, to the euerlasting glory of Gods holy name, in gathering those, that are to be gathered and in keeping them, that are alreadie gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. Amen.</p>
