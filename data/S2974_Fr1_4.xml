   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F amongst thy leisure houres thou canst spare any for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall of this discourse, and dost looke to find somewhat in it which may serve for thy information and benefit: let me then advise thee to come unto it with an equall minde, not swayed by prejudice, but indifferently resolved to assent unto that truth which upon deliberation shall seeme most probable unto thy reason, and then I doubt not, but either thou wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> agree with mee in this assertion, or at least not thinke it to be as farre from truth, as it is from common opinion.</p>
   <p>Two cautions th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>re are which I would willingly admonish thee of in the beginning.</p>
   <p n="1">
      <pb facs="3"/> 1. That thou shouldst not here looke to find any exact, accurate Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, since this discourse was but the fruit of some lighter studies, and those too hudled up in a short time, being first thought of and finished in the space of some few weekes, and therefore you cannot in reason expect, that it should be so polished, as perhaps, the subject would require, or the leisure of the Author might have done it.</p>
   <p n="2">2. To remember that I promise onely probable arguments for the proofe of this opinion, and therefore you must not looke that every conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence should be of an undeniable dependance, or that the truth of each argument should be measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by its necessity. I grant that some Astronomicall appearances may possibly be solved otherwise then here they are. But the thing I aime at is this, that probably they may so be solved, as I have here set them downe: Which, if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as I thinke it must) then I
<pb facs="3"/> doubt not, but the indifferent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will find some satisfaction in the maine thing that is to be proved.</p>
   <p>Many ancient Philosophers of the better note, have formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended this assertion, which I have here laid downe, and it were to be wished, that some of us would more apply our endeavours unto the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of these old opinions, which though they have for a long time lien neglected by others, yet in them may you finde many truths well worthy your paines and observation. Tis a false conceit, for us to thinke, that amongst the ancient variety and search of opinions, the best hath still prevailed. Time (saith the learned <hi>Verulam)</hi> seemes to be of the nature of a river or streame, which carrieth downe to us that which is light, or blowne up, but sinketh that which is weighty and solid.</p>
   <p>It is my desire that by the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this discourse, I may raise up some more active spirit to a search
<pb facs="4"/> after other hidden and unknowne truths. Since it must needes be a great impediment unto the growth of sciences, for men still so to plod on upon beaten principles, as to be afraid of entertaining any thing that may seeme to contradict them. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnesse to take such things into examination, is one of those errours of learning in these times observed by the judicious <hi>Verulam.</hi> Question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there are many secret truths, which the ancients have passed over, that are yet left to make some of our age famous for their discovery.</p>
   <p>If by this occasion I may provoke any reader to an attempt of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I shall then thinke my selfe happy, and this worke successefull.</p>
