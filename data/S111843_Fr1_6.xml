   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Do not doubt, but many (who haue knowen my dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in times past) will wonder that (amongst so manie
excellent Musicions as be in this our contrie at this
time, and farre better furnished with learning then my
selfe,) I haue taken vpon mee to set out that in our vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
tongue, which of all other things hath beene in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
least knowen to our contrimen, and most in practise.
Yet if they would consider the reasons mouing mee
therevnto: they would not onely leaue to marueile, but
also thinke mee worthie, if not of praise, yet of pardon for
my paines. First, the earnest intreatie of my friends
daily requesting, importuning, and as it were adiuring
me by the loue of my contrie, which next vnto the glorie of God, ought to be most deere to
euery man. Which reason so often tolde and repeted to mee by them, chiefely caused mee
yeld to their honest request in taking in hand this worke which now I publish to the viewe
of the worlde: Not so much seeking thereby any name or glorie, (though no honest minde
do contemne that also, and I might more largely by other meanes and lesse labour haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained)
as in some sort to further the studies of them, who (being indewed with good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
wittes, and well inclined to learne that diuine Art of Musick) are destitute of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
masters. Lastly, the solitarie life which I lead (being compelled to keepe at home)
caused mee be glad to finde any thing wherein to keepe my selfe exercised for the benefite
of my contrie. But as concerning the booke it selfe, if I had before I began it, imagined
halfe the paines and labour which it cost mee, I would sooner haue beene perswaded to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
thing, then to haue taken in hand such a tedious peece of worke, like vnto a great Sea,
which the further I entred into, the more I sawe before mee vnpast: So that at length
dispairing euer to make an end (seeing that growe so bigg in mine hands, which I thought
to haue shut vp in two or three sheetes of paper,) I layde it aside, in full determination to
haue proceeded no further, but to haue left it off as shamefully as it was foolishly begonne.
But then being admonished by some of my friends, that it were pittie to lose the frutes of
the imployment of so manie good houres, and how iustly I should be condemned of ignorant
presumpsion, in taking that in hand which I could not performe, if I did not go forwarde:
I resolued to endure whatsoeuer paine, labour, losse of time and expence, and what not?
rather then to leaue that vnbrought to an end, in the which I was so farre ingulfed.
Taking therefore those precepts which being a childe I learned, and laying them togither
in order, I began to compare them with some other of the same kinde, set downe by some
late writers: But then was I in a worse case then before. For I found such diuersitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, that I knew not which part said truest, or whome I might best beleeue. Then
was I forced to runne to the workes of manie, both strangers and English men (whose la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
togithers with their names had beene buried with mee in perpetuall obliuion, if it
had not beene for this occasion) for a solution and clearing of my doubt. But to my great
griefe, then did I see the most part of mine owne precepts false and easie to be confuted by
the workes of <hi>Tauerner, Fairfax, Cooper,</hi> and infinite more, whose names it would be
too tedious to set downe in this place. But what labour it was to tomble, tosse, &amp; search so
manie bookes, &amp; with what toyle &amp; wearinesse I was enforced to cōpare the parts for try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the valure of some notes, (spending whole daies, yea &amp; manie times weekes for the
demonstration of one example, which one would haue thought might in a moment haue
been set down,) I leaue to thy discretion to consider: and none can fully vnderstande, but
he who hath had or shall haue occasion to do the like. As for the methode of the booke,
<pb facs="4"/>
although it be not such as may in euery point satisfie the curiositie of <hi>Dichotomistes:</hi> yet
is it such as I thought most conuenient for the capacitie of the learner. And I haue had
an especiall care, that nothing should be set out of his owne place, but that it which should
serue to the vnderstanding of that which followeth should be set first. And as for the
definition, diuision, partes, &amp; kindes of Musicke, I haue omitted them as things onely ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
to content the learned, and not for the instruction of the ignorant. Thus hast thou
the reasons which moued mee to take in hand &amp; go forward with the booke. The paines
of making whereof, though they haue beene peculier to mee, &amp; onely to mee: yet will the
profit redound to a great number. And this much I may boldly affirme, that any of but
meane capacitie, so they can but truely sing their tunings, which we commonly call the sixe
notes, or <hi>vt, re, mi, fa, sol, la,</hi> may without any other help sauing this booke, perfectly learn
to sing, make discant, and set partes well and formally togither. But seeing in these latter
daies &amp; doting age of the worlde, there is nothing more subiect to calumnie &amp; backbiting
then that which is most true &amp; right: and that as there be many who will enter into the
reading of my booke for their instruction: so I doubt not but diuerse also will read it, not
so much for anie pleasure or profit they looke for in it, as to finde some thing whereat to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
or take occasion of backbyting. Such men I warne, that if in friendship they will (ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publikly or priuately) make me acquainted with any thing in the booke, which either
they like not or vnderstand not: I will not onely be content to giue them a reason (and if
I cannot, to turne to their opinion,) but also thinke my selfe highly beholding to them.
But if any man, either vpon mallice, or for ostentation of his owne knowledge, or for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
(as who is more bolde then blinde bayerd) do either in huggermugger or openly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate
that which either he vnderstandeth not, or then maliciously wresteth to his own
sense, he (as <hi>Augustus</hi> said by one, who had spoken euill of him) shall finde that I haue a
tongue also: and that <hi>me remorsurum petit,</hi> He snarleth at one who will bite againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I haue saide nothing without reason, or at least confirmed by the authorities of the
best, both schollers &amp; practicioners. There haue also been some, who (knowing their own
insufficiencie, and not daring to disallow, nor being able to improue any thing in the booke)
haue neuerthelesse gone about to discredite both mee and it another waie, affirming that
I haue by setting out thereof maliciously gone about to take awaye the liuings from a nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of honest poore men, who liue (and that honestly) vpon teaching not halfe of that which
in this booke may be found. But to answere those malicious caterpillers, who liue vpon the
paines of other men,) this booke will be so farre from the hinderance of anie, that by the
contrarie, it will cause those whome they alledge to be thereby damnified, to be more able
to giue reason for that which they do: Whereas before they either did it at hap-hazerd, or
for all reasons alledged, that they were so taught. So that if any at all owe mee any thanks
for the great paines which I haue taken, they be in my iudgement, those who taught that
which they knew not, and may here if they will learne. But if the effect do not answere to
my good meaning▪ and if manie do not reape that benefit which I hoped; yet there wil be
no reason why I should be blamed, who haue done what I could, and giuen an occasion to
others of better iudgement and deeper skill then my selfe to doe the like. And as for
those ignorant Asses, who take vpon them to lead others, none being more blinde then
themselues, and yet without any reason, before they haue seene their workes, wil condemne
other men, I ouerpasse them, as being vnworthie to be nominated, or that any man should
vouchsafe to aunswere them: for they be in deede such as doing wickedly hate the light
for feare they should be espyed. And so (gentle Reader) hoping by thy fauourable cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
to auoide both the malice of the enuious &amp; the temeritie of the ignorant, wishing
thee the whole profit of the booke and all perfection in thy studies, I rest.</p>
