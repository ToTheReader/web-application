   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hy cease you maister Gale? vvhat kepeth backe the publishing of your iiij. bookes, vvhich vvith so great trauaile, and perfite skyll you haue so happelye finished? Doth feare of Sycophants and detracting ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues astoyne you? Or the mistrust of seuere iudgemēt at the learned, kepe back your honest attempt? Let these be no impediments I shall desyre you, but banishe feare, and put from you mistrust. And as touching the maleuolent detra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctors, it either nedeth not, or helpeth not to stād of thē in dread. Apes vvil euer haue apishe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, vvith mocking, movving, &amp; grinning at euery persō do vvhat you cā. I my self haue som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat tasted of their curtesie, and therefore can better vtter their nature vnto you. They be such as for the more part are ignoraūt thē selues, or if they beare the face of learning, yet be they arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant &amp; loiter in idlenes: &amp; therfore to maintein their name, do carpe and reprehend other mens good labours, thinking thereby among the rude
<pb facs="5"/> multitude to get them more fame and honour. These haue not so muche hindered me vvith their serpentine tongues, as made me among the vvise and learned, of greater estimation. For although it be a common sayeng, yet is it moste true, VIRESCIT VVLNERE VIR<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>TVS. But vvyll you eschevve their sting and poyson? Be idle then, loyter, regarde neyther your duetie to God, nor yet to your countrey. this must of force be your shift, vvhich hovv ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nest it is, be you the Iudge your self. But you vvil saye peraduenture, you are armed against this sort sufficiently not regarding their fors: and yet you dread the censure, and iudgement of the graue and learned. Surelye these you need least of all other to feare. For lyke as Apes can do nothing but apishely: so vvyll the learned do nothing but learnedly, discretlye, and vvith great aduisement. They consider by theyr ovvne trauailles, that it is no trifling, but great paynes to vvryte in any arte or science. And vvhen they reade other mens labours, and fynde perhappes some errours, they reiect not the vvorke, they deface not the authour, but think vvith them selues HOMINIS EST ERRARE. And if the errours be such as are
<pb facs="5"/> thought not tolerable, they vvill not currishely checke: but curteously admonishe, or els vvith theyr pen spedely amend it. Seing therfore that chattering layes may not preuayle against you: and that I haue (as I suppose) deliuered you of the mistrust you had in the learned: deferre no longer tyme, nor make no moore delayes. But since your countrey craue it, your approued frends earnestly looke for it, and your duetye to both these require it: Kepe these bookes no len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in darknes, but let them taste of lyght. And as touching your request in your letters sent to me, to peruse &amp; read your copies, to alter, chaūge and adde as I shoulde thinke good, I haue some vvhat satisfied your expectation herein. And first I see your great diligence in reading your authours in Chirurgerie, as Brunus, Theodori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Rolandus, Launfrancus, Rogerus, Bartalpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, Guido de Cauliaco VVilhelmus Ier. Bruns<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>svvike, Vigo and other. And do also consider vvhat paine &amp; great difficultie it vvas, to collect so perfite vvorkes, out of so imperfite authours. I speake it not to their dispraise, they vvere in the tyme of ignoraunce. But in my simple iudgement, if the follovving of Galene, Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene, Mesue, and others, of vvhome in your
<pb facs="6"/> bokes you make so often mentiō had not stayed you, and your long experience conducted you, you should of force haue fallene into the huge pitte of cloudy &amp; most grosse errours. Amonge vvhich these follovving are not the greatest, but yet not sufferable in any case. For vvhat man is so mad knovvinge the nerues to be the cause of fealing, vvyll in vvoundes of the nerues bydde stitch the same? vvho is so bolde in great vvoūds in vvhich there is fixed splentes, shot, arrovve heades, and such lyke, to geue the Pacient slepe drinkes as they call them? vvho is so rude in vvounds vvith gonshot made thorovv a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as to dravve an hearinge rope through the vvounde? Or vvhat ignoraunce appeareth in them all, in confounding the names of diseases and miscalling of simples? Doth not Guido the best of these authours rehearsed, cal oedema, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimia? Erysipelas, hirisipela? scirrhus, scliros? and that vvhich I most meruayle at, that he calleth estiomenon (vvhich is herpes exedens) mortem et dissipationem membri, and he interpreteth estiomenon, quasi hominis hostem. Hovv farre from the matter it is, and hovv ridiculous an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, let the learned iudge. I lothe to vvrite them, &amp; repent the lost tyme in reading
<pb facs="6"/> them. But these for a tast I offer, vvhereby gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reader thou maist the better iudge &amp; esteme the labours of the author our contrymā. VVho for hys countryes sake haue spared no tyme to trauaile, nor regarded his great expence. Yea &amp; that vvhich is more, not his febled old corps vvhi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch is very vnapt to take so great a thing in hād. This for my part I dare bouldlye affyrme, that neuer in Englishe vvas so perfite vvorkes in Chirurgerie set oute: and I dought vvhether in any other tounge there be in all poyntes any vvork extant in Chirurgerie vvhich vvith these may be compared. For if vve shall loke first of his institution in Chirurgerie, hovv pithylye plainely &amp; compendiously doth he set out the hole body of the art, shovving the definitions, di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uisions &amp; also apt names of tumors against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vvoundes, vlcers, fractures, dislocations, and other like? Hovv diligently instructeth he the student in Chirurgery first in the theoricke and then in the practicke part? Then the student being thus trained vp &amp; novv made apt to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, he sendeth him to his Enchiridion in vvhi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch is set out the method of curing vvoūds both in the similer and instrumental parts, and also such apte medicines as are for thē conueninent.
<pb facs="7"/> He doth moreouer shevv the cure of such acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents as do often chaunce to vvoundes. Last, he doth open the curing of fractures and disloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Furthermore he hath finished a treatise of curyng vvoundes made vvith gonshot, in vvhich learnedly he doth cōfute the long recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued errour that hath ben mainteined for truth, hovve that such vvoundes shuld be venemous. Hovv pleasant this argument is, &amp; also {pro}fita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I refer it to thy iudgemēt (gentle reader) mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusting nothing, but vvhen you shall vvay his arguments, vvith theirs of the contrarye parte, you vvyll be vvholly of myne opinion. And yet this good Gale stayeth not here, nor is fatigate and vveried vvith these great paines: but hath also finished a golden vvorke, vvhich he calleth his Antidotarie: in vvhiche, is comprehended the treasures of Chirurgerie. There shal the Chi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rurgian hauing need of medicines vvhich do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, attracte, resolue, mollifie, suppurate, mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, incarnate, conglutinate, cicatrize (and vvhat is els requisite to be vsed in the art) finde abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, asvvel of those vvhich are called simple, as also of them vvhich because they stand in the mixture of diuers simples, are named compoūd.
<pb facs="7"/> There shall he also vvith smale payne, &amp; great gaine receyue in one houre, that vvhich in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeres trauaile vvith no smale expence, this Gale hath inuented and found out. These boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes are novv perfitly finished. He hath more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer in his hands diuers other vvorks (as I heare) vnfinished, as a booke intituled a compendious Method of healing tumours against nature: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, of the true and perfite cure of all kynde of vlcers. Also a nevve translation of Guido de Cauliaco, vvith certaine briefe cōmentaries vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same. Besides these: there be other, vvhose titles I do not knovve. Therefore that these maye also come to thy vse, I shall require thee to shevve a gratefull heart, and thankfully receyue that, vvhiche he hathe vvith payne finished, and is freely vvithout revvarde offered. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delyghted vvith the argumentes of these bookes, I am digressed from ansvveryng the other part of your letter Maister Gale. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired me, that since I vvas so earnest vvith you for the publishing of your bookes: that I vvould vvryte somevvhat in the prayse &amp; commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chirurgerie. VVhiche thinge in myne opinion vvere superfluous, vvhen that there can be no greater prayse then is vvritten in
<pb facs="8"/> your vvorkes considering that through the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this arte the vvoundid is made hole, the broken bones vnited, the Iointes being out of their naturall feat, reducid into their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, the hough and painful tumores expelled, &amp; the virulent &amp; maligne vlcers (vvhich doth eate and deuoure the members of man no lesse then mothes do clothes, &amp; fire that is put to it) are vanquished and ouercom. Be not these great benefites? and such as nedeth not the cōmenda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiō of other? But yet if these vvil not satisfie you, at the next setting out of other of your labours if this my vveake body may recouer strength (I) vvil to my povver satisfie your expectation. In the mean time: I bid you vvel to fare, &amp; remēber your vvhyte heares are massengers to admonish you that you must leaue this vvorld, &amp; repaire to the heauenly Chirurgian Christ. And therefore hast you for the time that remaineth, &amp; finishe those vvorkes vvhich you haue in your handes. Againe fare you vvell: and loue your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyngham as you haue begonne.</p>
