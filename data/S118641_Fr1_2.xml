   <p>Some say there be certaine formes of speech farre vnworthy the pen of a Preacher. I grant that somethings be much vnworthy, both my <hi>writing</hi> &amp; many their <hi>hearing;</hi> howsoeuer the Schismatikes thinke the things<note place="margin">Ezec. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> 5. 16. 17. 5 16. 17. 25. 26. &amp; 23. 3. 8. &amp;c.</note> not vnworthy their <hi>Doing. Ezekiel</hi> was forced to speake more grosly then he would; when from filthines of the body, he would delineate the soules vncleannes for Idolatry. The like also did Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> Let the<note place="margin">Reu. 17. 4</note> Factious be ashamed of <hi>so</hi> doing, and
<pb facs="4"/>
we will be ashamed of so writing and hearing.</p>
   <p>Some say that in the Diologicall speeches, I seeme to point at certaine particular persons, vpon whom some of my speeches cannot be truely faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. I grant; first that I haue aymed at some particular persons, so well as they in their Dialogues of the <hi>Barwicke Souldier,</hi> the Host and Chaplaine &amp;c. with many such Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinicall libels, haue done right often. But as their magnaticall one-eard Inuectiues were set on fire from hell, for destroying the Church peace, so, I doubt not but my feruent breathings, will be found to haue beene kindled by the coales of the Altar, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of Schisme Let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the parable of <hi>Iothams</hi> trees, that gathered together for electing a King; when as none but the brabling<note place="margin">Iudg. 9. 8. &amp;c.</note> Bramble would accept of the offer. That parable will fit them, as if it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="4"/>
had propounded vnto them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I answere, though all there spoken, cannot bee auerred of euery person in a faction, (by reason no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is at vnity in it selfe) yet it may sit close to some other they thinke not of, in the same faction: and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially,</hi> though <hi>not actually,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the leud spirit of that whole Corporation.</p>
   <p>Besides, to such as say, that <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme</hi> was long since confuted by the Fathers, and what neede <hi>Clapham</hi> meddle with it, &amp;c? I answer: first by Retortion: So <hi>Donatisme, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme, Reordination Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, Atheisme &amp;c.</hi> were confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Fathers (so was the very adultery, murder, &amp;c.) what need a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preacher then iterate these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? The answer to the last, will fit<note place="margin">So M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. More in his tables doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</note> the first. Secondly, I answer: Our heretikes haue added vnto the anciēt teaching such conclusions as of old
<pb facs="5"/>
were not dream'd of. And had I not<note place="margin">one Arrian Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, &amp; ano ther, a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Arrian, both burnt at <hi>Norwich</hi>
      </note> by trauaile abroad found out that, I might seeme vnto many to speake but in darke parables. Search all the bookes that I haue writ, and that is from <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1595. hitherto, 1608.) and consider if still I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noked not all the Factious, specially on the right hand, howsoeuer hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vnanswered of any. VVhich doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les they would haue done, had I not too truely pressed them. Thirdly I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, I know none that condemne my labours, of that kind, but suchas be either <hi>open</hi> foes, or <hi>hypocriticall</hi> brethren. If open foes, then no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile though they ball and barke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me, whenas they raile against the whole body of the Church. If <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall</hi> brethren, who let some Factious haue their hearts, and for maintenance sake let vs haue their bodies onely, I waie not of their doome no more then of <hi>Laodiceans</hi> deuotiō:
<pb facs="5"/>
for what is such an Hypocrite, but an <hi>Ambo</hi> between two, a bifronted <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> looking two wayes, and a <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> faithfull to none? The opposite side do spit at them, and can we do lesse then spurne them?</p>
   <p>In this booke is acted <hi>Errour on the Left hand.</hi> In the fore-front wherof I haue Marshalled the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist,</hi> as one who primordially through a frozen security, did decline towards <hi>Libertinisme,</hi> establishing such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, as vnto flesh and blood might be most acceptable. Vnto which side also, if I had reduced the carnall Familist, (for there be a second sort more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall) I suppose I had done him no wrong. But sit as they shall, naught be they all, and it is the naughtines of their opinions that I specially dart at.</p>
   <p>As for the <hi>Male-content,</hi> I make him the <hi>Nicka-fidge</hi> here (running from one faction vnto another) as I
<pb facs="6"/>
did the <hi>Flyer</hi> in the former. VVho al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so here doth at last meet with <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity;</hi> and so (after some dehatemēt) become an honest man. Worse I wish to no <hi>Flyer,</hi> nor a straw the worse to any Mal-contented. <hi>Dei est non er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare, hominis errare, insipientis perseuerare in errore.</hi>

      <l>Great <note n="a" place="margin">Ioue the short of Iehoue.</note>
         <hi>Ioue</hi> himselfe is onely free from falt:</l>
      <l>The rightest man with <hi>Israel</hi> doth halt,</l>
      <l>But froward fooles in sollie will perseuer;</l>
      <l>Though tentimes braid, a foole he wil be euer</l>
   </lg>
   <p>If thou canst well relish the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but not the <hi>Maner</hi> of handling: (for euery one doth quickly conceit a Dialogicall <hi>Prosopopeia</hi>) I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thee to my <hi>Antidoton,</hi> my <hi>New Ierushalem,</hi> my <hi>Manuall of the Bibles doctrine,</hi> together with diuers of the heades, sparsed in my <hi>Bibles briefe,</hi> in my poeme <hi>Aelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> and fiue parts of my labours of <hi>Salamons Song;</hi> not to mention
<pb facs="6"/>
any of my imperfect workes printed abroad ouer immaturely.</p>
   <p>But to helpe the slowe conceited (for these two bookes of Dialogues were penned, almost altogether for such about the citie of London, who are ordinarily toyled with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious) it must first be obserued that the maine thing I driue at, is, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the principall argument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by euery sort of Schismatique doth fabricate vnto himselfe a new society or Church. Secondly, to shewe, how that principall argument is laide at home by our <hi>Mal-content,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon others build their rendings from vs. Thirdly, to disclose such their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumēt, by that forme of introducting them, in their mutuall brablings, wherein, as sometimes one of them confuteth another, so, much of their extrauagant speech is so absurd, <hi>Vt recitare, idem est quod refutare,</hi> As the bare repetition is a sufficient
<pb facs="7"/>
refutation. Lastly, my drift is, in the person of <hi>Mediocrity,</hi> to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish a <hi>Meane;</hi> Which held and kept according to knowledge may keepe our people from flying out into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, as they would auoide the grosse and leaud consequents insuing their breach from vs.</p>
   <p>Had not some learned (in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) obserued so many points (at least) in my former booke it had not obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a <hi>passe</hi> to the presse: For sure I am, that it stood vpon more sufficient examination, then all the books which besides I haue diuulged. So much is sufficient for reasonable spirits. As for such as be wilfully malitious and ignorant, nothing will content them; <note n="b" place="margin">Pro. 26. 4.</note> Neither will I answere such a foote to his full, lest I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like him. <hi>Neque Iupiter omnibus pluens placet, neque abstinens.</hi> The Lord deliuer our Church from euill.</p>
