   <p>COurteous Reader, hauing spoken of the first foundation of that yet renowned castle of <hi>Windsor</hi> by <hi>Aruiragus</hi> king of <hi>Britain,</hi> &amp; finished by that succeeding prince of worthy memory famous king <hi>Arthur;</hi> I thought good (being intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by some of my honourable-minded Friends, not to let slip so good and fit an occasion, by reason that there yet remaines in this doubtfull age of opinions, a controuersie of that esteemed Prince of <hi>Brittaine</hi>) to write not according to ages obliuiō, but directed onely by our late <hi>Historiographers</hi> of England, who no doubt haue taken great paines in the searching foorth of the truth of that first <hi>Christian worthie:</hi> and wheras (I know not
<pb n="35" facs="21"/> directed by what blindnes) there haue bene some Writers (as I thinke enemies to truth) that in their erronious censures haue thought no such mā euer to be liuing; How fabulous that should seeme to be, I leaue to the iudgement of the best readers, who know for certaine, that that neuer dead Prince of memory, is more beholding to the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Romane,</hi> the <hi>Scot,</hi> the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> yea to the <hi>Greekes</hi> themselues, then to his owne Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who haue fully and wholly set foorth his fame and liuely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: then how shamelesse is it for some of vs, to let slip the truth▪ of this <hi>Monarch?</hi> And for more confirmatiō of the truth, looke but in the Abbey of <hi>Westminster</hi> at Saint <hi>Edwards</hi> shrine, there shalt thou see the print of his royal Seale in red wax clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Berrill, with this inscription, <hi>Patricius Arthurus Gallie, Germaniae, Daciae Imperator.</hi> At <hi>Douer</hi> likewise you may see Sir <hi>Gawins</hi> skull and <hi>Cradocks</hi> mantle: At <hi>Winchester,</hi> a Citie well knowne in England, his famous round <hi>Table,</hi> with many other notable monuments too long to rehearse: Besides I my selfe haue seen imprinted, a french Pamphlet of the armes of king <hi>Arthur,</hi> and his renowmed valiant Knights, set in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours by the Heraulds of <hi>France:</hi> which charge of impression would haue been too great, otherwise I had inserted them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in his Life and Actions: but (gentle Reader) take this my paines gratefully, and I shal hereafter more willingly striue to employ my simple wit to thy better gratulation; I haue here set downe (turned from <hi>French</hi> prose into <hi>English</hi> meeter) the words of the Herald vnder the arms of that worthy <hi>Brittaine.</hi>
