      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing receiued this Letter following out of <hi>Barbary,</hi> from an honest Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Merchant, who hath long time so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourned there, very religious, wise and discrect, and so knowne among the Merchants: with whom also my selfe conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed many moneths, during my abode in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; and therafter shewing it as a matter of newes to some friends, I was at length importuned to make it common, in respect of the noueliy: <hi>est natura hominis nouitatis auida;</hi> and (as the Prouerbe is) <hi>Africa semper aliquid apportat noui.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to satisfie, if not all (which) was wont to bee the Poets taske: <hi>Populo vt placerent quas fecisset fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulas);</hi> yet at leastwise those, who haue nought else<note place="margin">Act. 17. 21</note> to doe, (like those Athenians in the Acts) <hi>but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to tel or heare some newes:</hi> Howbeit, I hope, it mayserue to some good vse also for vs Christians of these last daies, <hi>vpon whom the ends of the world are come:</hi> to see how busily the Diuell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">Forty yeers (sayth this new sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish king or Prophet of his) &amp; then Christ must come to iudgement, as in the letter.</note> his last part, now in this last age of the world, &amp; playeth his prize, for that he knoweth he hath but a short time, 40. yeers by his own calculation, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before hand his owne condemnation. <hi>For the Lord hath so done his marueilous workes that they ought to be had in remembrance:</hi> And so
<pb facs="3"/>
ought the deuils workes too, though in another kind, &amp; a <hi>Latere</hi> (as I may say) for he is the Ape &amp; imitator of God <hi>(transforming himselfe into an Angel of light)</hi> neither can he doe any thing of himselfe, but by Gods permission as he hath power, commission, and authority from him. And therein also many times he plaieth the <hi>Mountibank,</hi> obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for true and <hi>effectual workings</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle tearmeth them) many false and feigned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions. And whether true or false, his end is still to deceiue, and vent his lying arts, doctrines of deuils; and therefore in scripture worthily stiled <hi>the father of lies:</hi> and his miracles, which hee worketh for confirmation thereof, <hi>lying wonders.</hi> And by these his sleighty conueiances, sometimes winding heere, sometimes there, hath this subtle serpent gon frō about time to time, compassing the earth, to and fro, and walking in it to deceiue the world. And not onely the world (I meane the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of disobedience and misbeleefe) <hi>but if it</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 24</note>
      <hi>were possible euen the very elect.</hi> And such must bee (or rather is) the comming of <hi>Antichrist</hi> in this last age of the world whereof we haue beene so long since forewarned: <hi>(little children it is the last time &amp;c.) Whose comming</hi> (as the Apostle<note place="margin">Ioh. 2. 18. 2.Thess. 2. 9.</note> describeth it) <hi>is by the effectual working of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than with all power and signes and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders &amp;c. And therefore God shall send them strong delusions that they should beleeue lies: that all they might bee damned which beleeue not the truth &amp;c.</hi> O the miserable estate of al mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belieuers,
<pb facs="3"/>
whom the deuil hath thus blinded to their vtter <hi>condemnation, which sleepeth not.</hi> And such is the state and condition of these miserable Moores giuen ouer beyond measure, to these idle &amp; <hi>superstitious vanities</hi> (so <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth them) <hi>I hate all them that hold of superstitious vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>) blind prophesies dreams, necromancy and such like, wherein these Saints professe themselues, and hold the people in such awe for feare of their curses (which many times fall out accordingly: (the deuill working together) as if they were Popes, such is their soueraignety. As by this example yee may see, one of these fanaticall Saints now become a King. <hi>Scilicet his Babilon dextris:</hi> euen by these and such like arts, did <hi>that spirituall Babylon,</hi> at the first <hi>that great Whore</hi> spoken of in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,<note place="margin">Reue 17. 1. 2. Thess. 2. 3.</note>
      <hi>that man of sinne, the sonne of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now sitting as God in the Temple of God, and shewing himselfe that he is God</hi>) vnder the like pretence come to the height of his supremacy, not only making himselfe a King, but insulting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer Kings and Emperours: <hi>not caring</hi> (as the prouerb is) <hi>neither for King nor Keiser,</hi> but <hi>exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himselfe against God, and all that is called God:</hi> hat is to say Kings and Princes. <hi>Be wife now therfore ye Kings,</hi> whether Christian or Heathen, the vse is generall to al, beware of these Saints for all their hypocriticall shew of Holiness. Saints in profession but Deuils in practise. <hi>His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse catexochen;</hi> euen that holy one of Rome, (for so the word Saint signifieth: a Holy one)
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>nam si hic mali est quidquam (I</hi> say no more) they are capital enemies to the thrones of Kings. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance this Saint who (forsooth) vnder a colour of Holinesse, and simplicity, armed with most strong delusions, euen from the Deuill himselfe) yee see what wonders he hath wrought against <hi>Mully Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> yea and what greater hee promiseth: <hi>operae pretium est audire.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But when that bridge appeareth in the mouth of the Straights, as he prophesieth, and he with all his troupes ariue in the Popes Dominions (the Pope and he in the Lists together) then we shal see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deuil is the stronger. The Lord preserue his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their deuillish delusions. And so after this long Preface (too long I must needs confeffe for so short a discourse, but that I tould not wel cut it shorter) I referre it to the censure of the wise to make vse of: beeing the chiefe and maine motiue, with the aduise and approbation of some godly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Preachers and others, why <hi>I</hi> haue published it, Which (if I finde acceptable) <hi>I</hi> may (perhaps) bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to reuise some papers of my owne, all this while throwne aside, as touching the affaires and slate of that country, falling within the compasse of my daily obseruation, during that my imployment<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> with other accounts of my time not altogether idlie spent there, hauing now, but too good a leasure (since the losse of so hopefull a Maister) for such a purpose, God send vs an other comforter. And so once more farewel gentle Reader.</p>
