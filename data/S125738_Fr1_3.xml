   <head>The Preface to the READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN</hi> I first debated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued with my self to write this small Treatise, diuers obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and hinderances rose vp and stood before mee, ready to take my hand from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as mine insufficiency in Art, and my disability to instruct others, which stand in neede my selfe of a continuall instruction; but taking a more strict Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey both of mine owne fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and other sufferance, I found me entered so farre
<pb facs="3"/> within the compasse of a known and approued experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that howsoeuer there might be rudenesse or rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in my labour; yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse there should not want truth nor profit. Truth, which might adorn &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie those weake Buildings, which are often shak't wi h the Stormes and Tempests of these worldly casualties; and Profit, which might inrich and support the minde, when at any time it beganne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline or bend vnder the griping hand of that which wee call Misfortune. This expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of euils became vnto me both a spurre to set mee
<pb facs="3"/> forward in that <hi>Cariere</hi> which I haue now finisht (in this little Booke:) and also an Armor to defend me against the Bitings and Bitternesse both of Curiosity &amp; Censure.</p>
   <p>A Patron or Protector to the Work I durst not assume; first, in respect I held it much too hūble for those which are both Great and Good; and next, in respect I knew it much and precious for those which are euill, proud and disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Bookes now adayes (for the most part) come to their Patrons like Citations, from which men couet to shrinke and hide themselues; or else like Briefes, which howsoeuer
<pb facs="4"/> they exhort to Charitie, yet they find few charitable: now that neither of these effects may worke vpon this, I send it thus naked into the world, and indeed would onely haue it beare it selfe, of it selfe. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications which come from loue, many mistake, and those mistakings breed Grudgings not Gratitudes: those which proceed from desire of Gaine, are sordid and Base, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they may bee gilded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, yet the poison of contempt is easie to bee tasted. Both these also I will now shunne, and onely wish them that are sicke and stand in neede, to try my Physicke; those which
<pb facs="4"/> are in health and sound, may stay till disease come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: those which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, that is, halfe sicke, halfe sound, may (if they please) try some Medicines: there is no doubt but they wil worke much, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, or at least to procure a preuention. I haue tryed thē, must loue them; for I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered by them. They which excercise the like, will (no doubt) find the like: they which are fearefull and dare not; or foolish and will not, let them still liue and languish; for they are neither worthy of Fathers, Mothers, no nor any good Physicians blessing.</p>
