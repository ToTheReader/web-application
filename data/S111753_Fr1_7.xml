   <head>¶Eloquence first
geuen by God, after loste by man,
and laste repayred by God
agayne.</head>
   <p>MAn (in whom is poured
the breathe of lyfe) was made at hys
firste beinge an euerliuynge Creature,
vnto the likenes of God, endued with
reason, and appoynted Lorde ouer all
other thinges liuing. But after the fall
of our firste father, Sinne so crepte in,
that our knowledge was muche darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and by corruption of this oure fleshe, mans reason and
entendement were bothe ouerwhelmed. At what time God
beinge sore greued with the folye of one man, pitied of his
mere good uesse, the whole state and posteritie of mankinde.
And therefore (wher as throughe the wicked suggestion of
our ghostelye enemye, the ioyfull fruition of Goddes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
was altogether loste:) it pleased our heauenly father to
repayre mankynde of hys free mercye, and to graunte an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerliuynge
enheritaunce vnto all suche as woulde by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante
fayth seeke earnestlye thereafter, Longe it was ere
that man knewe himselfe, beinge destitute of Gods grace,
so that al thinges waxed sauage, the earth vntilled, societye
neglected, Goddes will not knowen, man againste manne,
one agaynste another, and all agaynste order. Some liued
by spoyle, some like brute Beastes grased vpon the ground,
some wente naked, some romed lyke woodoses, none did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
thing by reason, but most did what they could, by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode.
None almoste considered the euerliuynge God, but
all liued moste communely after their owne luste. By death
they thoughte that all thinges ended, by life they loked for
none other liuynge. None remembred the true obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of wedlocke, none tendered the education of their chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
lawes were not regarded, true dealinge was not once
<pb facs="6"/>
vsed. For vertue, vyce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>are place, for right &amp; equitie, might
vsed aucthoritie. And therfore where as man through rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
might haue vsed order, manne throughe follye fell into
erroure. And thus for lacke of skill, and for wante of grace,
euyll so preuayled, that the Deuyll was mooste estemed, and
GOD either almost vnknowen emonge theim all, or
elles nothinge feared emonge so manye. Therefore euen
nowe when man was thus paste all hope of amendemente,
God still tendering his owne workemanship, stirred vp his
faythfull and elect, to perswade with reason, all men to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietye.
And gaue his appoynted ministers knowledge bothe
to se the natures of men, and also graunted them the gift of
vtteraunce, that they myghte wyth ease wynne folke at
their will, and frame theim by reason to all good order.</p>
   <p>And therefore, where as Menne lyued Brutyshlye
in open feldes, hauing neither house to shroude them in, nor
attyre to clothe their backes, nor yet anye regarde to seeke
their best auayle: these appoynted of God called theim to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by vtteraunce of speache, and perswaded with them
what was good, what was badde, and what was gainefull
for mankynde. And althoughe at firste, the rude coulde
hardelie learne, &amp; either for straungenes of the thing, would
not gladlye receyue the offer, or els for lacke of knoweledge
could not perceyue the goodnes: yet being somewhat drawē
and delighted with the pleasaūtnes of reason, &amp; the swete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of vtteraūce: after a certaine space, thei became through
nurture and good aduisement, of wilde, sober: of cruel, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:
of foles, wise: and of beastes, men. Suche force hath the
tongue, and such is the power of eloquence and reason, that
most men are forced euen to yelde in that, whiche most stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
againste their will. And therfore the Poetes do feyne
that Hercules being a man of greate wisdome, had all men
lincked together by the eares in a chaine, to draw them and
leade them euen as he lusted. For his witte was so greate,
his tongue so eloquente, &amp; his experience suche, that no one
man was able to withstand his reason, but euerye one was
rather driuen to do that whiche he woulde, and to wil that
<pb facs="6"/>
whiche he did, agreing to his aduise both in word &amp; worke,
in all that euer they were able.</p>
   <p>Neither can I see that menne coulde haue bene broughte
by anye other meanes to lyue together in felowshyppe of
life, to mayntayne Cities, to deale trulye, and willyngelye
to obeye one another, if menne at the firste hadde not by Art
and eloquence perswaded that, which they ful oft found out
by reason. For what manne I praye you beinge better abl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
to maintayne him selfe by valeante courage, then by liuing
in base subiection: would not rather loke to rule like a lord,
then to lyue lyke an vnderlynge: if by reason he were not
perswaded that it behoueth euerye man to lyue in his owne
vocation, and not to seke anye hygher rowme, then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
he was at the first appoynted? Who woulde digge and
delue from morne till euening? Who woulde trauaile and
toyle with the swea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e of his browes? Yea, who woulde for
his kynges pleasure aduenture and hasarde his life, if witte
hadde not so wonne men, that they thought nothing more
nedefull in this world, nor anye thing wherunto they were
more bounden: then here to liue in their duty, and to traine
their whole lyfe accordynge to their callynge. Therfore
where as menne are in manye thynges weake by Nature,
and subiecte to much infirmitye: I thinke in this one point
they passe all other Creatures liuynge, that they haue the
gift of speache and reason.</p>
   <p>And emonge all other, I thinke him most worthye fame,
and emongest menne to be taken for halfe a God, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
dothe chiefelye, and aboue all other, excell menne, wherin
men do excell beastes. For he that is emonge the reasonable,
of all moste reasonable, and emonge the wittye, of all moste
wittye, and emonge the eloquente, of all mooste eloquente:
him thincke I emonge all menne, not onelye to be taken for
a singuler manne, but rather to be counted for halfe a God.
For in sekynge the excellencye hereof, the soner he draweth
to perfection, the nygher he commeth to GOD who is
the chiefe wisdome, and therefore called God, because he is
most wise, or rather wisdome it selfe.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>Nowe then seinge that God geueth his heauenlye grace
vnto all suche as call vnto him with stretched handes, and
humble harte, neuer wantynge to those, that wante not to
them selues: I purpose by his grace and especial assistence,
to set forthe preceptes of eloquence, and to shewe what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
the wise haue vsed in handeling of their matters,
that the vnlearned by seinge the practise of other, may haue
some knowledge them selues, and learne by their
neyghbours deuise, what is necessarye
for them selues in their owne
case.</p>
