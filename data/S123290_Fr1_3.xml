For though his tongue was as the Pen of a ready Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the hand of Christ who guided

Jn which labour both of humility and love, your <hi>Ladyship</hi> did that honour unto him which <hi>Baruch</hi> (thogh great and Noble) did but receive in the

<pb facs="6"/>&amp; so much honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) brought it forth into the world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in it selfe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth as much as any other this blessed wombe did beare. The Lord in way of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, write all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Contents of it, yet more fully and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships heart, and all the lineaments of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
