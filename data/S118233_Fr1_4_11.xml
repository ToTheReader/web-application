   <l>WEll mightst thou wonder <hi>Taylor</hi> that I praise</l>
   <l>Thy home bred Muse, since in these crittick daies</l>
   <l>It is a Maxim, that who er'e is knowne,</l>
   <l>To giue to others worth, leaues himselfe none:</l>
   <l>Did not I see how much adultrous art</l>
   <l>Paints out the face of poesie for the mart:</l>
   <l>Of outside stages; who can from's loose pen,</l>
   <l>Shake inke at whores, and country gentlemen:</l>
   <l>Can make a souldier vtter treason, curse,</l>
   <l>And Ladies whine, speake as new come from nurse.</l>
   <l>Who can with this, and an opinion'd fame,</l>
   <l>A hungry pention purchase, weares the Name</l>
   <l>Of Poet; when his idle pate hath nought</l>
   <l>To speake his art, but that tis deerely bought.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="6"/>(And yet cheape too) should we but weigh the paine,</l>
   <l>And selfe felt guilt, of his translating veine.</l>
   <l>When I on both looke, by <hi>Apollo's</hi> fire</l>
   <l>I laugh at him, and thee I doe admire.</l>
   <l>Thou ow'st thine owne begettings, which by thee</l>
   <l>Are made, not fashiond, such should Poets be.</l>
   <l>Such were the antient Bards, and Druids songs</l>
   <l>Who vsed their owne language, their owne tongues:</l>
   <l>Where Nature, vnto me seemes Art to passe</l>
   <l>As much as Diamonds doe a painted glasse:</l>
   <l>For if who best translates a Poet were</l>
   <l>We might haue more then one borne in a yeere.</l>
   <l>And I haue liu'd an age, and nere saw two,</l>
   <l>So much vnbought, vnborow'd, yet could show</l>
   <l>As I haue read from thee, what wouldst thou more</l>
   <l>Ther's many weares the Bayes, deserues thy oare.</l>
