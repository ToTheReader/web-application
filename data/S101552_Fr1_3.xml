<hi>Egesippus</hi>) remained a
Virgin,<note place="margin">Egegesip: apud Euseb. hist. lib. 3. cap. 32.</note> free from all heresies
and corruptions, during the
life of the Apostles: that is to
say, about one hundred yeeres
after Christ, to which time S.
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
But after the death of
the Apostles (saith he,) Errors by little and little crept
into the Church, as into a voyde and desert house. This
Assertion is dolefull enough, and yet very profitable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all Popish Recusants of our time: as who are not
ashamed, impudently to avouch, that after so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

Error at all in their <hi>Romish Babylon.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If any demaund the cause heereof, the aunswere is at

To which Errour, (though most palpable) <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeneus,</hi>

that so many silly, follish, rude, and ignorant Papists, doe
<pb facs="4"/>
at this day, terme late vpstart Popery▪ the Old Religion.
They onely respect the externall face of the Church, as it
was in the late dayes of their forefathers, And for want
of skill, and reading of auncient Councells, Fathers, and
histories of the Church, they deeme that to be very olde,
which is indeede very new. Hence commeth it, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more moueth the rude vulgar people to embrace
Popery, then this theyr fond perswasion, that it is the old
Religion.</p>
   <p>In regard hereof (right Worshipfull) I haue taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
me, for the glory of GOD, the peace of his Church,
and the common good of my natiue Country, to set before
the eyes of all indifferent Readers, as cleerely as in a
glasse of Christall, the originall and daily excrements
of Popery, and that it is not the Old but the New Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
I haue prooued succinctly and euidently, first, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
the name (Pope,) was common to the Fathers of the
Church, for the space of 528 yeeres after Christ, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
vsurped as peculiar to the Bishop of Rome. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
that the Popes superoyall power, was vnknowne
to the world for the space of 607. yeeres, vntill <hi>Phocas</hi>
the Emperour of Rome. 3. That the Priests &amp; Bishops <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
were euer married in the East Church, and in the West
Church, for the space of 385. yeeres. 4. That Popish par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
were vnknowne 1300. yeeres. 5. That Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
was neuer beleeued of the Greeke Church, nor yet of
the Latine Church, for the space of 250. yeeres, about
which time <hi>Origen</hi> (too much adicted to his allegorical
Speculation) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

After <hi>Origen,</hi> others began to call the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

many thing to <hi>Origens</hi> conceit: and so by little &amp; lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

<pb facs="5"/>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> make it an Article of Popish sayth. That auriculer cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
was no Article of Popish fayth, for the space of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 1215. yeeres. 7. That Popish veniall sinnes, were first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fift of that name, that is to say,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 1566. yeeres after Christ. 8. That the Article of Popish
sayth, that the Pope cannot erre in matters of fayth iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
was neuer knowne to the Church for the space of
1500. yeeres. 9. That the cōdigne merit of mans works,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
was not an Article of Popish fayth, for the space of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,

Transubstantiation, was first hatched in the Councell of

of Saints, was neuer knowne nor heard of, for
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> the space of 1047. yeeres. 12. That the Communion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

yeeres: neither was it an Article of Popish fayth, vntill
the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> about 1414. yeeres after
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Christ. 13. That Priuate Masse began 1000. yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> Christ. 14. That it was euer holden vnlawfull for
the brother to marry his naturall sister, for the space of
1418. yeeres, at what time Pope <hi>Martin</hi> set it abroach,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> by the instigation of the deuill. 15. That worshipping of
Images was thought vnlawfull, for the space of 1484.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> yeeres. 16. That the Church seruice was euer in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
tongue, for the space of 443. yeeres at the least. 17.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> That Popish <hi>Agnus Deis</hi> were not heard of, for the
space of one thousand two hundred yeeres after Christ.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> 18. That the Popes Bulls were vnknowne, for the space
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> of 772. yeeres after Christ. 19. That Popish hallowed
Candles on <hi>Candelmasday,</hi> were inuented 843. yeeres
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> after Christ. That Bishops were not sworne to defend
the Pope and his Canons, for the space of one thousand,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> two hundred, twenty nine yeeres after Christ. 21. That
<pb facs="5"/>
Lent-fast in Popish manner, was neuer heard of for the
space of 427. yeeres. All which, and many other impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
poynts of Popish fayth, are so liuely discouered to the
first hatching thereof, in this short and plaine Discourse,
as euery child may with all facility, boldly pronounce, and
constantly affirme, that the late Romish Fayth and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
is not the Old, but the New Religion. Which if the
silly Papists would once duly consider, they would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
obey the Pope, or like of his Religion. The Worke,
such as it is, I haue dedicated to your Worships, as a signe
of a thankfull hart, for your manifold kindnesses towards
mee at all times. And so I humbly commend your
Worships to the protection of the Almighty.</p>
