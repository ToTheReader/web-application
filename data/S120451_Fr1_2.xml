   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIAN</hi> discreet <hi>Reader,</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Dalmatian Bishop</hi> thus impartially painted out in his colours, thou maist perceive how easie a thing it is, for any man of the meanest capacitie to build ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wind-mills and castles in the aire alone with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: and how dangerous and uncertaine to trust un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable <hi>Rome: Crudelis mater magis, an puer improbus ille?</hi> I can hardly conjecture which may be the more observeable, the Crueltie of mother <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Impiety of her prodigall retired sonne. But I conclude, <hi>Improbus ille puer, crudelis tu quo{que} mater,</hi> Both a wicked son, and an adulterous mother. Yet (Lady <hi>Rome</hi>) let me here dispute the point, whether or no he died thy son: sure I am that since his returne unto thee, he did never totally adhere to thy Religion; but as it shall plainly appeare, did much dislike both thy doctrine and discipline: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise thou wouldest not have used him as a fagot for the fire, but have preserved him rather as a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Rafter for thy decayed building. But I must needs say, thy mercy is meere crueltie, and thy pietie no lesse than barbarous immanitie. The <hi>Iscocchi</hi> sent forth threats against their <hi>quondam</hi> Bishop, (I
<pb facs="3"/>meane this same <hi>Dalmatian</hi> Bishop, <hi>M. ANTON. de Dominis</hi>) that if they could lay hands on him, they would make a bag of his skin (as they are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to make of swines skins for wine and oyle in those countries.) It seemes the <hi>Pope</hi> and his shave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or chapmen, could make no use at all of him, but returne him to his Ashes, as they doe all Heretikes, whose cinders they use to sprinkle in the aire, with these words, <hi>Colligat Deus,</hi> Let their God gather them, if he will have them. Mee thinkes they might better have kept him as a Stale to publish more books in his name, or have sent him an Apostle to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> for the conversion of Infidels, whither he would rather have beene packing, than stay at home in <hi>Rome,</hi> there to be sacrificed to their flaming <hi>Aetna,</hi> or be broiling upon the hot coles. <hi>Caveat alter,</hi> Take heed <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Preston,</hi> let not the <hi>Ignatians</hi> prevaile with you to carry a letter to <hi>Rome,</hi> lest you dip your finger in the same sauce. I have heard you may have a Bishopricke in <hi>Rome</hi> for the fetching: So had <hi>Spalato,</hi> procured by the <hi>Spanish Fistulado.</hi> But beside the Castle of <hi>S. Angelo,</hi> he could never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any of his hoped revenewes appendant to his said Promotion. Well, the old Schoole verse shall end all that I intend to perswade in this preluding Preface, <hi>Foelix quem faciunt,</hi> &amp;c. Happie he whom others harmes make to beware.</p>
