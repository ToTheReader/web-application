   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, there hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
been occasioned since the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of this work, by reason of the
occurrence of certaine Authours, that
contrary unto my knowledge had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
so fully herein; but after consideration had
(that for the most part they were but translations)
I thought it might bee no lesse lawfull and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
for mee than for others, to communicate unto
such as are yet desirous of further information,
that wherein I have bestowed both cost and paines.
Notwithstanding, I haue so used the matter, as that
I might not derogate from the estimation had of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to increase mine owne. Read it throughly,
iudge indifferently, and if thou likest it, practise
considerately. If thou art ignorant herein, I am
<pb facs="32"/>
sure it will instruct thee, and though well experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
(which perhaps thou art) I make no question,
but that thou mayst finde somewhat which thou hast
not heard of before; So farewell.</p>
