Iudgement.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ONDER NOT,
christian Reader
that of al my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
and trauayle
within the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of GOD
these twentye yeares, I haue set
forth nothing in exponing anye
portion of scripture, except this
onely rude and indigest Sermon
preached by me in the publicke
audiēce of the church of Eding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough
the day and yeare aboue
mēcioned. That <hi>I</hi> did not in writ
communicate my iudgemēt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the scriptures, I haue euer
thought and yet thinke my selfe
<pb facs="3"/>
to haue most iust reason. For cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
my selfe rather cald of
my God to instruct the ignorant,
comfort the sorowfull, confirme
the weake, and rebuke the proud
by tong &amp; liuelye voyce in these
most corrupt dayes, thā to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
bokes for the age to come,
seeing that so much is written (&amp;
that by men of most singuler cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition)
and yet so little well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued:
I decreed to containe my
selfe within the bondes of that
vocation, wherevnto I founde
my selfe especially called. I dare
not denie (lest that in so doing I
should be iniurious to the giuer)
but that God hath reuealed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me secretes vnknowen to the
worlde, and also that he hath
made my tong a trumpet to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne
realmes and nations, yea
certaine great personages, of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and chaunges, when no
<pb facs="3"/>
such thinges were feared, nor yet
was appearing, a portion wherof
can not the world denie (be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so blind) to be fulfilled, and
the rest (alas) I feare shall followe
with greater expedition and in
more full perfection, than my
sorowfull heart desireth. These
reuelations and assurances not
withstanding, <hi>I</hi> did euer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steyne
to commit anye thing to
writ, contented onely to haue
obeyed the charge of him, who
commaunded me to cry. If anye
then will aske to what purpose
this onely sermon is set forth, &amp;
greater matters omitted, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
to let such as Sathan hath
not altogether blinded see, vpon
how small occasions, great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
is nowe conceyued. This
sermon is it for the which from
my bed I was called before the
Councell: and after long reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb facs="4"/>
I was by some forbidden to
preach in Edingbrough so long
as the King and Queene were in
the towne. This sermon is it that
so offēdeth such as would please
the Court, and yet will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to be enimies to the truth,
that thei dare affirme that I haue
exceded the bonds of Gods mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanger.
I haue therfore faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
committed vnto writ, what
soeuer I could remember might
haue beene offensiue in that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
To the ende that aswell
the enimies of Gods truth, as the
professors of the same, may ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
note vnto me wherin I haue
offended, or at the least ceasse to
condempne me before they haue
conuicted me by Gods manifest
worde. If any man thinke it easy
vnto me to mitigate by my pen
the inconsiderate sharpenesse of
my tongue, and so can not men
<pb facs="4"/>
freely iudge of that my sermon, <hi>I</hi>
answere that neyther am <hi>I</hi> so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
that <hi>I</hi> will study to abuse
the worlde, in this great light,
neyther yet so voyde of feare of
my God, that <hi>I</hi> will auowe a lye
in his owne presence. And no
lesse doe <hi>I</hi> esteeme it to be a lye,
to deny or cōceile that which in
his name <hi>I</hi> haue once pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
than to affirme that GOD
hath spoken, when his worde as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
me not of the same, for in
the publike place <hi>I</hi> consulte not
with flesh and bloud what <hi>I</hi> shall
propone to the people, but as the
spirit of my God who hath sent
me and vnto whome <hi>I</hi> must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
moueth me, so I speake,
and when I haue once pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
threatnings in his nāe (howe
vnpleasant soeuer they be to the
world) I dare no more deny thē,
than I dare deny that God hath
<pb facs="5"/>
made me his messinger to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne
the inobedient of their
assured destruction. At that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mō
were auditours vnto me not
onely professors of the truth and
such as fauor me, but rancke pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes,
dissembled Hipocrites, &amp;
no small number of couetous
clawbaks of the new court. Now
<hi>I</hi> will appeale the conscience of
them all, as they will aunswere
in the presēce of the eternal god,
that eyther they beare me record
now writing the truth, or els note
vnto me the sentences offensiue
then by me pronounced, &amp; now
ommitted in writting, for in
Gods presence <hi>I</hi> protest that so
far as memorie would serue me,
<hi>I</hi> haue written more vehemētly,
than in the action <hi>I</hi> spake and
pronounced, but of purpose <hi>I</hi>
haue omitted persuasions and
exhortations which then were
<pb facs="5"/>
made for alluring of suche vnto
the feare of God, whom gladly I
would haue pleased, if so I could
haue done, &amp; not haue betrayed
the manifest truth of my God.
The Lorde be mercifull vnto me
that I did not more fullye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
whatsoeuer his holy spirit
layde before me, in that text,
which I am assured the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
reader shal think I haue but
slenderlye handeled, all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
being cōnsidered. O Lord
for thy great name sake giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs Princes and rulers that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in thy truth, that loue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
hate impietie, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
rather to be roundely taught
to their saluation, than deceyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
flattered to their euerlasting
confusion. Amen.</p>
