         <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Onourable sir,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p> being earnestly reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by a déere friend, to put downe in
writing, some true relation of our late
performed voyage to the North parts
of <hi>Virginia;</hi> at length I resolued to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his request, who also emboldened
me to direct the same to your honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
consideration; to whom indéed
of duetie it perteineth.</p>
   <p>May it please your Lordship therefore to vnderstand, that
vpon the sixe and twentieth of March 1602, being Friday,
we went from <hi>Falmouth,</hi> being in all, two &amp; thirtie persons,
in a small barke of <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> called The <hi>Concord,</hi> holding
a course for the North part of <hi>Virginia:</hi> and although by
chance the winde fauoured vs not at first as we wished, but
inforced vs so farre to the Southward,<note place="margin">They fel with <hi>S. Marie,</hi> one of the <hi>Açores.</hi>
      </note> as we fell with <hi>S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
one of the islands of the <hi>Açores</hi> (which was not much
out of our way) but holding our course directly from thence,
we made our iourney shorter (than hitherto accustomed) by
the better part of a thousand leagues, yet were wée longer
in our passage than we expected; which happened, for that
our barke being weake, we were loth to presse her with much
saile; also, our sailers being few, and they none of the best, we
bare (except in faire weather) but low saile; besides, our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vpon an vnknowen coast, made vs not ouer-bolde to
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
stand in with the shore, but in open weather; which caused
vs to be certeine daies in sounding, before we discouered the
coast, the weather being by chance, somewhat foggie. But
on Friday the fourtéenth of May,<note place="margin">They discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red land the 14. of May.</note> early in the morning, wée
made the land, being full of faire trées, the land somewhat
low, certeine hummocks or hilles lying into the land, the
shore full of white sand, but very stony or rocky. And standing
faire alongst by the shore, about twelue of the clocke the same
day,<note place="margin">Eight Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord of them.</note> we came to an anker, where eight Indians, in a Baske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shallop
with mast and saile, an iron grapple, and a kettle of
Copper, came boldly aboord vs, one of them apparelled with a
wastcoat and breeches of blacke serdge, made after our sea-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
hose and shoes on his féet; all the rest (sauing one that
had a paire of breeches of blue cloth) were naked.<note place="margin">The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</note> These
people are of tall stature, broad and grim visage, of a blacke
swart complexion, their eie-browes painted white; their
weapons are bowes and arrowes. It seemed by some words
and signes they made, that some Basks or of <hi>S, Iohn de Luz,</hi>
haue fished or traded in this place, being in the latitude of 43.
degrées. But riding heere, in no very good harbour, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
doubting the weather, about thrée of the clocke the same
day in the afternoone we weighed, &amp; standing Southerly off
into sea the rest of that day and the night following, with a
fresh gale of winde, in the morning we found our selues em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baied
with a mightie headland; but comming to an anker a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
nine of the clocke the same day, within a league of the
shore, we hoised out the one halfe of our shallop, and captaine
<hi>Bartholmew Gosnold,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Their first landing.</note> my selfe, and thrée others, went ashore,
being a white sandie and very bolde shore; and marching all
that afternoone with our muskets on our necks, on the highest
hilles which we saw (the weather very hot) at length we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
this headland to be parcell of the maine, and sundrie
Islands lying almost round about it: so returning (towards
euening) to our shallop (for by that time, the other part was
brought ashore and set together) we espied an Indian,<note place="margin">Another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian.</note> a yoong
man, of proper stature, and of a pleasing countenance; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some familiaritie with him, we left him at the sea side, and
returned to our ship; where, in fiue or sixe houres absence, we
had pestered our ship so with Cod fish,<note place="margin">Anexcellent Codfishing.</note> that we threw num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
of them ouer-boord againe: and surely, I am persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that in the moneths of March, April, and May, there is
vpon this coast, better fishing, and in as great plentie, as in
<hi>Newfound-land:</hi> for the sculles of Mackerell, herrings, Cod,
and other fish, that we daily saw as we went and came from
the shore, were woonderfull; and besides, the places where
we tooke these Cods (and might in a few daies haue laden our
ship) were but in seuen fadome water, and within lesse than
a league of the shore: where, in <hi>Newfound-land</hi> they fish in
fortie or fiftie fadome water, and farre off. From this place,
we sailed round about this headland,<note place="margin">A great head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> almost all the points of
the compasse, the shore very bolde: but as no coast is frée from
dangers, so I am persuaded, this is as frée as any. The land
somwhat lowe, full of goodly woods, but in some places plaine.
At length we were come amongst many faire Islands,<note place="margin">Many faire Islands.</note> which
we had partly discerned at our first landing; all lying within
a league or two one of another, and the outermost not aboue
sixe or seuen leagues from the maine:<note place="margin">The first I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland called <hi>Marthaes</hi> vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</note> but cōming to an anker
vnder one of them, which was about thrée or foure leagues
from the maine, captaine <hi>Gosnold,</hi> my selfe, and some others,
went ashore, and going round about it, we found it to be foure
English miles in compasse, without house or inhabitant, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a little old house made of boughes, couered with barke,
an olde piece of a weare of the Indians, to catch fish, and one
or two places, where they had made fires. The chiefest trées
of this Island, are Béeches<note place="margin">Beeches.</note> and Cedars;<note place="margin">Cedars.</note> the outward parts
all ouergrowen with lowe bushie trées, thrée or foure foot in
height, which beare some kinde of fruits, as appeared by
their blossomes; Strawberries, red and white, as sweet and
much bigger than ours in <hi>England:</hi> Rasberies, Gooseberies,
Hurtleberies, and such an incredible store of Uines,<note place="margin">Uines in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.</note> aswell
in the wooddie part of the Island, where they run vpon euery
trée, as on the outward parts, that we could not goe for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vpon them: also, many springs<note place="margin">Springs.</note> of excellent swéet water,
and a great standing lake<note place="margin">A Lake.</note> of fresh water, néere the sea side, an
English mile in compasse, which is mainteined with the
springs running excéeding pleasantly thorow the wooddie
grounds which are very rockie. Here are also in this Island,
great store of Déere,<note place="margin">Deere.</note> which we saw, and other beasts,<note place="margin">Other beasts.</note> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
by their tracks; as also diuers fowles, as Cranes,<note place="margin">Cranes.</note>

fowles, in great plenty; also, great store of Pease, which
grow in certeine plots all the Island ouer. On the North
side of this Island we found many huge bones and ribbes of
Whales. This Island, as also all the rest of these Islands,
are full of all sorts of stones fit for building; the sea sides all
couered with stones, many of them glistring and shining
like minerall stones, and verie rockie: also, the rest of these
Islands are replenished with these commodities, and vpon
some of them, inhabitants; as vpon as Island to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and within two leagues of this; yet wée found no
townes, nor many of their houses, although we saw manie
Indians, which are tall big boned men, all naked, sauing they
couer their priuy parts with a blacke tewed skin, much like
a Black smiths apron, tied about their middle and betwéene
their legs behinde: they gaue vs of their fish readie boiled,
(which they carried in a basket made of twigges, not vnlike
our osier) whereof we did eat, and iudged them to be fresh
water fish: they gaue vs also of their Tabacco,<note place="margin">Tabacco.</note> which they
drinke gréene, but dried into powder, very strong and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
and much better than any I haue tasted in <hi>England:</hi> the
necks of their pipes are made of clay hard dried, (whereof in
that Island is great store both red and white) the other part
is a piece of hollow copper, very finely closed and semented
together. Wée gaue vnto them certeine trifles, as kniues,
points, and such like, which they much estéemed. From hence
we went to another Island,<note place="margin">Elizabeths Island.</note> to the Northwest of this, and
within a league or two of the maine, which we found to bee
greater than before we imagined, being 16. English miles at
the least in compasse; for it conteineth many pieces or necks
of land, which differ nothing frō seuerall Islands, sauing that
certeine banks of small bredth, do like bridges, ioine them to
this Island. On the outsides of this Island are many plaine
places of grasse, abundance of Strawberies &amp; other berries
before mentioned. In mid May we did sowe in this Island
(for a triall) in sundry places, Wheat, Barley, Oats, and
Pease,<note place="margin">Wheat, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and Oats sowed, came vp nine inches in fourteene daies.</note> which in fourtéene daies were sprung vp nine inches
and more. The soile is fat and lustie, the vpper crust of gray
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>
colour; but a foot or lesse in depth, of the colour of our hempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
in <hi>England;</hi> and being thus apt for these and the like
graines; the sowing or setting (after the ground is clensed)
is no greater labour, than if you should set or sow in one of
our best prepared gardens in <hi>England.</hi> This Island is full of
high timbred Oakes,<note place="margin">Oakes.</note> their leaues thrise so broad as ours; Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,<note place="margin">Cedars.</note>
straight and tall; Béech,<note place="margin">Beech.</note> Elme,<note place="margin">Elme.</note> hollie,<note place="margin">Hollie.</note> Walnut trees<note place="margin">Walnut trees.</note> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance,

not differing from ours in <hi>England,</hi> but the stalke bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

Grapes, forty or fifty in a bunch; Sassafras trées<note place="margin">Sassafras trees.</note> great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

other fruit trées,<note place="margin">Diuers other trees.</note> some of them with strange barkes, of an
Orange colour, in feeling soft and smoothe like Ueluet: in the
thickest parts of these woods, you may sée a furlong or more
round about. On the Northwest side of this Island, néere to
the sea side, is a standing Lake of fresh water, almost thrée
English miles<note place="margin">A lake three miles about.</note> in compasse, in the middest whereof stands a
plot of woody ground, an acre in quantitie or not aboue:
this Lake is full of small Tortoises,<note place="margin">Small Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toises.</note> and excéedingly frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with all sorts of fowles before rehearsed, which breed,
some low on the banks, and others on low trees about this
Lake in great aboundance, whose yong ones of all sorts we
tooke and eat at our pleasure: but all these fowles are much
bigger than ours in <hi>England.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Abundance of fowles, much bigger than ours in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
      </note> Also, in euery Island, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in euery part of euery Island, are great store of Ground
nuts,<note place="margin">Ground nuts.</note> fortie together on a string, some of them as bigge as
hennes egges; they grow not two inches vnder ground: the
which nuts we found to be as good as Potatoes. Also, diuers
sorts of shell-fish,<note place="margin">Shell fish.</note> as Scalops, Muscles, Cockles, Lobsters,

But not to cloy you with particular rehearsall of such things
as God &amp; Nature hath bestowed on these places, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whereof, the most fertil part of al <hi>England</hi> is (of it selfe) but
barren; we went in our light-horsman from this Island to the
maine, right against this Island some two leagues off, where
comming ashore, we stood a while like men rauished at the
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>
beautie<note place="margin">The exceeding beautie of the maine land.</note> and delicacie of this swéet soile; for besides diuers
cléere Lakes<note place="margin">Great Lakes.</note> of fresh water (whereof we saw no end) Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes<note place="margin">Large me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes.</note>
very large and full of gréene grasse; euen the most
woody places (I speake onely of such as I saw) doe grow so
distinct and apart, one trée from another, vpon gréene grassie
ground, somewhat higher than the Plaines, as if Nature
would shew her selfe aboue her power, artificiall. Hard by,
we espied seuen Indians,<note place="margin">Seuen In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note> and cumming vp to them, at first
they expressed some feare; but being emboldned by our cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
vsage, and some trifles which we gaue them, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vs to a necke of land, which we imagined had beene se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
from the maine; but finding it otherwise, we perceiued
a broad harbour or riuers<note place="margin">A broad riuer.</note> mouth, which ranne vp into the
maine: and because the day was farre spent, we were forced
to returne to the Island from whence we came, leauing the
discouery of this harbour,<note place="margin">A good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> for a time of better leasure. Of the
goodnesse of which harbour, as also of many others therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
there is small doubt, considering that all the Islands,
as also the maine (where we were) is all rockie grounds and
broken lands. Now the next day, we determined to fortifie
our selues in a little plot of ground in the midst of the Lake
aboue mentioned,<note place="margin">The English house.</note> where we built an house, and couered it
with sedge, which grew about this lake in great aboundance;
in building whereof, we spent thrée wéeks and more: but the
second day after our comming from the maine, we espied 11
canowes or boats, with fiftie Indians in them,<note place="margin">Eleuen ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nows with fiftie Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in them.</note> comming
toward vs from this part of the maine, where we, two daies
before landed; and being loth they should discouer our forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
we went out on the sea side to méete them; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
somewhat néere them, they all sat downe vpon the
stones, calling aloud to vs (as we rightly ghessed) to doe the
like, a little distance from them: hauing sat a while in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
captaine <hi>Gosnold</hi> willed me to goe vnto them, to sée what
countenance they would make; but as soone as I came vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, one of them, to whom I had giuen a knife two daies
before in the maine, knew me, (whom I also very wel remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred)
and smiling vpon me, spake somewhat vnto their lord
or captaine,<note place="margin">Their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> which sat in the midst of them, who presently rose
vp and tooke a large Beauer skin from one that stood about
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>
him, and gaue it vnto me, which I requited for that time the
best I could: but I, pointing towards captaine <hi>Gosnold,</hi>
made signes vnto him, that he was our captaine, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to be his friend, and enter league with him, which (as I
perceiued) he vnderstood, and made signes of ioy: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
captaine <hi>Gosnold</hi> with the rest of his companie, being
twenty in all, came vp vnto them; and after many signes
of gratulations (captaine <hi>Gosnold</hi> presenting their Lord with
certaine trifles which they wondred at, and highly estéemed)
we became very great friends, and sent for meat aboord our
shallop, and gaue them such meats as we had then readie
dressed, whereof they misliked nothing but our mustard,
whereat they made many a sowre face. While we were
thus mery, one of them had conueied a target of ours into
one of their canowes, which we suffered, onely to trie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were in subiection to this Lord to whom we made
signes (by shewing him another of the same likenesse, and
pointing to the canow) what one of his companie had done:
who suddenly expressed some feare, and speaking angerly to
one about him (as we perceiued by his countenance) caused
it presently to be brought backe againe. So the rest of the day
we spent in trading with them for Furres,<note place="margin">Seuerall sorts of Furres.</note> which are Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
Luzernes, Marterns, Otters, Wild-cat skinnes, very
large and déepe Furre, blacke Foxes, Conie skinnes, of the
colour of our Hares, but somewhat lesse, Déere skinnes, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
large, Seale skinnes, and other beasts skinnes, to vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen.
They haue also great store of Copper,<note place="margin">Red Copper in abundance.</note> some very
redde; and some of a paler colour; none of them but haue
chaines, earings or collars of this mettall: they head some
of their arrows herewith much like our broad arrow heads,
very workmanly made. Their chaines<note place="margin">Chaines.</note> are many hollow
pieces semented together, ech piece of the bignesse of one of
our réeds, a finger in length, ten or twelue of them together
on a string, which they weare about their necks: their col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars<note place="margin">Collars.</note>
they weare about their bodies like bandelieres a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
broad, all hollow pieces, like the other, but somewhat
shorter, four hundred pieces in a collar, very fine and euenly
set together. Besides these, they haue large drinking cups<note place="margin">Drinking cuppes of Copper.</note>
made like sculles, and other thinne plates of copper, made
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>
much like our boare-speare blades, all which they so little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéeme,
as they offered their fairest collars or chaines, for a
knife or such like trifle, but we séemed little to regard it; yet
I was desirous to vnderstand where they had such store of
this mettall, and made signes to one of them (with whom I
was very familiar) who taking a piece of Copper<note place="margin">Mines of Copper.</note> in his
hand, made a hole with his finger in the ground, and withall
pointed to the maine from whence they came. They strike
fire in this manner; euery one carrieth about him in a purse of
tewd leather, a Minerall stone<note place="margin">Minerall stones.</note> (which I take to be their
Copper) and with a flat Emerie stone<note place="margin">Emerie stones.</note> (wherewith Glasiers
cut glasse, and Cutlers glase blades) tied fast to the end of
a little sticke, gently he striketh vpon the Minerall stone,
and within a stroke or two, a sparke falleth vpon a piece of
Touchwood (much like our Spunge in <hi>England</hi>) and with
the least sparke he maketh a fire presently. We had also of
their Flaxe,<note place="margin">Flaxe.</note> wherewith they make many strings and cords,
but it is not so bright of colour as ours in <hi>England:</hi> I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
they haue great store growing vpon the maine, as
also Mines and many other rich commodities, which we,
wanting both time and meanes, could not possibly discouer.
Thus they continued with vs thrée daies, euery night reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them selues to the furthermost part of our Island two or
three miles from our fort: but the fourth day they returned to
the maine, pointing fiue or six times to the Sun, and once to
the maine, which we vnderstood, that within fiue or six daies
they would come from the maine to vs againe: but being in
their canowes a little from the shore, they made huge cries &amp;
shouts of ioy vnto vs; and we with our trumpet and cornet,
and casting vp our cappes into the aire, made them the best
farewell we could:<note place="margin">Indians apt for seruice.</note> yet six or seuen of them remained with
vs behinde, bearing vs company euery day into the woods,
and helpt vs to cut and carie our Sassafras,<note place="margin">Sassafras.</note> and some of them
lay aboord our ship. These people, as they are excéeding cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,<note place="margin">A goodly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; of good conditions.</note>
gentle of disposition, and well conditioned, excelling all
others that we haue séene; so for shape of bodie and louely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
I thinke they excell all the people of <hi>America;</hi> of stature
much higher than we; of complexion or colour, much like a
darke Oliue; their eie-browes and haire blacke, which they
<pb n="11" facs="6"/>
weare long, tied vp behinde in knots, whereon they pricke
feathers of fowles, in fashion of a crownet: some of them are
blacke thin bearded; they make beards of the haire of beasts:
and one of them offered a beard of their making to one of our
sailers, for his that grew on his face, which because it was of
a red colour, they iudged to be none of his owne. They are
quicke eied, and stedfast in their looks, fearelesse of others
harmes, as intending none themselues; some of the meaner
sort giuen to filching, which the very name of Saluages (not
weighing their ignorance in good or euill) may easily excuse:
their garments are of Déere skins, and some of them weare
Furres round and close about their necks.<note place="margin">Their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</note> They pronounce
our language with great facilitie; for one of them one day
sitting by mee, vpon occasion I spake smiling to him these
words: <hi>How now (sirrha) are you so saucie with my Tabacco?</hi>
which words (without any further repetition) he suddenly
spake so plaine and distinctly, as if he had béene a long scholar
in the language. Many other such trials we had, which are
héere néedlesse to repeat. Their women<note place="margin">Their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> (such as we saw)
which were but thrée in all, were but lowe of stature, their
eie-browes, haire, apparell, and maner of wearing, like to
the men, fat, and very well fauoured, and much delighted in
our company; the men are very dutifull towards them. And
truely, the holsomnesse and temperature of this Climat, doth
not onely argue this people to be answerable to this descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but also of a perfect constitution of body, actiue, strong,
healthfull, and very wittie, as the sundry toies of theirs cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
wrought, may easily witnes. For the agréeing of this
Climat<note place="margin">The goodnesse or the Climat.</note> with vs (I speake of my selfe, &amp; so I may iustly do for
the rest of our company) that we found our health &amp; strength
all the while we remained there, so to renew and increase,
as notwithstanding our diet and lodging was none of the
best, yet not one of our company (God be thanked) felt the
least grudging or inclination to any disease or sicknesse, but
were much fatter and in better health than when we went
out of <hi>England.</hi> But after our barke had taken in so much
Sassafras, Cedar, Furres, Skinnes, and other commodities,
as were thought conuenient; some of our company that had
promised captaine <hi>Gosnold</hi> to stay, hauing nothing but a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="12" facs="7"/>
voyage in their minds, made our company of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
(which was small enough before) much smaller; so as
captaine <hi>Gosnold</hi> séeing his whole strength to consist but of
twelue men, and they but meanly prouided, determined to
returne<note place="margin">Their return.</note> for <hi>England,</hi> leauing this Island (which he called <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths
Island</hi>) which as many true sorrowfull eies, as were
before desirous to sée it. So the 18. of Iune, being Friday,
we weighed, and with indifferent faire winde and weather
came to anker the 23 of Iuly, being also Friday (in all, bare
fiue wéeks) before <hi>Exmouth.</hi>
