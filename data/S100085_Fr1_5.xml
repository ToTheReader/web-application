   <head>To the Gentle Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Courteous and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Reader, it was
not the insatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of a shade like fame
which soone vanisheth,
nor the unquenchable
thirst of an emptie glory, that did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
me to write this treatise, but the
good will I bore thee and thine endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
We ought to doe well, not because
we would be frequently talked and spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of by every man, but that wee may
edifie and give content to our owne
mindes; for as men are inconstant, so
their actions and humours likewise are
variable, and he that heapes up prayses
upon thee to day may blame thee to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
And although our name doth not
die presently with us, if we, having done
<pb facs="9"/>
well in our life time be praise worthy, yet
it cannot last for ever, but must once
perish with the world, and thus we die
twice.</p>
   <p>The subject is praise worthy enough,
but as for the Penman, Ile leave that
to thy descreet censure: Good language
I want, yet if I did not want it, thou
wouldst want the understanding of the
booke.</p>
   <p>The Art of Defence may bee justly
termed next to the liberall, the chiefe,
the most necessary, as well in time of
peace as in time of warre, at home and
abroad, the most part of other exercises
of the body being but for pleasure onely,
or the health of the body, this for plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sure,
for health of body and soule
too; for if thou bee knowne to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rt
herein, and to guide thy weapon by
judgement, thou dost scarsely give any
occasion of falling out, that thou mayst
not be accounted a vaine man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou knowest what danger there is
in, onely standing upon thine owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb facs="9"/>
when the unskilfull having one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
courage, will quarrell upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
because the danger he may fall
into is unknowne to him: besides no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
will easily offend thee, so that skill
maketh thee to be respected and feared,
and to feare no man, if thou be engaged
in any necessary quarrell.</p>
   <p>And againe, if it bee thy chance to
light into a company, where perhaps
in thy presence some may fall out, then
the reputation thou art in for thy skill
may be the cause of their agreement, if
thou thy selfe dost stirre in mediating
betweene them, and thus thou mayst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
their bodies and soules from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
in hindring the shedding of blood.
I cannot but marvaile extreamely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the necessitie, why this art
should be so much neglected▪ without
the want of good and skilfull teachers
be the cause. For with what confidence
can we weare our weapons, with what
safetie if we cannot use them? There is
a great difference betweene the wearing
<pb facs="10"/>
and the handling of Armes, to weare a
Rapier or Sword is onely fashionable, to
use it, necessary.</p>
   <p>If a man bee assaulted and hath no
skill to trust to, he will be daunted and
loose his courage, and although hee doth
not loose his spirit, but with a resolute
minde will strive to gaine the conquest,
his fortitude becomes temeritie, and his
owne valour will be his raine, because it
is not ruled by reason.</p>
   <p>And if thou hast never so good skill,
doe not offend any one, nor contemning
undervalue thine adversaries skill, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he hath none at all, for contempt
engendreth carelesnesse, and careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
destruction, ever that thou shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
thou escapest; therefore rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
thy selfe that thine adversary
hath more skill then thou, and fight wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
as if thou wert to combat with
thy better man, and thou shalt bee free
from many perills, that else would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
thee. It is not my profession indeed
to practise this science, or to get my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living
<pb facs="10"/>
the same, but my ambition to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
that to thee for <hi>Grande</hi> mercy,
which hath cost me both thankes and
silver: I was encouraged by many of my
friends to commit this treatise to the
Presse, and easily induced to put it in
action, seeing the want of such a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ect:
yet I had scarsely ventured to put
my selfe into the world, had it not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
my noble friends to divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and surround me with the fiery
walls of their tender love. I present unto
thy view a booke small in quantity, but
great if thou peruse it throughly, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon reason and experience, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically
composed, and (which I will
not blush to speake) in such termes that
there cannot be made any blow or thrust
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t thee, but thou mayst finde remedy for
there. There have indeede beene some
few and those of great skill and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that have written some discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of this subject very obscurely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being that it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> their living and
profession, they thought it not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="11"/>
to make that common by which they
were maintained. I have fitted my selfe
to thetimes, in speaking onely of single
Rapier and single Sword, being that
the Dagger, Gauntlet, Buckler are not
in use, and because that the Rapier an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

the Sword are the grounds of the lesse

of the weapons. There be some that wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

that a man having a long arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

those, I should perchanse be held to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>liver
a Paradox, which indeede is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
Paradox but to the unskilfull: In bac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
Sword-play a long weapon may bee a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>vantagious;
<pb facs="11"/>
in Rapier-play it is not, if
he that hath the shorter weapon doth but
alwayes thrust close to his adversaries
weapon: But if two play together that
are both unskilfull, then hee that hath
the longer Rapier doubtles hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
because they thrust f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rre off from
one anothers Rapiers.</p>
   <p>Entertaine therefore, gentle Reader,
these first fruits of mine endeavours,
with as good and noble a minde as I
wrote it with a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sire to benefit thee, and
to advance thy skill, which if thou dost
thou shalt oblige me further, and give
me great encouragement to enlarge it
with Emblemes, and the art of <hi>Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nering,</hi>
a thing very usefull, namely
how to assault an enemy farre off with a
Rapier. Farewell, and peruse this with
health and joy.</p>
