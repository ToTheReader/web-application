         <hi>De diuin. lib.</hi> 1.</note> two Snakes forsooth (so he sayth) were taken in the house of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and wise man, one <hi>Ti. Gracchus,</hi> vnto whom the wise men (for so I name them, whome the Persians call <hi>Magos</hi>: the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians <hi>Prophetas:</hi> the Assyrians <hi>Chaldaeos:</hi> and the Indians <hi>Gymnosophistas</hi>) they being asked what these Snakes signified, did saye: that if he did let the Male escape, then should his wife shortly after die: if the Female, then should he. The Female was let gone (for, loth a Gods name he was, that <hi>P. Affricanus</hi> his daughter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a yong gentlewoman should die) so he himselfe in fewe dayes after accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly died. A worthie proofe of a thing neuer able to be proued Well, if anye of the twaine, sayth he, should escape, by that meane, the man, or the wyfe must nedes die. But as he had choyse to keepe which he woulde, so was he bound by no necessitie to let go anye. Why then kept
<pb facs="4"/>
he not both? he was a wise man, why sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued he not therby as well his owne life, as his wiues? after the same maner myght we easilye confute (were it not to long) the famous Oracle at <hi>Delphi,</hi> the cutting of a whetstone with the rasour by <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius,</hi> the dreame of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and al such incredible, lewde and whetstone lies. But let <hi>Cicero</hi> herevnto (for so he doth) make this aunswere. What subtiltie is this, by trifling to condemne things, confirmed by yeares and antiquitye of time? nay, what follie is it, without any reason, to receiue dreames and fonde fables, found out we know not how, why, nor by whō? yet it is contained in blinde chronicles, it is of authoritie. Yea, but <hi>ipse dixit</hi> (were the authoritie better than of those, <hi>qui sui quaestus causa, fictas suscitant sententias</hi>) hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the learner, letting him from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudging what in eche thing is right. In reasoning (as <hi>Cicero</hi> himself saith) the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is not so much, as is the weight of the reason to be sought for, &amp; requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. What? is this, will some say the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Cicero?</hi> is not his first booke of
<pb facs="4"/>
Diuination written in the name of his brother <hi>Quintus?</hi> that I graunt. And yet, it is the doings of <hi>Tullie,</hi> it is his owne worke, and (though it pleaseth him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to try his wit) his verie and full mind, as the same may well appeare aswell in other of his workes, as speciallye in hys writing vnto <hi>A. Caecinna,</hi> wherein he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that no signes can be surer, that none may be more certaine, than Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But let his first passe, and come vnto the seconde. Denieth he not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, not onely dreames, whereof I speake not, but also visions? not only <gap reason="foreign">

      </note> but also <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, and yet we read that in the verie booke of God, how Daniel, S. Peter, S. Iohn, with others saw visions, regarded, estemed and expounded them. But here a while to omit the heathens, I would that we likewyse, euen we that are Christians, shoulde not trust ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much vnto authorities, vnto the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, I meane, and coniectures of man, it is modestie to be allowed, and pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to be praysed, if we so reade them, as

O follie! ô madnesse! the scripture is plaine. A farre off follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed Peter, he feared, yea, he was greatly afrayde. Some also affirme that S.

      </gap>standing all this, he died not. Alas, what weake authorities be these? nay,
<pb facs="5"/>
what foolish, and intollerable dreaming is this, about the scriptures of God? a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, such as childishlye do vnderstand, that the Lorde wil discend into a valley, vpō the side of the mount Olyuet, there to iudge the worlde, is not therein their wisedome so small, and their writings so fonde, as whether is most foolish, it is hard to tell? Further, there be which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage, that our Sauiour in no respect fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death, and that he was nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde of his passion. But the scriptures be altogether otherwise. For he himself sayth, <hi>My soule is heauye, euen vnto death.</hi> Of whom likewise the Euangelist thus spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Marc.</hi> 14.</note>

      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ibidem.</hi>
      </note> Let them therefore be ashamed, which thinke that our Sauiour, in respect of his manhode, feared not death, and that he did not through feare of his passion say <hi>Transeat à me calix iste,</hi>
      <note place="margin">

      <hi>let this cuppe passe from me.</hi> There is moreouer, which write, that though our sauiour suffered, yet he felt no paine, though he were scourged, and wounded, yet he felt no smart, no griefe, no dolor, that all his passion was

      <hi>sine sensu poenae, without feeling of paine.</hi> What? when he cried,<note place="margin">

      <hi>and our sorowes did he sustein.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, may wee not see, how slender some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, are the writings, and authoritie of man? howe farre from the purpose they estray? and how plainelye in some places they differ, from the Prophets, Apostles, Euangelists, and holy Ghost? And to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the heathens againe, in whose workes although manie things be found vntrue, supersticious and lewde, yet tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe them, as meanes, we haue attained the ryght entrie into Artes, the readye way how to vnderstand liberall sciences, and the playne path into the pleasaunt park of al laudable studies. And amongst all such benefits, which we thus at their handes haue receyued, no one seemeth more excellent, so profitable, and so to be accepted, as is the Arte of reasoning, which onelie (as the Prince of Orators <note place="margin">
         <hi>De leg. lib.</hi> 2.</note>sayth) doth conteine the whole skill of
<pb facs="6"/>
thorowly seeing and adiudging, what both is, and ought to be in euery matter. Yea, and that man, as sayeth the diuine Philosopher <hi>Plato,</hi> which vtterly in thys Arte is ignorant, seeth nothing else, were he otherwise neuer so rich and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but the verie shadowes, and hollow bare images of things. Therefore haue I thought it (my singular good Lorde) worth the labor, if wee in our tongue, as the Latines haue done in theirs, shoulde some briefly, &amp; some at large, so set forth this Art (which I may worthily term the verie treasure house of sciences, the Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of Iewels, the ground of all good stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the very nurse of right perfect knowledge) as it maye at the length ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that like as the Latine is nothing inferiour vnto the Greke, so our tongue may in time, either be comparable with both, or at the least (somewhat to graunt thē) not much inferior vnto the second. Which my smal labour howsoeuer done, although in value little aboue the apple giuen by the poore man, vnto <hi>Artaxerxes Memor,</hi> I haue yet bene bolde to dedicate,
<pb facs="7"/>
and offer vnto your honor. First, as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and pledge of the vnfeined good will which (not to speake of your great cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie) for sundrye good causes, I am bounde to beare during lyfe, towardes your good Lordship: then, that vnder your protection, the same being publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, the malice of <hi>Momus</hi> might be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and the spite of <hi>Zoilus</hi> abated. For it cannot be but <hi>Logique</hi> hath enimies, but reason hath foes, but one industrious sometimes shall haue aduersaries. Thus humbly I craue that your honor would, with such hart and countenance receiue it, as thereby I may be encouraged (if it shall please God, so to ayde me) to beginne, and goe forwarde with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things.</p>
