At this speech <hi>Democritus</hi> profusely laughed (his friends and the people standing by weeping in the meane time and lamenting his madnesse) <hi>Hippocrates</hi> asking the reason why he laughed: he told him at the vanities and fopperies of the time. To see men so empty of all vertuous actions, to hunt so farre after gold, hauing no end of ambition, to take such infinite paines for a little glory, and to be fauored of men, to make such deepe mines into the earth for gold, &amp; many times to find nothing, with losse of their liues and fortunes.

When they are poore and needy they seeke riches, and when they haue them they doe not inioy them, but hide them vnder ground, or else wastfully spend them. O wise <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> I laugh at such things being done, but much more when no good comes of them, and when they are done to so ill purpose. There is no truth or iustice found amongst them, for they daily plead one against another, <note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>Contra paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, fratres ciues perpetuo rix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur, &amp; inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citias agunt.</hi>

They make great account of many senselesse things, esteeming them as a great part of their treasure, statues, pictures, and such like moueables, deare bought, and so cunningly wrought, as nothing but speech

wanteth in them, <note n="b" place="margin">

      </note> and yet they hate liuing persons speaking to them. Others affect difficult things, if they dwell on firme land, they will remoue to an Iland, and thence to land againe, being no way constant in their desires. <note n="c" place="margin">

         <hi>Suam stultiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am perspicit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo sed alter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum dexidet.</hi>
      </note> for no man will mocke his owne folly, but that which hee seeth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so they iustly mocke one another. The drunckard calls him a glutton, whom he knowes to be sober, many men loue the Sea, others husbandry, briefly they cannot agree in their owne trades and professions, much lesse in their liues &amp; actions.</p>
   <p>When <hi>Hippocrates</hi> heard these words, so readily vttered without premeditation to declare the worlds vanity, full of ridiculous contrariety, hee made answer that necessity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled men to many such actions, and diuerse wills ensuing from diuine permission, that we might not be idle, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is so odious to them as sloth and negligence. Besides men cannot foresee future euents, in this vncertainty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affaires, they would not so marry, if they could foresee the causes of their dislike and separation, or parents if they knew the houre of their childs death, so tenderly prouide for them: or an husbandman sowe, if he thought there would be no increase; or a marchant aduenture to sea, if hee foresawe shipwracke; or be a magistrate, if presently to bee deposed. Alas, worthy <hi>Democritus,</hi> euery man hopes the best, and to that end he doth it, and therefore no such cause of laughter.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Democritus</hi> hearing this excuse, laughed againe alowd, perceauing he did not well vnderstand what he had said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning perturbations and tranquillity of the minde. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that if men would gouerne their actions by discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; prouidence, they would not declare themselues fooles, as now they doe, and he should haue no such cause of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="24" facs="16"/>
but, quoth he, they swel in this life as if they were immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, for want of vnderstanding. It were enough to make thē wise, if they would but consider the <seg rend="sup">e</seg> mutability of this world, and how it wheeles about, nothing firme and sure, he that is now aboue, to morrow is beneath, he that sate on this side to day, to morrow is hurled on the other: and not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering these things they fall into many inconueniences and troubles, coueting thinges of no profit, and thirsting after them, tumbling headlong into many calamities. So that if men would attempt no more then what they can beare, they should lead contented liues, &amp; learning to know themselues would limit their ambition, <note n="f" place="margin">

      </note> they would knowe then that nature hath enough without seeking such superfluities, and vnprofitable things, which bring nothing with them but griefe and molestation. As a fat body is more subiect to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases; so are rich men, there are many that take no heed what happeneth to others by bad conuersation, and therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowe themselues in the same manner through their own fault, not foreseeing dangers manifest.

   <p>But for as much as I vndertooke at first, that Kingdomes, Prouinces, Families, were Melancholy as well as men, I will examine them in particular, and that which I haue hitherto dilated ar randome, and in more generall termes, I will now particularly insist in, and proue with more speciall and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Arguments, Testimonies, Illustrations, &amp; that in briefe. <note n="c" place="margin">

Many men saith <note n="e" place="margin">

      <hi>Seneca, had beene without question wise, had they not had an opinion before hand, that they had attained to perfection of knowledge already, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had gone halfeway.</hi> They had too good a conceit of themselues, and that marred all; of their Worth, Art, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Iudgement, Eloquence, their good parts, all their Geese are Swannes, and that manifestly prooues them to be no better then fooles.
