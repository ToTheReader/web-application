   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing induced by some priuate reasons, and by the instant entreaty of special friends, to suffer some of my worthlesse Poems to bee published, I desired to make some written by my deere friends <hi>Anonym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>i,</hi> and my deerer Brother, to beare them company: Both without their consent, the latter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the low Country warres, and the rest vtterly ignorant thereof. My friends names I concealed; mine own and my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I willed the Printer to suppresse, as well as I had concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the other, which he hauing put in without my priuity, wee must now vndergoe a sharper censure perhaps then our nameles workes should haue done, and I especially. For if their Poems be liked, the praise is due to their inuention: if mislked, the blame both by them, and all men, will be deriued vpon me, for published that which they meant to suppresse.</p>
   <p>If thou thinke we affect fame by these kinds of writings, though I thinke them no disparagement euen to the best iudgements, yet I answer in all our behalfes, with the princely shepheard <hi>Dorus.</hi>
   </p>
   <q>Our hearts do seeke another estimation.</q>
   <p>If thou condeme Poetry in generall, and affirme that it doth intoxicate the braine, and make men vtterly vnfit, either for more serious studies, or for any actiue course of life, I only say, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bio te stultum esse libenter.</hi> Since experience proues by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of many, both dead and liuing, that diuers delighted, and excelling herein, being Princes or states-men, haue gouerned &amp; counselled as wisely: being souldiers, haue commanded armies as fortunately; being Lawyers, haue pleaded as iuditially and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently: being Diuines, haue written and taught as profoundly,
<pb facs="3"/>
and being of any other profession, haue discharged it as sufficiently as any other mē whatsoeuer. If liking other kinds, thou mislike the Lyricall, because the chiefest subiect thereof is Loue; I reply, that loue being vertuously intended, and worthily placed, is the whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of wit and spur to all generous actions: and many excellent spirits with great fame of wit, and no staine of iudgement, haue writtē excellently in this kind, &amp; specially the euer praise-worthy <hi>Sidney:</hi> So as if thou wilt needs make a fault, for mine own part
<q>
         <l>Haud timeo, si iam nequeo defendere crimen</l>
         <l>Cum tanto commune viro.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>If any except against the mixing (both at the beginning and end of this booke) of diuers things written by great and learned Personages, without meane and worthlesse scriblings, I vterly disclaime it, as being done by the Printer, either to grace the forefront with sir <hi>Philip Sidneys,</hi> and others names, or to make the booke grow to a competent volume.</p>
   <p>For these Poems in particular, I could alledge these excuses, that those vnder the name of <hi>Anonymus</hi> were written (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by diuers things to sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> liuing, and of him dead) almost twenty yeares since, when Poetry was farre from that perfection, to which it hath now attained; that my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is by profession a Souldier, and was not <hi>18.</hi> yeares old when he writ these toyes: that mine owne were made most of them <hi>6.</hi> or <hi>7.</hi> yeeres since, at idle time: as I iournied vp and down during my trauails. But to leaue their works to iustifie thēselues, or the Authors to iustifie their works, &amp; to speak of mine own; thy mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes I contemne, thy praises (which I neuer deserue, nor expect) <hi>I</hi> esteeme not, as hoping God willing, ere long, to regaine thy good opinion, if lost; or more deseruedly to continue it, if already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by some grauer worke, <hi>Farewell.</hi>
