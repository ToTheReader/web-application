      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Commend to thy freendly iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (gentle reader) this lyttle Booke, made in answere of two seditious and Traiterous Pamphlets, the one printed in French, and the other in English: wherein, if in their writings thou findest any thing, that may seeme offensiue to thy ciuill and well ordered nature, let this be thy perswasion, such as the Tree is, such is the fruit, and such as the matter is, such are those kind of mē. Thou hast already read in my former booke, a breefe setting downe of their wicked &amp; vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tresons: but shortly thou shalt haue such matter come foorth,
<pb facs="7"/>
as shall paint them foorth in their right coullours, yet not all that I knowe, for my dutie wyll not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to shewe it, nor thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie endure to reade it. And by way of curtesie let me desyre of thee, that although at sundrye times thou shalt heare such lewde speeches of me, as I were not woorthy life, if I were so euill as to deserue them: yet that thou wilt not enter into iudgement against me, before thou be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued what I am, as also what they are that mooue the slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for I know that I am o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise reported of, then I haue deserued, or they can prooue. For it is the whole felicitye of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarye, seeing hee can no way preuayle in his mischeeuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents: to rayse vp slaunders and infamous speeches, that way to
<pb facs="7"/>
discredit those, whom other wayes they are not able to iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Beholde their dealings, and be warned by them, feare God, honour thy Princesse, looue those that wish thy welfare, and in all causes commend thy selfe to the heauenly protection. </p>
