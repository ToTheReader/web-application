   <head>¶ THE TRANSLATOR to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Might well haue taken occasion (gentle Reader) to commend vnto thee, both mine own paines in trāslating and gathering this worke, the Printers charge and diligence in procuring and publishing the same, and the perfectiō of the thing it self, according to the subiect and theame wherevpon it treateth. But as touching mine own trauaile, I wil no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing speake: sithence I did vndertake the same at request of my friend (the Printer) who hath so throughly deserued my paynes, as I stand fully contented: his diligence, and charge, I thinke not meete to be ouerpassed with silēce: who to his great costs hath sought out asmuche as is written and extant in any language, concerning the noble Artes of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerie &amp; Falconrie: and to gratifie the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and Gentlemen of this land, hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursed
<pb facs="4"/>
great summes for the Copies, transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, pictures, and impressions of the same. I wil not say that he hath spared neither En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, Frenche, Latine, Italian, nor 'Dutche Author to search (as it were in the bowels of the same) an exquisite tradition &amp; methode of those two Artes. But to cōclude mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in few wordes, he hath shewed himselfe more desirous (a rare exāple) to pleasure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, thā to profit himself by this enterprise. And therwithal in his behalf, I must alledge, that as the studies of Diuinitie, &amp; graue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses are (without all cōparison) most cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēdable, euen so yet could he haue trauayled in no one Arte or Science (them excepted) which might haue bene more cōmendable or necessary for al Noblemen &amp; Gentlemen: not only for the delightfulnes therof, but also bicause it is both profitable and godly. For if (as <hi>Salomon</hi> sayeth) all earthly things be vanities, then are those moste to be esteemed which may continew the life of Man in most
<pb facs="4"/>
comfort and godly quiet of mynd, with honest recreatiō. And if it be true (as it is doutlesse) that pride (which is roote of al vices,) doth increase by idlenes, thē is that exercise high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be cōmended, which doth maintaine the body in helth, the mynd in honest meditatiōs, &amp; yet the substance not greatly decaied. For these causes I haue always allowed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their opinions, which do more esteeme Hūting thā Hawking. Sithens we do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">The Falconer sayth no.</note> perceiue, that Hūting is mainteined with much lesser charge. And to return to my first begon purpose, I cōmend to thy curteous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider atiō (gentle reader) both my trauel, and the Printers charge: assuring thee, that as much as could cōueniently be foūd out either in authoritie, or conference, is here expressed, for thy better knowledge in Venerie. Take it in gree, &amp; be as thankeful vnto the Printer for his good wil &amp; honest mening, as he hath bin vnto me for my study and trauell herein. And so farewell:</p>
