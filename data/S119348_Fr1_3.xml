   <head>To the most Noble and thrice Honorable <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> Lord Steward of his <hi>Maiesties houshold, and Chancellour</hi> of the Vniuersity of OXFORD.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, though vnknowne vnto your Lordshippe, but by a relation made vnto your Honour of my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels and obseruations beyond the seas, your Lordshippe vouchsafed to grant mee your Letters of fauour to the Vniuersity of <hi>Oxford</hi> for the furthering of mee in the printing a booke entituled, <hi>The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Spanish Pilgrime:</hi> and now hauing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht the same, I should thinke my selfe most happy, if it would please your Lordship to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and fauour these rude lines, not looking vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the meane vnderstanding of the Authour, but the good will and affection wherewith I haue written them; to wit, for the honour of God, and good of my Countrey: wherein I doe especially dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer diuerse subtilties and policies, of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
Iesuites, Fryers, Monkes and other Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Priests beyond the seas, as likewise our <hi>English</hi> fugitiues vnder the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Dominions, and the wrong I receiued in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to mine owne true Religion. I doe therefore most humbly beseech your Honor that you would be pleased to take this booke vnder your protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the furthering of my 'cause, and repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of my aduersaries, and I shall euer pray for the much increase of your Lordships health and Honour. The booke I dare not say deserues your fauour, it being a greater token of Nobility in you to Patronize with your greatnesse that which is meane in it selfe, then onely to bee fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, where merit may challenge liberality; yet in it selfe the worke is religiously disposed to the discouering of truth, and that all which are any whit inclined to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> may see the vaile vnmaskt wherwith they were hoodwinkt. I detaine your Honour no longer, but with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle digression from you to that God, whom I humbly implore to preserue your Lordship the yeeres of my desire, which is as vnlimited as your Nobility.</p>
