   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is nowe a good while since (deare Christian Reader) that this maister <hi>Stapletons</hi> Counterblast was blowne ouer the seas from <hi>Louaine,</hi> against the Reuerende father in Christe, the Bishop of Winchester, or rather against the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Maiestie and hir Supremacie, &amp; was thus farre answered vnto, as here is nowe set foorth. Which may easily be perceiued by the reading, for there is little or nothing altered, except a sentence or two here &amp; there added, as things haue falne out since. I speake this, that thou shouldest not here loke for any great or exquisite penning, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that after so lōg a leysure some more notable and exacter answere should come forth. Our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries vaunt much of their wittes herein, and chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>y this my matefellow master <hi>Stapleton,</hi> to be verie fresh &amp; pregnant in readinesse of answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, for he is his mothers sonne, and hath it on his fingers ends. Howbeit, I may say to these, as <hi>Apelles</hi> sayd to one, who when he had drawne a picture: Lo (quoth he) I did this apace. Some thinkes (quoth <hi>Apelles</hi>) it is so rūningly done. And thus it falleth often out with our <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>anists</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but <hi>Sat cito si sat bene,</hi> It is soone ynough if it be well inough, (say I) when all is done.</p>
   <p>The reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> why this answere came forth no
<pb facs="6"/>
soner, are these. First, I kept it priuate to my self, abyding if either the Bishop, against whome it was made, or any other woulde aunswere to it. Secondly, I heard at the length, that Maister Nowell the Deane of Poules trauayled in it, whose learning and wisedome being suche as all the aduersaries could neuer withstand: I surcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to proceede any further. Thirdly, when I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued he set not out his answere neither, I thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght it best to lay myne asyde also. Thinking that either he was stayed vpō som weightier conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than I did know: or else that he did thinke the boke not worth the answering at al (as in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed, to the lerned marker it is not) &amp; M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel had answered <hi>Dorman</hi> in muche like matter before, which were y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> occasiōs why it slept so lōg.</p>
   <p>But since that time, as many haue mused and talked much on the matter, so they haue not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle marueiled why nothing was said vnto it. The argument was great and waightie, not so muche whether nowe the Supremacie belonged to the Pope, as whether it pertained to the ciuil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and whether the Queenes Maiestie did claime and hold it by right or no, The parties in controuersie were of note, as wel master Fecken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham among the Papistes, as the Bishop of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, whose estimation among vs, is not more for his authoritie, than his name amōg other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for his learning. Nowe when Master <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi> stept in lyke a lustie yoncker, and blewe vp
<pb facs="6"/>
this Counterblast betwene these twain, so hotly hallowing for answer out of hande to be made by the Bishop therto, &amp; al this while had none: some did interprete it, that he was a very vnfit matche for so graue a Bishop, as (to say y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> truth) the match was nothing euen. And therefore I wite not the Bishop, if he vouchsafed not to answer him, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seing home his booke was so pestred with scoldes and scorners Rhetorike. Neither will the horse of noble corage strike at euery brauling curre that barks at his heeles. But when others misse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōstrued this to the worst, &amp; said the Counterblast was so notably blown, that the Bishop durst not, nor was able, he nor any other to answer it: &amp; whē vpon the head of all this M. Saunders Latine volume cōmes forth, although chiefly on the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes visible Monarchie, yet once again entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this questiō of the Princes Supremacie, with fresh matter (&amp; as he bosteth) with such inuincible arguments against it, that all are but vnlearned, starke fooles, and cleane madde that do defend it: and not thus content, so depresseth the Princes estate, that he will now proue the Pope hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to depose al Christian Princes, and release their s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

            </gap>,</hi> vvhiche argument Thomas Stapleton hathe moste copiously handeled in that booke, vvhiche beeing replenished vvith all eloquence and learning, he set foorth against Horne the false Bishop of VVinchester.</hi> So storn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully this rayling Papiste speaketh of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and so he braggeth of his fellowes lerning and eloquence. All whiche considered, I thought it necessarie and more than high tyme, to answer these proude Phariseis, least the goodnesse of the cause should become distrusted, the truth suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Prince slaundered, the Bishop defaced, the enimie encouraged, the godlie offended, the simple abused, and the whole estate euill spoken of, by too muche vnfrutefull silence, and ouerlong suffrance of such false and glorious pratlers. And although for these causes I was the willinger to sette it foorth, yet was I the more emboldned on the request of diuerse, that hearing I had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed in it, by their godlie persuasions vrged me the more thereto.</p>
   <p>The chiefe of the Argument consisteth on <hi>the Supreme gouernement of Christian Princes in causes Ecclesiasticall.</hi> The occasion sprang of a controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie betweene the Bishop of Winchester, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Feckenhā, about the Oth of the Supremacie. All which is extant abroade in a learned and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie booke of the Bishops, answering to maister Feckenhams scruples. The issue they draue the matter vnto, was this, that maister Feckenham
<pb facs="7"/>
must be resolued for <hi>the Princes Supreme Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Ecclesiasticall causes,</hi> by any of these foure meanes, <hi>the Scripture, the Doctours, the Councels, or the Practise.</hi> The Bishop accepteth the offer, and maketh proofe of <hi>the Princes Supreme gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Ecclesiasticall causes,</hi> not onely by any one, but by euery one of all these forsayd poyntes, as the Bishops booke is euident to testifie. Maister Feckenham that had made his promise to take the Oth vponany of these proues, and seing them all (beyond his cunning and expectation) proued, but neither mynding to keepe touche, nor able to answere: suborneth a chapman from beyond the seas, to wit, this <hi>Louanist</hi> maister <hi>Stapleton,</hi> (if he may be called Maister, for order of schole degree, that is suche a renegate from God, and runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from his Prince) who to saue maister Fec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenhams honestie, if he woulde aduenture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue his cause: master Feckenham should to saue his credite, vouchesafe to relieue his neede.</p>
   <p>Master <hi>Stapleton</hi> hauing better furniture of sale eloquence, than store of grounded learning, and yet more learning than grace well to imploy it, in acknowledging the manyfest truth, taketh vpon him to aunswere the Bishop, and deuides all the matter into foure Bookes, whereof this is the fyrst, that here is answered. This doone, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth suche apride of this his exquisite piece of worke, that we must needes haue some fyne new name for this fyne newe booke, (singular heads
<pb facs="8"/>
ye know, must haue singular inuentions) and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Bishops name is <hi>M. Horne,</hi> he entitleth his worke forsooth a Counterblast. And yet som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what truer than he himselfe wist, beeing in deed a <hi>blast,</hi> scarce worth a <hi>Counter,</hi> if the reader well examine it.</p>
   <p>And that ye maye the better perceiue, this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume deserues so rare a name, for these two rare gifts, eloquence and learning, for which maister <hi>Sanders</hi> so highly extolleth him (<hi>Mulus mulum sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit:</hi>) And sith these two champions beare now the bell for eloquence among the Papists, the one for English, the other for Latine: I haue sorted mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Stapletons</hi> eloquence by it self, consisting on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cōmon places folowing, that we may the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier iudge of the substance of his learning, whiche otherwise we should not so well discerne, it is so poudred with his eloquence. His eloquence (I confesse) I haue sayde but little vnto, nor can say muche, nor would say ought vnto it, as one that neuer was trained vp in the scholes and arte ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. As for maister <hi>Stapleton</hi> goeth beyond maister <hi>Saunders,</hi> and withoute all comparison is an <hi>A perse</hi> Doctor in it, and therfore I set it asyde, the better to viewe the learning, to the whiche I had more especiall regarde, for when all is done, the Eloquence settes it out, but the Learning proues the matter. And though it be not replyed vpon with suche learning as many other better coulde, that rather shoulde haue doone it, yet
<pb facs="8"/>
haue I endeuored truly, simply and playnely to answere it, and (I hope) to the cōtentation of the modest Reader, that rather respecteth the boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ing out of the truthe, the staye of his conscience, and the glorie of God, than either the estimation of learning, or the shewe of eloquence.</p>
   <p>Nowe although the Supremacie be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall matter, yet the importunitie of maister <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi> hath once or twice caried me perforce away with him, to purge our selues of certain auncient Herekes that he layeth to our charge, and crieth so faste vpon vs for answere, and sayeth we styll slinke from it, as though we hearde it not, and therefore I haue here at large made aunswere to it, which makes the volume aryse the bigger. In somuche that I thought, for all maister <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletons</hi> exclamations, to haue lefte it out, or put it in one of his Common places. But that Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Saunders</hi> commeth rufflyng in wyth the like argument, and therefore I lette it stande as it did. And I truste I haue cleerely disburdened vs, and iustly burdened them therewyth, tyll they shall be hable to discharge themselues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I desyre (good Reader) but euen indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in thy iudgement.</p>
   <p>Last of all, since Master <hi>Sanders</hi> hath compiled his great volume of the Popes Uisible Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, in the secōd book wherof he entreth into this argumēt of the Princes Supremacie: I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen out of the second booke. 4. chapters of the state
<pb facs="9"/>
of the Ciuil and Ecclesiastical power, in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, in the Use, and End of both: of the Interest and superioritie of either state: chiefly of that he would not only defeate the Prince of all gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters Ecclesiasticall, but also clean dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possesse hir Maiestie of hir Crowne. For, maister <hi>Saunders,</hi> to mayntein the trecherous fact of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>us</hi> the fift, the last Pope, (if Cardinal <hi>Bon Compag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> Pope Good fellowe, as the talke wente, be not deade) woulde proue, that Bishops may depose their Princes, and assoyle their subiectes from their allegeance. Whiche poyntes as they draw nerest to the present argument, and in deed are for learning (suche learning as it is) the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall pointes of all his volume, I thought good to ioy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> them vnto <hi>Stapleton,</hi> and so in one answer, answere both, though both be answered seueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they drawe neere or farre, in resemblance or varietie of Argument, example, or similitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute this matter. Wherein what is doone, I committe vnto thee (good Christian Reader) to iudge as God shall moue thy heart, and besecche thou him, to moue it to the best, That the truth may appeare, that the falshode may be detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that thou mayst be edified, that the Prince may be obeyed, that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel maye be prospered, and that God aboue al things may be glorified nowe and for euer.</p>
