      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Axle tree of the Worlde is a right line,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The Axle trre of the world.</hi>
      </note> imagined to passe through the Center or midst of the earth, from the one ende of heauen to the other: the vpper ende of which Axle trée is called the Pole Artike, that is to say, the North Pole:<note place="margin">
         <hi>The two Poles.</hi>
      </note> &amp; the nether end, the Pole Antartike, that is, the South Pole: vpon which two Poles, otherwise called the hooks or hengils of the world, the heauens doe turne rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the earth. Moreouer the Cosmographers doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the worlde into diuers partes by certaine Circles, whereof some are called greater, and some lesser.</p>
   <p>The greater are those which doe deuide the world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 2 equall partes:<note place="margin">
         <hi>The greter Circle.</hi>
      </note> whereof there be 6: that is, the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, the Zodiake, the Meridian, the Horizon, and the 2 Colures.</p>
   <p>The Equinoctiall is a great Circle,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall.</hi>
      </note> girding the world in the verie midst betwixt the 2 Poles, by reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are two latitudes, the one Northern, &amp; the other Southerne.</p>
   <p>The Northerne latitude is that space,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The north latitude.</hi>
      </note> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined betwixt the Equinoctiall and the North Pole.</p>
   <p>The Southerne latitude is that space,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The South latitud.</hi>
      </note> which is contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned betwixt the Equinoctial &amp; the South Pole: and either of these two spaces conteineth in bredth 90 degrées.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>A Degree.</hi>
      </note>A Degrée is one part of a Circle, béeing deuided into 360 partes called degrées.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Longitude.</hi>
      </note>Againe, the circuit of the Equinoctial, containing 360 degrées, is the verie longtitude of the Earth: the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of which longitude beginneth at the the first Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, placed in the West, and so procéedeth Eastward vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the 180 degrée of the Equinoctiall, and from thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth by the West vntill you come againe to the 360 degree, which is the last degree of longitude. And note by the way that euerie degrée of the Equinoctiall contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth 60 English miles, so as the longitude of the whole Earth is 21600 miles.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>The Zodiake,</hi>
      </note>The Zodiake is a great, broad, and slope or shoring Circle, carrying the 12 Signes: in the middest whereof is a line called the Ecliptike line, from which the Sun neuer swarueth.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>The Meridian</hi>
      </note>The Meridian is a greate Circle, passing ouer our heades, in what parte of the World soeuer we be, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so through both the Poles: which line when the Sunne toucheth it aboue the Horizon, it is Noonetide or midday to those that dwell vnder the same.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>The Horison.</hi>
      </note>The Horizon is a great Circle, deuiding the vpper halfe of the World which we sée, from the nether halfe which wee see not: in the the very middest or Center of which Circle, if in a plaine field you looke rounde about you, you shall alwaies finde your selfe to be.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>The 2 Colures</hi>
      </note>Now as touching the two Colures, because they differ not in effect, though in name, from two Meridians, I leaue to speake of them, aswell for that I haue spoken of them at large in my Sphere, as also for that they are not mentioned in this Treatise.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>4 lesser circles</hi>
      </note>Of the lesser Circles there be foure: that is, the two Polar Circles,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The Circles Artike and Antartike.</hi>
      </note> and the two Tropikes. Of the two Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Circles, the one enuironeth the North Pole, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called the Circle Artike, &amp; the other enuironeth the South Pole, and is called the Circle Antartike, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="4"/>
it is opposit to the other.</p>
   <p>Again, of the two Tropiques, the one is placed betwixt the Equinoctiall and the Circle Artike,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The Tropike of Cancer.</hi>
      </note> and is called the Tropike of <hi>Cancer</hi>: and the other is placed betwixt the Equinoctiall and the Circle Antartike, and is called the Tropike of <hi>Capricorne</hi>:<note place="margin">
         <hi>The Tropike of Capricorn.</hi>
      </note> and each of these Tropikes is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the Equinoctiall 23 degrees and a halfe, which is the greatest declination of the Sun from the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The greatest declination of the Sun.</hi>
      </note> for he neuer mounteth higher then the Tropique of <hi>Cancer,</hi> nor descendeth lower then the Tropike of <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne,</hi> and these two Circles are Paralels to the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall.</p>
   <p>Paralels are 2 lines or Circles,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Paralels.</hi>
      </note> equally distant in all places one from another. And by these foure lesser Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles the Earth is deuided into 5 Zones or broade spaces,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Zones.</hi>
      </note> whereof there be two colde. 2 temperate, and one hotte described both in my Sphere and also in this treatise.</p>
   <p>A Paralell of the longest day,<note place="margin">
         <hi>A Paralell of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> longest day.</hi>
      </note> is a space of the Earth, wherein the day increaseth by one quarter of an hower, procéeding from Equinoctiall towards any of the Poles.<note place="margin">
         <hi>A Clyme.</hi>
      </note>
   </p>
   <p>A Clime is a space of the Earth, conteining two such Paralells wherein the day increaseth by halfe an hower, of which Clymes according to the old Writers, there be 7 declared at the full in my Sphere, and also somewhat touched in this Treatise.</p>
