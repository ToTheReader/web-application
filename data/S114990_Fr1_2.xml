      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a method in all arts, and a mystery, but in none more then in the <hi>art of thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> being the very Center to which all the other arts doe tend, and for which they were invented. <hi>Magister artis venter,</hi> and what is that but Thriving? Now in the study of this great art, you must make the world your Liberary, and learne to reade men as well as bookes: and yet not to discourage you in the whole volume of this
<pb facs="3"/>science, you are to turne over but three leaves, onely some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what close writ, very hard to reade, and when you are once out, can hardly begin againe: Times, Trades, and Debts, this is that screw of a three fold twinding; for if you screw not your fortunes the right way, as it is in all screwes, you may turne and work your heart out, remember but that first: And let me tell you, Time is the hinge of all thriving, Trades are the doores on which good hopes may turn, and stand long enough; if Debts those under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining leavers of husbandry, fling not all off the hooks. Thus then thinke with your selfe, to Time a businesse well, and to
<pb facs="3"/>begin businesse in time, is the very key to the door of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thinke the losse of a minute more dear than the losse of a pound; for certainly of all expences, the expence of Time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s the costliest: which, mindefull reader, that thou mayst know now, learn to prize and reckon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hy time right: for as <hi>Seneca</hi> said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o <hi>Lucilius, quem mihi dabis qui aliquod pretium tempori ponat? qui diem estimet? qui intelligat se quotidie mori:</hi> and therfore that made him say in the beginning of the same Epistle to <hi>Lucilius, vindica te tibi,</hi> as if a man were to be revenged upon himselfe for hasting his owne death by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>osse of Time. Now therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hat thou maist know how to
<pb facs="4"/>take and redeeme thy Time. I have here set before thee, a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of each minute of thy life, this is the first leafe, and now I passe to the next, having not time to speake of Time.</p>
   <p n="2">2 All men are or would be rich; even the sluggard wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, though he hath not: 'Tis easie indeed to covet the top of wit or preferment, but to get up the hill, <hi>hic labor, hoc opus;</hi> there is a businesse indeed! the wayes to thrive are manifold, yet one good is worth all, and in effect is all: onely all the Art is finding and catching it: Could <hi>Archimedes</hi> but have found foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for his Mathematicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, he would have done wonders.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <q>
      <l>Give me but footing where my selfe may stand,</l>
      <l>From their fixt Base I'le hoyst both sea and land.</l>
   </q>
   <p>Boldly spoke, and bravely meant; and questionlesse, if you could have done the one for him, he would have perform'd the other for you: Thinke not, thriftie would be, that I by his example enjoyn the impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or to build castles in the ayre, but meerely to shew thee how out of nothing to produce something, and thus I apply it. Could a young man once take hold or setling in preferment, where he may but fixe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of his hopes, then may he easily drive the world before
<pb facs="5"/>him, and so mount up to wealth. Now who is able to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell to a beginner the shortest cut, or score him the very way to thrive, if he either stand in his owne light through wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or cut the throat as it were of all his hopes, through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of better; the foole thus concluding with himselfe, <hi>He that's borne under a three-penny Planet, shall never be worth a groat.</hi> To him, and to him I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate not. What should I talke to such of Promotion? But to a forward spirit, and a manly heart, prepared for industry, and resolved to stand to his curse in Paradice, I commend this my Grammar of Trades. Nor thinke hopefull Reader I
<pb facs="5"/>have prefixt a specious title to make the sale more oylie, I would I were dead if I care whether you buy or burne it, onely I would have thee reade and be wise, labour and be rich.</p>
   <p>The old Paradox is witry and true. <hi>Quisque suae fortunae, faber.</hi> Every man sits at the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile and forge of his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-making: now then if you can see to strike the Iron, while it is hot, that is, while time and the hand of Providence hold forth the opportunity, you may make your trade, but if you lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger till it be cold, it will cost you another Heate. <hi>Experto mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi credite.</hi> Now therefore that no man may over-slip his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, or be pusled for want of
<pb facs="6"/>light, to see when it is offered, or to conduct him forward, when it is found, Loe here a Torch held out before him, pointing the plaine high way to preferment, in all Professions, Trades, and Arts, found out by an old traveller in the Sea of Experience, <hi>Longis erroribus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus, qui mores Hominum, &amp;c.</hi> who now stands after all his folly, and ruines, a Land-marke, to the generall good of others.</p>
   <p>To the Father and his sonnes, to the Mother and every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers childe, to the Scholler, the Apprentice, the Navigator, the Husbandman, the Courtier, and the Souldier, whether in hopes or in despaire, standing, rising, or falling, I bequeath
<pb facs="6"/>this my Legacy, my Looking-glasse to promotion, my Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar of Trades.</p>
   <p n="3">3 And since in the voyage to Promotion, Lending is the Rocke, and Borrowing is the Gulfe, I have discovered them both in the end, lest your ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der endeavours should tare against the one, or be swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the other. Farewell, and where you see me, if you meane to Thrive, looke to your selfe.</p>
