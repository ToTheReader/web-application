   <p>I Do judge these Reverend Devines
faithfull, and therefore one occasion
I will hould communion with them
in the worship of God, and although
they do in some things practise some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,
which I dare not partake in,
yet I do professe to hould communion
with them in all holy parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and because we do thus practise:

send him with his Letters to the Bishopp,<note place="margin">Iohn Can proved a false acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser.</note>

there are sundry Congregations, which
have agreed with their Patrons, that they
choose and call their Pastor. And sundry
Gentlemen, fearing God, which are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
and do use to advise with the most

of one, wherein they do take the advise
of learned Devines, approvin him, and he
is choosen by that Church, before the
Bishops see him; and therefore Dr. Ames<note place="margin">Fol. 234.</note>
his sentence is true, allthough <hi>Iohn</hi> CAN
revile him for it; and he after in the same
book doth justifie this course of chusing
by the Congregation, to be good, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

against M. Robinson, and tryed, if he cold
hav don more thē M. Robinson have don,
for ther is his cause proved erronious, &amp;
it is in other books provd fals, in denying
the Grace of God, given us in Iesus
Christ. He doth know, there are books
have been published this 16 years, which
have proved sundry artikels of their faith
false and erronious, yet <hi>Iohn Can</hi> dare not
write against till the Authours be dead.</p>
   <p>It appeareth unto me, <hi>Iohn Can</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the right calling of a Teacher in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, because he putts no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt Election, Approbation, &amp;
Ordination, which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Word of God
doth distinguish, yet in his book he count
them all one thing.</p>
   <p>He writeth, they practise nothing, but
that the Teachers of our Church have
affirmed to be truth, which I manifest, is
not so: for, we affirm, God hath ordained
Schooles, to educate and fitt men to be
teachers in his Church, and such are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
instruments, to increase heavenly
graces. This we hold, is a worke of Faith,
for us, to heare them preach, which <hi>Iohn
Can</hi> do condemne, Act. 13. 15.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="71" facs="36"/>
We doe beleeve the communion of
Saints, and thus the Church have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
since the Apostles dayes, and
though <hi>Iohn Can</hi> doth confesse, they
were first converted by our Ministerie,
yet he condemneth those that doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in that holy worship, contrary to the
Counsell of the Holy Ghost, in dispising
Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ie, Thess. 5. 20.</p>
   <p>He writes himself Pastor of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
English Church,<note place="margin">Yet those that chose him, and ordained him, did depose him, they say, for that he deceived them.</note> and he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
all the divines of our nation, that
there is not one a lawfull teacher in this
age, but himselfe, yet it appeareth, he is
ignorant of the grounds of Religion.
Hebr. 6. 2.</p>
   <p>Whereas <hi>John Can</hi> doe command all
those which do denie his grounds, to sett
downe their names, and the place where
they dwell, I desire of him to shew his
commission, for I think he is vainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saited,
and one that doth not know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
therefore fare unfitt to reprove
those, which have laboured more yeares
in studie then he hath monts. See his
Booke Folio 60.</p>
