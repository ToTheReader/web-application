   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here present vnto your view, what was first meditated by your appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it had neuer beene penned but for you, and therefore it doth of right appertayne vnto you. I confesse that at the time of the deliuerie hereof, the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my memorie was such as neuer before I had experience of in a Pulpit, by reason whereof I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-slipped many things. And that was one speciall motiue that made me the more willing to commit it to the Presse, that what was purposed and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be preached, but through debilitie of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was not vttered with the mouth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be heard with the eare, might yet at length be seene with the eye. If this poore labour
<pb facs="3"/>of mine shall finde entertaynement with you, as a testimonie of my thankefulnesse for your vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued kindnesse towards me, and of that respectiue loue and louing respect I beare you: and if it may be a meanes of the least good vnto any Christian soule into whose hands it shal come, I haue enough. And thus I commend you to God, beseeching him to keepe you by his power through faith vnto saluation; and will for euer rest</p>

      <signed>Yours in all Christian dutie, IOHN COMYNS.</signed>
