Our Dauid Henry theight hath alreadye so substancially cast the foundacion, and reised the buildyng of the Temple, that I trust it shalbe no burden for our young Salomō to consummate and fynyshe the same whan his tyme shall cum.

Whiche cōmaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement whan it came firste vnto me in your graces name although I knewe how litle it was that I could do in this kinde, yet was I glad that your cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente dyd so iustlye concurre with the determinacion of myne owne minde and purpose. For I had long time afore with mature deliberaciō and also with aduised eleccion apointed with my self to trāslate this paraphrase vpon Luke, assoone as any suche libertie might be, and to make it vnto your grace a testificacion of my duetie and thankefull remembraunce of your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfolde benefites afore doen to me of your mere bountie. And two thynges there were that had moued me to take this prouince most specially in hand, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>e because that as Luke is the longest of all the Euangelistes, so is he of al men noted to haue written his gospel moste exactely, aswell by relacion of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Apostles which were present and conuersaunt with Christ while he liued on earth, as also by the instruccions of Paul, who was moste earneste and full in the iustificacion of feith, and most piththy against the iustificacion of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des (albeit they do al in this poynte of doctrine throughly consēt and agre.) The secōd was, for that Erasmus who did in this paraphrase bestow more diligēce then in most of the others, had specially dedicated thesame vnto our most noble king Henry theight. And I thought I could not deuise any apter gift to presēt his most dere beloued wife withal beyng of the like zele, affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, godlines, &amp; deuocion that he is, then thesame worke, trāslated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe, whiche I certainly knew his maiestie to had singularly well allowed and moste graciously accepted in latine, and in perusyng thereof to be daylye

excedyng muche delighted. And I nothyng doubt, most gracious Lady, but that the readyng therof should cause no lesse delectacion of mind to you, yf y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> thing were so well doen as sum mā of more learnyng perchaūce coulde haue doē it. And in this behalf none other refuge I haue but to your most benigne fauour and pardone well to accept mine honest herte, mine earneste zele, and willing labours. For as touching the translacion selfe, though I iudge and plainly confesse my self to be by many degrees inferiour in knowledge &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to all the others whom I heare that your highnes hath appoynted to the translating of the other partes, and though I cannot of my self promesse any hablenes to take such a prouince in hand: yet (my hart better seruyng me hereunto then perchaunce my hande hath doen) whan I sawe that your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces resolucion &amp; pleasure did helpe to minister courage to myne own hertes desire, I conceiued boldenesse to attempt &amp; enterprise the thing, &amp; thought it most expedient to shew mine obedience &amp; prompt good wil to do your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, trusting that though I haue not been hable in all behalfes and pointes requisite, fully to discharge y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> office of a good trāslatour, yet I haue expressed y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sēce &amp; meaning of the autour. As for the grace of the latine tonge I thinke vnpossible to be liuely expressed, as this autour doth it in the latine by reason of sundry allusions, diuerse prouerbes, many figures, and exorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciōs retoricall, with Metaphores innumerable, whiche cannot with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lyke grace be rendred in any other lāguage thē in the latine, or greke, besydes that an infinite sorte of wordes there be, whose full importyng cannot with one mere Englishe worde equiualently be interpreted. And this imperfeccion I haue to my litle power so laboured to redoub, that I trust there be not any poynte of piththie significacion any where conteyned, whiche I haue not in one or other place of the sentence by sum meanes throughly touched. And for as muche as I consider it to be a paraphrase, that is to say, a playn settyng foorth of the sence of the texte with as many woordes as the circumstaunce therof for the better linking of one sentence to an other doth require, I haue not so precisely bound my self to euery woord and sillable of the letter, but that I haue takē more respect to thexplanacion and declaring of the sēce, thē to the noumbre of the latine syllables. In translatyng of the very texte I thinke it requisite to vse sum scrupulositie (&amp; if the translatours were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together so precise as they are, but had sum more regard to expressing of the sence, I thinke in my iudgemente they should doe better) but in a paraphrase which of it selfe is a kynd of exposiciō and of cōmentary, I thinke it nothing nedefull to be so precise in the wordes, so the sence be kepte. And this I dare auouche, that yf any interpretour shoulde in sum places bee as breefe in the English translacion as the autour is in the latine: he should make thereof but a darke piece of worke. For that is the onely thyng that maketh the very text selfe so derke as it appeareth to be. In Luke I haue had sum what the more businesse, because that the Latine exemplaries (thorough whose defaulte of negligence I am vncertayne,) do vary and not well agree, sum hauing more or lesse then others, sum hauyng an other woorde than an other copye hath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Whereby I haue in sum places been driuen to vse myne owne iudgemente in rendrynge the true sence of the boke, to speake nothyng of a great noumbre of sentences, whiche by reason of so many membres, or parentheses, or digressions as haue cum in place,

Sum loue it whan it is style like, &amp; sum care for no more but the bare sence. But eloquence of it selfe, and copie (that is to say shift of termes) is a vertue in an oracion, and that thing chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly geueth to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

What other thyng commendeth Chaucer &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his woorkes to be more set by then thousandes of other freashe hastye bokes hastily shootying forth lyke May floures, and not wythering but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diyng with the first readying? Neuerthelesse no man of our tyme and in our Englishe toungue (which none but our selfes for our own vse do muche passe on,) writeth so ornately, but that he hath in sundry woordes &amp; phrases sum smatche of his natiue countrey phrases, that he was borne in. Yet this notwithstandyng sum there be, whiche haue a mynde to renew termes that are now almoste worne clene out of vse, whiche I do not disalowe, so it bee doen with iudgement. Sum others would ampliate and enrich their natiue language with mo vocables whiche I also commend, if it be aptely and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily assaied. So that if any other doe innouate and bryng vp a woorde to me afore not vsed or not heard, I would not disprasse it: and that I do attempt to bryng to vse, another man should not cauayle at. For an easy thyng it is to depraue, and a small glory for one man, in matters of nothing, to laboure to deface an other. But for as muche as both do our beste, we ought rather thus to thinke the one of the other.</p>

And what if one labour to enrich his countrey lāguage, as Tullie glorieth that he did amplify the latine tonge, is he therfore to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and not rather to be commended?
