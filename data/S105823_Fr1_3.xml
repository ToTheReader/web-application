                 <title>Greenes carde of fancie : Wherein the folly of those carpet knights is deciphered, which guiding their course by the compass of Cupid, either dash their ship against most dangerous rocks, or else attaine the haven with pain and perill. Wherein also is described in the perso of Gwydonius a cruell combate between nature and necessitie. By Robert Green, Master of Art, in Cambridge</title>

      </seg>AN blowing vpon an Oten pipe a little homely Musick, and hearing no man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise his small cunning, began both to plaie so loud, and so long, that they were more wearie in hearing his musick, than he in shewing his skill; till at last to clawe him and excuse themselues, they said his pipe was out of tune: So Gentlemen, because I haue before time rashly reacht above my pitch, and yet your curtesie such as no man hath accused me, I haue once again aduentured vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon your patience; but (I doubt) so farre, as to be rid of my follie, you will at the last say, as <hi>Augustus</hi> sayde to the Grecian, that gave him oft times many rude verses: Thou hast need (quoth hee) reward mee well; for I take more paines to read thy works, than thou to write them. But yet willing to abide this quip, because I may coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruaile it with your former curtesie, I put my selfe to your patience, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you to the Almighty. Farewell. {inverted ⁂}</p>
