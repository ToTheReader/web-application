   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL M. Ioseph Bainham Esquire, and to Mistresse Ione Bainham his Wife.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, when J call to minde the reuerent and holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that godly Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr both of your name, countrie, and house, M. <hi>Iames Bain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who died most constantly for the truth of the Gospell, as we haue his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at large described in M. <hi>Fox,</hi> pag. 1030. and consider withall the great mercie of God, in continuing still vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that VVorshipfull name and stocke, the same light of faith, and zeale of the truth, and holynes of profession: J no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="3"/>doubt to say vnto you, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the holy Apostle wrote vnto Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie, <hi>When I call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the vnfayned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy Grandmother Lois, and in thy Mother Eunice, and am assured that it dwelleth in thee also,</hi> 2. Tim. 1.5. So it cannot be but a great ioy and comfort to those that feare God, to see the posteritie of Martyrs, to retayne still the holy faith and profession of Martyrs: not only to be of their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly linage, but of the spirituall kindred also: not to be next them only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but to folow them in regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this example of your owne cloth, as it is vnto vs an occasion of reioycing, so to you it must serue, not as a spur to pricke you, but as a starre to direct you, and a line to leade &amp; draw
<pb facs="3"/>you forward to al holy encrease of faith and zeale. That holy man, as he was vertuous in his life, deuoute in prayer, sound in faith, patient in his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; so most of all was he constant and cheerefull in his death: who in the midst of his torments, and out of the raging flames of fire, thus spake with a comfortable and heauenly voyce: <hi>O yee Papists, behold, yee looke for miracles, &amp; here now you may see a miracle, for in this fire I feele no more paine, then if I were in a bed of downe: but it is to me as sweet as a bed of Roses.</hi> How ought wee now to honor the memorie of this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed man, and how much are you to praise God, that hath giuen you out of your worshipfull house so worthie an example and encouragement to all Christian proceeding? J saye againe
<pb facs="4"/>with the same Apostle. <hi>Wherefore I put you in remembrance that you stirre vp the gift of God in you, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Timoth. 1.6. And J doubt not, but that as it is true generally in the Church: <hi>Sanguis Martyrum semen Ecclesiae:</hi> the blood of the Martyrs is the seede of the Church: so more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in your familie, that it hath been blessed of God, and made fruitefull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seasoned as it were by the blood of so holy a man. Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, <hi>Passio Christi sufficit ad salutem, passio Martyrum contulit ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplum:</hi> Christs death sufficient to saluation, the Martyrs death is effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall for example and instruction. You haue both Christs holy passion to saue you, and this Martyrs worthy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and confession to instruct you. The memorie of this excellent man gaue me
<pb facs="4"/>occasion to present this Sermon vnto you, which came to my hands, which contayneth a profession of the same faith for the which he dyed, in you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerencing his remembrance, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his faith: God graunt vs all the like zeale and holynes in our liues, that wee may haue the like comfort and cheerefulnes in our end.</p>
