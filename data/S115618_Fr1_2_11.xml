   <head>On the death of <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Randolph.</hi>
   </head>
   <lg>
      <l>VVHen <hi>Donne,</hi> and <hi>Beaumont</hi> dyed, an Epitaph</l>
      <l>Some men (I well remember) thought unsafe;</l>
      <l>And said they did <hi>presume to write, unlesse</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>They could their teares in their expression dresse.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>But love makes me more bold, and telles me I</l>
      <l>In humble termes to vent my piety</l>
      <l>May safely dare; and reason thinks not fit,</l>
      <l>For which I lov'd, I now should feare that wit.</l>
      <l>Respect lookes like a bargaine, if confinde</l>
      <l>To rules precise; and is more just then kinde.</l>
      <l>If by a poiz'd and equall testament</l>
      <l>It turnes good-will, into a covenant;</l>
      <l>Must every present offer'd to a Prince</l>
      <l>Be just proportion'd to his eminence?</l>
      <l>Or ought my <hi>Elegy</hi> unjust be thought</l>
      <l>Because I cannot mourne thee as I ought?</l>
      <l>Such lawes as these, (if any be so bold)</l>
      <l>Ought those unskilfull but proud soules to hold,</l>
      <l>Who think they could and did, at a due rate</l>
      <l>Love thee; not mee, whose love was passionate,</l>
      <l>And hath decreed▪ how ere the censure goe,</l>
      <l>Thus much, although but thus, to let men know.</l>
      <l>I doe admire no Comet did presage</l>
      <l>The mournfull period of thy wonder'd age;</l>
      <l>Or that no <hi>Sybill</hi> did thy death fore tell,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="12"/>Since that by it alone more ill befell</l>
      <l>The <hi>Laurell-God,</hi> then when the day was come</l>
      <l>Wherein his <hi>Delphick-Oracle</hi> was dumbe:</l>
      <l>In meaner wits that proverbe chance may hold</l>
      <l>(That they which are soon ripe are seldome old)</l>
      <l>But 'twas a poore one, and for thee unfit,</l>
      <l>Whose infancy might teach their best years wit;</l>
      <l>Whose talk was exemplary to their pains,</l>
      <l>And whose discourse was tutor to their streines;</l>
      <l>If thou wert serious, then the audience</l>
      <l>Heard <hi>Platoe's</hi> works in <hi>Tullies</hi> eloquence:</l>
      <l>If sad, the mourners knew no thrifty size</l>
      <l>In teares, but still cri'd out, oh lend more eyes.</l>
      <l>If merry, then the juyce of <hi>Comedy</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Soe sweetned every word, that we might see</l>
      <l>Each stander by having enough to doe</l>
      <l>To temper mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap>th, untill some friend could wooe</l>
      <l>Thee take the pains to write, that so that pressure</l>
      <l>Checking thy soules quick motions, some small leasure</l>
      <l>Might be obtain'd to make provision</l>
      <l>Of breath, against the next <hi>Scen's</hi> action.</l>
      <l>I could goe through thy works, which will survive</l>
      <l>The funerall of time; and gladly strive</l>
      <l>Beyond my power, to make that love appeare</l>
      <l>Which after death is best seen in a teare;</l>
      <l>But praising one, I should dispraise the rest,</l>
      <l>Since whatsoere thou didst, was still the best:</l>
      <l>Since then I am perswaded that in thee</l>
      <l>Wit at her acmie was, and wee shall see</l>
      <l>Posterity not daring to aspire</l>
      <l>To equalize, but only to admire</l>
      <l>The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap> as their archetype; with thought of thee</l>
      <l>Henceforth I'le thus enrich my memory.</l>

         </gap> Earth-quakes, and great frost;</l>
      <l>And say i'th' last deare yeare, 'twould thus much cost.</l>
