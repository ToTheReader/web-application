Therfor am I nowe compelled, ere I passe any further, to shewe in fewe wurdes the summarye contentes of the. iiij. partes of my votaryes actes, that my reader maye knowe the dyfference of them, by theyr di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerse groundes and argumentes.</p>
   <p>In the fyrste parte, after longe engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derynge, bredynge, and brynynge, my votaryes haue rysen faste, by the craftye inuencyons of Idolatours.

The fyrste parte comprehendeth all the tyme from the worldes begynning to a full thousand yeares after Christes in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>carnacyon.<note place="margin">cōtentes</note> The seconde parte contayneth CC. yeares more, from y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thousand of yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> reigne of king Iohā. the third part shall contynue for.

Wherfore they sought firste of all to bring them vndre by sophistycall sorceryes.<note place="margin">the firste</note> And
<pb n="Cxvij" facs="206"/>
fyrste they began with the weaker concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge the worlde, whyche were the cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, preachers, or ministers of Gods wurd for they were (as apered) the more easie to ouercome. Christe the sonne of God, the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye Apostles, and the godly fathers of the primatiue churche, vpon diuerse considera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cions, permitted them to haue wiues.<note place="margin">Wiues.</note> S.

   <p>If this wiuinge (thought they) might be brought to an yll opinion, that the people might treckē it nought, thā shuld we make that office of pastorall cure,<note place="margin">Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> whiche afore serued God in paineful study of his wurd to serue vs in all vanitees and plesures of the fleshe.

By these chefely and by other lyke practyses, came that admynystracyon for the sowles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houe, to an vtter decaye and ruyne, as is shewed at large in thys former boke.

   <p>Yea, they played with those worldly rulers, for all their great power and wys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</note> as the bearwardes do with their apes and their beares.
