   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, it is a point well knowne vnto your Worship, that in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of absolute neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity wee must regard what God doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and enioyne, not what men doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue and like of: and that wee must still offer vp our seruice in obedience to the Almighty, whatsoeuer men doe thinke or speake of vs. As for this worke of publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the labours of such faithfull and painefull Ministers, as desire rather to spend their time in preaching, then in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I take it not to be a duty of that kind:
<pb facs="3"/>but of an inferiour nature; wherin the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance or disallowance of those that are godly wise, should haue a great stroke, either for encouragement to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in it, or for discouragement to desist from it. Herein hauing made some triall, I haue (through Gods blessing) found successe beyond my expectation: which as it ministreth vnto mee matter of much reioycing, in regard there are many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands in Israel, who desire and embrace the sincere &amp; plaine doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; so doth it set an edge on my desires to take vp some vacant houres in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: being right glad, if by any meanes I may bee an helper to the truth, and an instrument of refreshing hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitten soules, by conueying vnto them some baskets full of such fragments, as may bee communicated without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment or disaduantage to my selfe, or to any else. These Sermons I haue made bolde to recommend vnto your fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acceptance and patronage, not onely in regard of the interest which you haue
<pb facs="3"/>in them, and that encouragement which I haue often receiued from your Worship in businesses of this nature; but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I perswade my selfe that your very countenancing of them, wil adde, though not vnto their goodnes, yet vnto their good esteeme, among many that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously affected.</p>
   <p>And thus nothing doubting of your Worships fauour in taking in good worth this my bold attempt, I leaue you to the safe tuition of God Almighty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching him to enrich you &amp; yours with all manner of corporall and spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings in Christ Iesus; and to adde vnto your life, as also vnto the life of your faithfull and gracious yoake-fellow, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny happy and comfortable daies.</p>
