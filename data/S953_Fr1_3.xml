at the promised Land: Millions of Christians in profession are cast away against the one, or against the other: for some, though they haue no true grace wrought in them, thinke notwithstanding that they are in no danger, but shall certainly bee saued: which is as great presumption, as if a man being stricken thorow the heart, should thinke himselfe very well, and in no danger of death. Others when they come to apprehend the heauy wrath of God, and deadly curse of the Law due vnto them by nature for sinne, in hellish
<pb facs="6"/>
sorrow vtterly despaire, Some sincere Christians also there are, against whom the Tempter doth so far preuaile, that in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their owne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, they are ready to faint, for feare of hell and condemnation; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they cannot perish, or suffer shipwrack against this rock of <hi>Desperation,</hi> yet their poore Barke may bee so battered and beaten against it, as that peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they may bee a long while after in rigging and mending of it vp againe, with griefe and hart-smart that thou maist escape these
<pb facs="7"/>
dangers, vse these short questions and answeres as a Sea-mappe, or guide vnto thee, to shew thee thy way betweene both, that so thou mayest saile to Heauen in more safety, confidence, and comfort. Now to the end that the better vse may bee made heereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider I beseech thee of these things. First, what multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes daily (departing this world) throng in at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall gates of Hell, for want of the assurance of their saluation. Secondly, consider that thou being by nature a condemned man, if thy pardon be not sealed
<pb facs="7"/>
to thy conscience, and giuen thee before the breath bee once out of thy body, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward though thou wouldest, or couldest giue a thousand worlds for it, it cannot bee had: consider againe of the vncertainty of thy life, thou canst not tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou shalt bee aliue to morrow, for <hi>thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not what a day may bring forth:</hi> Consider al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the certainty of thy death: dye thou must, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing surer, for who can stand against the power thereof? and, oh how bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the remembrance of death to one that is not
<pb facs="8"/>
assured of his saluation! Further, consider how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible the Iudgement day will bee to all such as get not the assurance of their saluation in their life time: which may will they turne themselues then? Oh what will they doe? Mountaines and Hills fall vpon vs, and crush vs in peeces, shall they cry, but it shall not bee. Then what most dolefull and intollerable torments shall they for euer endure in hell; able to breake the hardest heart to thinke on? Oh <hi>who shall dwell with the deuoring fire? who shall dwell with the
<pb facs="8"/>
euerlasting burning?</hi> Lastly, consider of the most inestimable ioyes of Heauen, and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble delights, which all they shall haue, who get the assurance of their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in this life: <hi>Such as eye hath not seene, eare hath not heard, nor the heart of man concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of:</hi> O heauenly ioy! O sweet delights! O excellent surmounting glory! O endlesse su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabounding pleasures! wherewith their hearts shall bee rauished and for-euer replenished. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these considerations,
<pb facs="9"/>
I earnestly request thee, if thou hast any pittie or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration on thy poore soule, <hi>Make thy calling and election sure, euen while it is called to day:</hi> How shall I doe that, thou wilt say? This briefe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise will shew thee how, yea, more then that; heereby thou mayest bee assured of thy saluation, if thou vse it rightly, but then thou must goe through it with good aduisement; if thou touch the Honie-combe with thy lips, thou mayest finde sweetnes; but if thou sucke, much more: so read these things, as to learne
<pb facs="9"/>
them, so learne, as to know thy owne estate thereby, so mightest thou sucke out the hole sweetnesse thereof; get the true stamp of them in thy heart, so thou maiest be sure thou shalt be saued: which the Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen grant for his mercies sake. Amen.</p>
