      <hi>The Preface.</hi> TO THE FAVOVRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE AND IVDICIOVS <hi>Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hen is a <hi>Booke</hi> thorowly <hi>allowed,</hi> when <hi>Seene and Allowed:</hi> when the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> have approoved it, as well as the <hi>Licencer.</hi> With this favourablenesse (as I thankfully must acknowledge) have my <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Bookes</hi> beene entertained: yea, most <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably,</hi> by the most <hi>Iudicious.</hi> In an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hope therefore, of the like acceptance; does my <hi>Dedication</hi> in the same <hi>Style,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine preferre it selfe to its old <hi>Patrones-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,</hi> The <hi>Favourable and Iudicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> (though arm'd
<pb facs="3"/> but in <hi>Paper</hi>) cannot but <hi>Conquer.</hi> I meane <hi>affections.</hi> Since then I no waies could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, that my <hi>Stile</hi> or simple <hi>performance,</hi> should in any degree inveigle your <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> this onely became my encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That though this <hi>Story</hi> should goe out of my hands, poorely enough and weakely endited: yet that the <hi>prevailing Fortunes</hi> of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> would so potently assist and goe along with it; as that by that time it came into your hands, it would so prevaile with your <hi>affections;</hi> and so <hi>gently</hi> in the reading, <hi>captivate</hi> the <hi>attentions</hi> of all the favourers of his actions, that their <hi>Iudgements</hi> (for the time) should become deprived of this part of their due liberties; and forbeare the <hi>power,</hi> though, not of <hi>see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> yet of <hi>censuring,</hi> my <hi>errors.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The <hi>First Part</hi> I undertooke, to cheere up the long-exercised expectations of such well-affected <hi>English,</hi> as desired in their dayes, to see some <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>consolation,</hi> to the miserably afflicted <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Germany.</hi> In that poore <hi>Booke,</hi> our <hi>Nation</hi> first read,
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>That God had begun to send a Deliverer vnto His people.</hi> This (me thoughts) <hi>in a time of my leasure,</hi> was a worke not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether beneath me: and that to bring <hi>Glad tidings,</hi> was next unto the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> To the going on with this <hi>Second Part,</hi> hath the united and repeated desires, of well-disposed people provoked me: I could not take so many <hi>expectations</hi> of my <hi>Betters,</hi> for lesse then a <hi>Command;</hi> and that it was a <hi>Duty</hi> to satisfie them.</p>
   <p>My <hi>Booke</hi> hath many mens <hi>Stories:</hi> but I have laboured most upon the Kings. In penning of the <hi>whole,</hi> I had these two <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Truth</hi> and <hi>Plainenesse.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing of the <hi>First,</hi> (besides the chargeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of procuring the <hi>Jntelligence,</hi> out of the Armies and else-where) hath cost mee much more paines, then the bare writing: my care was, to learne out, and get acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with such understanding Gentlemen, as had beene personally present in the <hi>Actions.</hi> To some of these, hath my <hi>Margent</hi> beene already thankefull: and here, especially, am
<pb facs="4"/> I againe, to that Gentleman of curious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, whom you shall find named <hi>Page</hi> 46, in the <hi>Margent.</hi> I will not bee much displeased, if <hi>Gallobelgicus</hi> shall any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where differ from me: this by his former Bookes I perceive, that he hath made use of but few things, which I have not seene before his <hi>Mart:</hi> and my <hi>diligence</hi> (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve) hath not beene behind his; and my <hi>Intelligence,</hi> I know to bee farre <hi>better. Truth</hi> is the pearle, I sought for; which I have still preferred before <hi>fauour:</hi> and had the <hi>Imperialists</hi> well beaten the <hi>Swedish</hi> now and then; I would not have omitted it. <hi>Ʋariety,</hi> is some <hi>ornament</hi> to a <hi>Booke:</hi> part of which mine now wants; as running al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon the victories of the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> If then any contrarily-affected shall give out, That I have omitted their victories: besides this answer to them, That they should have done well to have sent me in their <hi>Intelligence:</hi> I further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, What victories these were, which suffered the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to march up
<pb facs="4"/> and downe so many hundred miles in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi> and that I never read, (in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the time of this Story) of any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize he undertooke, but he prevailed in it: his fortunes never receiving any remarkeable or considerable checke, but at <hi>Ingolstat</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This truely I beleeve; That all their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed victories, which they have so often here given out, will hardly (yet) make up a <hi>Second Part</hi> of the <hi>Laurea Austriaca.</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, I cannot but have: but they are <hi>casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> and not <hi>affected</hi> ones; they are my <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances,</hi> not my <hi>purposes.</hi> And if those that know better, (and be sure they doe so) will adde to, or controll this; I shall thanke them for satisfying my <hi>Readers,</hi> in what I would have serv'd them; had I either known more <hi>Truth,</hi> or more <hi>Circumstances.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>As for my <hi>second Ambition, Plainnesse;</hi> that have I also laboured upon. I affected not to be too <hi>concise,</hi> or too <hi>sententious.</hi> My care was, not to hunt for praise; by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of our noble Language, with fine new phrases, and unhappily coyn'd words:
<pb facs="5"/> the presumptions of an over-bold <hi>fancy.</hi> Some <hi>military Termes,</hi> may perchance be <hi>obscure,</hi> because <hi>proper:</hi> which being their commendation, I would not (in this) des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend unto every capacity. In a many of these, may the Reader satisfie himselfe, in my <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish Discipline:</hi> and for understanding of the rest, my Booke must waite the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its <hi>Readers</hi> industrie. To make all more <hi>Plaine,</hi> I have noted the <hi>places</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Action. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> cannot flie: therefore have I specified the <hi>distances</hi> and <hi>lyings</hi> of the <hi>Townes;</hi> that you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>orderlinesse</hi> and <hi>probabilityes</hi> of the Kings <hi>Proceedings:</hi> and that there was no <hi>impossibility</hi> in his Conquests. I have beene carefull, (if not too curious) in this point: and have taught those <hi>Readers</hi> that have <hi>Mapps,</hi> how to turne them. This commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity because all have not; and that in the same <hi>Mappe</hi> there be many townes of the same names; therefore have I beene so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in my <hi>Descriptions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This one addition had I purposed to have
<pb facs="5"/> made unto my <hi>Story:</hi> the <hi>Iournall,</hi> namely, or <hi>Diarye of the Actions of the Lower Saxony.</hi> And that, betweene the <hi>Armies</hi> and <hi>Generalls</hi> of the two adverse <hi>Leagues,</hi> the <hi>Protestants</hi> and the <hi>Catholikes.</hi> That is to say; Betwixt the Lord <hi>Marquesse</hi> of <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Saxon-Weymar,</hi> the Lord <hi>Achatius Todt,</hi> Sir <hi>John Banier,</hi> and <hi>Bauditz:</hi> all Generalls for the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>League.</hi> Together with the two Dukes of <hi>Mecklenburg,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Lunenburg</hi> and <hi>Saxon-Lawenburg,</hi> the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Hessen,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Bremen;</hi> all Generalls for themselues, and the <hi>Protestant-League, respectively:</hi> on the one party. And, the Earles of <hi>Pappenhaim</hi> and <hi>Mansfeld,</hi> the Barons of <hi>Gronsfelt</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> with <hi>Reinacher, Boenickhausen,</hi> and other Governours and Commanders: for the <hi>Imperiall</hi> party. But this have I beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to leave out, for want of conference with such Gentlemen, as had personally beene em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the <hi>Actions:</hi> an instruction, which I much preferre, before all <hi>written Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/> My <hi>Preface,</hi> was onely to make the <hi>Readers</hi> understand my purpose; and I hope I have done it. The Readers must be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the liberty of their severall verdicts: and though they should differ, yet must all passe for <hi>Iudgement.</hi> The pleasing of them, must be put to the venture: but if I might not be thought partiall to mine owne; I would freely enough confesse, That having taken treble paines in <hi>This,</hi> more then in my <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> I had in <hi>This</hi> given my selfe so much the more satisfaction, then in the <hi>Former.</hi> With this comfort doe I now part with my <hi>Booke; That I have not yet entered upon a foyld Story.</hi> God turne the warres to a happy issue: I had much rather write of <hi>Peace,</hi> then <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</hi>
