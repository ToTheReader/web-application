      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, having composed this small Volume, J was resolved to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate it to a right worthy, and worshipfull Gentleman, living within the wals of the City of <hi>London</hi>: being perswaded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by an intimate friend, and familiar acquaintance of mine, which Gentleman, as he reported unto me was an especiall favourer of the <hi>Muses.</hi> But upon better consideration, well knowing, that for my owne part, J had no particular relation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, neither was he a man with whom J had at any time the least acquaintance, or one whom to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg I had ever sixed my eye upon. J was doubtfull left some ill construction might have bin made of my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and simple meaning: and therefore unwilling to be taxed with over bold presumption, J thought it better to reflect my eye upon a more familiar object, and to present the dedication of these poore labours to such a man, of whose goodnesse, and worth, J have had sufficient tryall by the testimony of many yeeres acquaintance: and the more imboldned thereunto by that conjugall affinity which hath more strongly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited me to anindeered, and in violable obligation If
<pb facs="3"/>
I consider of the worke it selfe, I may well blush at the performance thereof, and with the Poet say,
<q>
         <l>Cum relego scripsisse pudet, quia plurima cerno,</l>
         <l>Me quoque qui feci, judice digna lini.</l>
      </q>
For although I have had an Idaea in my minde, which hath presented me with a better forme, yet my produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions I must confesse, are lame, and imperfect, and come farre short of the extentions of my wishes, and imaginations. Let your better judgment rather allow of my intentions, then of my unpolisht expressions: and what I am not able to delineate in words, let my well-meaning endeavours be supplied out of the treasure of your more judicious apprehension. So shall I have a further tryall of your favours, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a sacrifice which I owe unto the graces, and you: and shall alwaies rest,</p>
