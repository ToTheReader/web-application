   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>NTENDING to present vnto your viewe out of that reuerent an renowned author Cardinall Baronius the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie beetweene the Church and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of England, wherein the cheife actors in this our disturbed nation, were, that mightie <hi>King Henry</hi> the second, and our Metropolitane sainct <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury, and in forraine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes that most holy &amp; wise Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3. and Lewes the pious king of France, with many Catholicke Princes, and among the Scismatickes the potent Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Fredericke with his idoll Octauian, seeking by all meanes to intrude themselues, and put their sickles into this haruest, where the <hi>Diuel</hi> the father of their execrable scysme, like a deepe polititian taking aduantage of their hellish discord had in this vnfortunate Iland sowed the cockle of dissention, I thought best in regard this canker soe spreade it selfe through the Christian world, and this history was collected out of the Epistles written by the cheifest rulers in that age, to lay open briefely the state of the westerne Church, and kingdomes vnited therein, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby your mindes receauing light may better discouer thinges otherwise obscured. First therefore to delineate the time, I must somewhat touch the raigne of Pope <hi>Adrian, Alexanders</hi> predecessour, who being the only man of our English nation that euer steered saint Peeters ship, and was not only for his singular vertues, wisedome and
<pb n="2" facs="6"/> learning preferred to the Apostolike Sea, but also him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the Apostle who conuerted the Norwegyans to the Christian faith, I thinke it no vnnecessary digression to treate of his origine, progresse, and most high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</p>
   <p>At Abbotts Langley in the County of Hertford, neere kinges Langley,<note place="margin">Nicolas Breake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Pope Adriā, borne in England.</note> where Edmund of Langley receaued his first breath, from whom all the kinges of England and Scotland haue these many yeeres descended, was borne <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas Breakespeare,</hi> who afterwarde exalted to the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of Rome, and called <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth, ruled in matters of faith and Religion, the whole Christian world. His father was <hi>Robert Breakespeare</hi> a yonger brother of the family of Breakespeare, whose place concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the name is seated neere <hi>Vxbridge</hi> in <hi>Middelsex</hi> now in the possession of Ashby. His father (saith <hi>Iohn Stowe</hi>) after the death of his wife, and before the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as I conceaue) of his sonne out of the realme, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed a Religious life in the Monastery of saint Abbans; wherein Stowe ignorantly, not maliciously ran into an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for Pope <hi>Adrians</hi> mother (as shall bee afterwards showed) ouerliued him. It appeareth in a Counsell cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in Normandie by Pope Alexanders Legates with the Archbishop of Roane and Bishops of the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince <hi>anno Dom. 1172.</hi> how before that time men might enter into religion leauing their wiues in the world, for there was made a Canon afterwards prohibiting it. And so might <hi>Robert Breakespeare</hi> in this precedent age (as it is affirmed) bee a Monke in saint Abbans, and his wife (as it is certaine) ledd a retyred life vnder the Archbishop in Canterbury. The name of Breakespeare bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly English, and about the time of the Conquest, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincibly proueth they were of the Saxon not of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race. <hi>Breakespeare</hi> it selfe was in the raigne of king Iames the inheritable mansion of a knight, and how great
<pb n="3" facs="6"/> in forepassed dayes, God knoweth. But (as sainct Thomas sayth in his Epistle to Gylbert Bishop of London) what hath a priest, a religious man to doe with these worldly flourishes? I will descend to his humiliation, which was his ascent, first to honor, then to heauen.<note place="margin">All that fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loweth is collected out of Card. Baronius.</note> Leauing as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> his countrey and kindred, hee trauelled in his youth to pourchase learning, and comming to Arnulate professed religion in the Monastery of saint Rufus, where hee was called first to bee Prior, then Abbot of the house, whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it fortuned that for serious occasions of the Church commended to his charge hee went to the Apostolike Sea, and hauing fully finished all his busines, and now intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to returne, Pope Eugenius of blessed memory retayned him there, and by consent of his brethren,<note place="margin">Pope Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Adrian Bishoppe of Alba.</note> did consecrate him Bishop of Alba. A while after, seeing his vertues and wisedome, hee designed him Legate a Latere of the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolike Sea into Norwaye to preach the faith in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince,<note place="margin">Adrian A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle of Norwaye.</note> and purchase to allmighty God their misdebelieuing soules, where hee like a worthie and discreete steward and disciple of Christ, diligently instructed that rude and Barbarous nation in the Christian lawe and Ecclesiastical ordinances.<note place="margin">Pope Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacius.</note> After by the diuine prouidence vpon the death of Eugenius and preferment of Anastacius to the Papal throne, hee returned to his mother the holy Church of Rome, leauing beehind him peace to the kingdome, lawes to the barbarous, tranquility to the Churches, order and discipline to the Cleargie, and a people acceptable to God and fruitfull in good workes. Within a shorte tyme after dyed Anastacius, and the Bishops and Cardinals as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling together in saint Peeters Church by the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the diuine counsell, speedily chose him Pope,<note place="margin">Pope Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>iā</note> and with great acclamation of the Cleargie and layetie, as a man elected by Allmighty God (allthough hee laboured with all his power to auoyde it) they inthronized him in the papal chaire, calling him Adrian the fourth <hi>3.</hi> Non.
<pb n="4" facs="7"/> Decemb. An. Dom. <hi>1156.</hi> He was a man of singular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity,<note place="margin">The praise of Pope Adrian.</note> meeke and patient, learned in the Greeke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongues, eloquent in speech, a perfect Orator, very skillfull in Church musicke, a famous preacher, seldome angrie, willing to pardon, bountifull in beestowing, a greate Almesmā, and for demeanour and beehauiour renowned. This much out of the Vaticane library. Now to showe that hee esteemed his honor a burden, his dignity a misery, and that hee would neuer haue vndergone the weighty charge of this supreme authority, but only to satisfie the will of almighty God, I doe heere recite his owne wordes spoken to that worthie Iohn of Salusbury in Polichrati lib. <hi>8.</hi> cap. <hi>23.</hi> Hee confessed hee found in that high estate soe great tribulations, as in comparison of them all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bitter aduersitys, seemed sweete and pleasing; Hee sayd, the seate of the Romane Pope was a thorny throne, beegirt with most sharpe spurres, of that huge weyght, as it was able to presse, to bend, yea breake in peeces the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est shoulders, and but that (said hee) I will not struggle against the diuine prouidence, I would I had neuer gon out of my natiue soyle of England, or else euer lurked in my poore Cell of saint Rufus, rather then to bee plunged in these extreame difficultyes: yea hee professed that in all his ascentes from his solitarie cloyster to the supreame heygth of the Papacy hee found noe contentment or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; yea (quoth hee) god hath stretched out my whole life beetweene the anuile and the hammer; but now (if it pleaseth his diuine goodnes) let him supporte with his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hād the burdē that hee hath imposed on my infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or otherwise it is intollerable. Thus hee teacheth from the highest throne of this world to flye honors; thus hee preacheth from the greatest eminency to all Potentates not to repose themselues in glory, riches, and pleasures, which are but the shadowes of their seates, but deepely to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the charge, that by reason of their authority they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe,
<pb n="5" facs="7"/> which is to employ their vttermost forces to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Almighty god in the ryghtuous gouerment of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple subiected to their powers, for otherwise <hi>Potentes potenter punientur.</hi> Nether would I euer haue dilated my selfe soe farre in praise of Pope Adrian, but that some of our Chronickles ignorantly, others willfully omitt his commendation. They confesse hee conuerted Norwaye, and gaue the dominion of Ireland to the kinges of England; but as the first was only for enlargeing the kingdome of Christ; soe was the last, as you may see in his Epistle to Henry the second. Now crauing pardō for my digression in the prayse of this man, the glory of our nation, who prefered god beefore his contrey and all, I will returne to the matter.</p>
   <p>Fredericke king of the Romanes in his first entrance into his royaltie, began impiously to encrease his dominion,<note place="margin">Frederick kinge of the Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>nes a perpetual enemy of the Church.</note> with the suppression of the Church; and by how much his power was the greater (for hee commanded all Germany, and mightily preuayled in Italie) so much the more was he enabled to mischeife. This wasting flame, which soe much endangered the whole Christian world, shewed it selfe as a litle sparke in the raigne of Pope Eugenius, gathered strength by the conniuancy of his successor Anastacius, began to waste the power of our noble Adrian, and lastly fired Alexander the third out of Italie, and deuoured for the time all his iurisdiction in Germany, and had not Christ maintayned his Church against the gates of Hell, France, England, Spayne, with all the rest had bene ruinated.<note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the discord bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Church and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> The original was the first yeare of his raigne, in the Church of Magdeburghe the Metropolitane of Saxony, where vpon the death of the Archbishop, a dissention aryseing about choosing his successor, they appealed to Fredericke then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding in Saxonie, who not able to compose the controuersie, perswaded the Deane and Chapter of Magdebourghe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Guicman Bishop of Cicens, a noble yong gentleman to gouerne their Church, pretending that when such que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
<pb n="6" facs="8"/> arose, the king with aduice of his counsell ought to dispose therin, nether was any Bishop in that case to bee consecrated, till hee had receaued his authority from the kingly scepter. But all this was a false pretence, for it lay not in the kinges or Emperors power, causelessly to translate Bishoppes from seate to seate, without assent of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Sea, which holy Pope Eugenius righty considering, with singular constancy withstood the kinges vnlawfull attempt, sharpely reprouing the Bishoppes of <hi>Germany,</hi> that laboured for him, because they rather sought to flatter their prince in concurring with his sinne, then to please God; and this did hee not only with his learned and pious Epistle, but also vehemently persued the same by his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates. But Eugenius preuented by death, lefte all to his successour Anastacius, a man of a gentle and yeelding dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: For notwithstanding his Legate was disgracefully abused by Fredericke, and ended his life in his returne home, hee neuerthelesse ratifyd the kinges election, and granted Guicman his Pall; whereupon Fredericke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining from his religious zeale increased yeere by yeere in obstinacy against the Church. And Anastacius not long after departing the world our countreyman beeing instantly elected by the name of <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth,<note place="margin">Pope Adriā assaulted by the King of Cecil. The king of Cecill excō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. Pope Adriā terrifyed by Fredericke king of the Romanes.</note> found the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges insolency much strengthned against him by his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors facility of nature. In the beeginning of his Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hee was troubled with the inuasions of William king of Cecil, wherefore against his temporall sword, hee drewe his spirituall sword and excommunicated him. Fredericke also king of the Romans with his suddaine approach towarde the Citty terrifyed him; whereupon hee sent Legates to treate with Fredericke, and Fredericke likewise two Embassadors, being Archbishoppes, to the Pope;<note place="margin">Octauian enemy to the Pope ād Cardinalles.</note> which Legates and Embassadors meeting together, went ioyntly to Fredericke at Viturbi: where first Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian, afterwards that firebrand of Christendome, began
<pb n="7" facs="8"/> to shewe his turbulent spirit. This man nobly borne in Rome, and descended from the Earles of Tuscan, Preist, Cardinall of the title of Saint Cecill, like another Iudas euer endeauouring what hee could against the Pope, the Church, and Colledg of Cardinalls, beeing dismissed from his Holynes, in regard hee sought to raise a sedition by the Scysmatickes, intruded himselfe without commission to confound the peace, which was now to bee concluded by the meditation of the Legates and Archbishoppes, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Pope and Fredericke; but beeing sharpely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by his brethren the Legates, hee was for this time with shame, repressed: and soe suppressed the poyson which since he vomited. This beeing, thus ouerblasted, the king in a great and most solemme assembly of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and knightes, caused his fealty to bee sworne by his deputy to the Pope.<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours oa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the of fealty to the Pope and Church.</note> Which was to preserue the Pope and Cardinalles with their state, and not to doe any iniury, or suffer any iniury to bee donne to them or theires; and if any should offer to wrong them, hee would withstand it to his vttermost power, and if wronges were soe cōmitted; hee would by all meanes redresse them: Whereupon the Pope beeing satisfyd, resolued to inuest him with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall crowne, and a day and place was for their meeting appointed. But the king neglecting to hould the Popes styr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup (a custome formerly vsed by the Emperors in honor of the Apostles saint Peeter and saint Paule (as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently made manifest by authenticall recorde,<note place="margin">The cause and custome of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors houlding the Popes styrrup.</note> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) the Cardinalls with drewe themselues to places of safety, and the Pope beeing left in the power of Frederick, and his army, would not for all this peryll admit the king to the kisse of peace, vntill hee proformed this his duty to him and the Church; which the king in the end, seeing the ancient practise thereof, with humility condescended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. This Master Camden in his suruey of England noteth of Pope Adrian, which hee beeing expert in historys could
<pb n="8" facs="9"/> not choose but knowe to haue bin donne by diuers Emperors and kinges to sundry Popes. But to the purpose: the king proceeding to his imperial coronation, was like to haue bin preuented by the Romane <hi>Arnoldistes</hi> (a scysmaticall faction then swaying in the Common-wealth) had not Pope Adrian with his counsell and power made way to him for his coronation in Rome,<note place="margin">Frederick croumed Emperor by Pope Adriā.</note> where hee receaued, with all ceremonyes from the Pope, the Crowne and Emperiall ornamentes: Which finished, the seditious Romanes with a sharpe fight assaulted the <hi>Germanes,</hi> in which conflict many beeing killed, the <hi>Germanes</hi> in the end obtained the victory with the slaughter, and captiuity of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, wherein the Pope shewed himselfe to his Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens a pious father, for hee neuer left sollicitinge the Emperour vntill hee had procured their release. Soe pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the Emperour, who hy this perfect or politicke amity concluded with the Pope, found thereupon good successe in the warres which hee vndertooke in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne towards <hi>Germany:</hi> let vs see what beefell to William king of Cecyll after hee was excommunicated. The king incensed heerewith, commanded the Princes of his army to lay a streyght siege to <hi>Beneuent,</hi> the Popes familiar courte of residence,<note place="margin">Beneuent beesieged by the king of Cecill.</note> to repell which iniury, the Pope excited the mightyest Earle in his kindome, <hi>Robert de Bassauyll</hi> his cousen-german, with many others of the nobility to make warre vpon him, moreouer hee called in diuers others exiled,<note place="margin">The great cōbination in war of Emperors &amp; others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the king of Cecyll.</note> and spoyled of their goods by the king and his father, as <hi>Robert of Surent</hi> a Prince of <hi>Campany</hi> and <hi>Earle</hi> de <hi>Rupe canina,</hi> with others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for parentage and power, to returne into their Countrey and recouer their lost posessions, promising them the assistance of the Romane Sea: lastly hee solicited the Emperors both of Rome and Constantinople to inuade the kingdome of Cecyll: whereupon the Emperor of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> as strong in men as money tooke <hi>Hadrant</hi> a sea-towne

      <hi>Apulia,</hi> the Cittyzens yeelding vnto him. Earle Robert also with his followers, what for the loue of him, ād hatred of the king, violently wonne Tarunt and Barum two renowed Metropolitane Seas, with all the sea coastes to the very boundes of his kindome: The famous and worthy peeres the Prince of Capua and Count Andrew chalenged all Campany commonly named the land of labour, euen to Salern, Naples and saint Germans; soe as the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was in a mighty combustion. Frederick Emperour of Rome encamping his army about the coastes of Ancon, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured soe great a mortality among his souldiers, as loseing his most puissant lordes, scarce the tenth man remayned aliue, whereupon beeing notable to retayne his powers that were willfully bent to returne into their countrey, though vnwilling, was ready to departe.<note place="margin">The king of Cecyl ready to submit himselfe to the Pope▪</note> Now the king of Cecyl thus beegirt with assaultes, retyring himselfe with dew repentance and all humility to obedience, sent the Electe of Catana with the choysest of his noble atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantes as far as Salerne towards the Pope, submissiuely beeseeching absolution from this excommunication, and promising to doe homage and sweare Fealty to his Holines, and withall to restore all the Churches of his kingdome with ample liberty, and giue therefore three Castles called Palud, Montfuscal, and Muron, with their appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes for euer to the Romane Church, offering to subdewe the rebellious Romanes to the Popes subiection, and if hee could recouer the grace and fauor of the Pope and Church of Rome, would beestow on them so much money as the Emperour of Constantinople promised: The Pope the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore assured that all these should bee proformed, was most willing to embrace these conditions, beeing soe hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and profitable to the Church: but the Cardinals that were of the Roman Emperors faction, beeing too singular in their owne conceites, withstood and reiected all this, and did afterwards often the like to the Church of Romes exceeding dommage.</p>

   <p>For heereupon the next yeere à world of miseryes ensued, in regard the king of Cecyl gathering a most powerfull ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in Cecill and Calabria,<note place="margin">Anno 2.

But the Emperour neglected all, whereby the malefactors being encouraged, withheld the Bishop still in captiuity. The Pope not enduring soe greate a wrong and indignity, addressed two Legates, the one Rowland Priest Cardinal of the tytle of saint Marke, Chancellor of the Romane Church, afterwards Alexander the third (whose very person in this case yeelded matter to the ensuing dissention) the other Bernard Priest, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of the tytle of saint Clement; sending by them letters, wherin, hauing expostulated this heynous and sacrili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious offence, with the impunity therof as yet tollerated, hee descended to the benefittes latety conferred by the Church on the Emperour, namely that hee receaued the fullnes of his dignity and honor, together with the ensigne

The Legates on the other syde returning home, appealed to the Pope for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse of the iniuryes they susteyned; whereupon the courte of Cardinalls was deuided, for some fauouring the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour imputed the fault to the Legates carelesse folly, others aggreed with the Pope, who wrote heereupon to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of Germany, persuading them to recall the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour from his sinfull proceedinges, and cause Reynold his Chancellor and the Count <hi>Palantine,</hi> who had openly abused the Legates, and vomited blasphemyes against the Church of God to make therefore publicke satisfaction, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating also by them to the Emperour, that if hee would rebell against the Church, it was all in vaine, since shee was founded on soe firme a rocke, as neither hee nor hell it selfe could euer ouerthrowe her.

   <p>But the people of Rome exceedingly crying out against this intolerable abuse, and extending their vttermost forces against those senators, who were authors of this mischeife, the Cleargy with their elected Pope were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered out of this thraldome; yet malice soe preuayled, as they were instantly by the same senators, beeing wonne thereunto by rewards, cast into another more streyght and close imprisonment beyond Tyber, where beeing almost three dayes in hould, the whole Citty rose to redresse so greate an enormity, and such an apparant treason, yea woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children detesting Octauian, exclaymed against him, calling him an accursed man, an <hi>Hereticke,</hi> reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, reuyling him, and thirsting after Alexander, in so much as to his very face they contemned and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him.

   <p>Octauian on the other syde residing at saint Peeters, the two Cardinals Iohn and Guido blinde with their hellish error, would not reclayme themselues from their damnable presumption, but with headlong rebellion honored their erected Idol, and leauing the Churches vnity, fell at his feete; and hee the shadowe of Antichrist, soe exalted aboue himselfe,<note place="margin">Octauians scisme.</note> vsurped the Chayre, as if hee had bin lawfull Pope; which many with weeping eyes and exceeding sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe beehoulding, remembred what Pope Anastacius as it were profecying, foretold him in these wordes: Accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and excommunicated sonne, thou shalt neuer haue this papal ornament, which thou soe much thirstest and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently seekest, but to thyne owne ruine, and the confusion of many.

Thus Frederick with the Counsell of the impious would haue aduanced Octauian to serue not God, but his owne turne. Hereupon hee sent his Embassadors the Bishopes of Prage and Verdun with letters to the Pope, styling him only Rowland the Chancellor, imperiously commanding him and the Cardinales to appeare at a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell held at Pauy vpon the Octaues of the Epiphanie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue his sentence from the Cleargie there assembled.<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth all adiacent kingdomes to appeare at his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to bee held at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy.</note> Hee likewise wrote to all the Bishoppes not only of the Empire, but also of France, England, Spayne and Hungary enioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all to bee then and there present to decyde this controuersy; the finall sentence whereof in his first letters hee reserued to himselfe, but after, beeing by some of more vnderstanding better instructed, hee left that to the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.

After deliberation of seauen days (for this Pageant was set out with solemnity) they consented (as before was conspired) to the approbation of Octauian there present,<note place="margin">The Scys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes approue Octauian and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander.</note> and condemnation of Rowland, who beeing cyted refused to appeare beefore them, for by these names are they recy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the author who fauored or feared the Emperour.

   <p>I should haue wondred, that soe many Bishoppes and Prelates gathered together in this vnlawfull conuenticle could soe bee ouerwhelmed in this Aegiptian darknes, as they could not see this apparant light, had I not knowne the like afterwardes in our owne countrey.

   <p>The reasons alleaged for this theyr wicked sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst theyre supreme spirtuall head were supported with the horrible periury of many eminent Clearkes, a thing most detestable in soe holy a function: and a great argument against him, was that hee refused to bee iudged by these his subiectes, a matter contrary to Religion and all rules of gouerment. Heereupon these rebells against the Church excōmunicated the Pope out of the Church, and imitated in all pointes the actiōs of a true counsell, but still grating vpō the old quarrell of the league with Cecill against the Empire so was the world euer predomināt.

In the same sorte saint Anthelme Bishop of Billicens assisted with one Geffery a learned wise and vertuous man, soe perswaded the Priors of the Carthusians and Cistercians (who amazed knew not which way to take) that as now beeing setled by them in the right, they with theyr orders, especially the Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, through out the whole westerne Church, were the cheife publishers and defendors of Pope Alexanders cause. Neither thus ended the worthy endeauors of sainct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelm and Gessery, but they diswaded many other Prelates and theyr subiectes from following the wicked scysme of Octauiā, and made thē vtterly detest it.

   <p>Alexander neuerthelesse returning to Rome sound Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uians faction soe strengthened with the power of his noble kindred, and such as the Emperour had with his vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeauors laboured on his side, as hee could haue there no place of cōtinuance; wherefore hee departed thence into Campany, and all the Patrimony of saint Peeter and the adiacent territoryes about the Citty beeing allmost wholy possest by the Almaynes and scysmatickes, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the aduise of his faythfull Counsellors to goe by sea with his brethren the Cardinalles into France. Leauing therefore the Bishop of Prenestyne his vicar and

Heere Guido in the presence of these kinges and Prelates, and that great multitude both of the Clergie and Layetie, extended for Octauian the vttermost of his witt and eloquence, to whom William of Pauy a singular Orator, opening his mouth that was shutt at Pauy, replyed, and soe retorted his owne argumentes vpon him, as hee ouercame him with his owne weapons; in the conclusion of which conflicte the victory was soe apparant on Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders side, as both kinges with theyr subiects acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him euer after their spirituall gouernor, and therupon was excōmunication pronounced against the Scysmatickes. Thus all beesides the Empire yeelded to Pope Alexander, who safely reposeing himselfe in the principality of the king of Cecill, expected a conueniente tyme to passe ouer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to France, hauing thus prepared his way by Peeter Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Tarantasia, a man of that singular humility, charity, and contempt of the world, as had hee not bin dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded vpon vrgent reasons, hee would haue sold his horses, and beestowing the money on the poore, trauelled on foote. But, happily hindred,<note place="margin">The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Tarantasias humility ād charity.</note> hee was instantly vpon the Popes occasions enforced to vse them in his iourney to France; when staying by the way at the Monastery of Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack for want of health, hee neuerthelesse restored the sicke miraculously to their health; and that by the confluence of people flocking to him the prouision of the Religious should not bee wasted,<note place="margin">The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of Tarantasias miracles confirming the Popes election.</note> hee with the same power multiplied theyr corne and bread; where also a knight whose sonne was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of sight, hoping to recouer by the meritts of the Saint, what his child for his owne demeritts had lost, carying him towardes the Abbey, and meeting by the way with a Catholike, who had bread hallowed by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, applyed some of the crummes thereof to his son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes eyes, whereupon hee did presently see, and the father
<pb n="34" facs="22"/> who thought to presse the Saint with his sute, did now render God and him humble thanks for this benefit. The Gouernor of Corboyle in France hauing a daughter of fiue yeeres old, who was borne lame, offered the child at the Saintes feete, by whose prayer and imposition of his hand, shee presently obtayned integrity of her limbes. From thence hee passed through Paris with wonderfull expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the kinges and princes, and exceeding concourse of multitudes of people, euery where honoring him, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing about him not only for these rare cures soe oftē shewed, but also to see the Popes Legate, the messinger of peace, the enemy of warre, whose bloody discord was euen now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to confound both kindomes, euery one for reuerence of his sanctity, and for remedy of theyr maladyes, striuing to gett but some little peece of his garment. At the Blaud Mountayne the confine of France and Normandie Henry King of England hasted to meete him, and no sooner sawe him, but<note n="*" place="margin">Alighting</note> leaping from his horse hee ran to him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing his feete, instantly got his vpper garment, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee refused, although hee resisted, although hee and others disswaded, yet the king persisted, and one of the Legates followers saying, and what should an old torne cloake doe in akinges royal wardrobe? The king answered, you would neuer vse these wordes, did you but know the great cures that haue bin wrought by his girdle which now some yeeres since was giuen mee. About this place rested the Legate, treating with the prime men of the kingdomes, concerning a conclusion of peace, where a poore woman whose daughter was dumb from her natiuity, more respecting her childes cure, then the glory of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and state of theyr kingdomes, could not bee restrayned, but that she broke in through the greatest of them, leading with her the childe; neyther did this humble Legate for all this noble assembly refuse her, but praying, and putting his thumb dipped in his owne spittle into the childes
<pb n="35" facs="22"/> mouth, and then signing her tongue and lippes with the Crosse, bad her speake after him, which presently shee did, and afterwardes continued the vse of her speech. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly a yong man brought his feeble and lame mother, who signed with the Legates benediction, recouered. The Legate an other tyme conferring with the king of France, the young prynce of England and the Earle of Flanders, about this weyghty busines, a woeman pressed towardes him with her sonne beeing twelue yeeres of age, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeeres blind, whom when the Courtyers and attenders would haue kept backe, the Legate commanded her, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping as she was, to bee brought with her child vnto him, and the Legate asking the childe what hee desired, my lord (sayd he) that <hi>I</hi> may see; the Legate put a peece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into the childes hand, and weeting his fingers in his owne spittle, signed the crowne of the childes head, and his eyes, with the Crosse, and prayed; the princes wondred what the Legate meante, thinking hee had iested, but the child instantly recouered sight, sawe the money in his hand, and all thinges else; the Princes and all admyred, and the deuoute king of France beeing certaynly assured of the miracle, falling on his knees, kissed the childes head and eyes. At the Monastery of <hi>Mortimer</hi> the legate on <hi>Ash-wednesday</hi> giuing hallowd ashes to the king of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and others, a knight, who by reason of a wound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in his temples from a Crossebowe, had lost now long since the sight of one of his eyes, importunately bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought the Legate to restore him his eye, the Legate excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himselfe, and intreating the knight not to presse him aboue his power, the knight still instantly vrged him, till in the end the Legate touched, blessed, and dismissed him, whereupon hee receaued the sight of his lost eye. The knight published this to his lord the king and others, wherupon God was more praysed and honored, and his seruant more reuerenced.

An outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious famine at that time encreasing and consuming A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitaine with the adiacent cōtreyes, threatened all France; wherefore the Pope sent two of his Cardinalles to the king of France, signifying his arryual within his Dominions, and requesting to knowe in what parte of his kingdome hee would appoint him and his to remayne: whom the king for the honor of sainct Peeter reuerently vsed, returning them backe with all contentment to Pope Alexander, whom hee called his Lord, father, and Pastor of his soule.

   <p>The Emperour now seeing the whole Christian world (except himselfe) followe Pope Alexander, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded but not conuerted; for standing on his owne power hee knewe the limitts of his Empire to bee extraordinarily enlarged, and allmost all Italie subiect to his Dominion; moreouer hee feared, if Pope Alexander preuayled, hee should loose his Emperiall courtes; straitghtned therfore in this sorte, beeing a man of a great witt and deepe policy, hee beegan to deuise how hee might with a generall assent of the Church haue both Alexander and his Idol Octauian deposed, and a third elected: And beecause, like will to like, hee made choyse of Henry Count of Trey, in whom hee reposed especiall trust,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the King of France.</note> to bee heerein his strength and assistance. The Counte therfore instructed by the Emperour returned home, and comming as a subtle temptor to his lord the king of France, a man of a Doues simplicity, craftily suggested to him on the Emperours beehalfe a singular good
<pb n="38" facs="24"/> way to make a perfect vnion in the Romane Church, which was, that the Emperour for the pure loue of God desired that they two, beeing the greatest Princes of this parte of the world, should at Auinion, a towne confining on both theyr dominions, assemble together the Cleargie and Layety both of the Empire and France, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to bring with him Octauian and his complices, and the King, Alexander with his Cardinalles, and there the election of them both beeing diligently examined by the Clergie of Italy, Germany and France, to determine then what was best and most profitable to the Christiā Common wealth. The king out of his pious disposition too confident, and considering the great mischeifes which arose vpon this discord, condescended to the Count, promising his safe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to the Emperour for effecting this matter. Wherupon the Count returning to the Emperour in Lumbardy, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this on the kinges beehalfe with his oathe. Hence spread an euill rumor through Italy to the greife of all good Catholikes, fearing least heereby the Churches liberty should bee endangered. Against the day the Emperour with his Princes and puissant army came to the appoynted place, and Octauian with his scysmaticall cōfederates followed. The king with his Clergie and nobility hastened also thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, meeting in the way at Saluian with Pope Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where honoring one an other, they consulted two dayes about this appoynted assembly, but beeing a thing not only vnworthy, but also contrary to the Churches Canons, that the Papacy beeing the highest seate, should bee subiect to any earthly iudgment, it was agreede by all, that only some of the principall Cardinalles should bee sent to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to the world the lawefull election of Pope Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Octauians title to bee but a fryuolous imposture. Wherupō fiue Cardinalles accōpanyd the king to the parlee, the Pope with the rest retyring themselues to the Monastery of Dole in Aquitayne. The king with his reuerent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
<pb n="39" facs="24"/> trayne came by Diion to Mount Saon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth France from Germany, expecting there what the Emperour would propound. Wherefore the Arch here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike Octauian, seeing the Reuerent Cardinalles of the Church of Rome, and the Cleargy of France constantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing against him, beeing afrayd of his tryal, complayned to the Emperour, that his aduersary Alexander disdayned to appeare, and himselfe whose cause was in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours presence confirmed at the Counsell of Pauy, must yet come to a new examination. Wherupon the Emperour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed with anger, sent the king word that bee had broken his couenant, and falsifyd his oath, beccause hee brought not Alexander to the place. The king therfore aduising with his counsell, answered, that allthough hee could lawfully excuse the Popes absence, yet because hee would not derogate from his regality or renowne, nor bee tayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any deceyte, bee it eyther iust or vniust, hee would presently without any dissimulation send for the Pope and his brethren thither. And soe instantly posted away messingers to call the Pope and Cardinals thither with speede, or otherwise to signify that hee must yeeld himselfe a captiue into the Emperours handes, according as it was couenanted betweene them. Wherupon the Pope and Cardinals seeing the king thus entangled in the Emperours snares, were marueylously troubled, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how they were on all sides bee set with dangers, for if they wente thyther to vndergoe the iudgment of men,<note place="margin">The Pope and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Kinge of France in danger to bee sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> they saw the Churches liberty hazarded by violence; if they went not, but suffered the king to bee enthralled by the Emperour, they could expect nothing for themselues but imprisonment and losse of all. For the Emperour was not only dreadfull with his owne mighty army, but had also the kinges of Denmarke and Behemia with his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and powers there vnited with him, intending, as it seemed, to accomplish in that parlee the malice which hee
<pb n="40" facs="25"/> had long hached against the Pope and king. But god who neuer forsaketh his, suffered not the Pope and king to bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a prey to the Emperour, for hee styrred vp the spirit of the glorious king of England with a powerfull army of resolute souldiers to march speedily and couragiously against the Emperour,<note place="margin">The King of Englāds couragious attempt to deliuer the Pope and King of France out of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours hā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> sending also such a terrible famine among the Emperiales, as Frederick could no longer endure there to effect his intended mischeife. Wherfore, to make a faire pretence for his departure, hee sent by Reynold his Chancellor and others his fauorites to the king of France, commanding him, that in regarde theyr lord Fredericke was Emperour of the Romanes, and the speciall Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of the Romane Church, and therfore no Prelates could iudge the cause of the Election of the Pope of Rome, but such as were within the Romane Empire, the king with his Bishops &amp; Clergie should repayre to him as a freind and associate to attend his sentence heerein. Whereunto the king smiling answered, that hee wondred a wise man would send soe foolish a message; asking if hee were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that Christ committed his flocke to saint Peeter and his successors, or whether hee could euer proue that the king of France and his Prelates were any where excepted, as beeing not sheepe of that flocke.<note place="margin">

The Emperour on the other side confounded with shame dispersed his army euen perishing with famine, and with great sorrowe went into Germany. About this time the king of England visited Pope Alexander, in the Monas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of Bobien, and prostrating himselfe with all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, kissed his feete: and when the Pope offered him a seate meete for his Maiestie, hee refused it, and with his Barons

The king offering to furnish him with all thinges necessary, the Bishop answered, hee would not hazard his soule among the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enemyes of Gods Church. The king replying, hee therfore desired to haue him along, beecause if his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science should bee any wayes endangered, the Bishop might rescue and deliuer him; the Bishop ouercome with his importunity, happily yeelded: whereupon the king with a royal trayne sett forward: neyther with any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or dissuasiōs of his faythfull counsellors could hee be-recalled, but neuerthelesse preceeded on with great iustice and religion, which purchassed him in all Countreyes where hee passed, both loue and reuerence: for though his company encreasing amounted in showe to an army, yet would hee not suffer them to offer the least wrong to any;<note place="margin">The singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar iustice of the king of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke.</note> yea his seuere equity was such, both at home and abroade, as when afterwardes vpon want of prouision for his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; complayning to the Emperour, hee desired hee might
<pb n="43" facs="26"/> haue the same for money, and the Emperour willed that his seruantes as others who followed those warres should gett it by spoyle of the Countrey: hee cryed out hee was no theife, nor would purchase by robbery, and although in eases of necessity this was tolerated, yet would hee not allow that in other nations, which hee condemned in his owne, or suffer his subiectes with forraine offences to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their domesticall lawes. Wherupon the Germane Princes admyring, protested, that happy was the Realme where such a king gouerned. But to returne to the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se: After a tedious iourney approaching the Emperiall Campe, hee found contrary to his expectation a cold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaynment. For Absolon the good Bishop accompanyd with Rafe that ill Embassador, deliuered beefore the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour the cause of his lords coming. But Frederike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning first the kinges neglecte and delay, sayd, that hee who held his kingdome by seruice to the Emperiall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, forgot himselfe much in omitting thus long his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance. Absolon answering, The Emperour should haue signifyd soe much to the king before hee vndertooke his iourney, and not to inuite him with such faire and large promises. The Emperour wondering, answered, who fed the king with such hopes and promises? Absolon produced Rafe, saying, this is hee, who with your high promises abused the goodnes of our credulous king. But Rafe abashed at the Emperours denyall, gaue the Bishop leaue to vnfould the whole matter. The Emperour still gayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying all, Absolon desired his kinge might haue then a safe conduct backe into his Countrey: But Fredericke yeelding to nothing, affirmed, that as hee medled not with his comming, soe hee would not assist him in his goeing. Heerupon the king repenting his rashnes, sayd, allthough the swoard hung ouer his head, neuertheles hee would rather dye then inthrall his countrey to bondage. And for a remedy to this mischeife, lying with the Emperour
<pb n="44" facs="27"/> on the confines of France, determined by Absolons coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, to flye thither by stealth for refuge. But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour altering his mynde sought to win him by giftes, whom hee could not bend by terror, and giuing the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sclauia allured the king to doe him Homage, yet soe as it should neyther preiudice his posterity nor king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, alleadgeing for example the glorious king of Englād, who in like case for his principallityes in France, did Homage to the king of France. And now to descend to Octauians absurd conuenticle, where the Archbishop of Clen declaymed of the iniury offered the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour by other kinges who would intermedle with choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Pope of Rome, where the Emperour on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary side neuer interposed himselfe about the elections of any Bishoppes in Cittyes subiect to their dominions. And the Emperour saying also that hee doubted not but the kinges there present, assembled by him for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, would concurre with the Bishoppes in ratifying Octauians authority. When Octauian heereupon procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his counterfeit solemnity to accurse Pope Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">The king of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke by the aduise of Bishop Absolon flyinge Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauian, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander.</note> the king of Denmarke admonished by Absolon, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the place, and refusing to bee present at that sacrili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious excommunication, shewed thereby his approbation of Alexander, and reprobation of Octauian. And Bishop Absolon following after, when Octauian requested him to stay, sayd, there was no reason but as hee came with the king, soe hee should departe with him, and soe they both left Octauian. Thus the Emperour contrary to the Canons of the Church, summoned kinges to establishe the Papacy.</p>
   <p>Heere now dawneth the day of sainct Thomas of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburyes history, which beeing most tempestuous, closed neuertheles in a most glorious Euening; for thus writeth Cardinall Baronius. This selfe same yeere a great counsell was assembled at London in England, of all the Bishoppes

Whereunto Salusbury addeth thus; hauing long resisted, vpon the instant vrging of Henry of Pisapreist Cardinall of saints Nereu and Achilleus beeing there Legate, hee assented, wherupon they presently sent Messingers to Pope Alexander resyding then at Mount Pessulan for obtayning his pall,<note place="margin">S.

      <head>CONSIDERATIONS VPON the Preface.</head>
      <p>LEt vs now heere behould the Christian world as at this tyme it presented it selfe. Where first wee see the Pope &amp; Cardinals banished out of Rome, Italy and all, the mighty Emperour of Rome posessing all theyr dominiōs Ecclesiasticall &amp; temporall, and mayntaineing Octauian that vsurping Scysmatick in the Papal throne. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of Constantinople not intermedling with the Wes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne Church, and also lately ouerthrowne by the Ceciliās. The king of Ierusalem though acknowledging Alexander his lawfull Pastor, yet raigning a far of, &amp; hardly able to defend the frontyers of Christendome against the <hi>Saracens.</hi> The good king of Denmarke though lately showing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe an approued Catholike, yet Frederickes Homager, and diuorced by all Germany from assisting Pope Alexander. Bohemia drowned in Germany; and Hungary à remote
<pb n="49" facs="29"/> kingdome, and though subiect to the Romane Sea, yet not able to succour her. The king of Cecill, though Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders faythfull freind, yet soe incumbred with domesticall rebellions, as hee could not rayse an army to restore him. The kingdomes of Spaine, though they wished him well, yet soe ouercome with the Mahomet a Moores as theyre states were miserable. So hee was only left by God to the pious &amp; worthie king of France, the powerfull king of England, and in myne opinion, the greatest king of the Norman race that euer swayd ouer this land: for (as Gilbert B. of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don writing in the names of all the English Bishops to saint Thomas Archbishop of Canterbury, sayth) his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions reached from the Perinean Mountaines to the Northerne seas; and if Edward the III. Henry the V. and Edward the IV. hauing England, Ireland, Callis, &amp; rather a tumultuous tytle, then any peaceable countreyes or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable reuenues in France, were able to tryumph ouer France, then how much was Henry the II. who beesides England &amp; Ireland, had the Dutchyes of Normandy &amp; &amp; Aquitaine, with the Earledome of Anioue his natiue soyle &amp; other honores in quiet possession, to omitt Britaine that had a great dependance on him, able to ouermatch the puissance of France. To passe from this to his great reuerence &amp; affection to Pope Alexander, I know no king that euer showed more: and last to ascend to his actions, the effectes of these, Henry the II. drewe England, France, Spaine, Ireland &amp; Norwaye to obey Pope Alexander: and when the Emperour would haue surprysed at Mount Saon, the king of France, and thereby entralled the Pope &amp; Cardinalles, &amp; spoyled them of all, this renowned <hi>K.</hi> with his couragious army rescued them. Now what a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible attempt was it of the enemy of Mankind to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe (if hee could) from the Pope such a king, from the Church such a child? But though the billowes of these seas were wonderfull, yet God was more maruaylous in guiding sainct Peeters ship through them. Considering all
<pb n="41" facs="30"/> these, euery indifferent man may in reading this Epistolary history iudge how great reason the Pope had, as far as in conscience hee possibly could, to forbeare this king soe well deseruing of the Apostolike Sea. And also when, inforced through iustice thereunto, hee would haue executed against him the censures of the Church, what a true heroicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous acte it was to prefer the loue &amp; duty hee bore to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, before the fauor of soe great, &amp; such a deseru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freind. And what aboue all others is most to bee marked in the proces of this matter, although all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of this realme fearefully &amp; fowly wandred astray, yea although saint Thomas of Canterbury himselfe like an other saint Peeter falling, recouered againe, &amp; rose to a glorious Martyrdome: yet Pope Alexander, whom it chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fely concerned, neuer erred eyther infayth or infacte; God so directed with his holy Ghost the gouernor of his Church. Lastly to conclude with this famous kinge, whose faire arysing sunne was soe ouerclowded with his turbulent passions, as they, molested the whole Church, and gaue occasion (though, vnwitting to him) of the Martyrdome of the glorious Saint; hee returned neuertheles in the end soe clearly againe to himselfe, as hee gaue that great satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; indured, yea imposed vpon himselfe soe sharpe a pennance as was able to make his very enemys relent, and a stony hearte with teares to pitty him: Neither doe <hi>I</hi> thinke but the prayers &amp; merites of S. Thomas, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting his bloudy executioners to cōtrite penitētes through Christes passion saued their soules, did in like sorte, yea more effectually helpe to raise to the same eternall blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes this king, after hee departed this world in the Octaues of S. Peeter &amp; S. Paul An. <hi>1189.</hi> beeing first penitēt, cōfes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his sinnes, &amp; receauing the most B. Sacrament. This being deliuered by Card. Bar. out of Roger I haue precisely set downe, because it is Cronicled that the king dyed out of charity, beeing I thinke as false, as that Pope Adrian (according to the Scysmatickes fable) was choaked with a flye, or K. Iohn poysoned by a Monke.</p>
