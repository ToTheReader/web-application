   <head>The Translators Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow hard a thing it is to translate
from one language to another,
and make the same word for word
to answer one another, as face an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
face in a glasse; the right
sense, phrase, grace, and proprietie thereof
obserued, is not vnknowne to the learned, who
haue acknowledged, and found by experience,
this so great a difficultie. Much more hard (I
say) then to compose a thing anew, and bring
forth a mans owne free conceptions: which yet
is both hard and painefull, as all new births be.
Neither is it to be expected, or possible for any
one, alwayes so exactly to expresse the very
words &amp; phrase, which in diuers languages are
different: a libertie therein left to all Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
which here I challenge. Nor haue I varied
much from the Authors words herein, but only
in some few places (and that consulting with
better iudgements then my owne:) which had
I translated verbatim, might haue remayned
very obscure. And so I referre it to the censure
of all those who fauour the equitie of this so
Christian a cause. Being an answere to an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
(or rather <hi>mis-information</hi>) of the
Aduersaries both of Truth and Religion, who
<pb facs="3"/>
are now growne to that height of impudency,
as they will <hi>Informe,</hi> affirme, yea and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
and denie almost any thing, though as
cleare as the Sunne, either in matter of right or
fact, to maintayne their owne desperate cause.
Witnesse all those idle rumors wee haue heard
with our eares, from time to time dispersed
amongst vs, and daily heare: which Time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
in part hath shewed to bee palpable and
false, and (I hope) will doe more and more;
comming from the father of lyes, and his mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
instruments: with such contumelious and
vnworthy aspersions, vpon that most Noble
and Heroicall Prince, now King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
and his proceedings; whereby they endeuour
by all meanes to disable, disgrace, and dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
him, (and so haue done euen from the time
of his Nuptials to this last Action, which hath
set them all on fire) as (I hope) God in due time
will make all the world eye witnesses and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
thereof by the euent; <hi>Exitus acta probat:</hi>
and hereupon wee will ioyne issue with them.
If <hi>Rome</hi> be not <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> fall not,
then are we palpable lyers (as they call vs) like
themselues, <hi>neither hath the Lord spoken by any
of his Prophets:</hi> but if it bee, then let them bee
lyers (as they are, and the children of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Deuill) <hi>and God only true, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:</hi>
in the meane time, <hi>desinant maledicere,</hi> I
say no more. If there bee any escapes either in
this translation, or the former impression of the
<pb facs="3"/>
Latin (whereof I was an ouer-seer) as also of
the other <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> formerly
published, (wherein was promised further sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
and iustification of the cause, since
made good, both by the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and other his seruants and well-willers)
I say as then: <hi>Me, me adsum qui feci;</hi> I hope the
Christian Reader will pardon and passe ouer
them. If those of the aduerse part, friends and
well-willers to the <hi>Informer,</hi> perhaps meete and
quarrell with such small matters, they shall but
only bewray their distrust, and weaknesse of
their owne cause, not finding greater matters
to challenge, therefore carping at the least: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that saying (whereof they make
good vse) <hi>Calumniare audacter, semper aliquid
haeret.</hi> And so I conclude with the Author in
this his prooeme following, referring (as before)
the further censure hereof to the discreete
and iudicious Reader: <hi>let the wise iudge
whether is more solid; and let the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Reader adhere and cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that which is the plainer,
and grounded vpon
best proofes.</hi>
