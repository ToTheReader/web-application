                 <title>An exposition of the second epistle of the apostle Paul to Timothy, the first chapter : Wherein 1 The text is logically into it's parts resolved, 2 The words plainely explicated. 3 A familiar metaphrase annexed. 4 The seueral doctrines thence arising deduced. and largely confirmed 1. by precept. 2. by example. 3. by [---] . All which is accompanied with familiar and delightfull similitudes, for the better alluting the drouping affections to imbrace the truth; and the froward will to obey it. Lastly as the matter requireth: there is vsed, definitions, distributions, subdiuisions, trialls, motiues, and directions, all which be of great vse in their proper order.

   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> LEONARD PVMROY MAIOR OF Plymmouth, with the worshipfull Magistrates <hi>his brethren; and to all who beare Office in that</hi> Corporation, <hi>I. B.</hi> wisheth <hi>Grace, Mercy, Peace.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orthie Sirs, and much respected friends, the truth is, that if I would follow the fashion▪ of the world, you should then receiue a large commendation. For, sure I am, many a man hauing narrower footing, hath leaped farre; a smaller bottome spun a long thread; and of lesse matter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a stately building. But I, to shun the
<pb facs="3"/> appearance of flatt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ry, silence the carping aduersarie; and that, another day, my hand might not cry my heart mercy, will turne my prayses of you, into prayers for you, and exhortations to you, that, as you haue begunne well; so you may neuer waxe wearie, or proud in so doing. You are stiled <hi>Gods,</hi> able by your example to bring good or euill into fashion: the gouernment of the inferiour lies vpon your shoulder. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doe iustice; and take heede of quitting the guiltie, and condemning the innocent. But let iudgement runne downe as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and <hi>righteousnes as a mightie streame.</hi> In this<note place="margin">Amos. 5. 24.</note> sea there must be no ebbing nor flowing: the bankes at euery season, are to be full, swelling ouer. Neither is this streame to be staied for a moment, or turned another way. If it should, iniquity in the meane time would take her place: and whosoeuer drawes, and drinkes of that puddle, shall dye the death. Moreouer, you may not mixe it, the mudde of iniustice with the pure fountaine of righteousnesse: for, that will hinder the current from sliding through the channels of Iudicature, so cleerely and
<pb facs="3"/> speedily, as the Iudge of all the world ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth, commaundeth. And, that this wels mouth may not be stopped, this streame stayed; or, by any vncleane carkase cast into it, putrified; but runne strongly, purely, and spring for euer: in your elections remember <hi>lethroes</hi> counsell to <hi>Moses, Choose you</hi>
      <note place="margin">Exod. 18. 20. 21. 22. 1 Cor 5. 6.</note>
      <hi>out able men, fearing God, leuers of the truth, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting couetousnes,</hi> though to be an inferiour offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. Will not <hi>a little leauen, leauen the whole lumpe?</hi> And tel me, whē is the riuer, troubled? at any time? but when the mud is raised vpward, &amp; the cleere water falleth downeward? Let the righteous rule, there wil be rest: but if the wicked beare sway, troubles shall come. Who wil put a sword into a mad mans hād? will he not beare it for nought? ingender strife, &amp; cōceiue mischiefe? Depresse the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane<note place="margin" type="runSum">23.</note> puddle, exalt the cleare water: then shal God be with you, and all the people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so goe home to their place in peace. I speake<note place="margin">Io 13. 10.</note> the truth, I dare not flatter; you <hi>are cleane</hi> (may I not adde) <hi>but not all?</hi> Its a rare societie, that consists of none but Saints, a singular body without all blemish; and may we, can wee finde a corporation, that hath no vnsound
<pb facs="4"/> member in it? Will you credit me? haue you but one such? I could wish there were none at all. I accuse no mans person: Euery one must fall or stand vnto his owne master, &amp; the <hi>wrath of man doth not accomplish the iustice of</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iames. 1. 20. Reu. 22. 11.</note>
      <hi>God.</hi> Wherefore, he who is <hi>righteous, let him be righteous still;</hi> and if any be filthy, let him <hi>wash</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Kin. 5. 13.</note>
      <hi>and be cleane.</hi> And, not to weary you with words; here you haue at the last, what some of you long since desired at my hands, viz. the first lectures at my comming to you, I preach't among you. Now may the wise see, what the world hath carped at, and the Preacher full often bin blamed for; as if the earth had not beene able to haue borne his words, nor he for the bitternesse of his spirit worthy to set a foot in Gods sanctuary. I confesse my corne may be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with chaffe, my coyne haue some slips; and my zeale not altogether according to knowledge; yet, my desire in Preaching &amp; printing these Sermons, was and is, that sinne might be mortified, holines vivified, God our master after the best manner ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and both speaker and hearer at the last day saued.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>Here you haue onely the beginning, but if the Lord will you may see, and receiue the ende of my labours with you. Truly, I shall greatly reioyce, if my weake indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours proue, in the least measure, to you or any other profitable; and that they may, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure your selues, my prayer according to my power, to him, shall not be wanting, who is only able to giue a blessing. And thus commending you to God, I take my leaue; and will during life, alwayes rest</p>
