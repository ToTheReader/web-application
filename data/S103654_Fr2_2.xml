   <head>TO MY LOVING and learned Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> SAMVEL BVRTON, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester.</head>
   <p>

studies: but whose vaine would it not reuiue to looke into these heauenly songs? I were not woorthy to be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, if it should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent me to be a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et with DAVID, after I shall haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Pulpit: This worke is holy and strict, &amp; abides not anie youthful or heathenish libertie; but requires hands
<pb facs="83"/>
free from profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, loosenesse, affectation. It is a seruice to God and the Church by so much more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee regarded, as it is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. For, who is there that will not challenge a parte in this labour? and that shall not find himself much more affected with holy measures rightly composed▪
<pb facs="84"/>
Wherfore I haue oft wondered, howe it coulde be offensiue to our aduersaries, that these diuine dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the spirit of GOD wrote in verse, shoulde bee sung in verse; and that an Hebrue Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme should be made English. For, if this kinde of compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had beene vnfit, God woulde neuer haue made choice of
<pb facs="84"/>
numbers, wherin to expresse himselfe▪ Yea, who knows not, that some other Scriptures, which the spirit hath indited in prose, haue yet been happily &amp; with good allowance put into strict numbers? If histories tell vs of a wanton Poet of old, which lost his eyes while he went about to turne MOSES into verse; yet eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="85"/>
student knowes with what good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datiō NONNVS hath turned IOHNS gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell into Greek He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicks; And APOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LINARIVS that learned Syrian, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with BAZIL and GREGORY (who lived in his time) in the tearms of this equality, that BAZILS speech was <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, but APOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LINARIES
<pb facs="85"/>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, wrote, as SVIDAS reports, all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue scripture in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicks, as <hi>Sozomen</hi> (somewhat more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strainedly) all the Archaiology of the Iewes, till SAVLS gouernment, in 24. parts; or as SOCRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TES yet more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, all MOSES in Heroicks, and all the other histories in diuerse meeters: but
<pb facs="86"/>
how euer his other labours lie hid, his Metaphrase of the Psalmes is still in our hands with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: besides the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of their owne FLAMINIVS &amp; ARIAS MONTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVS (to seeke for no more) which haue worthily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed themselues in this subiect. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I see how it
<pb facs="86"/>
can bee offensiue to our friends, that wee shoulde desire our english Metaphrase bettered. I say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the disgrace of that wee haue: I know how glad our aduersaries are of all such aduantages; which they are ready enough to finde out without mee, euer reproachefully vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayding vs with these defectes. But
<pb facs="87"/>
since our whol Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is now vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally reuised; what inconuenience or showe of innouation can it beare, that the verse should accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie the prose? es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially since it is well knowne howe rude &amp; homely our English Poësy was in those times, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; wherin, if euer, it seeth her full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<pb facs="87"/>
I haue been solicited by som re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered friends to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this taske; as that which seemed vvell to accord with the former exercises of my youth, and my present profession. The difficulties I founde manie, the worke long &amp; great; yet not more paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then beneficiall to Gods Church. Whereto as I dare
<pb facs="88"/>
not professe anie sufficiencie; so will I not denie my readinesse, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most indeuour, if I shall bee imployed by Authoritie: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in this part, I doe humbly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my selfe to the graue censures of them, whose wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome menageth these cōmon affaires of the Church: and
<pb facs="88"/>
am readie eyther to stand stil or proceed, as I shall see their Cloude or Fire goe before or behinde me. Onely (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer) I shall for my true affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Church, wishe it done by better workemen. Wherin as you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue, so further my bolde but not vnprofitable motiō,
<pb facs="89"/>
and commend it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to greater cares: as I doe you to the greatest.</p>
