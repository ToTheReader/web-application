   <head>The Prologue of this presente Cronicle compiled in laten by the famous Romayne Salust: and transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Englysshe, by Alexander Barcley Preest.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ankynde wrongfully complayneth of hys naturall dysposicion: sayeng, that his feble and fraile life of shorte cōtinuaunce of tyme is rather ruled by chaunces of fortune: than by prouision of strength or vertue: But yf man wyll consyder his naturall inclination: contrarye to suche opinion: he shall fynde that nothyng longynge to mankynde, may be founde and proued greater, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or more preeminent than his naturall inclination: &amp; that his owne diligence and exercise, rather faileth him than outher myght or longe continuaunce of lyfe time. But in this opinion to iuge indifferētly: let man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande that the mynde is ordayned, guyder, ruler and captayne of mannes lyfe: whiche mynde: whan it valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly intendeth to attayne, to worshyp and dignitie, by way of vertue: it nedeth nat to force of fortune, nor to care for her vncertayne giftes: but to dyspise her as nat able to gyue to any man honesty, diligēce or other good and vertuous exercises: nor able to depriue mā agayne of the same gyftes: after he hath obtayned the same. But on the other parte if this minde of man, taken and blynded with froward pleasurs be subdued vnto slouth and bodyly lustes: after it hathe exercised and occupyed such ieoperdous pleasure by a lytel seasō: and after that by cowardous slouth, bothe the strength, the tyme and
<pb facs="96"/>
she wyte are vanysshed away and decayed: than anone the infirmitie and febilnes of nature is accused and put in blame. And thus all suche slouthfull doers transpose and lay awaye the faute whiche in them selfe is culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vnto the difficulte of such besinesse, as they haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by negligence. But if it were so: that men had as greate cure and affection of thinges good and profyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as they haue desyre &amp; pleasure in sekynge and folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynge thinges contrary vnto them, and nothynge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, ye: and also muche perylous and hurtfull: than shulde nat they be more ruled by the chaūces of fortune than they shuld rule the sayd chaunces. And thus shuld they attayne and procede vnto so greate excellence: that where they be mortal of nature they shuld be made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall by glory and renowmed fame. For in lykewyse as man is composed and made of .ii. thynges (that is to say of the body and soule) ryght so all thynges, all besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and exercises, to mankynde belongyng, foloweth some the nature of the bodye: to decay brefely and to be mortall: as it is, which thing forther to proue by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we daly se that the goodly beauty of the visage and shape of mankynde, great abondaunce of ryches, &amp; also the strength of the body, wyth all other suche thynges and semblable, decayeth and vanyssheth awaye wythin shorte tyme. But contrarely the excellente and worthy actes: belonging to mans wyt: be immortall and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng: as the soule is immortall. And finally in lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse as the begynning of the gyftes corporall or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and of the gyftes of fortune is caduke, vayne, and vncertayne: ryght so is the ende of the same mutable &amp; transitory. And all thynges whiche be borne and sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng: agayne decayeth and approcheth to deth: &amp; whan
<pb facs="96"/>
these same be growē and increased to the high of theyr perfectiō: agayne they begyne to decay and consume by age and debilite. But the mynde and soule beynge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupte, eternal and gouernoure of mankynde, ruleth and weldeth al thynges: but it selfe can nat be violently ruled nor compelled by any thynge erthly, consyderyng the frewyll, whiche it optayneth of his creatour. For whiche consyderation the frowarde iniquite of them is more to be maruayled: which subdued to the ioyes and pleasures of the body, passe forthe the time of theyr lyfe in carnall lustes and ydelnes. But towchyng theyr wyt (whiche is the best gyfte and grettest treasure graūted to mankynde) that suffre they to slomber and to slepe wythout exercise, in slouthe and ydelnes: whose dulnes surely is somoch more to be blamed: namely sith so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny &amp; diuers noble exercises &amp; occupacions of the mynd be: by whom most clere nobles and fame vndefiled may be optayned. But of suche diuers exercises concernyng the mynd some are better refused: thā procured in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous tymes &amp; inquiet. And namely in this tyme tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and season vnquiet: great offyces, lordeshyppes, rowmes to commaunde and rule, and brefely to speke. All maner cure concerning the administracion of thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges appartenyninge to the commen wele: semeth vnto me nat at all to be coueted or desyred of any wyse man. For neyther is honour giuen vnto vertue, as condigne rewarde and worthy therto belongynge nother such as haue gotten iurisdictiō and honoure, by fraude and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laufull meanes (in lyke case) can nat be moore sure nor more honest, by meane of such honour so vnryghtwys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtayned. For certenly a man to rule hys countrey &amp; kynred by myght and violence: all if he haue power so
<pb facs="97"/>
to do and also though he ryght wysly correct the crimes of the transgressours and misdoers. Neuertheles: so to do it is vnbehouefull and vnexpediente. And often at conclusion more perylous and daungerous: than it is sure or profytable, and namelye, syth all mutacions of thynges, and chaunges of gouernours pretende &amp; thre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten slaughter, of some exile or wylfull flyghte, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonmente wyth othere lyke crueltyes, more belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng to ennemies of a commen wele, than to defenders of the same. Than forthermore: a man to labour to the vttermost of his power, and all in vayne. And in we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryenge him selfe to get noughte els but euyll wyll and hatred: it is a point of extreme &amp; vtter madnes, excepte parchaunce it be suche one, whiche hath a disshonest, a foule and perelous pleasur to cast away for nought hys owne worshyppe &amp; libertie, for pleasure of a fewe migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty men vsurpers of dominion and lordshyp. But amōg all other besinesse, whiche are exercised by mannes wyt the redyng of hystories and the reducing of the same to memory: is moch more necessary and profitable to al de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>grees beryng rule of a commen wele, but most namely vnto princes. Of power, profet, and commodite wherof I purpose at this tyme to passe ouer w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> silence, bycause many other authours haue wrytten of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same befor my time. And also y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> no mā shuld suppose my selfe by prid or insolēce, to bost mine owne study vainly laudīg y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same. But meche contrarye I beleue rather y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> some enuious malygners shalbe hereafter, which shal obiect &amp; ascribe a name of slouth and negligence to this my laboure. Nowe great and profitable so euer it be: &amp; that bycause I haue determyned to lede my lyfe solitarely: fre from medlyng with the commen wele. Certaynly (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
<pb facs="97"/>
they onely shall impute and ascribe suche name to me, &amp; to this my labour: which thinketh it a most great and singular craft or practised wysedome to wynne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuolence, by salutyng the commen people, and by dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulate reuerence done to euery man passyng by them or els to get fauour by feastynge and flateryng the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>menty. Whiche enuious maligners: yf they wolde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider bothe in what maner seasons and in what ieopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous tymes I haue obtayned offices &amp; rownes of auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torite, and what men wolde gladly, and yet myght nat obtayne suche rowmes. Moreouer yf they call to mynd what maner of men afterwarde came into the order of senatoures. For certayne if my wyllers consider indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently these premisses: than shall they thinke that I haue chaunged the purpose of my mynd: more for cause reasonable: and by good aduisement, thā for slouth and cowardise, and they shall fynde, that more profete shall come to the commen wele by this my study (which they count but ydelnes and tyme mysspente) than of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure and besynes whiche other men take vpon them fayntly and iniustlye administrynge the common wele. And they shall fynde that my writing shal proue it selfe more laudable and profitable to the comentie, thā theyr vndiscrete gouernaunce. For often haue I harde of the famous prynces Quintus Maximus, and Publius Scipio, and besyde these of many other ryght famous and worthy men of the cytie of Rome, whiche whā they behelde the ymages of theyr forefathers made of stone of waxe, or of metall, &amp; erecte into hye trones in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of the valiaunte and magnificente actes by them doone for the commen wele: the sayde princes in adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singe suche ymages weere wonte to saye vnto suche
<pb facs="98"/>
as stode nere by them: that theyr myndes were gretlye kyndeled to vertue and nobles in contemplynge of the same. The case is playne: that suche figures of metall stone, or waxe had nat such operatiō nor myght within them selfe. But such hygh courage and flame was kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled and increased in the hardye hertes of suche noble men and valiante warrious, by remembraunce of the gloryous dedes of theyr forefathers in theyr lyfe tyme done and represented to their memory by such ymages in so moche that this flame kyndled in theyr hertes to vertue coude neuer be slaked nor saciate in thē, tyl tyme that they were equall with their forefathers in vertue, fame, and glory. Than how moch more ought the clere description of hystores to kyndell vnto boldnes &amp; vertu the myndes of noble men by redyng of the same. But moche contrary, yf we aduert the worlde as it is nowe amonge all men whiche lyue, and conforme them selfe to the maners vsed nowe adayes, where shall we fynde one: but that wyll striue and contende wyth theyr fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers to ouercome them, other in couetise and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous ryches, or els in prodigalite and wastfull expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and nat in honest and laudable lyfe, good excercises and diligence? And moreouer genty linē of the fyrst hed whiche were wont to preuente auncient noble men and ascende vnto vertue and nobles, by vertuous maners: suche laboure nowe to lordeshyp, honour and authorite by fraude and falshode: rather then by very vertue or good meanes and laudable. After such maner as if the offyce of a hye Juge, of a Tresourer, a Cōsull, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uost, and all suche other great offices, were noble &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellente of them selfe. And nat in maners as if suche of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices shulde be counted of worthines and dignite: after
<pb n="j" facs="98"/>
as the vertue and honour is, of such as rule in the same offices and by rowmes. But playnlye affirmynge the treuth: the man maketh the office noble and worsshype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: yf his maners shyne by vertue. But yf his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacion be contrary, no offyce, no rowme, can make hym noble nor worshypfull. But this omittyng I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded in this prologue wyth ouer ferre circumstaunce, and also wyth somewhat to moche libertie of wordes, more than in a preface is requisite: for that it pyteeth me of these tedious maners of this oure citye of Rome. But now wyl I come to my mater purposed, and fyrst interpryse begonne.</p>
