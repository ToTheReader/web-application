                 <title>A commentary, upon the whole booke of Ecclesiastes or The preacher : Wherein the originall Hebrew text is carefully examined, our owne English translation and others are duely viewed and compared, in which also the literall sense is chiefly considered, other senses as usefull are not omitted. The exposition of the ancient fathers, and other ancient and classicall authours being diligently observed: the whole is also illustrated with frequent passages and sentences taken out of them.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, to make ashort commentary upon mine owne mind in publishing this commentary upon the Booke of <hi>Ecclesiastes:</hi> I desire that God may be glorified by the knowledge of his Word, and that the Church of God may be illightned in the knowledge of it, and that the discharge of my duety to the Church might be in some sort expressed. For though the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be the firmament of the Church, in which the Sun of truth shineth, the Moone of knowledge is in her full brightnesse, and where there are a multitude of starres of most excellent and divine light; yet such are the clouds of humane ignorance, such the mists of our corrupted nature, that we perceive but darkly the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and glory of them. If therefore such means be used, as that these clouds may be in some measure cleared, and the thicknesse of these mists in some part lesned, it is not a labour that needeth to be judged of, as needlesly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed. As for this booke of the Preacher, such is the blindnesse of the eyes of many in the reading of it, that mistaking utterly his heavenly meaning, from hence they frame pretences for their owne earthly and voluptuous living. But such also are many passages of this booke,
<pb facs="4"/> that even they who have the sharpest sight, must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a dimnesse of their eyes when they looke upon them. Where if my small candle hath given any light, the whole praise be given unto the Father of lights: if it hath cast a false light, I presume that they who discerne it, will not be misled by it, I hope that they who discerne it, shall receive no hurt by it. For though we may not walke in the way of a right understanding, in all things, yet if we doe walke in the way of a right faith, and of a godly life, we shall be sure not to misse the way unto eternall life, which God of his mercy grant to us all for his Sonne Jesus Christs sake. The faults of the printing had not been so many and great, had mine health beene greater, that I could have lookd after it. But let thy courtesie be the physicke to cure them, and for many of them there is a remedy set downe in the end of the booke, where seeing thou mayest easily correct them, be not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty to condemne them. Farewell</p>
