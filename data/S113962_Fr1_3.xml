      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honorable and prudent Lord, the
vngratious Emperor Commodus, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the accusation of a guilty consciēce,
caused fourteen or fifteen discreete Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Gentlemen, to be thrown into the
riuer of Tyber, for no other offence, but because they
soberly talked, of the the vertues of the good Emperor
Marcus Aurelius, his father: alleadging that they could
not praise his father without the reprouing of himselfe:
and certainly, although Commodus did euil, he spake
the trueth: for the cōmendation of vertue, is euermore
a reproch to vice: which principall (right honorable)
considered of the one part, by your manifold, seruices
done vnto the Queenes most excellent maiestie, to her
blessed realm, &amp; generally to the true church of God:
and of the other side, weyed by the most odious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
conspired by many rotten subiectes, whereof iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
lately hath cut off certaine of the principall, whose
vile purpose reached to the life of her sacred Maiestie,
the subuersion of their countrey, and generall callami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the church of God: no other conclusion can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
but that the reuerence of your publique seruice,
will alwayes reuiue the hatred of their treasons, and
that the reproch of their treasons, will neuer suffer the
<pb facs="3"/>
reuerēce of your fidelitie to die. Therefore (most graue
Lord) desirous to honour (withall duetifull affection)
your godly vertues, as the comforte of all good men:
and also to acknowledge some especiall fauours shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
vnto my selfe, vnder your sound protection, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
(for the generall instruction of my countreymen,
the subiects of England) my obseruances of certain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
speach and behauiours, of those fourteene notable
Traitors▪ which lately suffered for their treasons: tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
that this censure, by the sentence of all good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
will merite the acceptance of my former bookes,
which hetherto haue escaped the disgrace of publique
reproofe. Protesting, in the behalfe of my writing, that
my desire hath euermore bene, to instruct all men, and
not to iniure the worst of the wicked. And now to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clude,
that vertue may haue her sample by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and vice her shame by these traitors, in the name
of experience, I aduise all men, who<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the height of their present conditions, to make
loyall and honest actions, the ladders of their aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
which will commend them with a beloued life,
or an honorable death: whē treason is the hatchet that
seuereth life, and ioyneth infamie vnto death. The
Lord be with your Lordshippe in all your affaires: for
whose health and honorable prosperitie, the good sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes
of England continually pray.</p>
