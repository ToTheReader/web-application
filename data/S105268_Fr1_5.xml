   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE famous <hi>Grecians</hi> had a Law, (though after mittigated by <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rondas)</hi> that who soeuer for feare did run away from Battle, should be punished with death. So, least I should come in the reuerence of that Law, or be called a Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I haue presumed to publish these my long conceyted Poems to common light: And like that valiant <hi>Bayard</hi> (who feeling himselfe deadly wounded, and vnable to sit on his Horse, commaunded his Souldiers to lay him against a tree, but in such sort, as he might die with his face to the Enemie) I resolue, since I haue alreadie from wisest cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, receiued my death shot, by printing my papers, to die with my face to the Foe. And since (louing Lector) <hi>Non omnibus datur adire Corinthum,</hi> I am contented to be poynted at for a foolish Poet, so I may be reputed a fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Subiect. <hi>Mauricius</hi> forewarned by Dreames, and sundry Prognostications, that <hi>Phocas</hi> should kill him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of <hi>Philip</hi> his sonne in law who this <hi>Phocas</hi> was? Who answered, hee was a faynt and cowardly fellow. The Emperour thereby concluded, hee was both cruell, and a murtherer. I feare no foe () saue faynting <hi>Phocas,</hi> who cowardly concealing his owne, will cruelly murther my Verses. Thus humbly submitting my home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboures to thy charitable casligation, I rest.</p>
