Which when they had fought a long tyme, deliuered to his Captaynes and Souldiars this manner of speach.

Much more ought wee therefore (who are indued with a more excellent nature, and haue by the instinct thereof, no lesse care of wife, and children, libertye, fame and victory, then of piety, and Religion of the Goddes) fight and puissantly stand agaynst the force and furye of the Enemy. If the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Cock fighting, yelded to this noble Athenian Captaine, an argument and reason, to prouoke and enkendle the mindes of his sould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iars to prowes and valiantnes, who can iustly controlle your attempt in this discourse of warres: albeit I graunt you are in respect of an old trayned Souldiar, but a very Cockerell. What I haue perused, my notes and penne detecteth. Your endeuors cannot be but commendable, desart greater, if you were well employed. My good Blandy, in conclusion, so farr is it, that I may call your stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies into reprehension, that I could wishe other your Elders in Militarie discipline, disposed as you are, and furnished with your skill and facultye.</p>
