      <hi>TO THE COVRTEOVS READER</hi> As touching the vse and abuse of Historie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F Historie were as easily conceited and made vse of, as (according to <hi>Baldus)</hi> it hath true proportion and documents for the gouernment of mans life, I should hold it no sinne so precisely to prescribe a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation and bound, to such as should enter the List, and consult with example. For what more pleasing to our selues; or profitable for societies could euer befall vs, then in this theatre of mans life, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Historie affordeth all sorts of actors) to sit and learne preuention by other mens perils, and to grow amplie wise by forraine wreckes; al which being traduced to our priuate vses; we may either as partners in what we haue past, or obseruers of future casualties; by presedent euents, tie ages to our memories: and preuent our escapes, by suruew of other mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, briefly beget experience by sight, or foresight of worldly casualties, and forme a mirror of forepassed errors, to foreiudge our future calamities. But for that it behoueth vs to enter this worldly Academie, the more prepared, the more that Historie is fraught and fulfilled with plentiful fruite, and whereas the difficultie and difference is a like, to yeeld an vpright verdict both of a mans owne, and other mens life, neither may any man rightly examine another (how wise so euer he be) except in equall ballance he weigh his own imperfections; it must necessarily follow on both sides, that with the more wisedome, and the greater obseruation wee ought to entertaine Historie, least our mind like the wind should wander vncertainely, and our deuotion should preuent our reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; our esteeme our knowledge. For as in an ample and well furnished and affluent banquet, although some things, (and they to few men) seeme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, othersome to other are without taste and seeme tart, and euerie one iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his meate not by proofe, but by the pallate; yet notwithstanding there is a certaine mean, which either natures ordinarie, or the defined kind of nutriment (being simple and incorrupt) hath fashioned and fixed for most aptest for the body; from which whosoeuer varieth, or either beyond measure, or without iudgment, followeth his foolish appetite, and glutting himselfe beyond discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reapeth more in commoditie then pleasure by these pleasures: So in the diuersitie of mans life, although a thousand formes, a thousand similitudes bee offered, and that euerie man fashioneth other mens manners to his mind, yet is their but one true path that vertue walketh in, which whosoeuer tracketh with
<pb facs="4"/>
iudgement, doth truly know the vse of life; whereas they that sit in a plentifull banquet, in affecting all things, can make vse of nothing. Now how many are there, I pray you, that in respect either of their owne, or other mens acts &amp; words (according to the rule of vertue) can be more choise in iudging minds, as meats, and that in this matter seemeth not sufficiently instructed? wherein I wonder that men espie not their errors, whereas they imagine that Historie is the instructor of such as read the same, whereas it onely yeeldeth matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, euen as the banquet ministreth meat according to euerie mans affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some therefore are seduced with the sweetnes of the stile, and in seeking their pleasure, lose their profit; who reape no other fruit of Historie, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile time, and beget officious idlenes, laughing away houres, and nourish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: others in reading glorie, hunt it in a shadow, where if they could make vse of it in proportion, they could not fall to repent it. And whereas no man can aspire to true glorie without true vertue, neither no wise man will hope further, yet see we many men, that because they haue read many excellent works, will be Capricious and pretend wisedome; resembling those tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedians, who will after they haue discharged themselues of their parts, and apparrell wherein they counterfaited the Emperour, yet retaine his royall and princely manners: Some triuiall and light witted, that make an Eclipse of a shadow, make more of the embleme, then the worke; the habit then the Doctor: So admirable effects worketh history in mens mind. Now whereas it is the most exact and chiefest intent of historie to awaken mans idlenes, and arme them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst casualties, and the whole bent of example hath no other issue, it falleth out thorow mens securitie (who suppose that their neighbours perils concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them not) that whatsoeuer is of note, is ouerslipt with a deafe and slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping iudgement, and things that memorie should best loue, are lost in her. To conclude, there are some that will haue euerie mans shooe fitted on their owne last, &amp; tie all mens pens to their own pleasures: For which cause partly by reason of this secret, partly thorow this ill ordered, confused, and rash method of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as of corrupt humours, so is there growen a certaine <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> of iudgement and resolution: and as in intemperate bodies, meat yeeldeth verie little profit; so reape they no fruit or benefit by their reading. By this good reader thou maist easily conceiue, how a historie ought to be read: how mens liues ought in them selues be examined: finally how equal a proportiō is required in both. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my opinion the chiefest ground of this difficultie, is the peruersnes of our iudgements, which is the cause we the rather respect our own inclinations what they are, then the true life and force of example. Furthermore this is no lesse mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie then the former, that such as write set downe such things as are acted, not onely for their profit sake, but to feed their owne humours: and like to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Architects (by interposing their iudgements) doe vainely praise some things, supposing that our imitation should betied to their pleasure; where if they performed what they ought to do, the reader should incounter with no such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions: but now in like manner as Cookes who rather expect their masters pleasurable taste, then his profit; would God the Historiographer did not affect flatterie. It therefore appeareth that in two sorts (first in our owne iudgement; and next to the preiudice of those that write) we are circumuented; in that
<pb facs="4"/>
they set not downe such euents as passe, in their owne nature and as they are. For he that writeth an Historie is the interpretor of those things that are past, whose iudgement being depraued, it fareth with him as with the purest &amp; most richest wine, which waxeth mustie by reason of that vessel wherein it is inclosed, or is by sophistication corrupted, which is the greatest folly, &amp; most intolerable deceit that may befal men. They therfore, who negligētly vndertake a historiy, (or suppose that life were to be past rashly, and without an exact obseruance of all offices) are no lesse deceiued then certaine countrey pesants in the last troubles of France (of whose folly I drewe some example) who attempting and entring vpon a citie not farre off from them, &amp; lighting into an Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries shop furnished with all kind of drugs and dainties, and being allured by the pleasure, odors and delight of the confections they tasted; and supposing all to be of the same kind, deuoured, tasted, and swallowed downe euery thing: whereupon some fell sicke of feauers, some grew phrensie, and manie lost their liues to please their appetites, at leastwise he that scaped best, gaue occasion of laughter to the lookers on. For as life, so Historie (the image of life) is fraught with pleasure, and displeasure; and onely in the vse of life, the wisedome of life consisteth. Fare well, vse this, and my selfe as two twinnes borne for thy profit.</p>
