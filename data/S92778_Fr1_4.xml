      </note> cited by <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) as the orthodoxe <hi>CHVRCH</hi> ever believed, and primitiuelie professed, that they made but two Estates of the <hi>CHVRCH;</hi> one Militant on Earth, and another Triumphant in Heaven: So, altho our Beliefe and Profession, bee jumplie agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; yet not onlie will our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries haue a third estate of Christians, vnder the <hi>GOSPEL,</hi>
      <pb n="10" facs="7"/> after death, in <hi>Purgatorie;</hi> but also of the Fathers and Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, vnder the Law, in an Hellish <hi>Limbo;</hi> and, that thither our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour behoved locallie to descend, after His death, for their libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">The state of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie.</note> So that heere-in standeth the question betweene vs, (lest thou shouldest mistake the state there-of) <hi>Whether the Soules of the Patriarches, &amp; Godly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, vntill CHRISTS death, were detayned captiue, in a part of Hell, called</hi> Limbus Patrum? And, <hi>That CHRIST descended locallie in His Soule thither, for their liberation?</hi> They holde the Affirmatiue, and wee the Negatiue; seeing <hi>David,</hi> speaking of him-selfe, clearlie doeth say,<note place="margin">Psal. 73.24.</note>
      <hi>Thou wilt guide mee with Thy counsell, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after</hi> (not inclose mee in an Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Dungeon,) but <hi>receiue mee

      <note place="margin">Durand. in <hi>3.</hi> Sent. Dist. <hi>22.</hi> q. <hi>3.</hi>
      </note> all <hi>PROTESTANTS</hi> acknowledge His descense thither virtuallie, and by effect. But wee deny main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the <hi>Popish</hi> ende of His descense thither, whether virtuallie, or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie the same were affirmed. Yea, taking <hi>Hell</hi> (as it should be) properlie, for the place of Torment onlie, and estate of the Damned, (all other <hi>Limboes</hi> beeing but imaginarie <hi>Chimeraes.</hi>) It is
<pb n="12" facs="8"/> the constant doctrine of all the <hi>Romanists</hi> with vs, that except virtuallie, or by effect, <hi>CHRIST</hi> no-wyse descended locallie into <hi>Hell,</hi> thus vnderstood. Therefore, if we proue, that the <hi>Patriarches,</hi> before <hi>CHRIST'S</hi> death, were not in <hi>Hell,</hi> (as both Scripture, and most orthodoxe Fathers doe witnesse) and consequentlie, that in <hi>Hell</hi> there was no such place of their detention, as a <hi>Limbus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum;</hi> Wee shall, without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, evince, that locallie <hi>CHRIST</hi> descended not thither, for that ende of their liberation: and so obtayning, that they were not in anie such <hi>Limbus,</hi> &amp; that <hi>CHRIST</hi> descended not in Soule, to deliver them out of anie such <hi>Limbus;</hi> For anie other manner of His descense into <hi>Hell,</hi> (seeing both sides grant a descense vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and in effect to the place of
<pb n="13" facs="8"/> the Damned) betweene them and vs, there would rest no controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, nor can they bee anie way able vnjustlie to vpbrayd vs, with any denyall of a cleare Article in the Creed, <hi>Of CHRISTS descense into Hell;</hi> this <hi>Popish Limbus</hi> onlie being taken out of the way, into which onlie, for the fore-sayd liberation, they affirme a locall descending.</p>
   <p>Which detention of the holie <hi>Patriarches,</hi> and Godlie, in anie such <hi>Hellish Prison,</hi> vnder the Law, is a doctrine, not onlie cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the veritie of Scripture, and abating from the force of Man's Fayth, and <hi>GOD'S</hi> Mercie; but also, is no lesse derogatorie to the efficacie of <hi>CHRIST'S</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, &amp; vertue of His death, (who was that Lambe, slayne from the beginning of the Worlde;) nor Man's satisfaction, in that <hi>Popish
<pb n="14" facs="9"/> Purgatorie,</hi> vnder the <hi>GOSPEL</hi> now, is a-lyke abasing of the same Merite, and curtayling of the blessed power of His paynfull Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: and so, are both sacrilegious Heresies, and accursed encroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings vpon the <hi>LORDS</hi> Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue Royall, and Priestlie Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence.</p>
