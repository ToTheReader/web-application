   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I durst print a Booke, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion I durst not thinke of any other Patron
<pb facs="3"/> then your Lordship, to whom, by all the ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of preferment, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, gratitude, duty, and domestick service, I stand so strictly oblig'd; to whom should the Booke belong, but to him to whom the Author?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note>
      <hi>Doth any man plant a tree, and not eat of the fruit?</hi> Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath both <hi>planted,</hi> and <hi>watred;</hi> the fruite therefore (such as it is <hi>sower Grapes</hi>) I heere humbly present your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with, to whom by yet further, and more speciall
<pb facs="3"/> interests it owes it selfe; These Meditations (my Lord) they were the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of those weary houres of that slowe recovery, which (I must confesse) next to Gods, I had by your Lordships special care, and furtherance, out of that my late, long, and hopelesse sicknesse, so that it were a kinde of theft to make ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to any other of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of those houres, which I then but borrowed from your Lordsh ps more publique service: your Lordship must here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="4"/> expect rather sickly thoughts, then serious stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and so, if neither margent-throng'd with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, nor Method-bound with Art, the proverbe will plead pardon, <hi>Thoughts are free;</hi> nor indeede is it but of the nature of this kinde of writing, rather to touch, then presse; to dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>play, then discusse the subiect.</p>
   <p>Why I make not my Epistle Dedicatory (to the custome) laudatory, your Lordships resolu'd declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such kind of cheape,
<pb facs="4"/> hackny fly-blowne fame, may be cause enough; such as are so happy as to know you, know well enough how little you neede it, how lesse you love it: besides, 'twould be thought (being a servant) I durst doe no other, and <hi>necessitas nec habet legem, nec lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi> nor law, nor laud.</p>
   <p>Why I make this my vnlabour'd pastime of thinking, thus venturous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publique, as (I must conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sse) it was not that commonly pretended m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="5"/> of friends; so, much lesse was it any over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening opinion of the worth, but next to Gods glory, and your Lordships service, the causes are these two; in the first place the vindication (as much as in me lyes) of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from that common brand which her Romish adversaries so frequently vpbrayd her with, that she spends all her devotion on the Pulpit, and keepes n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ne for the Closet; in the next place, a prebable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation (by these) of the
