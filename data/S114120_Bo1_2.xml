      </gap> this life, or to frame accusations against the time in which they befall us, is the property of ignorant and wicked men; of such as have no true knowledge either of God, or of themselves and their owne condition. When any querimonies of this kinde sound in our eares, we may seeme to beare the voice of <hi>Cain,</hi> repining against God and his just proceedings. <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 4. 13.</note>
      <hi>My punishment</hi> (saith he) <hi>is greater then I am able to beare.</hi> Or of the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> murmuring in the wildernesse, by acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of every want or distresse <hi>Cain</hi> should have complained of the sinne he had committed: that is, of himselfe who had so unnaturally, so treacherously, so wickedly slaine his righteous brother <hi>Abel.</hi> And the <hi>Israelites</hi> should have knowne and considered that their wants and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
<pb n="8" facs="17"/>
in the desart, were from the hand of their gratious and loving God, of whose love and care of them, they had not long before so joyfull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in their miraculous both deliverance out of Egypt, and preservation at the red Sea: all which (had they not beene more then unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) would have beene fresh in their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. They should have considered likewise that those afflictions were not punishments so much as fatherly corrections by which they were to be schooled and nurtured; being as yet a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious people, unfit and unworthy to become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in that happy land of Canaan. Both <hi>Cain</hi> (I say) and that people should have turned<note place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints should be against ones▪ selfe.</note> their complaints and accusations against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And so all men, of what age soever, when the infirmities of this miserable life lye heavy upon them should looke backe to the first punishment of the first transgression. <hi>In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy bread, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>Dust thou art,</hi> &amp;c. And also to their inbred corruption and manifold actuall sins they should have had an eye, because they had deserved the afflictions of which they complained, as they are punishments, and did necessarily require them as fatherly chastisements.</p>
   <p>And this one consideration might stop the mouthes of those complayners, whether they be such as before they come to this age (having stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died for some exceptions against it) fall into a base account of it; or Old Men themselves, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily so called, which are ever whining and complaining of their <hi>onus Aetna gravius</hi> (so
