Wherein I do moste chiefly note the secrete iudgemente of God, <note place="margin">The secret iudgement of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in all ages.</note> whiche hath not onely bene nowe declared by the moste wretched slaughter of thys member of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriste, but also heretofore in all tymes and ages euen frō the first creation of mā, to this presēt time of our sensible vnderstandynge of
<pb facs="3"/>
this exēple &amp; many others chaūce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge to lyke effecte.</p>
   <p>For after that God had made <note place="margin">God fyrste entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Adam.</note> Adam in his perfection and asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated hym w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> a cōpanion for his comforte: He gaue vnto him incō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinētly certeyne preceptes, which he commaunded moste diligently to be obserued, that is, to vse all his heauēly giftes cōteined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Paradise to his most delectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, sauynge one pore seely tree, which he had reserued to his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasure.</p>
   <p>But this obliuious minister A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, hauynge more respecte to the flattering tonge of Eua, who had receyued a corrupt doctrine of the serpent, and wyth lyght persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inkenled in his herte wyth the pestilent flame of vayne glorie, in that he thoughte to atteyne to the estimation to knowe boeth good and euyl, and so be made equal in
<pb facs="3"/>
knoweledge wyth God, was by iust and secrete iudgemēt of God depriued of his administration, ex pulsed out of Paradise, and made a slaue and vile bondmā to death and synne. Notwithstandyng the wrath of God dyd not so farre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre into iudgemente wyth Adam, that he dyd vtterly forsake hym, but yet once more made him a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistre vpon the earth, &amp; gaue hym <note place="margin">Ciuile po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer geue to Adam in earth.</note> ciuile power to rule all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures therin, &amp; to constitute other rulers vnder hym. By the whiche authoritie Adam dyd substitute Cain his elder sonne &amp; Abell his brother lyke ciuile officers vnto God. But Cain beinge a spiteful <note place="margin">Cain an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious and couetous minister.</note> and enuious minister, wyllynge his owne prefermente, boastynge his hypocritical deedes, iudgynge euyll of his brothers conscience, misusyng his function, vnsaylled in his administration, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
<pb facs="4"/>
not his vocation: yea coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng hym selfe only to be in office, and his vnpure sacrifice to seme moste beste, beganne moste tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously to persecute his brother &amp; at the laste slewe hym to the high displeasure of god: whereupon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie god procedynge into defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite sentence of his moste secrete <note place="margin">The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt of god agaynste Cain and al his issue.</note> iudgement wyth Cain, gaue hym vp into lyke death, and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie linially descendynge from hym was consumed in the floude of Noe. In the whiche floude is in lyke case to be noted the greate Ire and wrath of god agaynste the vniuersall worlde, for that <note place="margin">The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt of god agaynste the whole worlde,</note> they contempned hym. For theyr adulterie and tyrannte, wherein they moste abhominably dyd vse all kynde of fylthie and viciouse lyuynge. For the texte sayeth. The sonnes of the godlie beganne
<pb facs="4"/>
to wexe tyrannes vpon the earth.</p>
   <p>❧ After thys stoude, the seede of man beinge multiplyed agayne, to some numbre, among the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deis <note place="margin">The iustice of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the Chaldeis.</note> they beganne to buylde a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and a stronge towre, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it Babylon, whereby they thoughte in theyr folyshe cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to prostrate vnto theyr o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beysaunce the vniuersall earth.</p>
   <p>But God of hys diuine power forseynge theyr folyshe though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and wycked Imaginations, preuented them, and ministred vnto them hys iustice, confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge theyr speaches, whereby theyr workes were lefte vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, theyr councelles broken, theyr Kyngdome in processe made desolate, and ledde awaye captyue by the Assiriās, and so came to an vtter destructiō. And not without iuste cause dyd God precede wyth
<pb facs="5"/>
this wycked generation into iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, for by them arose the first <note place="margin">The fyrste occasion of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</note> occasion of Idolatrie. For when the godly amonge them, made sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto God, it so pleased God to kendle their sacrifice (whiche they had prepared) wyth fier from heauen. The vngodly folowinge theyr maner of sacrifice, brunte it in lyke fashion wyth fier, and so of their imaginations and dreames made a newe sacrifice vnto God, wythout expresse cōmaundement of the word of God, or els hauyng any truste in the promise of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes commynge. The same venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of God was not absent frō Kynge Pharao, who wyth obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <note place="margin">Pharao.</note> wyll and purpose abusynge the myght of his ciuile power, did most cruelly persecute the chyldrē of God. God loked vpon the house of Israel, and among kinges there sate he in iudgemente, where he
<pb facs="5"/>
found Abimelech giltie of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Abimelech</note> death, and hym lefte not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaged for his offence. Into the same iudgement entred god wyth Saule, who for his malicious sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke and stubburne hert against the electe of God, miserably peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, the ceptre and kyngly honor beinge taken awaye from his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie, yea, he laste of all rigned amonge his generation, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Saule.</note> wyth hym vtterly dyed his generation. And the kyngdome was deliuered into the handes of Dauid the annoynted of god. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that Asa deserued muche cōmēdation, for that he abrogated <note place="margin">Asa.</note> the vayne &amp; superstitious honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of god in so much y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he spared not to punishe his owne naturall mother in this behalfe, for she also vsed a certeyne superstition in hir religion: yet escaped not he thys strayght iudgemēt of god, for that
<pb facs="6"/>
he had wroughte a certeyne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie, &amp; had set apart his truste and hope in god. Ioram comman̄<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Elders of the realme &amp; his <note place="margin">Joram</note> bretherne to be slayne, and he was the authour of a newe Idolatrie, wherfore god for his iniquitie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged hym, and gaue hym ouer into the handes of the Philistians, by whom he was slayne, his wife and chyldren ledde away prisoners, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his yongest sonne Dchosias. <note place="margin">Ochosias.</note> who folowynge the steppes of his father renewed false religiō, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore god extēded his Ire agaynste hym, &amp; gaue hym ouer into destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Howbeit his mother Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia <note place="margin">Athalia</note> when she sawe hir sonne dead, dreadynge leste some of his kynred would take vpon him the crowne, she comaūded y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> al, whiche remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the kinges bloud shoulde be slayne. And so by thys meanes the <note place="margin">Salomons bloude de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</note> stocke &amp; whole house of Salomon
<pb facs="6"/>
was extinguished for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> only cause of disobeyinge goddes word, for the maintenaūce of Idolatry, &amp; despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing true religiō. And Athalia hir <note place="margin">Athalia slayne.</note> selfe for hir tiranny &amp; vsurpation cōtrary the wil of god escaped not vnauenged. For the high priest cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maūded hir to be slaine as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to goddes trueth, and vnmete ministre in the house of the Lorde. Ioas was an holy mā, &amp; loued wel to heare Ioiada preache the worde <note place="margin">Ioas</note> of god, as lōg as he lyued, but whē Ioiada was dead, he fel to Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, &amp; kylled the prophete zachary Ioiada sōne before the tēple. And for this, gods wil was y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he should be punished among the Sirians, and at the laste he was strangled among his owne seruaūtes. A sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of like effecte we reade of kynge Amasias. This Amasias when he was fyrst chosen kynge, wholy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed <note place="margin">Amasias</note> hym selfe to godly lyuinge,
<pb facs="7"/>
and elected to heare the prophetes preache, &amp; for that cause god made hym fortunate agaynste the Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. But incontinuaunce he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to were proud against god, and beinge constrayned of no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, to fulfyll his owne sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al appetite, he woulde nedes haue warre, wherein he was taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and so died wretchedly. And as Ozias, otherwyse called Asari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <note place="margin">Ozias ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Asarias</note> succeded hym in administratiō of the kyngdom, so lyke wise he fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed hym in state and condition of lyuynge, for at the begynnynge he was vertuous and a fauourer of the worde of God, and had tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe the healpe of god, a notable victory against the Philistians.</p>
   <p>Afterwarde where as he woulde haue done sacrifice in the temple contrary the commaundement of god, he was striken wyth an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible leprosie. I maye not in thys
<pb facs="7"/>
place forget Achas, who also ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Achas.</note> false religion, and of a peruers studie &amp; affection conceiued in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiō, he buylded chappels and aultares euery where thorowout al his realme, but god espied hym, and gaue hym and all his realme into the spoyle of straungers. No parcial iudge was god who spared not his anger from his onely cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen people, and the posteritie and ofsprynge of Abraham, to whom he made so greate and fayethfull promises: but iustly punished thē in the sixt yere of Ezechias, when the kyng of the Assirians conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the citie of Samaria, and led awaye captiue the. x. tribes of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell. For that they had instituted <note place="margin">The. x. tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell.</note> a peculiar and a straunge religion wythin thē selues, taught a newe doctrine, and made sacrifice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the decrees whiche god had geuen ouer them, abusynge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb facs="8"/>
vnder the pretence of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des worde and name, to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne and vpholde theyr priuate power and vsurped Kyngdome. What secrete iudgement God v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed wyth Manasse, howe ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously he deite wyth hym, let your <note place="margin">Manasse</note> consciences iudge. Wicked and ab horninable was his administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for of a false &amp; diabolicall zeale of holynes he burned his owne sō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in steede of sacrifice vnto the lorde, he persecuted the prophetes, and sawed Esaias the holy one in sunder. Yet being takē of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, knowledgyng his detestable factes, god toke hym into fauour. Did not god abbreuiat and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the kyngdome of Amon, and gaue hym ouer into the handes of <note place="margin">Amon</note> his owne seruauntes to be slayne, for his wycked administration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord: Who would thinke that God would haue ben displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="8"/>
wyth Iosias, which suppressed all false religion, pulled downe, <note place="margin">Iosias.</note> the chapples and Idolles, and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the bones of the false preachers to be burned, whō they had tofore misused for reliques: Yea, he restored the bokes of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses whiche had bene hydden away a longe tyme. That not wythstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge, where as he thoughte that all thynges woulde frame well and luckely wyth hym, because he was so holte a man, because he dyd so many good deedes of charitie, he woulde needes fyghie wyth the Kynge of Egypte, who woulde gladly haue lyued in peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiryng the same at Iosias hand.</p>
   <p>But Iosias presumynge vpon his holynesse, and trustyng in his owne strengthe, was stroken to death in the same battayle. And althoughe these were sufficient to feare any christiās hert, willing to
<pb facs="9"/>
subdue his stubberne &amp; to muche swellynge stomacke againste the wyll of the Lorde, yet I wyl brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recite (so that ye shal not thinke it tedious) howe god dyd prostrate and vtterly destroye the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of his faythfull people, and the stoute rebellions agaynste his worde in the reste of the age of the world, as I hetherto haue begon. Dyd not the pertinacy and stoute stomacke of Sedechias despisynge the godly preachyng of Hieremias <note place="margin">Sedechias</note> make god angry wyth hym and suffre him to be taken prisoner, his owne sonnes to be kylled afore his face, his eyes to be plucked out of his head, the parētes to eate theyr owne chyldren for hunger, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Hierusalem to be destroyed, the tēple (whō he had cōmaunded to be buylded) consumed wyth fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the most chosen part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iuda brought into captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

of the Babilonians. God of his moste secrete iudgemēt stirred vp the hertes of the Medtans and Persians agaynst Balthasar, who <note place="margin">Balthasar</note> blasphemed the name of God, and abused the vesselles of the Lordes house (dedicated to his holy admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration) in the Bankatyng<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

      </gap> his concubines. And so throught this blasphemynge and stoute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistaunce of goddesholy wyll, the citie of Babilō was cōquired and the whole empire of the Chaldeis and Assirians made subiect to the rule of the Persians. I cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte the tyrannicall and bloudy persecution of Aman the vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to hynge Assuerus who tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe <note place="margin">Amos</note> his power and subtil ingine had obteyned a commission of the kynge to destroye Goddes people vnder the name of Iewes, wherby he was sure to haue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> godly quene Hester put to death. But god be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="10"/>
a present remedy to his electe rewarded Aman wyth the same gibbet or haulter, whiche he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for goddes people. Howe longe dyd god defer his iudgemēt from Antiochus, the very figure of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, who commaunded goddes holy word to be burned, he sore pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished those christiās that woulde <note place="margin">Antiochus</note> not beleue vpon his fayth▪ He also prophaned the temple of god, for he set vp there an Idoll of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Howbeit the anger of god fel vpō hym. For his stocke &amp; ofspring dyd not onely perishe vtterly, but the whole Empyre also was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and subiected to the Siri ans. And nowe to perfourme my promise that I in the begynnynge dyd make, that is, in fewe wordes to notice the most notable hie sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries cōcernying y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> persecutiō of the christians executed in all ages, let vs come to the tyme of Christ. In
<pb facs="10"/>
the which the fyrst and most cruel persecutiō was of Herode agaynst Iohn Baptist. For at the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les requeste of Herodiades his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Herode</note> doughter, who had wel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hym wyth hir friscalles &amp; most lasciuious daunsing, he graunted hir by an othe, to fulfyl hir request what soeuer she would demaunde. where vpon she asked the heade of saincte Iohn Baptiste. But to the greate and miserable rueth of the boeth. For they were banished out of theyr countrey and depriued of their princely honoure by Caius Caligula. An other of the same bloud, called likewise Herode, neuy to the aforesayed Herode, slewe the <note place="margin">Herode</note> apostle S. Iames the elder, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore god shortned their kingdoms and roted them out as vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ministers vnto hym, &amp; brought their posteritie into vtter confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that wythin a shorte tyme.
