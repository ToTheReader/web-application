   <l>SVch is the Verse thou Writist, that who reades Thine</l>
   <l>Can never be content to suffer Mine:</l>
   <l>Such is the Verse I Write, that reading Mine,</l>
   <l>I hardly can beleeve I have read Thine:</l>
   <l>And wonder, that their Excellence once knowne,</l>
   <l>I nor correct, nor yet conceale mine owne.</l>
   <l>Yet though I Danger feare, then Censure lesse;</l>
   <l>Nor apprehend a Breach, like to a Presse:</l>
   <l>Thy Merits, now the second time, inflame</l>
   <l>To sacrifice the Remnant of my Shame.</l>
   <l>Nor yet (as first) Alone, but joyn'd with Those</l>
   <l>Who make the loftiest Verse, seeme humblest Prose.</l>
   <l>Thus did our Master, to his Praise, desire</l>
   <l>That Babes should with Philosophers conspire:</l>
   <l>And Infants their Hosanna's should unite</l>
   <l>With the so Famous Areopagite.</l>
   <l>Perhaps my Stile too, is for Praise most fit;</l>
   <l>Those shew their Iudgment least, who shew their wit:</l>
   <l>And are suspected, least their subtiller Aime</l>
   <l>Be rather to attaine, then to give Fame.</l>
   <l>Perhaps whil'st I my Earth doe interpose</l>
   <l>Betwixt thy Sunne and Them, I may aid those</l>
   <l>Who have but feebler Eyes and weaker Sight,</l>
   <l>To beare thy Beames, and to support thy Light.</l>
   <l>So thy Ecclipse, by neighbouring Darkenesse made,</l>
   <l>VVere no injurious, but a usefull Shade:</l>
   <l>How e're I finish heere, my Muse her Daies</l>
   <l>Ends in expressing thy deserved Praise:</l>
   <l>VVhose fate in this seemes fortunately cast,</l>
   <l>To have so just an Action for her Last.</l>
   <l>And since there are, who have been taught, that Death</l>
   <l>Inspireth Prophecie, expelling Breath.</l>
   <l>I hope, when these foretell, what happie Gaines</l>
   <l>Posteritie shall reape from these thy Paines:</l>
   <l>Nor yet from these alone, but how thy Pen,</l>
   <l>Earth-like, shall yearely give new Gifts to Men:</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="41"/>
And Thou fresh Praise, and we fresh Good receive</l>
   <l>(For he who Thus can write can never Leave)</l>
   <l>How Time in them shall never force a Breach;</l>
   <l>But they shall alwayes Live and alwaies Teach:</l>
   <l>That the sole likelihood which these present,</l>
   <l>Will from the more rais'd Soules command Assent;</l>
   <l>And the so taught, will not Beliefe refuse,</l>
   <l>To the last Accents of a Dying Muse.</l>
