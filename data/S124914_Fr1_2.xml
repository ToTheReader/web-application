   <head>TO THE RIGHT Honorable, George Duke of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham his Grace, <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Arroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> and <hi>Surrey, Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwicke, Iohn</hi> Earle of <hi>Houldernes,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Counsell for New-England.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ay it please your Lordships, that whereas you granted your Commission vnto Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Robert Gorges,</hi> Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>New England,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Fraunces West,</hi> my selfe, and the Gouernour of <hi>New-Plimoth,</hi> as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers with him, for the ordering and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all the said Terretories, wherein wee haue ben diligent to the vttermost of our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, as we shall be ready to render an account vnto your Honors, when you shall be pleased to require vs thereunto. In the meane time, I thought it my dutie to present vnto your viewes, such obseruation as I haue taken, both of the Countrey and People, Commodities
<pb facs="4"/>&amp; Discommodities: as also, what places are fit to settle Plantations in, in which not, what courses ate fit in my vnderstanding to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for bringing Glory to God, Hounour to our King &amp; Nation, good vnto the Commō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, &amp; profit to all Aduenturers and Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: which I humbly beseech your Lordships to accept of, as the best fruits of a shallow ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasitie: so shall I thinke my time and charge well imploied, which I haue spent in these affaires.</p>
   <p>I haue omitted many things in this my discourse, which I conceiued to be Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent at this time for me to relate, as of the time of my being at Sea, of the strange Fish which wee there saw, some with wings fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboue the water, others with manes, eares and heads, and chasing one another with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen mouths like stone Horses in a parke, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the steering of our Course, the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sunne and Starres, by which the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuation of the Pole is found, the degrees of latitude knowen, which shews how far a ship is out of his due course, either to the North or South: likewise of the making of the land at our arriuall vpon the choast of <hi>New-England,</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>how it did arise and appeare vnto vs: how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Harbour beares one from another vpon the point of the Compas: and what Rockes and dangers are in the way: how many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom water is found by sounding at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of euery Harbour: and from how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the seuerall winds all the Harbours are land locked. But by this meanes I thought I should not only be tedious, but also be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loosing my selfe, for want of fit phraises, and sound iudgement, in the Arts of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematickes and Nauigation, (being but a young Scholler, though an ancient trauiler by sea) and therefore thought better to omit those, then any thing I haue relate.</p>
   <p>Thus beseeching God to blesse your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors. I rest at your Lordshippes seruice.</p>
