   <p>THis small Tract, now aboue two
yeeres past, was by mee printed for
that worthy Knight the Authour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
with no intent to haue it published:
and being hitherto by me suppressed from
reprinting here at home; I find it to bee
of late time printed in Scotland (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
both to the Authours and my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation)
and Dedicated by another man
to the Bishops and Cleargy there, and so
made more publike, being of it selfe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate,
then was first intended: which (I
suppose) had the Author knowen,
or once misdoubted the sequell, instead
of <hi>De non temerandis Ecclesiis,</hi>
hee would haue studied another Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<hi>De non temerandis Scriptis
alienis:</hi> that his writings might
<pb facs="3"/>
not be impropriated, when Benefices are
made proper. Wherefore finding many
st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ps in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> from his copie, I haue (as well
in the right of the Authour as of my
selfe to whom the right of the sole Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
belonged) caused it to be reprinted.
And though at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> time of the putting it
to the Presse, I could not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>erre with
the Author, he being then in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
yet hath it pleased him since his
comming home, to adde something more
vnto it, as his leasure would permit him;
which I haue annexed to the end therof.
And thus haue I attempted to make a
priuate worke publike, lest the faults of
other men, should vniustly he cast vpon
him, that deserued so well in so rare an
Argument.</p>
