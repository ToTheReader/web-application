      <l>I Soong of late as time then gaue me scope;</l>
      <l>Howbee't for other times a way left ope:</l>
      <l>But now, as now; to th'end my Lord may heare,</l>
      <l>My voice, then hoars, to day is waxen cleere:</l>
      <l>My former Shepheards song deuised was</l>
      <l>To please great <hi>Scotus,</hi> and his <hi>Lycidas,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>But this for <hi>Galla,</hi> whom th'All-mightie power</l>
      <l>Hath made a Lilly-Rose, and double flower:</l>
      <l>O Vally Lilly, and Sharon-Rose her blesse!</l>
      <l>Though this good speed preuēted hath my presse:</l>
      <l>Else had I not this peece of booke alone,</l>
      <l>But whole <hi>Du Bartas</hi> offred at your throne;</l>
      <l>For either nation counterpaged thus,</l>
      <l>T'acquaint more vs with them, and them with vs.</l>
      <l>Yet <hi>(o!)</hi> vouchsafe it thus and grant an eare</l>
      <l>To these two Swains, whom I ore-heard whilcare.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>As Shepheard <hi>Musidor</hi> sate on a balke,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Philemon</hi> commeth to him, and they talke</l>
      <l>(Least on <hi>[quoth he]</hi> my tongue ore-often run)</l>
      <l>Thus each with oth'r; I stay till they haue done.</l>
   </lg>
   <sp>

      <l>Good day! what not a word? how dost thou fare?</l>
      <l>Or art thou sicke, or takest thou some care?</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Mu.</speaker>
      <l>Care, Shepheard? yea, to shew what ioy I can.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
      <l>How? that's a riddle; what's thy meaning man?</l>
   </sp>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Mu.</speaker>
      <l>For sith a Nymph, a daught'r of Shepheards God,</l>
      <l>Who rules a world of sheepe with golden rod,</l>
      <l>From loftie shrine descending yet will daigne</l>
      <l>To stoope at this my cottage homely-plaine,</l>
      <l>And of her fauour make herselfe the guage</l>
      <l>To me, that ought her seeke on Pilgrimage:</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
      <l>Oh, now I see whereon thy mind is bent;</l>
      <l>How to prepare fit entertainement.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Mu.</speaker>
      <l>What shall behooue me do, or how to looke?</l>
      <l>For though I pawne my fairest pype and hooke;</l>
      <l>That one, which <hi>Damon</hi> gaue me by his will,</l>
      <l>That other woon in game on Magog hill;</l>
      <l>Ile entertaine her (She, I pawne my life,</l>
      <l>Will proue the greatest Kings child, sister, wife.)</l>
      <l>Ile entertaine her: If I not mistake,</l>
      <l>Some Wheat-floure haue I for a bridall-cake,</l>
      <l>And Abricots, and Plums blacke, red, and white,</l>
      <l>Preseru'd with hony cleere as chrysolite;</l>
      <l>And nuts, and peares, and apples prety store,</l>
      <l>My poultrie will affoord me somewhat more,</l>
      <l>Except the Fox deceiue me.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
      <l>Shame him take!</l>
      <l>Oft hath he made our Chaunticleer to quake:</l>
      <l>But Creame and Butt'r is skarce yet out of horn,</l>
      <l>And all Achats this yeare apprize to corn.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Mu.</speaker>
      <l>I nothing buy, nor haue I much to sell.</l>
      <l>Store is no sore; my house it finds full well.</l>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <l>For there is corne, and milke, and butt'r and cheese,</l>
      <l>Thankes vnto <hi>Pales:</hi> then, if please my bees,</l>
      <l>(That waxen wasps when any shrews do fret them)</l>
      <l>But if I may by gentlenesse entreat them</l>
      <l>To lend m'a combe as sweet as is my guest,</l>
      <l>Enough it will be for a Sheepheards feast.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>

      <l>With all the musicke of their heauenly queere.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
      <l>But how (I pray thee as thou lou'st the kirke)</l>
      <l>Wilt thou deuise to set them all awerke?</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Mu.</speaker>
      <l>I haue a pricke-song for <hi>Calliope,</hi>

      <l>In riualling for <hi>Helens</hi> of the flocke,</l>
      <l>Affront each other with a cannon knocke,</l>
      <l>Some faire Ewes wool-lock wearing each in horn,</l>

      <l>Embrew'd the Crosier-staffe with Dragons gore.</l>
      <l>This order shall she sing of all most liefe;</l>
      <l>Because my faire guest weds thereof the chiefe.</l>

      <l>Well-pleasing <hi>Euterp</hi> shall the next in order</l>

      <l>Sweet <hi>Erato</hi> that sets my guest a fire,</l>
      <l>Shall play the romant of her hearts desire:</l>
      <l>So bee't her Grace it hold no disrepute</l>
      <l>To heare it charmy-quauerd on her lute.</l>
      <l>Then shal the Bride-maids &amp; the Bride-men dance,</l>
      <l>The Men of England, with the Maids of France;</l>
      <l>And sing with <hi>Venus, Cupid, Himene,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>This Madrigall, set by <hi>Terpsichore.</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Spring-Quyristers, record this merry lay;</l>
      <l>For <hi>Galla</hi> faire to day</l>

      <l>Grow all the Ground, but chiefely where she goes,</l>
      <l>With White and Crimsin Rose;</l>
      <l>Her Loue is both of those.</l>
      <l>She shall him choose and take before the rest,</l>
      <l>To decke her lockes and brest;</l>
      <l>And both shall be so blest,</l>
      <l>That they and theirs shall golden Scepter weild</l>

      <l>The proudest plant afeild.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>

      <l>So, here is worke for Muses all but two;</l>
      <l>What hast thou more?</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Mu.</speaker>
      <p>Enough for them to do.</p>

      <p>Nay, vse but <hi>Clio;</hi> leaue <hi>Melpomene.</hi>

      <p>Why leaue her out? a stately Muse is she.</p>
   </sp>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <sp>

      <l>But still so sad, with looke cast-downe on earth,</l>
      <l>I doubt hir presence will defeat the myrth.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Mu.</speaker>
      <l>No, no, I will not part her from the Queere;</l>
      <l>But fit her humor; and to mend the cheere,</l>
      <l>(Out-set all other wofull destinie)</l>
      <l>My fattest lambe shall make a Tragedie.</l>
      <l>And sing the Muse will of no greater bug,</l>
      <l>Then warre betwixt a yong child and his dug;</l>
      <l>Controuling some, though not of high degree,</l>
      <l>As cause thereof; ye Ladies pardon me!</l>
      <l>The melancholie Muse yet saith, not I;</l>
      <l>All that your Sex dishonour I defie;</l>
      <l>But your faire bottles <hi>Melpomen</hi> doth thinke</l>
      <l>Dame nature fill'd, for your faire bab's to drinke.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>

      <l>Milke would she giue else only to the poore,</l>

   <sp>

      <l>And this 'tis like shee'll adde vnto the rest;</l>
      <l>That Ladies child deserues a Ladies brest;</l>
