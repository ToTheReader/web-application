   <head>The Prologue.</head>
   <p>GEntlemen, Inductions are out of date, and a Prologue in Verse is as stale, as a blacke Veluet Cloake, and a Bay Garland: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you shall haue it plaine Prose thus: If there be any amongst you, that come to heare lasciuious Scenes, let them depart: for I doe pronounce this, to the vtter discomfort of all two peny Gallerie men, you shall haue no bawdrie in it: or if there bee any lurking amongst you in corners, with Table bookes, who haue some hope to find fit matter to feede his — mallice on, let them claspe them vp, and slinke away, or stay and be conuerted. For he that made this Play, meanes to please Auditors so, as hee may bee an Auditor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hereafter, and not purchase them with the deare losse of his eares: I dare not call it Comedie, or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie; 'tis perfectly neyther: A Play it is, which was meant to make you laugh, how it will please you, is not written in my part: For though you should like it to day, perhaps your selues know not how you should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest it to morrow: Some things in it you may meete with, which are out of the common Roade: a Duke there is, and the Scene lyes in Italy, as those two
<pb facs="3"/>
thinges lightly wee neuer misse. But you shall not find in it the ordinarie and ouer-worne trade of ieasting at Lordes and Courtiers, and Citizens, without taxation of any particular or new vice by them found out, but at the persons of them: such, he that made this, thinkes vile; and for his owne part vowes, That hee did neuer thinke, but that a Lord borne might bee a wise man, and a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier an honest man.</p>
