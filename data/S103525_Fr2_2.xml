      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Lord, who is the God of order, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of light, from time to time manifested that hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his mercy, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb facs="102"/>
fore-shaddowing first by Types, then fore-shewing by Prophecies, and at last point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more cleerely and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at that Lambe of God, by the</hi> Baptist <hi>his fore-runner. So that each age and manner of Reuelation hath had still the cleerer Demonstration of the</hi> Messiah, <hi>who was approching: Euen as the earth more and more is illuminate, the neerer the Sunnes arising vpon our Horizon is at hand: like</hi> Noah <hi>who first opened the window of the Arke wherein he was, then remooued the couering thereof, and at last stept forth himselfe. This is the Ladder
<pb facs="102"/>
which</hi> Iacob <hi>saw comming thus downe from Heauen, by the seuerall degrees of cleerer and neerer manifestation; and the Starry fore-guiding light, leading at last to the place where the Babe was, but there standing and vanishing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further progresse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>So that it is a maruell how that the Vaile so long should be vpon the eyes of</hi> Israel, <hi>or the Kall of induration vpon the heart of</hi> Iudah; <hi>but that euen when hee came, marking euery plain Prophesie, that was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of him, and seeing the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the same in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, they might haue knowne their King.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="103"/>
Herod <hi>conuocates all the Ecclesiasticall sort, and askes where he should be borne; and they answere, At</hi> Bethleem: <hi>For so it was writtē, there they saw his Humilitie at his first entrance into the world: and why then trusted they not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise their owne quotation, and embraced their Lord?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Let them peruse in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the rest of these Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that are spoken of him, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the particulars of the Treatise following) and (laying aside their stiffe-nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, of old vpbraided vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them) truely apply, and they shall beforced to come to that

conclusion of</hi> Apollos, <hi>that it</hi>
      <note place="margin">Acts 8. 28.</note>
      <hi>is euident by Scripture, That</hi> Iesus is that Christ, <hi>all those things spoken of the</hi> Messiah, <hi>agreeing to him alone, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applyable to no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</hi>

      <hi>The humble abasement of this lowly Lord, comming in the shape of a Seruant, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so ignominious a death for mankinde, beeing the cause of this stumbling of theirs, they expecting a worldly glorious King, and a corporall Deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Therefore</hi> Isaiah, <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing their incredulity for this cause, cryes out,</hi> Who will <note place="margin">Isaiah 53.</note> beleeue our report? or to
<pb facs="104"/>
whom is the arme of the Lord reuealed? <hi>And holy</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon <note place="margin">Luke 2. 34.</note>
      <hi>pronounceth him to be appointed for the rising &amp; fall of many in</hi> Israel, <hi>and for a signe which should bee spoken against; the wise Economie of the Lords grace beeing herein manifested, that by the reiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a time, the fulnesse of the Gentiles might bee accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, all men might taste of grace, &amp; the ends of the earth might be his Sonnes possession.</hi>

      <hi>But would they enter within the Vayle, and behold what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the</hi> Holiest <hi>is vnder the base outward couering of the Arke, and by a holy considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

digge within the earth of his humanitie, and they should finde the glorious Pearle and treasure of the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible Deity, manifesting it selfe in his life, in matchlesse miracles, possible onely to that nature to performe; so that the simple people are forced to confesse, that none could do such things, except</hi> GOD were with him, <hi>discouering it selfe also in his death by fearefull wonders: so that the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proclaimes,</hi> Of a surety he was the Sonne of God: <hi>and after his glorious Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Ascension, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the mightiest oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of the world, and Prince thereof, by strait Lawes, close imprisonments, cruel torments, farre exilements, and sundry sorts of death; yet this cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Iesus, by a few Fishermen, whom he made Fishers of men, subdued the world in short space to himselfe, making Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours to lay downe their crownes at his feet, who was crowned with Thornes, their Scepters to sway to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his Kingdome, in whose hand a Reed, for a Scepter, was sometimes moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly put; their Empires, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, Idols, and former Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish worship, like Dagon

falne before the Arke, lying ouerthrowne, striken dumbe, broken in pieces, and (as</hi> Sise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra <hi>before</hi> Iael) <hi>prostrate at the foot of his Crosse, by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (as the world accounted) subduing learning, by simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, wisedome; by humilitie, pride; by weakenesse, power, by meeknesse, cruelty; by suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, obtaining victory; and by shame, attaining to glory, the most glorious and most mighty Kingdomes which wee see, beeing but small pieces of their Conquests, and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Trophe.</hi>
   </p>

      <hi>What a death then is this, that hath done such things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

all the liuing could not doe? What matchlesse power is this that hath wrought such incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible things by weaknesse, by contempt, by the folly of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching? What base meanes is this to bring down highest▪ Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions? And how comes it to passe, that these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors at last glorie to dye for him, who dyed such a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and shamefull death, but that they know hee liueth and reigneth for euer? and thereby they (hauing liued heere by grace in him, and dyed wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing for him) should bee brought to liue and reigne in

glory eternally with him?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But our hope (according to the promise) is, that the Vaile at last will be taken from their eyes, and</hi> Iapheth <hi>and</hi> Sem <hi>shall be found in one Tent: the Lord will powre wpon the House of</hi> Dauid, <hi>and vpon</hi>

      <hi>These paines, Sir, that I haue taken herein, I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate to your Name, as a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of my more then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued duty and affection to you, which I shall thinke my selfe euer bound to owe,
<pb facs="107"/>
for your manifold courtesies, whereof at your last being in your owne natiue Countrey, I had sufficient proofe; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, not onely in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of LEVI to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi> MAIESTIE, <hi>by your meanes, and your vnmerited speeches there-anent: but likewise in that Royall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the same which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ensued, and of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (though vnworthy) thereof. The experience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of your modest, humane, and most gentle inclination, assures mee at this time, of your owne courteous and kind acceptation of this harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb facs="107"/>
consent, (in making the Old Testament (as it were) by the hand to leade in the New; and the Trumpet of the Prophets to sound the newes of the Gospell) without the needing many (if any) words, earnestly to sute the same. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue therefore, Sir, from an affectionate heart, and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hand, this small Pledge of gratitude and remembrance, and what weakenesse or defect is therein, let your better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and learned Iudgement couer, support, and supply the same. Whereunto remitting and recommending it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching God to multiply vpon
<pb facs="108"/>
you the growth of his grace, and sensible blessing, and that with our Master Iesus, you may dayly grow more &amp; more in fauour both with God and Man.</hi>
