to the reader.</head>
   <p>DEmosthenes the renowmed O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
defyneth law in this wise.
The law (sayth he) is y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> thing that all
men ought to obey for many skylles,
but in especial bicause law is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> inuē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; also the gifte of god, the decree
of prudēt men, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chastisement of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
&amp; vnwilfull offenses, &amp; finally the
common suretie of a realme wherby
it becommeth al men to liue which be
conuersant in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same. Chrysippus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
an excellēt philosopher thus begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his boke of lawes. The lawe is
kinge of all aswel diuine as humane
affaires, the presidēt and comptroller
of thinges honest and dishonest, the
prince, captaine and ruler of the iuste
and iniust, &amp; it is of ciuile-creatures
aswell the commaunder, what they
ought to do, as the forbydder, what
<pb facs="2"/>
they ought not to do. These auntike
sayenges of wise mē assuredly ought
moch to inflame vs to the knowledge
of those thinges, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>out which we shal
be estemed no men but as brute and
sauage beastes. Let vs not commyt,
that it be sayd of vs English men, as
it was ones said of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> men of Athens,
that is, that we make very goodly &amp;
profytable lawes, but we vse thē not.
Certainly there can be no greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche
to a common weale then thys.
One lesson I wolde we lerned of the
auncient lawyer Romain named Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and that is this. The knowledge
of lawes is not to beare awey y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> word{is}
but the pyth &amp; power of them. This
he wrote bicause there be many which
when good &amp; holsom lawes be made,
seke not to se them executed, &amp; obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
but rather how to defraude them
<pb facs="3"/>
and to haue them vnexecuted, whiche
kinde of people after the sentence of
most ancient lawmakers be no lesse
worthy of reprehensiō thā they which
do expresly against y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law. Now, they
do (say they) against the law which do
the thing that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> law forbyddeth. And
they defraude a law or statute, which
the wordes of the law saued, do circū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
the meaning and sentence of it.
Let vs thā so read the lawes, that we
may beare awey the sentence &amp; mynd
of them, and so fulfyl and obserue the
lawes, that it maye appeare that they
were not made in vayn. Thus doing,
we shal please god, we shal be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
subiectes to oure
prince, and finally we
shall seke our own
weale and
sauetye.</p>
