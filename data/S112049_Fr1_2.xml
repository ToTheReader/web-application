   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Owsoeuer (Right Honourable and most vertuous Ladie) this Booke may come to your Noble Goodnesse clothed in an old Name or Garment, yet doubtlesse (excellent Madam) it is full of many new vertues which will euer admire and serue you; and though it can adde nothing to your owne rare and vnparalleld knowledge, yet may it to those No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good ones (which will endeauour any small sparke of your imitation) bring such a light, as may make them shine with a great deale of charitie. I doe not assume to my selfe (though I am not altogether ignorant in abilitie to iudge of these things) the full inuention and scope of this whole worke: for it is true (great Lady) that much of it was a Manuscript which many yeeres agon belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to an Honourable Contesse, one of the greatest Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Kingdome, and were the opinions of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Physitions which then liued; which being now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued

by one not inferiour to any of that Profession, I was the rather imboldned to send it to your blessed hand, knowing you to be a Mistresse so full of Honourable pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and goodnesse, that although this imperfit offer may come vnto you weake and disable, yet your Noble ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue will support it, and make it so strong in the world, that I doubt not but it shall doe seruice to all those which will serue you, whilest my selfe and my poore prayers shall to my last gaspe labour to attend you.</p>
