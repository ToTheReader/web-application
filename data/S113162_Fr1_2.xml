      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS <hi>Tract</hi> will need <hi>Patronage,</hi> as great as may be had, that's <hi>Yours.</hi> Yet, when I first printed part of it, I presumed not to aske any, but thrust it out at the end of anothers Labours, that it might seem, at least, to have the same <hi>Patron,</hi> your <hi>Royall Father</hi> of Blessed Memory, as the other Worke, on which this attended, had. But now I humbly beg for it <hi>Your Majesties Patronage;</hi> And leave withall, that I may declare to <hi>Your most Excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie</hi> the <hi>Cause</hi> why this Tract was then written:
<pb facs="3"/>
VVhy it stay'd so long before it looked upon the light: Why it was not then thought fit to go alone, but rather be led abroad by the former VVorke: VVhy it comes now forth both with <hi>Alteration,</hi> and <hi>Addition:</hi> And why this <hi>Addition</hi> made not more haste to the <hi>Presse,</hi> then it hath done.</p>
   <p>The Cause why this <hi>Discourse</hi> was written, was this: I was, at the time of these Conferences with <hi>Master Fisher,</hi> Bishop of <hi>S. Davids;</hi> And not onely <hi>directed,</hi> but <hi>Commanded</hi> by my Blessed Master <hi>King Iames,</hi> to this <hi>Conference</hi> with him. He, <note n="a" place="margin">May 24. 1622</note> when we met, began with a great Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of seeking the <hi>Truth</hi> onely, and that for it selfe. And certainly, <hi>Truth,</hi> especially in <hi>Religion,</hi> is so to be sought, or not to be found. He that seeks it with a <hi>Roman</hi>

And therefore I did most heartily wish, I could have found the <hi>Iesuite</hi> upon that faire way he protested to go. After the <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> ended, I went, whither <hi>my duty</hi> called me, to my <hi>Diocesse;</hi> not suspecting any thing should be made Publike, that was both Commanded, and acted in private. For <hi>VV. I.</hi> the Publisher of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the first Conference with D. <hi>VVhite</hi> (the late Reverend and learned Bishop of <hi>Ely)</hi>

         </gap> the Reader.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses plainly, <hi>That Master</hi> Fisher <hi>was straightly charged upon his Allegiance, from his Majesty that then was, not to set out, or Publish what
<pb facs="3"/>
passed in some of these Conferences, till He gave Licence, and untill M.</hi> Fisher <hi>and they might meet, and agree, and Confirme under their hands, what was said on both sides.</hi> He sayes farther, <hi>that</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">Ibid.</note>
      <hi>M.</hi> Fisher <hi>went to D.</hi> White's <hi>house, to know what he would say about the Relation, which he had set out.</hi> So then, belike M. <hi>Fisher</hi> had set out the <hi>Relation of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> before he went to D. <hi>VVhite,</hi> to speak about it; And this notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Kings restraint</hi> upon him, upon his <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> Yet, to D. <hi>VVhite</hi> 'tis said he went, but to what other End, then to put a Scorne upon him, I cannot see. For he went to his house to know, <hi>what he would say about that Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Conference, which he had set out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> In my absence from <hi>London,</hi> M. <hi>Fisher</hi> used me as well. For with the same Care of his <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and no more, <note n="b" place="margin">These words were in my former Epistle, And <hi>A.

            </gap>, or either of the other two Conferences with</hi> Dr. White, <hi>till he was forc'd unto it by false reports given out to his private disgrace, and the prejudice of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Cause. Nor then did he spread Papers abroad, but onely delivered a very few Copies to speciall friends, and this not with an intent to Calumniate the Bishop.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A. C. in his Preface before his Relation of this Conference.</hi> Truly, I knew of no Reports then given out to the prejudice of the <hi>Jesuite's</hi> either Person, or Cause; I was in a Corner of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where I heard little: But howsoever, here's a most plaine Confession by <hi>A. C.</hi> of that which he struggles to deny. <hi>He sayes he did not spread Papers.</hi> What then? What? Why <hi>he did but deliver Copies.</hi> Why, but doth not he that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Copies (for Instance, of a <hi>Libell)</hi> spread it? Yea, <hi>but he delivered but a very few Copies.</hi> Be it so: I doe not say, How many he spred. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses the <hi>Iesuite</hi> delivered some, though very few; And he that delivers any, spreads it abroad. For what can he tell, when the Copies are once out of his power, how many may Copie them out, and spread them farther? Yea, <hi>but he delivered them to spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friends.</hi> Be it so too: The more speciall friends they were to him, the lesse indifferent would they be to me, perhaps my more speciall Enemies. Yea, <hi>but all this was without an intent to Calumniate me.</hi> Well. Be that so too. But if I be Calumniated thereby, his <hi>Intention</hi> will not helpe it. And whether the Copies, which he delivered, have not in them Calumny against me, I leave to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reader</hi> of this Discourse to Iudge.</note>
      <hi>hee spred abroad Papers of this Conference, full</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>enough of partiality to his Cause, and more full of Calumny against me.</hi> Hereupon I was in a manner forced to give M. <hi>Fisher's Relation</hi> of the Conference an <hi>Answer,</hi> and to publish it. Though for some <hi>Reasons,</hi> and those then approved <hi>by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> it was thought fit I should set it out in my Chaplain's Name, <hi>R. B.</hi> and not in my owne. To which I readily submitted.</p>
   <p>There was a Cause also, why at the first, the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon this Conference</hi> stayed so long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could endure to be pressed. For the <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> was in <hi>May, 1622.</hi> And M. <hi>Fisher's</hi> Paper was scattered and made common, so common, that a <hi>Copy</hi> was brought to mee <hi>(being none of his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friends)</hi> before <hi>Michaelmas.</hi> And yet this <hi>Discourse</hi> was not printed till <hi>Aprill, 1624.</hi> Now that you may know how this happened, I shall say for my selfe, It was not my <hi>Idlenesse,</hi> nor my <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnesse</hi> to right both my selfe, and the Cause, against the <hi>Jesuite,</hi> and the <hi>Paper,</hi> which he had spred, that occasion'd this delay. For I had then <hi>Most Honourable VVitnesses,</hi> and have some yet living, That this <hi>Discourse</hi> (such as it was, when <hi>A. C.</hi> nibled at it) was finished long before I could perswade my selfe to let it come into Publike View. And this was caused partly by my owne <hi>Backwardnesse</hi> to deale with these men, whom I have ever observed to be great Pretenders for <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> but yet such as will admit nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="4"/>
unlesse <hi>They</hi> and their <hi>Faction</hi> may prevaile in all; As if no <hi>Reformation</hi> had beene necessary. And <hi>partly</hi> because there were about the same time <hi>three Conferences</hi> held with <hi>Fisher.</hi> Of these this was the <hi>Third;</hi> And could not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently come abroad into the world, till the two former were ready to leade the way, which till that time, they were not.</p>
   <p>And this is in part the Reason also, why this <hi>Tract</hi> crept into the end of a larger Worke. For since that Worke contained in a manner the substance of all that passed in the <hi>two former Conferences:</hi> And that this Third in divers points concurred with them, and depended on them, I could not thinke it <hi>Substantive</hi> enough, to stand alone. But besides this <hi>Affinity</hi> betweene the Conferences, I was willing to have it passe as silent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it might, at the end of another Worke, and so perhaps little to be looked after, because I could not hold it worthy, nor can I yet, of that Great Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Service, which I owe to my Deare Mother, <hi>the Church of England.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>There is a cause also, why it lookes now abroad againe with <hi>Alteration</hi> and <hi>Addition.</hi> And 'tis fit I should give your <hi>Majesty</hi> an Account of that too. This <hi>Tract</hi> was first printed in the yeare 1624. And in the yeare 1626. another <hi>Jesuite,</hi> or the same, under the name of <hi>A. C.</hi> printed a Relation of this <hi>Conference,</hi> and therein tooke Exceptions to some
<pb facs="5"/>
Particulars, and endeavoured to Confute some Things deliver'd therein by me. Now being in yeares, and unwilling to dye in the <hi>Jesuites</hi> debt, I have in this <hi>Second Edition</hi> done as much for him, and somewhat more. For he did but skip up and downe, and labour to pick a hole, here, and there, where he thought he might fasten, and where it was too hard for him, let it alone. But I have gone <hi>thorough</hi> with him; And I hope, given him a full Confutation: or at least such a <hi>Bone</hi> to gnaw, as may shake his teeth, if he looke not to it. And of my <hi>Addition to this Discourse,</hi> this is the Cause; But of my <hi>Alteration</hi> of some things in it, this. <hi>A. C.</hi> his Curiosity to <hi>winnow</hi> me, made me in a more curious manner fall to <hi>sifting</hi> of my selfe, and that which had formerly past my <hi>Penne.</hi> And though (I blesse God for it) I found no cause to alter anything that belonged either to the <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Course</hi> of the Conference: Yet somewhat I did finde, which needed better, and <hi>cleerer expression;</hi> And <hi>that</hi> I have <hi>altered,</hi> well knowing I must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>Curious Observers</hi> on all hands.</p>
   <p>Now, Why this <hi>Additionall Answer</hi> to the <hi>Relation of A. C.</hi> came no sooner forth, hath a Cause too, and I shall truly represent it. <hi>A. C. his Relation of the Conference,</hi> was set out. 1626. I knew not of it in some yeares after. For it was printed among divers other things of like nature, either by M. <hi>Fisher</hi> himselfe, or his friend <hi>A. C.</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
When I saw it, I read it over carefully, and found myselfe not a little wrong'd in it, but the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and indeed the <hi>Cause of Religion</hi> much more. I was before this time by <hi>Your Majesties Great Grace,</hi> and undeserved favour made <hi>Deane of Your Majesties Chappell Royall,</hi> and a <hi>Counsellor of State,</hi> and hereby, as the Occasions of those times were, made too much a Stranger to my <hi>Bookes.</hi> Yet for all my Busie Imployments, it was still in my Thoughts to give <hi>A. C.</hi> an Answer. But then I fell into a most dangerous <hi>Feaver;</hi> And though it pleased God beyond all hope to restore mee to health, yet long I was before I recover'd such strength as might ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mee to undertake such a Service. And since that time, how I have beene detained, and in a manner forced upon other <hi>many, various,</hi> and <hi>Great Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,</hi> your <hi>Majesty</hi> knowes best. And how of late I have beene used by the <hi>Scandalous</hi> and <hi>Scurrilous Pennes</hi> of some bitter men (whom I heartily beseech God to forgive) the world knowes; Little Leasure, and lesse Encouragement given me to Answer a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> or set upon other Services, while I am under the <hi>Prophets</hi> affliction. Psal. <note place="margin">Psal. 50. 19, 20</note> 50. betweene the <hi>Mouth that speakes wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the tongue that sets forth deceite, and slander mee as thicke, as if I were not their owne Mothers Sonne.</hi> In the midst of these <hi>Libellous out-cries</hi> against me, some <hi>Divines</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
of great Note, and Worth in the Church came to mee, One by One, and no One knowing of the Others Comming (as to mee they protested) and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded with me to Reprint this <hi>Conference,</hi> in my owne Name. This they thought would vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my Reputation, were it generally knowne to be mine. I Confesse I looked round about these Men, and their <hi>Motion;</hi> And at last, my Thoughts working much upon themselves, I began to perswade my selfe, that I had beene too long diverted from this necessary Worke. And that perhaps there might be <hi>In voce hominum, Tuba Dei,</hi> in the still voice of men, the Loud Trumpet of God, which sounds many wayes, sometimes to the eares, and sometimes to the hearts of men, and by meanes which they thinke not of. And as <note n="*" place="margin">

Luk. 2. 47.</hi> And the Word the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap> spake to them by a meanes they thought not of, namely <hi>per Filium Dei in pucro,</hi> by the Sonne of God himselfe under the Vaile of our humane nature.</note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speakes, A Word of God there is, <hi>Quod nunquam tacet, sed non semper auditur:</hi> which though it be never silent, yet is not alwayes heard. That it is never silent, is his great <hi>Mercy;</hi> and that it is not alwayes heard, is not the least of our <hi>Misery.</hi> Vpon this Motion I tooke time to deliberate: And had scarce time for that, much lesse for the Worke. Yet at last to every of these men I gave this Answer. That M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> or <hi>A. C.</hi> for him, had beene busie with my former Discourse, and that I would never reprint that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I might gaine time enough to. Answer that, which <hi>A. C.</hi> had charged a fresh both upon mee, and the Cause. While my Thoughts were thus at
<pb facs="6"/>
worke, <hi>Your Majesty</hi> fell upon the <hi>same Thing,</hi> and was graciously pleased not to <hi>Command,</hi> but to <hi>VVish</hi> me to reprint this <hi>Conference,</hi> and in mine <hi>own Name;</hi> And this openly at the <hi>Councel-Table</hi> in <hi>Michaelmas-Terme. 1637.</hi> I did not hold it fit to deny, having in all the Course of my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice obayed your Majesties Honourable, and Just <hi>Motions,</hi> as <hi>Commands:</hi> But Craved leave to shew what little leasure I had to doe it, and what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences might attend upon it. When this did not serve to excuse mee, I humbly submitted to that, which I hope was <hi>Gods Motion in Your Majesties.</hi> And having thus layd all that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes this <hi>Discourse</hi> before your <hi>Gracious and most Sacred Majesty,</hi> I most humbly present you with the <hi>Booke</hi> it selfe, which as I heartily pray You to protect, so doe I wholly submit it to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> with my Prayers for Her Prosperity, and my Wishes that I were able to doe Her better Service.</p>
   <p>I have thus acquainted <hi>Your Majesty</hi> with all Occasions, which both formerly, and now againe have led this <hi>Tract</hi> into the light. In all which I am a faithfull Relater of all Passages, but am not very well satisfied, who is now my <hi>Adversary. M. Fisher</hi> was at the <hi>Conference.</hi> Since that, I finde <hi>A. C.</hi> at the <hi>print.</hi> And whether These be two, or but One <hi>Jesuite,</hi> I know not; since scarce <hi>One</hi> amongst them, goes under <hi>One Name.</hi> But
<pb facs="7"/>
for my owne part (and the <hi>Error</hi> is not great, if I mistake) I thinke they are <hi>One,</hi> and that One, <hi>M. Fisher.</hi> That which induces me to thinke so, is <hi>First,</hi> the Great Inwardnesse of <hi>A. C.</hi> with <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> which is so great, as may well be thought to neighbour upon <hi>Identity. Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Stile of A. C.</hi> is so like <hi>M.

Now as I would humbly Beseech <hi>Your Majesty</hi> to keepe a serious Watch upon these <hi>Fisher-men,</hi> which pretend S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but fish not with <hi>His Net:</hi> So would I not have You neglect another sort of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers</hi> in a Shallower Water. For they have some <hi>ill Nets</hi> too. And if they may spread them, when, and where they will, God knowes what may become of it. These have not so strong a <hi>Backe</hi> abroad, as the <hi>Romanists</hi> have, but that's no Argument to suffer them to encrease. They may grow to equall <hi>Strength</hi> with <hi>Number.</hi> And <hi>Factious People</hi> at home, of what <hi>Sect,</hi> or <hi>fond Opinion</hi> soever they be, are not to be neglected. <hi>Partly,</hi> because they are so <hi>Neare.</hi> And 'tis ever a dangerous Fire, that begins in the <hi>Bed-straw.</hi> And <hi>partly</hi> because all those <hi>Domesticke Evills,</hi> which threaten a <hi>Rent</hi> in <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>State</hi> are with far more safety pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>VVisdome,</hi> then punished by <hi>Justice.</hi> And would men consider it right, they are far more beholding to that man, that keepes them from falling, then to him that takes them up, though it be to set the <hi>Arme</hi> or the <hi>Leg</hi> that's broken in the Fall.</p>
   <p>In this <hi>Discourse</hi> I have no aime to displease any, nor any hope to please all. If I can helpe on to <hi>Truth</hi> in the Church, and the Peace of the Church together, I shall be glad, be it in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.

      <pb facs="8"/>
which once broken is not so easily soder'd againe. And if for <hi>Necessary Truths</hi> sake onely, any man will be offended, nay take, nay snatch at that offence, which is not given, I know no fence for that. 'Tis <hi>Truth,</hi> and I must tell it. 'Tis the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and I must preach it. 1 Cor. 9. And far safer it is in this <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 16.</note> Case to beare <hi>Anger</hi> from men, then a <hi>VVoe</hi> from God.

   <p>The <hi>Church of Christ</hi> upon Earth may bee compared to a <hi>Hive of Bees,</hi> and that can bee no where so steddily placed in this world, but it will be in some danger. And men that care neither for the <hi>Hive,</hi> nor the <hi>Bees,</hi> have yet a great minde to the <hi>Honey.</hi> And having once tasted the sweet of the <hi>Churches Maintenance</hi> swallow that for
<pb facs="9"/>
      <hi>Honey,</hi> which one day will be more bitter then <hi>Gall</hi> in their Bowells. Now the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Priest,</hi> more then any other, are bound to looke to the <hi>Integrity</hi> of the Church in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and that in the <hi>first</hi> place. For that's by farre the <hi>Best Honey</hi> in the <hi>Hive.</hi> But in the <hi>second</hi> place, They must be Carefull of the <hi>Churches Maintenance</hi> too, els the <hi>Bees</hi> shall make <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> for others, and have none left for their owne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary sustenance, and then all's lost. For we see it in daily and common use, that the <hi>Honey</hi> is not taken from the <hi>Bees,</hi> but they are destroyed first. Now in this great and Busie Worke, the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Priest</hi> must not feare to put their hands to the <hi>Hive,</hi> though they be sure to be <hi>stung.</hi> And stung by the <hi>Bees,</hi> whose <hi>Hive</hi> and House they preserve. It was <hi>King Davids</hi> Case (God grant it be never <hi>Yours.) They came about mee</hi> (saith the <note place="margin">Psal. 118. 12.</note> Psal. 118.) <note n="*" place="margin">Apum Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudine ardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem not at vesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num; Non est enim in illis multum roboris sed mira Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candescentia: <hi>Calv:</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 118.</note>
      <hi>like Bees,</hi> This was hard usage enough, yet some <hi>profit,</hi> some <hi>Honey</hi> might thus be gotten in the End. And that's the <hi>Kings</hi> Case. But when it comes to the <hi>Priest,</hi> the Case is alter'd, They come about him like <hi>VVaspes,</hi> or like Hornets rather, all <hi>sting,</hi> and no <hi>Honey</hi> there. And all this many times for no <hi>offence,</hi> nay sometimes for <hi>Service</hi> done them, would they see it.

   <p>Now <hi>one Thing</hi> more let me be bold to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to <hi>Your Majesty</hi> in particular, concerning Your Great Charge, the <hi>Church of England.</hi> 'Tis in an hard Condition. Shee professes the <hi>Ancient Catholike Faith;</hi> And yet the <hi>Romanist</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes Her of <hi>Novelty in her Doctrine.</hi> Shee practises <hi>Church Government,</hi> as it hath beene in use in all <hi>Ages,</hi> and all <hi>Places,</hi> where the Church of Christ hath taken any Rooting, both in, and ever since the <hi>Apostles</hi> Times; And yet the <hi>Separatist</hi> condemnes Her for <hi>Antichristianisme</hi> in her Discipline. The plaine truth is, She is between these two Factions, as betweene two <hi>Milstones,</hi> and unlesse <hi>Your Majesty</hi> looke to it, to <hi>VVhose Trust</hi> She is committed, Shee'll be grownd to <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> to an irrepairable both Dishonour, and losse to this <hi>Kingdome.</hi> And 'tis very Remarkeable, that while both these presse hard upon the <hi>Church of England,</hi> both of them Crye out upon <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> like froward Children, which <hi>scratch,</hi> and <hi>kicke,</hi> and <hi>bite,</hi> and yet crye out all the while, as if themselves were killed. Now to the <hi>Romanist</hi> I shall say this; The <hi>Errors</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> are growne now (many of them) very <hi>Old.</hi> And when <hi>Errors</hi> are growne by Age, and

Continuance to <hi>strength,</hi> they which speake for the <hi>Truth,</hi> though it be farre <hi>Older,</hi> are ordinarily challenged for the Bringers in of <hi>New Opinions.</hi> And there is no <hi>Greater Absurdity</hi> stirring this day in <hi>Christendome,</hi> then that the <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Old Corrupted Church,</hi> will we, nill wee, must be taken for the <hi>Building of a New.</hi> And were not this so, we should never be troubled with that idle and impertinent <hi>Question</hi> of theirs: <hi>VVhere was your Church before</hi> Luther?

      <hi>they fall into the Ditch together,</hi> I shall say nothing. But for so many of them, as meane well, and are onely <hi>misled by Artifice and Cunning;</hi> Concerning them, I shall say thus much only. They are <hi>Bells</hi> of passing
<pb facs="10"/>
good <hi>mettle</hi> and tuneable enough of themselves, and in their owne disposition; and a world of pity it is, that they are <hi>Rung</hi> so miserably out of <hi>Tune,</hi> as they are, by them which have gotten power in and over their Consciences. And for this there is yet <hi>Remedy</hi> enough; but how long there will bee, I know not.</p>
   <p>Much <hi>talking</hi> there is <hi>(Bragging,</hi> Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty may call it) on both sides. And when they are in their <hi>ruffe,</hi> they both exceed all <hi>Moderation,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> too; So farre till both <hi>Lips</hi> and <hi>Penns</hi> open for all the World like a <hi>Purse without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;</hi> Nothing comes out of this, and that which is worth nothing out of them. And yet this <hi>nothing</hi> is made so great, as if the <hi>Salvation of Soules,</hi> that Great worke of the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of the World, the Sonne of God, could not be effected without it. And while the one faction cryes up the <hi>Church</hi> above the <hi>Scripture:</hi> and the other the <hi>Scripture</hi> to the neglect and Contempt of the <hi>Church,</hi> which the <hi>Scripture</hi> it selfe teaches men both to honour, and obey: They have so farre endangered the <hi>Beliefe</hi> of the One, and the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Other, as that neither hath its <hi>Due</hi> from a great part of Men. Whereas according to <hi>Christs Institution,</hi> The <hi>Scripture,</hi> where 'tis plaine, should guide the <hi>Church:</hi> And the <hi>Church,</hi> where there's Doubt or Difficulty, should expound the <hi>Scripture;</hi> Yet so, as neither the <hi>Scripture</hi> should be forced, nor the Church so bound up, as that upon Just and farther Evidence,
<pb facs="11"/>
Shee may not revise that which in any Case hath slipt by Her. What Successe this <hi>Great Distemper,</hi> caused by the Collision of two such <hi>Factions,</hi> may have, I know not, I cannot <hi>Prophesie.</hi> This I know, That the use which Wise men should make of other mens <hi>falles,</hi> is not to fall with them; And the use, which <hi>Pious and Religious men</hi> should make of these great <hi>Flawes in Christianity,</hi> is not to <hi>Joyne</hi> with them that make them, nor to helpe to dislocate those maine <hi>Bones</hi> in the <hi>Body,</hi> which being once put out of <hi>Ioynt,</hi> will not easily be <hi>set</hi> againe. And though I cannot <hi>Prophesie,</hi> yet I feare That <hi>Atheisme,</hi> and <hi>Irreligion</hi> gather strength, while the <hi>Truth</hi> is thus weakned by <hi>an Vnworthy way</hi> of Contending for it. And while they thus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, neither part Consider, that they are in a way, to induce upon themselves, and others, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Extreame,</hi> which they seeme most both to <hi>feare,</hi> and <hi>oppose.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Besides:</hi> This I have ever Observed, That many <hi>Rigid Professors</hi> have turn'd <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,</hi> and in that Turne have beene <hi>more Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> then any other: And such <hi>Romanists</hi> as have chang'd from them, have for the most part quite leaped over the <hi>Meane,</hi> and beene as <hi>Rigid</hi> the other way, as <hi>Extremity</hi> it selfe. And this, if there be not both <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>VVisdome</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne it, is a very <hi>Naturall Motion.</hi> For a Man is apt to thinke he can never runne farre enough from that, which he once begins to hate; And doth not
<pb facs="11"/>
Consider therewhile, That where <hi>Religion Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi> is the thing he hates, a <hi>Fallacy</hi> may easily be put upon him. For he ought to hate the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> which depraves <hi>Religion,</hi> and to runne from it: but from <hi>no part of Religion</hi> it selfe, which he ought to Love, and Reverence, ought hee to depart. And this I have <hi>Observed</hi> farther: That no One thing hath made <hi>Conscientious men</hi> more wavering in their owne mindes, or more apt, and easie to be drawne aside from the sincerity of <hi>Religion professed in the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> then the Want of <hi>Uniforme</hi> and <hi>Decent Order</hi> in too many Churches of the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> And the <hi>Romanists</hi> have beene apt to say, <hi>The Houses of God</hi> could not be suffer'd to lye so <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily</hi> (as in some places they have done) were the <hi>True worship of God</hi> observed in them: Or did the People thinke that such it were. 'Tis true, the <hi>Inward VVorship</hi> of the Heart, is the <hi>Great Service of God,</hi> and no Service acceptable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: But the <hi>Externall worship of God</hi> in his Church is the <hi>Great VVitnesse</hi> to the World, that Our heart stands right in that <hi>Service of God.</hi> Take this away, or bring it into Contempt, and <hi>what Light is there left to shine before men, that they may see our Devotion, and glorifie our Father which is in Heaven?</hi> And to deale clearely with <hi>Your Majesty,</hi> These <hi>Thoughts</hi> are they, and no other, which have made me labour so much, as I have done, for <hi>Decency</hi> and an
<pb facs="12"/>
Orderly settlement of the <hi>Externall Worship of God in the Church.</hi> For of that which is <hi>Inward</hi> there can be no <hi>Witnesse</hi> among men, nor no <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> for men. Now no Externall Action in the world can be <hi>Uniforme</hi> without some <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> And these in <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Ancienter</hi> they bee, the better, so they may fit <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place. Too many</hi> Over-burden the <hi>Service of God;</hi> And <hi>too</hi> few leave it naked. And scarce any Thing hath hurt <hi>Religion</hi> more in these broken Times, then an Opinion in too many men, That because <hi>Rome</hi> had thrust some Vnnecessary, and many Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Ceremonies upon the Church, therefore the <hi>Reformation</hi> must have none at all; Not considering therewhile, That <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are the <hi>Hedge</hi> that fence the <hi>Substance of Religion</hi> from all the Indignities, which <hi>Prophanenesse</hi> and <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> too Commonly put upon it. And a Great Weaknesse it is, not to see the strength which <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> (Things weake enough in themselves, God knowes) adde even to <hi>Religion</hi> it selfe; But a farre greater to see it, and yet to Cry Them downe, all, and without Choyce, by which their most hated Adversaries climb'd up, and could not crie up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their cause, as they doe, but by them. And <hi>Divines</hi> of all the rest might learne, and teach this <hi>VVisdome</hi> if they would, since they see all other <hi>Professions,</hi> which helpe to beare downe their <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi> keepe up their owne therewhile, and that to the highest.</p>
