<pb n="632" facs="333"/> that is, vnlesse those which are in place of Ecclesiasticall Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will bee content to remit something of their too much rigor, and yeeld somewhat to the Peace of the Church; and hearkening vnto the earnest Prayers and Admonitions of many godly men, will set themselues to correct manifest abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, according to the rule of Diuine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and of the ancient Church from which they haue swarued.</p>
