   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READERS OF THIS TREATISE: <hi>AND</hi> To my Auditors in my Ministery; specially my ever much respected loving Friends, and respective Parishioners, the Inhabitants of <hi>Leigh</hi> in <hi>Essex:</hi> Grace and Peace be multiplyed.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Treatise</hi> I can neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, from the pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of it, which is about <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murder;</hi> that is a wickednesse not to be named among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> in regard of <hi>likeing,</hi> or <hi>practice</hi> thereof: nor yet can I magnifie it to you for any thing that is simply mine in it; although there is much more mine in it, than might have beene, if there had been full and compleat <hi>Tractates</hi> made by other men of that <hi>subject;</hi> whence I might have borrowed more, and have had more
<pb facs="6"/>help, than now I could, to have made this a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and better polished peece.</p>
   <p>I doubt not but it shall be found, in the advised and candide perusall thereof, to carry in all the passages thereof the impresse and stamp of <hi>truth;</hi> for which it may be worthy of your acceptation, both for <hi>informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>judgment;</hi> and also for <hi>direction</hi> of <hi>practice,</hi> in many important <hi>points</hi> and <hi>cases.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Although I did not obtrude it to the <hi>presse</hi> for publique use, upon mine owne meere <hi>motion,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous <hi>self-conceit;</hi> yet I need not make <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> for my publication thereof, from the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and furtherance of such persons, whose worth of <hi>Judgement</hi> and power of <hi>godlinesse</hi> is such, as might be sufficient to put mee forward to it; seeing that, in these dayes, wherein so many doe most wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly, and unnaturally <hi>kill</hi> themselves, it is a <hi>Trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> too necessarie and usefull: which sufficiently warrants mee, upon and with the approbation of the <hi>Church,</hi> to <hi>divulge</hi> the same to the worlds view and service.</p>
   <p>Although many men of learning and worth, <hi>Casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists, Schoolemen,</hi> and other <hi>Divines: Protestants, and Papists, Ancient</hi> and <hi>moderne, transmarine,</hi> and <hi>Domestick</hi> have occasionally, or but brifely cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and condemned <hi>Self murder;</hi> yet I have met with no single, nor compleat <hi>Treatise</hi> of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, seeing how requisite and needfull it is that there were in these dayes, such an entire <hi>Tractate</hi> of that <hi>subject,</hi> when as of most other <hi>subjects,</hi> and of many lesse necessary there is a surcharge of <hi>bookes</hi> and pamphlets; and finding my selfe, in this particular
<pb facs="6"/>unprevented by others of a <hi>Birth</hi> and opportunity free for me to adventure to the <hi>Sea</hi> of publicknesse, I have imbarqued my selfe in this bottome of dismall <hi>denomination</hi> from <hi>Self-killing;</hi> which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing spreads and carryes in the <hi>fore-top,</hi> and in the <hi>Ensigne</hi> upon the <hi>Poup,</hi> the white and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Colours</hi> of <hi>Lifes preservation,</hi> having all her force and ordnance bent against <hi>Self-murder;</hi> to overcome and sink the same; for which purpose it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaies the <hi>Flagge</hi> of bloody <hi>colours against</hi> it in the <hi>maine Top</hi> of every page. And thus I have, for the good both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-weale,</hi> and of the <hi>soules</hi> and <hi>bodies</hi> of men, (all which this <hi>subject</hi> doth neerly concerne,) adventured to commit my self to the stormie and unconstant Ship-wrecking <hi>Ocean</hi> of this tumultuous and tempestuous world, under the <hi>sailes</hi> of the <hi>presse,</hi> with flowen sheets, <hi>quò fata fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi> whither divine <hi>providence</hi> will carry me. I pray for <hi>heavens favour;</hi> for the <hi>worlds faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and for a prosperous <hi>voyage:</hi> desiring that my <hi>auspicable</hi> attempt may occasion and provoke <hi>others</hi> of better abilities to perfect my good meaning and weake <hi>Assay,</hi> by their more exquisite performances; and that my <hi>selfe</hi> may not be discouraged, by counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blasts, or ill successe, in my first setting saile out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>worlds</hi> view.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Contents</hi> and <hi>worth</hi> of the <hi>Treatise</hi> will bee apparent to the judicious <hi>Readers,</hi> upon the advised perusall thereof: and the <hi>fruit</hi> of the same will shew it selfe, in the <hi>Effects</hi> of it: and according to your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme in <hi>both,</hi> I doubt not but you will entertaine and regard it. I pray you read consideratly every <hi>passage</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>thereof, and the <hi>whole</hi> to the end, before you rashly censure, condemne, or reject any thing therein, upon the first mistake; either of the <hi>matter,</hi> or of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> meaning. What shall be, upon good <hi>reasons,</hi> manifested to me to be therein amisse, I will willingly endeavour to amend and correct; with respective thankfulnesse to the <hi>Informer.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I affect not to stand upon the <hi>pinacle</hi> of publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; objected to the contrary blasts of every bodies impetuous <hi>censure,</hi> neither agreeing within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor many times with the truth; where <hi>passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, prejudices,</hi> or their owne private unsound <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and <hi>by-respects</hi> yeeld them the <hi>premises</hi> of their <hi>conclusions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Although I am, in some sort, under an <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of ancient <hi>intention</hi> to have made some thing publick, about the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Practicall</hi> and <hi>Case-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;</hi> yet I may be excused for not performing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the precipitating <hi>zeale</hi> and bold undertakings of lesse considerate <hi>youth</hi> are often commendably mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, or recalled, by more mature and beter advised <hi>age.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I find so much, and so wel, scatteredly done by <hi>others</hi> (of great worth for judgment, piety, and experience,) touching that subject; which collected into one body, out of their writings publick and private, may suffice. And also I doe perceive that it may be hurtfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the difficultie of it, to descend particularly and punctually to the speciall definite and publick determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in <hi>Print,</hi> of all incident <hi>cases,</hi> as the same may be diversified, by their severall <hi>circumstances</hi> and <hi>accidents:</hi> whereupon I have beene hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
<pb facs="7"/>from that taske; which requires the united wisdome and experience of all the most <hi>practically-ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, pious,</hi> and <hi>profound Divines.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For the present, this <hi>Tractate</hi> I commend to your use. And above all, as I stand most bound, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to you my much respected <hi>Auditors</hi> and <hi>friends</hi> of my peculiar <hi>charge;</hi> whereupon I have faithfully, although in weake manner, attended and bestowed my labours in my ministery these seaven and twenty yeares, and upward; (in succession to a most <hi>Reverend, Iudicious</hi> and <hi>godly Divine,</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> both to you and me,) endeavoring to doe you <hi>all</hi> the best service and good that I could: and (I thank God) not without comfort of some fruit of my paines among you; although it be not so much as I would, for the salvation and welfare of you all; from whom neither any intestine <hi>discontents,</hi> nor externall <hi>invitations</hi> could ever hitherto prevaile to draw mee, to whom I found my selfe so strongly obliged and tied, both by my comfortable calling, and the <hi>Churches order,</hi> to bee yours; and also by our mutuall entire affection and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects each of us to other; begun with your <hi>Ancestors,</hi> and continued with your selves as the same ought to be betweene a <hi>Minister</hi> and his parishioners or people.</p>
   <p>In which regard I leave and commend unto you this <hi>Treatise,</hi> for a monument and witnesse, in times to come, of remembrance of your <hi>true</hi> and <hi>deare Friend;</hi> whose last farewell, he would be loath should be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with this lesse-pleasant <hi>subject.</hi> Wherein (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) my care is most for you, that you may have bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, by that now subjected to your <hi>eyes;</hi> which for the most part of it, you have heard sounding in your <hi>cares.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <p>For which purpose, I beseech God through <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to give a blessing; and to watch over, and keep, build up and strengthen you all in his grace, love and feare unto the end; and in the <hi>End</hi> give both you and me the <hi>Crowne</hi> of eternall <hi>glory</hi> with all the blessed <hi>Saints</hi> in heaven. Amen.</p>
