      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Britons the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciente inhabitauntes of this yle (for lacke of skilfull mē of warre of their owne; being afrayde of the Franki, &amp; Burgūdi, which were certaine Barberous nations, who at y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> time ouerrā, spoyled, &amp; possessed Fraūce) caused the Germayne people called Angly to come to ayde &amp; defende theim, by whose procurement the Angly vnder Vortiger their King, taking vpon theim the same enterprise, after they had ones defended theim, did then incontinence dryue theim oute of this ylande, remainnig here theim selues to inhabit: &amp; after their name called it Englande: euen as also of later dayes, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lyke chaūce hapned to the Grekes, by calling in the Turkes to helpe theim againste their enemies. Which examples, with innumerable lyke being well considered, doe moste manifestly shew, how daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and pernitius it is for a Prince &amp; his Realme, to be driuē to truste to the seruis of straungers for lacke of sufficiente skilfull men of their owne for their defence. Wherefor sithens my intente in setting fourth this boke of Martiall affaires, hath been onely to the ende to declare my good will, to haue my naturall coūtrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men not to be inferior to any in warlyke knowledge, but rather to excell in the same, whereby withoute ayde or helpe of any forein nation, we may alwayes be most renoumed and famous, I shall beseche all gentill readers, for this my labor doen for their como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deties, to iudge &amp; reporte therof accordingly. And although my doynges herin, be not correspōdente to my desire, nor to the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factiō of euery mās mynde (which were impossible) yet my truste is, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> som neuerthelesse by dilligente reding therof, &amp; imitating the example of Lucullus, (who chefelie by studie of lyke bokes, in very shorte space, became one of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> valiantest &amp; worthiest warrior of all the Romaynes,) may if they liste, take comodity and profit, whereby the knowledge in warres, may of suche as neuer haue ben trayned in theim, be the more easely gotten and attayned. For which cause, my indeuour and trauaile taken herein, for to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit this our cōmon weale, deserueth not vtterly to be despysed, seing that the most verteous lyfe, and gouernment of Alexander Seuerus Emperour of Rome, with manie other Princes, and Comō weales, coulde not, being necligent in this kynde of studie and practis therof, saue or defende theim selues, from moste sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefull endes, and miserable deathes: wherin fortune was not to
<pb facs="173"/> be blamed, but only their folly and ignoraunce, for hauing neuer thoughte in tyme of tranquillity and pease, that it could chaunge in to aduersitie and trouble: the which is a comon faulte of men, not to make accompre in fayre weather, of the tempest to come.</p>
