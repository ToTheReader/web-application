whereof your Honour (through
Gods especiall good grace, and
bountifull fauour) standeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
most richly stoared, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently
possessed, and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
furnished, But as my slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
estate and base condition en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uieth
me the hap, and forestalleth
me the possibility to send abroad
such florishing fairings: so again,
on the other side, hath duety ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently
incited mee to deuise
one course or other, how to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
my zeale, &amp; loyalty towards
your excellent estate and dignity.
Hereupon it hath pleased God to
make this small Treatise, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instrument
<pb facs="3"/>
of my wished desire,
and the faithfull messenger of my
willing hart. Small it is (Madam)
&amp; compendious (I confesse) both
in volume &amp; words: but yet such,
as shall (I doubt not) minister a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant
stoare of spirituall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and comfortable counsel,
for any Christian conscience, that
shall aduisedly read, &amp; attentiuely
marke the godly documents, &amp;
sound aduertisements therein cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised.
For herein are there brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
plainly, familiarly, and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically
laid open, ripped vp, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaied,
anatomized and vnfolded
(in effect) all the secret corners &amp;
starting hoales of the inwarde
man: together with the stinking
Camerine of all the other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
enormities, offēses &amp; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressiōs
outwardly also, through
thesway of sinne, bursting out in

vs into action. Whereuppon, the
conscience being by most plaine
and apparant euidence, endited,
arraigned &amp; conuicted, is driuen
to disclaime al helpe, merit, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,
condignity or worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in it selfe, &amp; prostrately to sue
for pardon at the mercifull hands
of God thorough Christ. The
which, as I most hartily (for the
vowed duety, and vnfeigned loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,

as I during my life, shal remaine a
