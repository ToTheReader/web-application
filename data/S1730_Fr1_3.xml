though not in <hi>Body,</hi> yet in <hi>Soule,</hi> in longing, and affectionate <hi>Vowes</hi> and <hi>Wishes,</hi> and on the wings of <hi>Contemplation flye to his Crosse.</hi> There let us lay downe all our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, lustfull, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull thoughts, our Pride and fond opinion of Science, the vanity and ryot of our youth, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice and morosity of our Age, together with the whole swarme of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</p>
