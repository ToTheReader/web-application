      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Reuerent and my most honored good Lord,</p>
   <p>I haue alwayes appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the life and Martirdome of that most excellent Prelate, and vndaunted Champion, S. Thomas Archbishope of Canterburie, a most perfect Paterne of a good Pastor, yea and of a good subiect too, as one wisely discerning Gods part
<pb facs="4"/> from Caesars, and giuing to ether their owne, without which there can be no Christian iustice. Take his owne gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and last words for it, written to King Henry his soueraigne; <hi>Prepared I am, not onely to die, but also to suffer a thousand deathes, and all torments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer for Christ's sake: Yet whether</hi> I <hi>die or liue,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cod. Vat. l. <hi>5.</hi> Epist. <hi>54.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>I am and shall euer be yours; and what euer becomes of vs and ours, God euer blesse you and your issue.</hi> So that I haue iudged no tyme mispent, in culling the peeces out of the most authenticall and best Authors, which haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to the making vp of this litle bulke, or Epistolarie processe of his life and death; which I hope will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare most contentfull and satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to all, and fittest to frame a right iudgment in any: as not being croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and fitted to selfe endes by arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall amplifications, but furnished by knowne fact, and made good by so many and so ir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>eprochable witnesses,
<pb facs="4"/> as it cannot indeed be suspected to be in any part disguised or forced by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or malice, but to deliuer a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked truth.</p>
   <p>Now amongst all those, whom I duely reuerence and honor in earth, I could find none, to whose patronage this poore worke of myne, might laye a more iust clayme then to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: like as, in my iudgment, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipe can pretend no Patrone in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to whom you may haue a more confident recourse, or with whom you might haue more sympathie, being considered such as he liued in this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habitation, for Religiousnesse, zeale, contrie, cause, constancie. None which comes more home to your vse in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of your long delay in banishment, and the opposition you haue found, euen amongst some of your children, and those domesticalls of faith. In a word, in reading it you will not fayle before your death, to reade a great part
<pb facs="5"/> of your owne renowned life. May it, I beseech almightie God, be long, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentfull, prosperous in earth: and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed out with an eternally blessed one in heauen. These are, and euer shall be, the zealous wishes of all good men; and in particular of</p>
