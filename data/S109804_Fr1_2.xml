   <head>Preface of the Author.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Vrsyd is that mā which dothe the worke of god necglygently. This is wryten in the .xlviii. cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pytre of the prophet Hie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>remye. God whose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie is incomparable / despiseth hym that is vndeuoute in his seruice / he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horryth the sluggard / he defyeth the wycked and the necgligent / moreouer if the princes of this worlde loke for to be seruyd with due reuerēce &amp; attendaūce / howe moch more then doth the lorde of all thynges (whose maiestie surely is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fynite) wyll / commaunde / and require / that we shall serue hym with most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall diligence. The Apostle therfore gyueth vs moniciō sayeng in this wyse. Let vs serue god with feare &amp; diligence. And in another place he exhortyth vs in this wyse. Laboure for your saluacion with feare / awe / and dread / for surely those thre thynges do cause dilygence / they induce vs vnto spirituall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection and distroy all necglygence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge vnto the sayenge of scripture: which is this. Let vs always walke cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cūspectly before god euermore fearyng.
<pb facs="2"/> leste we in any wyse do offende the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the almighty which beholdyth all thynges. And lyke as feare of body mouyth mannes mynde for to eschewe peryll / euen so the feare of god causyth vs to be circūspect in eschewyng synne. Therfore as it is wryten in the boke of Ecclesiasticus / he that is without feare maye not be iustefyed. And Salomon sayth. The feare of god is a well of lyfe / for to auoyde the ruyne of death / whiche also sayth in another place / he that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

      </gap>yth god is neglygent in nothyng. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtydly this detestable negligence which deseruyth malediction and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting dampnacion / is most repugnaūt and contrarie vnto holsome sollicitude / and vertuos diligence. Seyng therfore that the feare of god ingendryth dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence / it must nedys folowe that a man fearyng god shall in nothyng be negly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent / it is not without cause therfore that Dauid the maker of psalmys sayd / feare ye god all that be his saynctes / for they that feare hym shal want nothyng which texte is to be vnderstanden of no bonde or seruyle feare / but of such feare as a chylde hath of his father. Seynge therfore that the feare of god is so m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ch
<pb facs="3"/> necessary and holsome / we are wel war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyd in al the holy scripture / for to do all our workes hauyng before our eyen the feare of god / in so much that our laudes wherby we prayse hym / and our glorie wherby we reioysed in hym / ought to be ioyned and haue a sent of this godly feare / wherupon the holy {pro}phete sayth Serue ye the lorde with feare / &amp; reioyse in hym with dread. And certaynly to serue god after this fashyon is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyall gyfte of his grace / accordyng vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sayenge of Iob / from the north comyth gold / and from god comyth the tymorous or fearful praysyng / for syns that all our ryghtuousnes (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete than wytnesseth) is in the syghte of god / but a ragge of a woman vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified / and syns that in all our other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and doynges there happen many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straccions and defautes / ought we not then to be always circumspecte / ware / diligent / and fearfull / lest euyn in doyng our good workes / we offende our lorde / and be reproued of that ryghtuos and dreadfull iuge / for lyke as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy abbot Agathon said. If god shuld lay agaynst our many solde necgligence &amp; defautes / that we happen to incurre whylest we
<pb facs="3"/> are prayeng / vndoubtidly we coude not be saued. wherfore let vs endeuour our selu{is} with our hole power for to eschew this detestable necgligence in all our di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uine seruyce / wherupon fryer Thomas in the .liii. question of his worke affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that necgligence is the leuynge of due and conuenient busynes / and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectely repugnaunt and contrarie vnto spirituall and vertuos diligence. And ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kewyse as diligence is a specyall poynt of wysedom / euen so is necgligence the chefe poynte of folyshenes / for as saynct Isodore sayth. Negligens .i. non eligēs And so is he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> taketh none hede what is good nor what is euyll / therfore lyke as the takyng hede &amp; chusynge of those thynges that are mete and necessarye for a good purpose / is an ayde of a wyse man / so the leuynge of and refusynge of such thynges is very necgligēce / which is an acte of a fole / and comyth for lacke of good aduysement and discrecion / for if a man wolde inwardlye considre the authorite and worthynes of goddes hyghe commaundement and his moste dreadfull and ryghtuos iugemente / 
<pb facs="4"/> and there with all his rewarde and ioye of them that obey hym / and the tormen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes and paynes of them that dysobey hym / he shulde forthewith begynne to tremble / to abhorre negligence / and fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to do the worke of god with all dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligēce. Notwithstandyng S. Gregorie wryteth that Securite is the mother of negligence. But yet there is a good Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>curite which procedeth from a good and a pure conscience wherof Salomon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryth wytnesse in the .xv. chapytre of his prouerbys<note place="margin">Prouer. 15.</note> sayeng. An assured mynde is as it were a continuall feste. There is another maner of Securite that is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryllous and comyth by reason of errour and lacke of aduysemēt or consideraciō. And that is where a mā takyth no hede of hymselfe when he is in ieoperdy / nc remembryth how he walketh ī the myd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of the deuylles calthrop and snares nor that he offendyth god greuosly ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny wayes / nor caryth not whyther he deserue loue or hate / whyther he be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate and reproued / whyther he shal be sauyd or euerlastyngly condemnyd / of the which most dampnable and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Securite it is mencioned in the vii. chapitre of Ecclesiastes<note place="margin">esia. 7.</note> in this wyse
<pb facs="4"/> There be of the wycked sorte that be as presumptuos as if they had wroughte iustely. So that this presumpcion and also neglygence growe and sprynge out of one rote / and so it makyth no great mattier though one synne haue his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge of diuerse. Let vs therfore be verily wyse / diligent / carefull / and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspecte / as creatures hauynge eyes on euery syde. And let vs set our hartes vpon oure iorney lyke as the prophete Aggeus monysheth vs / that we tourne not into the waye of synne / lest we sone after fall into the tormētys of hell. And let vs pouder and and fulfyll the sayeng of the scripture which is this: Blyssed is that man that is alway farefull / for I haue fearyd god lyke as I wold wauys of the see ragynge vpon me. Wherupon holy Iob sayth these wordes. When I remembre god I am stryken with feare And also I was tymorous in all my workes lorde / for I knowe that thou wylt spare / when I offende / for a wyse man castyth the worst in all thynge / be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is vncertayn and in doute why<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther his actes do procede of charite / and whither he please god or not And for as moch as it is a dreadfull thynge to fall
<pb facs="5"/> into the handes of the lyuyng god / the whiche is terrible in his iudgementes vpon the sonnes of men wherof also we are vncertayne and ignoraunt what he hath determined of vs in the secretes of his prescience or knowlege / and finally what shall becom of vs: let vs then (all necgligence layed a part) studie to serue hym always with feare and reuerence / and so doynge we may be sure to truste on the best / but if we do our worke neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygently / we shall peryshe with those of whom the {pro}phete speaketh. They that swarue from thy commaundementes shall peryshe. These thynges I haue touched bresly of the feare of god / and eschewynge neclygence because in this worke folowyng I do intende specially to intreate of certayne mattiers concer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyng the good cōuersacion and lyuyng of religious persones or regulars / that is to wyte of such as are boundē to any rule or ordre certayne / the state of whō (alas the more pyte) is fallen to great ruyne and decaye / ye and in maner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to extreme misordre / neuertheles amōg them there are many good men that with the dread of god are mouyd vnto perfyte liuyng. Amōg whom also there
<pb facs="5"/> are manye that I loue tendrely / the whiche haue oftentymes disclosyd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me the charite of theyr hartes / for whose sakys I haue wryten this boke / wherfore (by the grace and helpe of god) I shall touche this mattier as groundly and as substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as I can possy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble.</p>
