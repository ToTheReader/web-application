   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O proue that the arte of Reasoning may be taught in englishe, I reason thus: First, we Englishmen haue wits, as wel as men of other nations haue: Wherby we conceyue what standeth with reason, and is well doone, and what séemeth to be so, and is not. Wée haue also framed vnto our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues a language, wherby we do expresse by voyce or writing, all deuises that wée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue in our mynde: and do by this means let men looke into our heartes, and sée what wée thinke. Then, as Englishe men can compasse this Arte by wit: so can they also declare and sette it foorth by speache. Nowe whereas a number of men doe suppose, that our language hath no words litte to expresse the rules of this Arte: and where as some men do argue, that it must néedes be so, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they that speake or write thereof at large, vse termes and wordes, that no mere English man can vnderstande: It is playn, that neyther their supposition is true: nor
<pb facs="5"/>
yet their reason good. For as time doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent a newe forme of building, a straunge fashion of apparell, and a newe kinde of artillerie, and munitions: so doe men by consent of speache, frame and deuise new names, fit to make knowen their strange deuises. As for straunge and inckhorne termes, (vsed of many without cause) they argue a misuse to be in the speaker: but they proue not directly, that there is anye lacke in oure language: no more then the rudenes of Lawyers latine, proueth that there is a want of good wordes in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tonnge. I sée and confesse, that there be <hi>Plura rerum, quàm verborum genera,</hi> (that is, moe things, then there are words to expresse things by) and do know with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that Aristotle founde that want in the Gréeke tongue, whiche for finenesse of speache, and store of woordes, farre excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all other languages. Yet is there this helpe in speache, that we ofte vse manye wormes to expresse one thing: yea &amp; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one word is vsed to signifie sundry matters. Moreouer, one language borow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of another, and where there is want,
<pb facs="5"/>
men sometimes deuise newe names and compounded termes. So that after a man hath conceyued anye newe deuise in hys heade, and is desirous to haue the same published, and made common to manye, he findeth euer some shifte, by one meane or other, to make the same knowen. And bycause there is none so good a waye to do it by, as speache, man maketh that hys chiefe meane. Thus ye may sée the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall groundworke, &amp; beginning of artes, Man firste doth conceyue trim deuises in his heade, and then (as the Poetes doe feigne of Iupiter) is pained as a womā in trauaile, till he haue vttered and published them, to be sene, &amp; commended of others. So that when as artes are begon at the first by one, and after laboured by many, they grow by continuance of time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as well in the vtteraunce of the speache, as in the deuise of the minde. As for deuising of newe termes, and compo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of wordes, our tongue hath a speciall grace, wherein it excelleth many other, &amp; is comparable with the best. The cause is, for that the moste parte of Englyshe
<pb facs="6"/>
woordes are shorte, and stande on one si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable a péece. So that two or thrée of them are ofte times fitly ioyned in one.</p>
   <p>Of these kinde of wordes, I haue deuysed many, and am now to giue a reason of my dooing. But first I desire thée (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) not to scoffe at them afore thou knowe what they meane: or that thou hast founde out thy selfe, or learned of others, more apte and fit termes then they are. And if any mā do cast out a reason, and say, <hi>Loquendum vt vulgus,</hi> that is to say, he that speaketh, must vse such termes as the common people is in vre withall: and therfore that we may not deuise newe names, but reteyne and vse the olde. I answer, this common saying taketh place, where there are words alredy extant, and in vse, fit to make the minde of the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, knowne to his audience: but the matter standes not so with vs. Therefore consider the case as it is: An arte is to be taughte in that toung, in which<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> it was neuer written afore. Nowe the question lyeth, whether it were better to borrowe termes of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther toung, in whiche this sayde Arte hath bene written: and by a litle chaunge of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing,
<pb facs="6"/>
to séeke to make them Englishe wordes, whiche are none in déede: or else of simple vsual wordes, to make compounded termes, whose seuerall partes considered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, are familiar and knowne to all english men? For trial hereof, I wish you to aske of an english man, who vnderstandeth neither Gréek nor Latin, what he conceiueth in his mind, when he heareth this word a backset, and what he doth conceiue when he heareth this terme a Predicate. And doubtlesse he must confesse, if he consider y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> matter aright or haue any sharpnesse of wit at al, that by a backset, he conceiueth a thing that muste be set after, and by a predicate, that he doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande nothing at all. The like shall fall foorth when comparison is made, betwixt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our new termes compounded of true english words, and the inkhorne termes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued of straunge and forain languages: For he that is an englishman born, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth no toung but his owne, shal at the first, eyther conceiue the meaning of oure words by himself, or else soon learne them v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon an other mās instruction and teaching: but for these inkhorne termes, it is certaine,
<pb facs="7"/>
that he shall neither vnderstande them by himselfe: nor keepe them in remembraunce when he is taught theyr signification of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, bicause the worde can make him no helpe. We therfore, that deuise vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able termes, compounded of true &amp; auncient english woords, do rather maintain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the antiquitie of our mother tongue: then they, that with inckhorne termes doe chaunge and corrupt the same, making a mingle mangle of their natiue speache, and not obseruing the propertie thereof. They that will haue no newe woordes deuised where there is want, seme not well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider howe speache groweth, or wherefore it was deuised by man: For names are not giuen vnto things afore the things themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues be inuented. Therfore olde names will not serue to make newe deuises knowen. It is a fondnesse (I graunt) to deuise newe names, where there are olde in vse, which agréeing to the propertie of the speach, may serue the turne well enoughe. For no man is of power to change or to make a language when he will: but when fit names are deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and spoken, they force the hearers to
<pb facs="7"/>
like of them and to vse them: and so do they by consent of manye, growe to a speache. Therfore (gentle reader) if thou doubt, what is ment, by any of our strange and new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised termes, consider their partes, as they are taken by themselues alone: and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the partes, shall leade thée to the knowledge of the whole. But if thys shall not serue thy turne, thou maist looke in the table placed in the end of our booke, and it shall shewe thée in order their meanyng, eyther by numbers referring thée to the places, where they are plainely taughte: or making some shorte exposition of them, if there be none in the booke afore. There shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be added also (for some mens better conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) the Latine termes. And thus much, for proufe, that this arte maye be taught in oure mother tongue, and for defence of the termes that we haue deuised to teache and set foorth the same. Newe let vs aunswere them, which iudge it hurtfull, to haue thys arte written and setfoorth in englishe. They builde chiefely vppon two poyntes. Fyrst they suppose, that it shoulde bée a greate decaye and hynderaunce vnto learnyng.
<pb facs="8"/>
Secondlye, that it shoulde minister vnto many, matter of contentiō and strife. The first part of their supposition is proued to be false by plaine experience: for what mā of experience and wit seeth not, that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning did neuer so flourishe in England in our forefathers dayes, as it doth now, and hathe done of late, euen since men haue begon to write of Artes in our englishe tongue? And as for contentiō, which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth betwixt partie and partie, when they argue and dispute of matters to and fro: that is no fault to be imputed or ascribed vnto arte: but an infirmitie and heate of choller, incident to the nature of sharpe wits, and commonly chancing▪ when men leaue the cause, and bestowe their speache vpon by matters: which thing the arte of reason reproueth, terming it a shift, and a wranglers point. But let vs consider the profite that commeth of this arte, so shall wée beste sée, that learning hath no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but them that are ignoraunt, &amp; those which know not what profite commeth of knowledge. This arte serueth to manye singular purposes. For she doth not onely
<pb facs="8"/>
teach an order to reason wittily of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matters, and to speake forceably of them either of or on, But she also yeldeth to them, that are cunning and experte in hir, a generall vnderstanding to iudge of all matters whatsoeuer, and to discerne what is saide or done according to reason, and what is not. And where euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular science hath but one speciall matter to intreate of, as Arithmeticke to intreate of numbers, Geometrie of bignesse, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke of health, &amp;c. This facultie that wée here speake of, is tyed to no speciall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but taketh in hand the debating of all things, so farre as wit and reason can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende. Hir preceptes are verye generall, and are vsed for groundes, and principles in all sciences. She trieth whether y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> rules of arte be true or false: she is a searching facultie, by reason whereof she teacheth a man the sooner to espy, what is right, what is wrong, what maketh for him, and what maketh against him. But to speake more particularly of hir worke, shée sorteth all wordes, and placeth euery kind by it selfe, eaching what they signifie, as they are
<pb facs="9"/>
considered, and taken alone: shée declareth what sense words do make, whē they are coupled and knit together: shée painteth foorth the perfect forme of a reasō by rule. And to conclude, shée doth minister matter to confirme, and laye foorth a troth: and teacheth a way, howe to disproue, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer an errour. He that is cunnyng in this facultye, shall seme ignoraunt in no learning: and who that is altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séene in this, can be depely seene in none. Doubtlesse a wise man must néedes take great pleasure, and wonder, to see a fewe rules lead men to an infinite knowledge. These things I trowe may profite many, sure I am, they can harme none. A scholer or one that is but a beginner, maye not thinke that he should vnderstande at the first sight, if perchaunce he reade in thys booke at aduenture here or there: For the rules of this Arte are couched together like to billets in a pile of wood: so y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> things that are layd downe in order, must be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlye taken vp: neither doe men draw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> out billettes at the breast of the pile: but they ascend to the toppe, and taking them

         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of hard pointes, vse these helpes. First consider with yourselfe▪ what the authors purpose is in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> place, how that speciall point may agrée with the generall issue: then seke to know, what euery word in the sentence maye signifie by it selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: &amp; after weigh what sense they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

Now to let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie writer haue his deserued praise, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse (to them that desire to knowe whom I folow) that in my thrée firste bookes, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ely folow Aristotle: both for matter, &amp;
<pb facs="10"/>
also for order: who is in my iudgement, an author, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> farre passeth all prophane wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: not onely for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>he writeth more true, and profitable things then others do: but also, for that his manner, and trade of writing, is more perfect and playner, then any others is y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> I haue red. As for Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronians &amp; suger tongued fellowes, which labour more for fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>nes of speach, then for knowledge of good matter, they oft speake much to small purpose, and shaking foorth a number of choise words, and picked sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, they hinder good learning, wyth their fond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>hatte. But in my fourth booke, which intreateth of the places, &amp; sheweth a way how to prouide store of arguments: I haue thought good neither fully to folow Aristotle: nor yet anye other that I haue séene. For Aristotles inuention serueth best, for vniuersitie men, when a question is broughte to some generall issue, as to proue that the backset is, or is not, the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, the kinde, the propertie, or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beer of the foreset. Howbeit, men vse in disputing or writing, to argue to and fro, neuer bringing the matter that lyeth in
<pb facs="10"/>
question, to anye of these foure generall issues. Nowe thoughe the latter writers, thinke they finde iust fault with Aristotle in this behalfe: yet in mine opinion, they themselues neither deuise so many places as may be deuised for store of matter: nor yet name them, or handle them so aptly or handsomly as is méete. If it be my happe, dissenting from all men in this pointe, to finde out a playner and more easye waye, then hath bene found out heretofore, thou oughtest (gentle reader) neither to blame their lacke of skill: nor much to praise my mending. For Artes are like to Okes, which by litle and litle grow a long time, afore they come to their ful bignesse. That one mā beginneth, another oft times fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth and mendeth: and yet more praise to be giuē to the beginner, then to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer or mender, if the first did finde moe good things, then the folower did adde. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth, that eche thing which is inuented by man, hath a beginning, hath an increase, and hath also in time a full ripenesse. Nowe although eche worke is most commendable when it is brought to
<pb facs="11"/>
his full perfectiō: yet where the workme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> are many, there is oft times more prayse to be giuen to hym that begynneth a good worke, then to him that endeth it. For if ye consider the bookes that are now prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and compare them with the bookes that were printed at the first (Lord) what a diuersity is there, and how much do the last exceede the first? Yet if ye wil compare the first and the last Printer together, and seke whether deserueth more praise and commendation: ye shall finde that the first did farre excéede the last. For the last had helpe of manye, and the firste had helpe of none. So that the first lighteth the candle of knowledge (as it were) and the seconde doth but snuffe it. This I write, for that some adding but patches to other mens workes, and after publishing the whole in their owne name, conueigh to themselues (as it were by stealth) the fame &amp; prayse that others doe deserue. As for those that marre y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> thing they take in hand to mend, do not only publishe to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world their own vnskilsulnesse, in finding out any profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter: but also doe bewray their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habilitie
<pb facs="11"/>
to iudge of things well found out to their handes. To such I say, it is farre easier for a meane craftes man, to make a worke of his owne deuise, then to finishe the work, that a cunning mā hath begon. I write thus much, bicause some men by suche kinde of dealing, haue misused both my doings &amp; my name. For the booke, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Philosophers game, and printed about nine yeares ago, is entituled to bée set foorth by Kaphe Leuer, and to be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by one W. F. But I assure thee (gentle reader) that, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> pamphlet or worke neuer passed from mée, with so many &amp; so grosse ouersightes, as in the booke nowe printed are common to be sene. For triall wherof, I referre my self to the copy that this day is extant in sundry of my frendes handes. Surely I thinke my selfe muche discredited, and that great wrong is offred vnto me, for that the same is set forth, and suffred to passe vnder my name, without my knowledge, or assent. Reason would, that eche man should beare the blame of his owne deault. But I maruell most at him, which woulde correcte and augment
<pb facs="12"/>
the tables that I drew forth, for beginners to loke on, when they played at this game. For sure I am, that I comprised in them, both plainly and briefly, all the examples of taking and triumphing, which are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be founde, in that kind of exercise. Nowe hath this correcter or augmenter (terme him as ye will) altered, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged mine examples, in an hundreth pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and moe: committing in eche place, a manifest errour: either leauing out them which are necessary: or interlacing them, which are altogether impertinent to this playe, or vtterly false, and not agréeing, to the rules and principles of Arithmeticke. It were therfore to be wished, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> no mans work shuld be printed, nor no mans name put to any worke, excepte the partie firste knew therof, and were welwilling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto: and that they which take in hand to amend or augmēt another mans writing, should vse certaine markes, whreby eche mans doing might appeare by it selfe. So should eche person beare the report of hys owne desert, whether it were good or bad. There are two common markes, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> thys
<pb facs="12"/>
arte shooteth at: the first is, to make a good reason: the second is, to shewe the faultes of an ill reason. Of the first, I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so much, as I thought conuenient and méete: of the second, I mind to write here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if the Lorde God shall make mée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and occasion me so to do. In the mean time, I haue yelded to the earnest request of my frendes: and haue published thys first part, without the seconde: not myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for mine own ease to stay that, which is thoughte, will yelde present profite to many. Learne thou (gentle reader) by this which is alreadye written, to make true reasons, and to vse an vpright kind of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng: and then shall no coloured or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueable arguments driue thée from the trueth, or leade thée into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Farewell from Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resme, the. 24. of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. 1572.</p>
