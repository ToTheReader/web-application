   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing of late, for mine owne exercise at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
howres, consummated the translation
of this little Booke, I now boldly aduenture
to commit it to the Presse, being the rather
induced thereunto by the incouragement of
certaine of mine acquaintance: not that I seeke hereby to
winne praise, or publish this for any deuotion in print, since
I am verily perswaded, it deserues not the least title of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:
and I hold it as a maxime with <hi>Lylie,</hi> that he
which commeth in print, because hee would bee knowne, is
like the foole that goeth into the market, because hee would
be seene. Onely I hope, that this my simple labour will be a
spurre to the riper wits of our time, that the golden works of
this &amp; other famous Poets, may not still lie hidden, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a vaile or mysterie, from the weake capacitie of meaner
iudgements. Concerning my translation, as I cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
commend it: for <hi>quando{que} bonus dormitat
Homerus:</hi> so neither will I wholly discommend it; in the
one I might seeme arrogant; in the other be accounted foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish:
and therefore <hi>puto rectius esse, vt sint mediocria
omnia.</hi> If one write neuer so well, he shall not please all; if
neuer so ill, he shall please some: a dog will barke, though he
lack his teeth; and a dolt wil censure, though he want iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I knowe, to some curious heads it will bee thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse,
that euery verse answeres not their expectation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I haue not word for word concurd with the Author
in my translation: yet if they will but looke a little into the
difficulty of this thing, considering the kind of verse which
I haue vsed, I hope they will rest satisfied. I only wil answere
them out of <hi>Horace, Non verbum verbo curabis red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,
<pb facs="3"/>
fidus interpres.</hi> And furthermore (besides the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
betweene a construction &amp; a translation) they may
know▪ that there are many mysteries in this writer, which
vttered in English, would shew little pleasure, and in mine
opinion, are better to bee vntouched, then to diminish the
grace of the rest with tediousnes &amp; obscuritie: I haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
followed the counsell of the aforesaid <hi>Horace,</hi> teaching
the duty of a good Interpreter, <hi>qui, quae desperat trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tata
nitescere posse, relinquit.</hi> By which occasion, some
fewe sentences I haue in places omitted, somewhat added,
some what altered, and somewhat expounded: that which I
haue added, you shall find quoted in the margent. The signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of the names (being indeede no names, but onely
wordes correspondent to the nature of <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Mise)
ne quis in ijs haereat,</hi> lest any should therewith be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
I haue englished and inserted them in the verse, that
the inferiour Readers should not bee wearied with looking
in the margent▪ as for the learned, they need not be instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
I meane not be a preiudice to any that can do finer; only
I would desire them to beare with this my simple labour,
and to accept it as a thing roughly begun, rather then pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.
And if any with this will not bee contented, let him
take in hand, and doe it anew himselfe, and I doubt not, but
he shal find it an easier thing to controll a line or two, then
to amend the whole of this interpretation. Farewell.</p>
