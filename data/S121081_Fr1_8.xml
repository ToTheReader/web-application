   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the Custome of worldly men, so sure to lay vp their earthly Treasure, as there is no comming to it without a Key, because it is kept vnder locke, or lockes rather. Thus it fareth with the Heauenly neuer-withering Treasure, which being (as it were) lockt vp from all men (as they be the Sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi>) cannot be enioyed of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of a double Key. One, is meerely Spirituall and Principally held and kept in his hand, which hath the Keyes of the house of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to open the wits and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of such as bee blinde by Nature. <hi>Luke 24, 45.</hi> and still more and more to illuminate such as bee alreadie taught of God. <hi>Psal. 119, 18.</hi> The other, is so Spirituall, as it is also Ministeriall; to wit, the Interpretation of Scriptures, eyther by vocall preaching, or by sounde Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of such Scribes as be skilfull to open the worde of the kingdome. The former Key, thy humble faithfull Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers must prouide, beseeching God thy Father most instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the name of his sonne, to open thine eyes to make thee able to see the wonders of his Law. The latter (as from many other Diuine Lock-smiths) so from this Authour is ministred to thee in this present Booke; full of labour, and very lightsome. What remayneth, but that as a naturall man would be glad of a Key, to open the Lock where much Gold and Siluer is stored vp: so thou shouldst ioyfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this worke, which leadeth thee to a Treasure more to be desired then Gold; yea, then much fine Gold. <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi>
