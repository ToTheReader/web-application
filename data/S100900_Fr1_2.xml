<pb facs="3"/> they extend beyond the reach of any mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, being so resplendent as they rarifie and giue light to the eclipsed and darke knowledge of all your Subiects, (as the Sunne giueth light and life to all the other Orbes and sublunarie bodies:) Vpon whom God hath multiplied his guifts and blessings to such a Product, as no Nation or Kingdome vpon the surface of the darke Globe of this earth could euer as yet num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

<pb facs="4"/> to the talent which God hath bestowed on me; and therfore not being able to present such gifts vnto your Highnesse as is worthy your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance (for the excellency thereof) rather then I shall be found with the vngratefull seruant to hide my talent in the ground, I haue presumed to dedicate vnto your Maiestie this <hi>Vineyard of Horsemanship,</hi> the first fruit of my liues experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, planted by painfull practise &amp; the charges of my whole estate; knowing the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs haue vouchsafed to receiue poor presents of such as were not able to offer greater gifts.</p>

<pb facs="4"/> hath taxed such false impositions vpon these noble Creatures, as now they are become most ignoble and base; In which also I haue done my best, to set these blamelesse Creatures free from such vniust suggestions, and haue laid the cause of them to mans ignorance, to whom they are properly appertaining. Therefore trusting your Gracious lenity will admit a tolleration of my vnworthy labours, it will incite others to digge deeper into this Myne, whereby there will be found such pretious pearles, as will garnish the now deiected Art of this so famous Subiect, that there shall bee no need to desire any Iewells from forraigne Countries, and also it wil imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den mee to persist (during the rest of my life) to bring such things to light as are yet left in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, according to the measure of my vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And in the meane time, I will pray with heart and mind vnto the King of all Kings, that hee would confound the wicked practises of all those, whether Papists or Atheists, that shall either secretly or openly attempt the subuersion of you or your Royall posterity, but that there may be still one proceeding from your loynes to rule the Scepter till <hi>Shilo</hi> come;
