   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RABLE <hi>GEORGE</hi> EARLE OF
<hi>CVMBERLAND,</hi> BARON OF <hi>CLIFFORD,</hi> LORD OF <hi>VVESTMER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Skipton, Vipont, Bromflet,</hi> and <hi>Vessy,</hi> Knight of the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Order of the Garter, all health and happinesse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong many that haue taken in hand (Right Honourable and my very good Lord) to write the Stories of auncient times, the warres and woorthie deedes of famous Princes, it was my lot (thogh vnwoorthie) to be called to the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of these last troubles of <hi>France,</hi> which by the Author, was in the French tongue very learnedly and eloquently set downe. And sith the matter therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, meriteth to bee well regarded, and duly considered of all noble and honourable personages: and the knowledge thereof, profitable to be imparted vnto all Christian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, it was thought verie meete and requisite, to haue the same tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into our English tongue, for the profit and benefit of all such En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen, as are not skilfull in the other language: what sweetnesse of phrase it hath lost, being thus stript out of it owne attire, I beseech your good Lordship to pardon; considering that the French in phrase, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a peculiar grace in it self, which cannot alwaies in an other speech be exprest. Not what I would, but what I could I haue done in the translation, wishing in my heart (for your Lordships sake) that my skil could haue stretcht to my good will. Neuerthelesse, for the saluing of all imperfections therein, and the intier affection which I beare to your honourable vertues, In all humilitie I commend my Booke to your Lordships patronage, that your worthinesse may supply what is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <pb facs="3"/>in me, and shield my booke from the enuie of Satyricall carpers: who beholding your Lordship to be a Protector of my simple labour, will rather blush at their owne peeuishnesse, then proceed any further in their mallice. Thus building on hope of your honourable fauour, I humbly rest.</p>
