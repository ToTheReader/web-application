      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aint PAUL'S</hi> glory and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great cause of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, was this; that as a wise Master-builder hee had laid the foundation, whereupon the whole building of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity is established. Though not to lay the ground-work or Principles of Religion,
<pb facs="3"/>yet to be fellow-workers with <hi>GOD</hi> and His holy Apostles, is now the glory and rejoycing of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of the Word in these latertimes. Amongst the rest a sincere, faithfull, and judicious Divine in these Workes of his never yet before extant, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to your Honours view and approbation. His abilities were such as became a Successour of a worthy and religious Predecessour, in his ministeriall function in the Vniversitie of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> by him performed, unto <hi>GOD's</hi> glory, the good of others, and his owne comfort. The first he unfainedly desired and propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the utmost scope of all his endeavors, that <hi>GOD might be glorified by him both in life and death:</hi> the second as subordinate to the other, hee procured, not ayming at his owne advantage so much as their salvation that heard him, <hi>not seeking theirs, but them.</hi> The last was an effect of the two first, this must needs be a consequent where the others are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent: for, <hi>GOD forgets not our labour of love,</hi> to Himselfe, or others. Sensible experience hereof had this holy man, who found much comfort by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry in himselfe, and by the fruits of it in others. There be many that spend much time in studying, <hi>are never weary in wel-doing, are instant in season, and out of season;</hi> but with how small successe! for it is <hi>in vaine to rise early, and sit up late,</hi> except
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>GOD</hi> give a blessing: <hi>Paul planteth, and Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los watereth, but GOD giveth the encrease:</hi> if <hi>GOD</hi> put not His hand to the worke, there will be but a Babel of confusion: He knew it very well, who <hi>prayed continually</hi> for the divine assistance to make his ministeriall worke effectuall. Hee prayed, and his prayer was heard: hee wrestled with <hi>GOD</hi> (as <hi>Iacob</hi> did) and overcame Him. Hee fulfilled his desires and granted his requests, and made him a spirituall Father of many children by him begotten unto <hi>GOD.</hi> Should I say more? I will adde this only: what in him was praise-worthy, let it be applauded; what was in him for Instruction and a godly life, let us imitate: Let us learne of a dead man to live. Dead doe I call him? <hi>Though the body die by reason of sinne, yet the spirit liveth unto GOD, through IESUS CHRIST</hi> our <hi>LORD.</hi> Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learne of him to live spiritually, that with him we may live eternally. I have shewed in some sort what hee was, and what it concerneth us to be. And this the rather, presuming of your Honours favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance, not so much of him that Dedicates these following Expositions, as of him by whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement hee was encouraged thereto, his worthy friend, Your Ladyships humble servant; that for his
<pb facs="4"/>sake, and the Authors, You would vouchsafe to cast over this Booke the wing of Your protection. This is his desire, who shall ever remaine</p>
