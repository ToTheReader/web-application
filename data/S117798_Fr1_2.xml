   <head>TO THE MOST
Happy Mistresse of all
imaginable Graces, which
beautifie and ennoble both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and minde, the Lady
Theophila Coke.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>Madame,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Motives for
the Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
Treatise to your
<pb facs="3"/>
Ladiship, are three; your
Knowledge, your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and my owne Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.
For the first; as
it is to you a singular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,
and Content, so
is it to me a speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
for you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
more to understand,
then I doe to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
Had I written to
your Ladiship in the
Roman Language, the
French, the Italian, or the
<pb facs="3"/>
Spanish, they had beene
almost as familiar to you
as this your native
Tongue, in which you
are Mistresse of so great
an Elegancy, that no
words are so fit as your
owne, to eternize your
owne actions. But these
are only the conveyances
of Learning, the vast bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
whereof you have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom'd,
and in every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
part of it are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
<pb facs="4"/>
of as much, as the
want of an Academicke
education, and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
divertments incident
to your sexe, permit. And
of this inestimable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
Modesty keeps the
key, and shuts out Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
not suffering a
word to issue forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Grace to attend it.
Hence it comes to passe,
that as it is impossible to
handle perfumes without
<pb facs="4"/>
bearing away part of their
sent; so to converse with
you without favouring
of your goodnesse. Nor
does your Discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
relish of your sweet
Disposition; for you reade
not of a vertue, which you
forthwith put not into
act, &amp; adde to it a greater
beauty, then it had in the
Example from which
you deriv'd it. The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratiō,
Madam, of these
<pb facs="5"/>
your Excellencies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in me a beliefe, that
this portraiture (though
imperfect) of the prime
President of femall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
would prove a
Present most acceptable
to your Ladiship, to
whose innocency you
makes as neer an approach
as any thing mortall can
doe. Should I say you
are without sinne, I
should impiously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
<pb facs="5"/>
the Scriptures;
should I say you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I should unjustly goe
against mine own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
for neither I, nor I
think, Envy her self could
ever yet discover in you
the least imperfection.
Sure I am if you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
they are inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
unlesse you place
your owne Conscience
for a witnesse, which it
will not better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb facs="6"/>
to judge it selfe, then
it will doe my Charity
to cleare it. Nor is this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of yours froward and
formall, but gentle, free,
and communicative. You
shew the world that there
is a christian freedome, of
which we may lawfully
partake. By your faire
Demeanour you cleerly
demonstrate, that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be without Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
and vertue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
<pb facs="6"/>
sociable, and that
shee is more fruitfull in
society, than in solitude.
This testimony, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
Truth, and the
people (whose Register
I am) commanded mee
to give You, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to Posterity. I
cannot descend to such
basenesse, as to flatter
you, yet (if I should,)
would not you be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
who are like a
<pb facs="7"/>
sweet Instrument, that
sends forth a delightfull
sound without being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of its owne Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
No, no, heaven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
my lines should bee
like those Sacrifices, out
of which they used to
plucke the heart, but leave
the tongue behinde. I se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
protest, that if you
were Empresse of the
World, and were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
as eminent in Vice, as
<pb facs="7"/>
you are in Vertue, I
would not give you the
least praise in exchange
for all your large posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
for no gold shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
winne mee to guild
sinne. And I freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that if within the
large circuit of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
or Reading, I
could have found a femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine
Example, fairer then
your owne, to her peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,
if living, I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb facs="8"/>
this Treatise, if
dead, had bequeath'd it
to her memory. Such a
prostituted Eloquence, as
made Apologies for <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salina,</hi>
and <hi>Quartilla,</hi> are
to me odious. But wee
must warily distinguish
betweene a grosse Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and a due Praise; the
latter of which,<note place="margin">Plinius secundus in Epist.</note> saith <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
no man contemneth
till hee hath left to doe
things praiseworthy. As
<pb facs="8"/>
we cannot over-worship
the true Deity, so wee
cannot over-praise a true
Piety. It onely now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth,
that I offer up to
your Ladiship, two Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions;
the first of which
is, that you would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to permit this Booke,
under your gratious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage,
to doe that
where you are not, which
you performe where you
are; that is, to confirme
<pb facs="9"/>
the good, and convert the
bad. The next is, that
your Ladiship would
be pleased to accept of my
submissive Gratitude,
which, though great, can
be no way proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the infinity of your
favours. These I would
endeavour here to summe
up, were I not deterred
from the attempt by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility,
and your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
Nature, to which
<pb facs="9"/>
nothing is more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing,
than thankes
for an old Benefit, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more pleasing,
than the conferring of
a new. I choose there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rather to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
of Ingratitude,
than of offending your
Ladishippe, whose
service next to that
of GOD, I justly
glory in, it being the
<pb facs="10"/>
onely Honour now
left,</p>
   <closer>
