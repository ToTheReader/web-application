   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>LATO</hi> saith, there was in old time an Oracle giuen vnto the <hi>Greekes,</hi> that they should double the Altar in the Temple of <hi>Delos</hi> (which was a peece of worke for an excellent <hi>Geometritian</hi> to performe, that had the very habit, and perfection of the Arte) but it was not there literally meant, (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Symposiaques</hi> hath expounded) that they should do so indeed, but thereby they were iniointed to study <hi>Geometry,</hi> to the end they might be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any peece of worke of as great consequence. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> offered sacrifice to the Gods, to know, when two figures are giuen, how to finde a third equall to the first, and semblable to the latter. Both which are strong arguments, inuincible proofes, and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding authorities, as well of the necessity to obtaine, as of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in obtaining the Art. The remembrance whereof, (kinde reder) hath oftentimes solicited me to make good my promise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted in my <hi>Geodeticall Staffe,</hi> concerning the publishing of my <hi>Topographical Glasse,</hi> which hauing now accomplished, there remaines nothing more, but to craue a kind acceptance, and fauourable construction: so shall you shake off that viscosious filth of ingratitude, which so much conglomerates the heart of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious: for the poyson of malice being once fostered in mens breasts without resistance, buddeth forth daily more malignant fruits, whereby men run <hi>a malo in peius,</hi> as the fish out of the pan into the fire: it is vaine then to begge applaudites of such, for Ruby stones are not found in flinty rockes nor redolent flowers amongst rough thystles. A corrupt stomacke yeeldeth no sweet breath, and
<pb facs="4"/>an enuious minde seldome due praise. Arte may checke, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n t quite change what nature c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ssion of hatred. Leauing them therefore, let vs direct our speech to the beneuolent reader, and kinde expositor, that wrings no sence to ambiguities, that wrests no saying to am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibologies, that seekes no euersion of the word, nor auersion of the worke, that vrgeth no dissention in the methode, or dissipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the matter, but aimes to get benefite by his reading, and to yeeld thankes for the writing, imbracing that which yeelds profit, and reiecting all which is impertinent, that receiuing a rose, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes a Hyacinth▪ to such do I commend this <hi>Topographicall Glasse,</hi> as a pure transparent Christall, wherin he may see a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of art like pleasures, and delightfull conclusions, performed by the methode of diuers instruments, as by the <hi>Glasse,</hi> by the <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitus</hi> by the <hi>Plaine Table,</hi> and by the <hi>Circumferentor,</hi> by all which shalt thou bee seuerally taught to describe Countries and Kingdomes to make Mappes of new discoueries, to plat Mannors, Lordships, or Townes, to measure parkes, pastures, or inclosures, and that after diuers new wayes. Also here are you taught to seeke the distance of Townes, the height of Turrets, to conuey waters, to plant Cities and houses, to plat buildings, and to measure all k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>imber Stone, Piramides, Columnes, Cones, Spheares, Globes, and such like, in a methode differing from any heretofore publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: so that if you haue any good Geometricall instrument alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, sure also hast thou the vse thereof; or if thou want, heere art thou instructed to make the same according to thy affection: for I seeke to tye none to my owne particular humor: then might I haue referred them vnto my <hi>Geodeticall Staffe.</hi> But happily some will say if there were sufficient instrumēts before, then what needeth these new inuentions? would wee haue our owne wits more excellent then our predecessors. Of such and such like, I fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb facs="4"/>enquire if Antiquity bee onely Mistresse of this faculty, if moderne wits may intimate or exhibite nought vnto the world; if we must only beleeue what is set downe, without contradiction, should that bee so? how farre had this age beene from the perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ct Idea of the Art, whose excellency turneth euery heart after the same as the <hi>Heliotropion</hi> after the Sun? into what an intricate Laborinth of cōfused errors had we run? The most ancient Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were as contrary in their sects, as erronious in their opiniōs, till time brought in Truth, truth Knowledge, and Knowledge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Vnderstanding; what a nūber of sects had we? as <hi>Catonians, Peripatitians, Academians,</hi> and <hi>Epicurians. Anaximander</hi> said the earth was like a columne. <hi>Anaximenes</hi> flat, <hi>Leucippus</hi> like a Drum, <hi>Democrites</hi> like a platter; till <hi>Thales</hi> demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to be round. How grossely did they differ about the Tides? some referring the cause to riuers falling from the mountaine <hi>Gaule,</hi> entring the Atlantique sea, as <hi>Tymeus:</hi> Some to a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of certaine waters, as <hi>Plato:</hi> Some to the Sunne drawing the winds vpon the Ocean which caused the Atlantique seas to swell, as <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> till <hi>Pytheas</hi> demonstrated the cause to bee in the increasing and decreasing of the Moone; whereby <hi>Homer</hi> said: <hi>I praise not my Ancesters for their knowledge, but for that they desired knowledge.</hi> But shaking off these old differēces, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the commodity of the <hi>Compasses, Sea-cards,</hi> and new <hi>Maps,</hi> &amp; of many other deuises &amp; engines, that haue beene lately set forth more beneficial then any heretofore, of which the old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers &amp; Mathem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>e.</hi> But my Pen shall not bee so much dismeasured to reproue ancient men▪ to the end to draw the glory to them that be present. Had we liued then we had knowne lesse then they, and were they liuing now, they would know more then we: euery thing hath his time,
<pb facs="5"/>before it come to maturity: neither doth nature alot like time to euery like action: some things grow to perfection in a moment, when others require a moneth. The Beare bringeth forth in foure weekes, when the Dolphin hath neere <hi>40.</hi> when one fruite faileth, another entreth into season: we must first inuent, next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and lastly perfect: the furtherance of which perfection it behoueth euery louer of the Science to cherish, which is here freely offered vnto thy view, though it might haue beene vndertaken (I confesse) by some one of more experience: but he that most can, least will, and he that worst may, holds the candle: else the world must walke in darknesse. There be many say, the instruments be vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and this or that is better: but none seeketh to reforme the same, &amp; contriue one that shall do best: the professors themselues cry out at the erros, but seeke no reformation of the fault: so that it fareth with this, as in the ciuill actions of the life, euery man curseth excesse, yet none liue temperately: euery man praiseth pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, yet none will suffer euery man blameth sloth, yet none will take paines: euery one exclaimeth on enuy, yet none leaue emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating. But to remit this, and speake something of the application of Instruments.</p>
   <p>He then that will be seene in the knowledge of Geometricall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, must learne by contemplation, to frame his proposition, and by action to manage his instrument: for I know diuers great Scholers, deeply seene in the Theoricall part, though in the actiue, meere nouices: which is a cause that such, so learned, were neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to correct and amend many defects. For as meditation cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth ability to vnderstand, so action bringeth dexterity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, because the euent of the worke is illustrated by a precise obseruation, as the life of the proposition is illuminated by a plaine demonstration: for as points found lines, lines surfoces, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces bodies, so good instruments produce true obseruations, true obseruations Symmetricall figures, and the superficiall capacity of proposed platformes. And as lines bound figures, so hedges bound inclosures: and angles in the field are created by the meting of hedges, as they be in figures by the section of lines: for you shall
<pb facs="5"/>know that all instruments, of what kinde soeuer, if they cannot obserue the precise quantitity of the angle, their worke is errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous: for though some instruments expresse the quantity of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, as the <hi>Theodelitus. &amp;c.</hi> and others regard not the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, producing angles <hi>Homogeneall,</hi> as the <hi>Plaine Table:</hi> yet, if you faile in the one or the other, your conclusion is error: for it is as great an absurdity if the angle <hi>Homogeneall Mechanicall</hi> delineated vpon the <hi>Plaine Table,</hi> Proue <hi>Heterogeneall,</hi> and accord not Symmetrially to the respondent angles in the field, as if with a graduated instrument you had falsly obserued the quā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity thereof: and therefore it is childish vanity, or at least selfe conceit, to go about to prefer the <hi>Plaine Table</hi> before a large gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated instrument, and I am perswaded all good Geometricians wil argue the same: though I verily beleeue it is possible to separate fire from heate, or the earth from the center, at turne the obstinate will of the ignorant: for vse and custome hath taken such roote in such, that it will hardly be supplanted. It sufficeth them, plaine men to haue an Instrument, for then they presume they bee <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometritians.</hi> Euery horse is not <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> yet he may be are one a iourney, though hee bee long and lame in performing it, and can hardly passe ouer a mountaine: but let euery man vse his will, and so I will mine heere, in saying no more at this time: onely wishing my selfe present to open any thing that the yong practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer shall doubt of.</p>
