   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is well ynough knowen,
that <hi>Ephesus</hi> was a Citie of
the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> renowmed for
many causes. And S. Luke
reporteth in the Actes, how
our Lord got himselfe a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
there by the seruice of S.
Paule, how the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

there, and what furtherance it had. As for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ee, I will touch nothing heere, but onely that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hich belongeth properly too the argument of the
Epistle. Saint Paule had taught the Ephesians
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he pure doctrine of the Gospell. And when he
was prisoner at Rome, perceyuing that they had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eede too bee confirmed, he wrate this Epistle too
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hem. In the three first Chapters he standeth
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>heefly vppon the prayzyng and magnyfying of
Gods grace. For in the beginning of the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>r,
after his greetings, he speaketh of Gods free
election, too the end they should knowe that they
were now called too the kingdome of heauen, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had bin predestinated vntoo lyfe before
they were borne. And heerin shineth foorth Gods
wonderfull mercy, that the sauing of our soules
commeth of Gods free adoption, as of the trew
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nd naturall welspring thereof. And forasmuch
as mens wittes are too weake to conceyue so hygh


<pb facs="15"/>
a secret: he prayeth God to inlighten the Ephes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
with the full knowledge of Christ.</p>
   <p>In the second Chapter, the better too set foorth
the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nesse of Gods grace, he putteth them in
rememberance how wretched they were till they
were called too Iesus Christ, by comparing their
present state, and their former state toogither. For
wee can neuer perceyue sufficiently how greatly
wee bee beholden too our Lord Iesus, nor consider
as becommeth vs how greate his benefyts are
towa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ds vs, except it bee layd afore vs on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
part, how wretched our state is without
him. Also he amplifyeth the matter new agein,
saying, that they had bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Gentiles and straungers
too the promises of eternall lyfe, which God had
made alonly too the Iewes.</p>
   <p>In the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rd Chapter he sheweth, that his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship
had bin apoynted peculiarly for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles,
too the intent that they who had bin straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
a long tyme, myght now bee graffed intoo the
people of God. And for bycause it was an vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
thing, and such a one as trubbled many
mens mynds with the newnesse therof: He calleth
it a secret, hidden from all tymes, saying neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
that the vttering of the same secret was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vntoo him. Towards the end he prayeth
God agein too giue the Ephesians the perfect and
lyuely knowledge of Iesus Christ, so as they may
not couet too knowe any other thing. By which
woords he not only goeth about too make the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians
acknowledge the greate number of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyts


<pb facs="15"/>
and gracious gifts that God had bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
them, and too shewe themselues thankfull for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> same, by yeelding themselues wholy vnto him:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> also intendeth rather too put them out of all
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> of their owne calling. For by all lykelyhood
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

      </gap>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>aint Paule was afrayd, least the false Apostles
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ould step in to trubble their fayth, by making th̄
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eleeue that they had bin but halfe instructed. For
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>heras they had bin Gentyles, and had newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eyued
the trew Christen doctrine: they had not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> the Ceremonies nor Circumcision spoken
of. But they that intended too bring the Lawe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> vre among the Christians, sayd, that all such as
were not consecrated too God by Circumsion,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ere vnholie. For it was their common song, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>one ought too bee reckened among the people of
God, which were not circumcysed: and that al the
Ceremonies commaunnded by Moyses, ought to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ee kept. And for that cause they spake euill of S.
Paule, for making Iesus Christ common too the
Gentyles, as well as too the Iewes, and affirmed
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>at his Apostleship was an vnhallowing of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eauenly doctrine, bycause he did after that sort of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
and set forth the couenant of grace to vncleane
people without any difference at all. Therfore too
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he end that the Ephesians bein assayled with such
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>launders, should not chaunge their mynds: he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ended
too giue them a remedie. And so, wheras
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n the one syde he telleth them so aduyzedly, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>heir being called to the Gospell, was for that they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ad bin chozen before the making of the world: he


<pb facs="16"/>
warneth them on the other syde, not too thinke
that the Gospell came too them by haphazard at
the apoyntment of men, or that it lyghted in their
lappes at aladuenture. For he telleth them, that
wheras Christ was preached too them: that prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
was nothing else than the vttering or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of Gods euerlasting determination. When
as he setteth the vnhapie plight of their former life
before their eyes, he therwithal putteth them in
mynd, that their getting out of so deepe a gulf, was
through the singular and woonderfull mercie of
God. And wheras he speaketh of the Apostleship
which was committed too him towards the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles:
he dooth it too strengthen them in the fayth
which they had once receyued, bycause their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ng
intoo the communion of Christes Church,
was wrought by the will of God. Neuerthelesse,
looke how many sentences heere be, so many war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
are there to chere vp the Ephesians to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
Gods bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>yts.</p>
   <p>In the fourth Chapter he descrybeth the meane
wherby our Lord gouerneth and maynteyneth
his Church: namely by the Gospell which is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by men. Wheruppon it foloweth, that that
is the verie full poynt of perfection, and that the
Churche cannot otherwyse bee kept vp vnappay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And therfore the Apostles meaning is, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
vntoo the Ephesians the ministerie, wherby
God reigneth among vs. Afterward he commeth
too speake of the fruts of preaching, that is to wit,
of innocencie, holinesse, and of all dewties of a


<pb facs="16"/>
Christen man. And he not onely teacheth what
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he lyues of Christians ought too bee in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
but also interlaceth particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
which concerne eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans peculiar calling
or vocation.</p>
