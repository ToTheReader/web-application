   <p>HOnor, is so much respected, and ador'd; that shee
hath a Temple erected to her, like a Goddesse;
a Virgine Priest consecrated to her (which is <hi>Eunomia,</hi>
or Lawe; since none should dare accesse to Honor,
but by Vertue; of which Lawe being the rule, must
needes be a chiefe) and a Herrald (call'd <hi>Phemis,</hi> or
Fame) to proclame her institutions, and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
To amplefie yet more the diuine graces of this Goddesse;
<hi>Plutus,</hi> (or Riches) being by <hi>Aristophanes,
Lucian. &amp;c.</hi> presented naturally blind, deformd, and
dull witted; is here by his loue of Honor, made see, made sightly,
made ingenious; made liberall: And all
this conuerted and consecrate to the most worthy cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebration
of these sacred Nuptialls; all issuing (to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the necessary application) from an honorable
Temple. &amp;c.
