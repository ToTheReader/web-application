      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is reported of the Philosopher <hi>Posidonius,</hi> that being once taken with a Disease so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as that the very Paine and Torture it put him to, made him ready to wring his Armes and crash his teeth together, for the very anguish of it: Notwithstanding he, thinking as it were to outbrave it with a proud Stoicall Patience, cries out, <hi>Nihil agis Dolor,</hi> &amp;c. Doe thy worst, Paine; yet will I never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that thou art an Evill.</p>
   <p>And doe wee not in like manner
<pb facs="3"/>
daily see, many brave spirited Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, so besotted with some, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps but Imaginary beauty, and so tormented with this folly of Love, as that both their Imagination is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, and their Iudgement also ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly corrupted; who, with this stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Philosopher, are so farre from seeking a cure for this their Malady, as that they will not be perswaded, that it is one: and therefore employ their whole study &amp; care, in chant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth Loves Encomiums, and the praises of their Mistresses, the sole cause of their Distemper.</p>
   <p>That therefore I might let these men see the grossenesse of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, &amp; withall discover the vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this Stoicall Opinion of theirs: (Although I professe my selfe to be rather <hi>Philologus</hi> then <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gophilus;</hi> and account him eloquent enough, that can but cloath his own
<pb facs="3"/>
conceptions with a bare naturall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression:) I have adventured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you with this litle Treatise, which is devoid of all Elegancy or Queintnesse of expression, as being composed by one that is a Professor of that Faculty, that the Prince of Latine Poets called a Mute one. Wherein you shall finde variety of Remedies of all sorts, for the cure of this the most frequent, and most dangerous Disease that both sexes are subject to; collected out of all kinds of Authors, both Physitians, Poëts, and Philosophers: that so you might have variety to delight you.</p>
   <q>Omne tulit punctum, qui miscuit utile dulci.</q>
   <p>The Reasons that moved me to write of this subject, after so many,
<pb facs="4"/>
and so learned Physitians that have done so before me, are chiefly Two. The first is, that being my selfe a Practitioner in Physicke, I found that most of them handled this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease of Love-Melancholy, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, as the other kindes of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholies and Madnesses; never shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precisely the cause and seat of this Malady: and that, both to the great prejudice of the Parties affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and also their own no small a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement and confusion, not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those effects, that they promise themselves, of their Physicall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions.</p>
   <p>The second reason that moved me to attempt this discourse, was, to confute the erroneous and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion of some Physitians, hereafter mentioned, who although they are Christians, the most of them, doe notwithstanding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<pb facs="4"/>
for the cure of this disease, Lust, and Fornication. But I doubt not, I shall sufficiently refute these men, in this ensuing discourse; and that by strong and evident reasons, both Naturall and Morall: and the rest I shall leave to Divines.</p>
