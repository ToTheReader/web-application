   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Ngenious Reader, in this subiect of Witch-craft
which I here present vnto thee, thou art not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
what obscuritie, difficultie, difference,
contrarietie and contradiction hath among Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
and learned men in all ages arisen. From
the effusion of generall ignorance, or superstitious blindnesse
herein, willing to withdraw the vulgar illusion; I haue inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
demonstratiuely to declare what portion of certainety in
such vncertainties, God and Nature hath destined &amp; allowed.
It is not any worth either arrogated vnto my self, or derogated
from others, but my studious desire and vehement affection in
this particular, together with some speciall experience &amp; paines
vpon diuers occurrents, &amp; occasions extraordinarily hapning,
that hath drawne me forth to offer my opinion as the widdowes
mite, more haply in good will, and harty affection, then in true
valew or deserued esteeme. If it may only giue occasion vnto a
more exquisite pensell, it is the heigth of my intention, and a
complete recompence of my indeuour. For this cause, and for
common easie reading and apprehension, I haue purposely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided,
and discontinued the smooth thrid of a continued labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
stile, and haue for the most part preferred and inserted a
plaine texture, of a more vulgar and carelesse phrase and word.
The enuious haply may cauill, that a Physicion out of his owne
supposed precincts, should rush into sacred lists, or enter vpon so
high points of Diuinitie, as by an vnauoidable intercurrence, do
<pb facs="5"/>
necessarily insert themselues in this proposed subiect. Diuinitie
it selfe doth herein answere them. In the theory of Theologie, it
is the duety and praise of euery man, to bee without curiositie
fruitfully exercised.</p>
   <p>For as touching matter of Diuinitie, as it falleth out, or is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
in the discourse of this small Treatise, I onely propound
such reasons and considerations therein, as in common are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
and commendable in euery Christian man, and therein
I doe neither vsurpingly controule others, nor controulingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
my selfe, but willingly submit vnto the graue censure and
dictature of the learned and reuerend Diuine. If therefore
(good Reader) I haue here published or communicated vnto
thee ought thankes-worthy, as it is by me freely intended vnto
thee; so let it not from me be vnfriendly extended by thee. If I
haue in ought erred, let it be thy praise and goodnes to make thy
vse thereof without abuse. If thou hast formerly thought amisse,
and doest here reade that is more right, bee not ashamed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
thy better knowledge. If thou list not to know, then
know, that truth shall iudge thee, and iustifie her selef without
thee.</p>
