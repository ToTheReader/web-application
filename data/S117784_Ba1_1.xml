This butter or fatt if it be dressed with Chamomil floures / is good for the diseases that are in the sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes / or the ache that is in partes full of sinowes. It is good to anoint thē withal y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> haue bene longe sicke in an agewe a litle before the fit come. It is good to laye to anye parte that acheth in the body: it is good for them that are werye / ether by great labor or w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> riding / so that it may be layd verye warme on with a hote hand / speciallye about the ioyntes / it will also ease the payne of the stone / somthing if the diseased place be anoynted therewith beyng hote. If ye make it of Dill / it doth also swage ache or payne that commeth of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy matter / and is good for all other thinges that Chamomill is good for / and specially for driuing awaye of the cold of an old agew / if the ridge bone be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed therewith as hote as the patient can suffer / an houre before the fit at the fire syde or in a hote bed. It is also good for swellinges and impostemes / and hardnes / and partely it helpeth a man to swete if a man be anointed ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with as hote as he can suffer / and so will y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> butter of Chamomil do lykewise / layd to after y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same maner. Ye may make a medicine with butter / and the floures of Lauander / as I taught you to make of the floures of Dill and Chamomill / and it wil be good for a cold sto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mache / for the head ach that commeth of cold / and for the ache of anye parte of the body that commeth of cold.</p>
