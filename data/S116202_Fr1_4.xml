this curious structure of words, serues but as the mother-of-pearle to enclose within it the pearle itself, which is the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Subiect</hi> there handled: For vnder his lines are briefly contayned most choaking and vnanswerable Arguments in defence of our Catholike Religion; since the materialls of this Treatise are indeede an abbreuiated draught of all chiefe Articles of Fayth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted betweene the Protestants and vs; branching itself forth into all those principall heads of proofes, which other more copious bookes doe at large vnfoulde: So as the huge and learned Volumes euen of <hi>Cardinal Bellarm<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>uth, that (not spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of holie Scripture) <hi>so much doctrinal matter of Fayth, and so much Oratorie, deliuered in so high a key, we<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Now concerning the <hi>Translation</hi>: It is donne faythfully, &amp; wholy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the sense of the Authour, and is as litterall, as the Engli<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>h with anie elegancie (according to my shill) will well beare with the Latin: The same frame and forme of speach (I meane the same <hi>Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>,</hi> of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin) is precisely (as much as possibly may be) kept in the English. And though in the censure of manie it
<pb n="25" facs="13"/>
hath beene imagined, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish tongue would not well suite with so high a stile, and that (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps euen for this particular reason) this Worke hath beene forborne to be translated by anie English Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike; yet in my iudgement the English (after tryall once made, and good stoare of words at hand) doth euen in this poynt well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with the Latin, and is thereby rather much aduantaged &amp; graced, then preiudiced; And the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour is much eased herein, as hauing in a readines such curious moulds or frames of Elocution, to cast his matter in. This libertie I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue taken to my self, that (now &amp; then) where an English word of a more full signification, by way of a Metaphor or otherwise, doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, then the Latin affordeth (&amp;
<pb n="26" facs="14"/>
this some times falleth out not by reason of any defect of the Authour, but through the fullnes of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish) I make choyce of the said Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish word for the greater redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancie of the sense. In like sort (here and there, though rarely) I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted a word or two, to make the drift of the Authour to appeare more turgent and forcing in the English (and, thereby to begett a <hi>Pathos</hi> &amp; to moue the Reader, more fully) then the compendious short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Latin (being translated without anie addition) would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye. But now will anie illiterate <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teralist</hi> (who dwelleth only in the bare letter of the Latin) finde fault herewith? Yf any of that ranke doe carpe thereat, let that man know, I hould him to be ouer seruilly <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall,</hi> and to taste strongly of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danticall
<pb n="27" facs="14"/>
Scholarisme.</hi> My proceeding here, is most warrantable: For since <hi>Words</hi> are the images of the <hi>Notions</hi> of the Minde, why should we no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> lay on the fayrest coulours of speach, that our skill can afford, it being directed only to make the picture to appeare more liuelie? and that the <hi>Words</hi> may st<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ike the <hi>Imagination</hi> (and consequently the <hi>Will</hi>) more intensely? I euer here except, where the Subiect of the Translation is the <hi>sacred Writt</hi> of God, in the translating whereof a literal playnesse is the best Eloquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce; and want of Art, the chiefest Art; since this Subiect cannot brooke, either adding to, or taking from.</p>
   <p>I doe not here intimate the least touch, as if anie blemish were in the <hi>Autographon,</hi> or that it were possible
<pb n="28" facs="15"/>
for any Translation to equall it. No; silkes dyed (we euer see) do loose the glasse &amp; beautie of their primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue coulours; And <hi>Campian</hi> transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, much diminisheth the luster and grace of <hi>Campian</hi> in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
