   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN reading Subiect.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>IT is not to be doubted, nay there is nothing more sure (good Christian subiect) then that Sathan as he hath beene vsed to do euer of old, so he will still hold on, and busie himselfe to withdraw thee from the regarde of some, or of euery of these my before handled loyall subiects duties, and to trumpe in thy way by casting before thee many stumbling blocks, and causes of vndutifulnesse, thereby to cause thee to forget, or else to neglect, and omit these before noted sixe duties. Of the which causes of vndutifulnesse by that our mortall and deadly foe, very much and oftentimes suggested and vrged, I haue thought it good for thy learning and warning, to giue thee heere a taste of sixe of thē in this little Pamphlet following, whereby thou maiest take a scantling of the residue, and so be thereby the better awaked and more excited, to beware of them all in time.</hi>
