      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no treasure so much enriches the minde of man as learning; there is no learning so proper for the direction of the life of man as Histore; there is no historie (I speake onelie of profate) so well worth the reading as Tacitus. For learning nature acknowledgeth a reason, by leauing industrie to finish her vnperfect worke: for without learning the conceyte is like a fruitefull soyle without tilling, the memorie like a storehouse without wares, the will like a shippe without a rudder. For Historie, since we are eassier taught by example thē by precept, what studie can profit vs so much, as that which giues vs patternes either to follow or to flye,, of the best and worst men of all estates, cuntries, and times that euer were? For Tacitus I may say without partiality, that hee hath writen the most matter with best conceyt in fewest wordes of anie Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher ancient or moderne. But he is harde. <hi>Difficilia quae pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chra:</hi> the second reading ouer will please thee more then the first, and the third then the second. And if thy stomacke be so tender as thou canst not disgest Tacitus in his owne stile, thou art beholding to Sauile, who giues thee the same foode, but with a pleasant and easie taste. In these fower bookes of the storie thou shalt see all the miseries of a torne and declining state: The Empire vsurped; the Princes murthered; the people wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering; the souldiers tumultuous; nothing vnlawfull to him that hath power, and nothing so vnsafe as to bee securely inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. In Galba thou maiest learne, that a good Prince gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by euill ministers is as dangerous as if hee were euill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. By Otho, that the fortune of a rash man is <hi>Torrenti simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> which rises at an instant, and falles in a moment. By Vitel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, that he that hath no vertue can neuer bee happy: for by his owne basenesse hee will loose all, which eyther fortune, or other mens labours haue cast vpon him. By Vespasian, that in ciuill tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults an aduised patience, and opportunitie well taken are the onelie weapons of aduantage. In them all, and in the state of Rome vnder them thou m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>iest see the calamities that follow ciuill warres, where lawes l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="4"/> by the sworde. If thou mislike their waires be thankfull for thine owne peace; if thou doest abhorre their tyrannies, loue and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thine owne wise, iust, and excelent Prince. If thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est detest their Anarchie, acknowledge our owne happie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and thanke god for her, vnder whom England en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyes as manie benefites, as euer Rome did suffer miseries vnder the greatest Tyrant.</p>
