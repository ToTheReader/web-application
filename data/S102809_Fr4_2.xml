      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat any Christian, how meane so euer, should in sincerity loue the Lord Iesus, his word and Saints, it is a very, nay the onely good thing: but it is both good and rare, when persons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by birth and blood, by great place and rancke in the common wealth, set their hearts vnfainedly to seeke God. For it is written, Not many mighty, not many noble are called; and yet such by the example of their zeale, prouoke many: as iniquitie when it accompanieth persons of authority, doth much more hurt, then if it be foūd in a priuate person: so godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in eminent persons is more powerfull
<pb facs="123"/> to draw others the more to like and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after. This was well seene in you (right worshipfull) when ye were our neighbours at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and did go before your inferiours in diligent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent hearing of the word, not onely at that time, but euer since the assemblies haue beene more frequented. The expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience whereof, as also of your speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to my poore selfe, both then in time of my best peace, and afterward in my soul sorrow and trouble, wherin ye appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued your selues towards me (as did some others) rather as parents then friends, (though I neuer durst looke for so much as your friendship, when I looked vpon my selfe so farre inferiour, so farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy) hath moued me to dedicate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you (till some better thing bee ready) this short Sermon, as some fruit of a thankefull mind: accept, read, consider, apply, practise, perseuere, that the God of trueth and mercie may crowne you in a blessed immortality.</p>
