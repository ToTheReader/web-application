   <head>¶ A CERTAINE MAN wisheth to all Christians the health and peace of our Lord IESVS CHRIST.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE question of the Supper of IESVS CHRIST,</hi> and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Thankesgiuing, hath brought foorth to vs, aboue other things, a cruel and pernitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. For the other Authors of sects, <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Suencfeldians,</hi> be neither lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nor of our family. But this is a ciuill and domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call euill, a bloody and deadly wound hidden in our bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. Surely it is a lamentable and horrible matter, that the thing which was first instituted for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mens minds in loue, and concord, and fellowship of the body of Christ, which is the Church, is now wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to variance, and confusion. And if there haue bene any good in this broile, it hath bene in the silence and sorrow of good and learned men: of whom aswell the misliking sheweth that there is somewhat in both parts that might be amended, and prayer and earnest desire may percase somewhat obtaine at Gods hand, that contention taken away, the agreement of minds may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ioyne in one. But this booke which is made tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb facs="4"/>
this question, whose soeuer it bee, sure it seemeth to be the worke of a good, learned and modest man, and one that hath bene long, much, and well exercised in the Monuments of our Fathers and Elders. Neither doeth it moue mee, that he would not be named; for because there is no bitter word in this disputation, and he doth reason of the matter learnedly, well, and truely, neither doth seeme willing to craue thankes at mens hands, nor to haue taken this Treatie in hand, either for desire of praise or greedines of Honour, but to be mooued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the common sorrow and hurt, to make an entry to that thing, the which many men greatly desiring the peace of Christs Church, haue wished with earnest and continuall prayers: namely, the remembrance of the Christian peace, and the forgetting of deuilish debate.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Bucer,</hi> whom I with honour speake of and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance sake, had found and made a way to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and there was great agreement of minds betweene him and <hi>Luther:</hi> and hee pacified the Churches of the <hi>Heluetians,</hi> and while hee liued there was peace and quietnesse: but when they were both dead, beholde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine bitter bookes on both sides. And surely they be to be pardoned which write vnwillingly: but those which without cause haue renued this wound, (if there be any such) these surely seeme to me little to feare what men iudge of them, or to esteeme the peace which Christ gaue and left vnto vs. But I returne to this Booke, which pleaseth me best aboue other in this kinde of argument; not, that I will altogether allow it to the Congregation,
<pb facs="5"/>
but because it seemeth to come neerest to the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of this contention. For which cause he that cannot inuent a better, if he be not content with this, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not defend his owne, let him take heed that hee doe not that for mans sake, which he ought to leaue vndone for Christes cause: namely, that he nourish not contention, which is the greatest enemie the Church can haue. I see nothing concluded in this disputation, that either is repugnant from the nature of our Religion, or not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably ynough spoken of this so great &amp; singuler my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie; both which things if both the parts had retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or followed, we should haue had quietnesse long ere this. I blame neither part, I beare good will to both, I loue both. And if that were done in writing that is done, and that of many, with good conscience in the leading of our life, and retaining and esteeming the friends on both sides, men should both haue written and disputed of this question on both sides, with lesse offence and bitternesse. But now wee write in such sort, as though wee did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the persons, and not the cause, and apply the trueth of the cause, not to the ordinance of Christ, but to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of men. Iesus Christ restore to vs his peace, which he gaue and left vnto vs when hee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hence, which we haue lost by these our contentions: Iesus Christ, I say, whose Victory, Triumph, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Praise, and Glory, be for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
