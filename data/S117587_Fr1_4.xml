      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was euer the craft and subtilty of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> but much more of the <hi>Apostates</hi> and <hi>Heretickes,</hi> when they deadly hated and persecuted the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Christians,</hi> and specially Gods <hi>Priests,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the guides, and Pastors of that Flocke, they sought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy) to sound their disgraces into credulous eares, and charge them of disloialty towards their Prince and Magistrate, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make them odious to their Princes, and hatefull to the Common-wealth.</p>
   <p>So did that Magitian of Aegipt, least his deceipts should haue beene impugned by the Christians, accuse them before the Emperour
<hi>Valerian,</hi> who (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> doth report) was so fauourable to the Catholick Christians, in the beginning of his raigne, that he would not permit any person should wrong them. So did some wicked persons about the Emperour <hi>Aurelian,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke him to persecute the Christians generally throughout all the confines of his Empire; who notwithstanding had most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly (as appeareth by the Writings of <hi>Eusebius ad Orosius</hi>) vsed them in the first sixe yeares of his raigne. So was holy <hi>Athanasius</hi> brought before the Arrian Emperours and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and accused of <hi>Nigromancie, Adulterie,</hi> and <hi>Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie.</hi> So was the Clergie condemned to death, and exile vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <pb facs="3"/>

      <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, vnder pretence of diuers crimes, and namely of sedition falsly forged against them. So did the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> being Heretickes, extreamely plague the Catholickes in <hi>Affrick,</hi> accusing them that they had secret conference by Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, and Letters with the
<hi>Romanes</hi> against them. And by this meanes did the Emperesse
<hi>Theodora,</hi> a woman of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichian</hi> heresie, cruelly persecute the Pope <hi>Siluerius,</hi> and the Clergie, vnder the colour of some Letters intercepted by her Councell, whereby the Catholick Christians should haue called in the <hi>Gothes</hi> &amp; forraigne powers, to inuade the Citie of Rome and the Empire.</p>
   <p>Yet this shamefull subtilty and crafty deceipt, was neuer so notoriously vsed by the <hi>Pagans,</hi> the <hi>Arrians,</hi> the
<hi>Gothes,</hi> the <hi>Vandals,</hi> the <hi>Lumbards,</hi> the
<hi>Donatists,</hi> &amp;c. as in the late persecutions and practises of Protestant Ministers, especially in <hi>England</hi> against the
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> in their Pamphlets and Pulpits, vrging the State to suppresse them with death, seuere exilements, and edicts, as if they had beene so many <hi>Catilines</hi> towards their <hi>Senate,</hi> and so many <hi>Absolons</hi> towards their <hi>Dauid.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The long time of our persecution: the number of them that were afflicted: the diuersity of their rankes and qualities, and their humours and dispositions: the perpetuity and variety of temptations and tribulations: the infinite indignities suffered by the mercilesse searching and robbing of Purseuants, Promoters, Informers, and such needy Officers (who cared not by whose fall they rose) (not hauing deserts or other degrees to clime to <pb facs="4"/> the height of their ambition.) We passed thorough for so many yeares; if they had fallen out among any other constitution of men then <hi>Catholiks,</hi> they might haue wrung (very probably) out of men well mortified, and patient, some action of dislike and discontentment, seeing <hi>Tristia pro virtute tollerare,</hi> to endure heauy things for vertues sake is a point hard to be practised. But yet neuerthelesse, what hath beene our fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity towards our Prince, and behauiour towards our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, with all humility, respect, modesty, and subiection? euer either readily doing what they enioyned, or patiently suffering what they imposed; <hi>Fiant inimici nostri Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> Let our enemies be our Iudge therein: and let the Roles, Registers, and Recordes speake. The true reason whereof was the doctrine, for by the Religion which we professe, we are taught, that we must obey our Princes <hi>Non propter itam, sed propter conscientiam,</hi> not for any indignation, but for conscience sake; and that to resist them, is to resist Gods ordinances. And this is the bit and bridle that euery true Catholicke carieth in his mouth, to restraine him from that by grace and feare of Gods iudgements, which flesh and bloud otherwise with the liuely sence and feeling of insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable miseries and afflictions, might driue him vnto.</p>
   <p>And if some of vs, forgetting our best fortunes at home, did flie from the storme of persecution, into a place of refuge, (taking such helpes as the charity of other Countries affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) and there perfected in the course of vertue and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, returned into <hi>England:</hi> our onely intent was (as <pb facs="5"/> heauen and earth shall witnesse with vs at the dreadfull day of Doome) to win soules from misbeliefe, and with the sweat of our browes (yea of our dearest bloud) to gleane a fewe eares, the silly reliques of their infortunate Haruest, who had misled infinite soules into endlesse perdition. Alas, what is <hi>Priesthood</hi> now, that was not in former times? that it must be accounted in these our dayes
<hi>treacherous,</hi> which hath euer beene reputed both in Parliament, and else-where, the most honourable calling next to the Prince, as the places of our great Priests and Archbishops beare euidence? Nothing is or can be changed in that <hi>Sacrament:</hi> howsoeuer, the mindes and proceedings of Protestants doe change. Neither did or doth the Pope or any other Bishop by making vs Priests, claime or get any more authority in <hi>England;</hi> then they of <hi>Geneua</hi> or <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Protestant Ministers. And as for oathes and promises in receiuing holy <hi>Orders,</hi> wee neither take nor plight any but one common to the <hi>Priests</hi> of all Nations, which is a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vow of perpetuall chastity, a thing rather pleasant then offensiue to vertuous mindes. But Gods true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being abandoned out of our miserable Countrey through our sinnes, the honour of God, and reuerent respect of his sacred <hi>Priests</hi> was gone withall: and in steed of Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Prerogation graunted to them by diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Lawes, they haue beene most subiect to iniuries, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, contempt, and calumnies, of all conditions and states of the Realme. But if the glorious Doctor St. <hi>Augustine <pb facs="5"/> Epist.
212.</hi> might haue beene heard, these imputations had not receiued such credit against them: for thus he saith to <hi>Pancarius</hi> an Officer, and honourable person, before whom a certaine Priest named
<hi>Secundarius</hi> was accused of a great crime. <hi>Quod videntur obiicere Presbitero, &amp;c. The crime wherewith they change their Priest, must be looked vnto, so alwayes if those that be his accusers be Catholickes: for against a Catholick Priest wee neither can, nor ought to admit the accusation of Heretickes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But seeing it now pleaseth our gracious <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> to consider our estate, and with the eyes of his Peerelesse cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie to looke vpon vs so long, and so dangerous sicke (of the late
<hi>Queenes</hi> euill) whom no Physick can cure, but the sacred hands of his annoynted <hi>Maiestie,</hi> nor no <hi>Salue</hi> can heale, but the soueraine <hi>Balme</hi> of his renowned clemencie; And so to qualifie our former pressours, permitting vs <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edere buccellam nostram sine dolore,</hi> to put a bit of meate into our mouthes without sorrow, without frights, without flights, and without circumuentions of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries.</p>
   <p>Wherefore most Honorable, Reuerend, Graue, and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Patrones</hi> (for I doe presume to challenge this title at your hands) vouchsafe to assist now our gracious Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne in this his Royall disposition, and call to minde your Predecessours, who (being Religious, wise, learned, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, and discreete, and therefore dignified by our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes <pb facs="6"/> Catholick Progenitours) did leaue you to succeede them not onely in their sincerity of Iustice, and fidelity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Princes, but likewise in their Religion towards God: The law of nature, the law of Nations, the law of <hi>England</hi> it selfe (in that state it is) requireth it; the law of God calleth vpon you, and bringeth euidence of this your obligation; your promise to God, to his Church, when you were first borne bindeth you: So many of your noble compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie as are admitted to the Honourable Order of the <hi>Garter,</hi> haue (or ought to haue) sworne it: you are all Councellours or Officers to his Maiestie, which by title of inheritance, and at his Coronation, by the Oath and Fidelity of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Prince, hath obliged himselfe to maintaine it: of that which is his office, your places professe performance; your promise to God, obedience and voluntary submission to his Church, fidelity to Prince, duty to Countrey, compassion to the vniust oppressed daily call vpon you to see it done.</p>
   <p>Pardon Noble <hi>Patrons,</hi> if peremptorily without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception I demaund but iustice by the present forcible Lawes of
<hi>England.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Who, for his better satisfaction, desireth to see these ensuing points at length: then reade that most worthy and laborious Treatise, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:</hi> The Protestants Apologie for the Romane Church.</p>
