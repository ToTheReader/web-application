   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ias the wyse man came to Cresus the ryche
kyng, on a tyme, when he was makynge newe
shyppes, purposyng to haue subdued by water
the out yles lying betwixt Grece and Asia mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor:
What newes now in Grece, saith the king
to Bias? None other newes, but these, sayeth
Bias: that the yles of Grece haue prepared a wonderful com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panye
of horsemen, to ouerrun Lydia withall. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
vnder heauen, sayth the kynge, that I woulde so soone
wisshe, as that they durst be so bolde, to mete vs on the lande
with horse. And thinke you sayeth Bias, that there is anye
thyng which they wolde sooner wysshe, then that you shulde
be so fonde, to mete them on the water with shyppes? And so
Cresus hearyng not the true newes, but perceyuyng the wise
mannes mynde and counsell, both gaue then ouer makyng of
his shyppes, and left also behynde him a wonderful example
for all commune wealthes to folowe: that is euermore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
and set most by that thing whervnto nature hath made
them moost apt, and vse hath made them moost fitte.</p>
   <p>By this matter I meane the shotyng in the long bowe, for
English men: which thyng with all my hert I do wysh, and if
I were of authoritie, I wolde counsel all the gentlemen and
yomen of Englande, not to chaunge it with any other thyng,
how good soeuer it seme to be: but that styll, accordyng to the
oulde wont of England, youth shulde vse it for the moost ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
pastyme in peace, that men myght handle it as a mooste
sure weapon in warre. Other stronge weapons whiche bothe
experience doth proue to be good, and the wysdom of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
Maiestie &amp; his counsel prouydes to be had, are not ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to take away shotyng: but y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> both, not compared togither,
whether shuld be better then the other, but so ioyned togither
that the one shoulde be alwayes an ayde and helpe for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
myght so strengthen the Realme on all sydes, that no
kynde of enemy in any kynde of weapon, myght passe and go
beyonde vs.</p>
   <p>For this purpose I, partelye prouoked by the counsell of
some gentlemen, partly moued by the loue whiche I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
borne towarde shotyng, haue wrytten this lytle trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
<pb facs="5"/>
wherin if I haue not satisfyed any man, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap> he wyll
the rather be content w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> my doyng, bycause I am (I suppose)
the firste, whiche hath sayde any thynge in this matter (and
fewe begynnynges be perfect, sayth wyse men) And also by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
yf I haue sayed a misse, I am content that any man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende
it, or yf I haue sayd to lytle, any man that wyl to adde
what hym pleaseth to it.</p>
   <p>My minde is, in profitynge and pleasynge euery man, to
hurte or displease no man, intendyng none other purpose, but
that youthe myght be styrred to labour, honest pastyme, and
vertue, and as much as laye in me, plucked from ydlenes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftie
games, and vice: whyche thing I haue laboured on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
in this booke, she wynge howe fit shootyng is for all kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of men, howe honest a pastyme for the mynde, howe hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
an excercise for the bodye, not vile for great men to vse,
not costlye for poore men to susteyne, not lurking in holes and
corners for ill men at theyr pleasure, to misvse it, but abiding
in the open sight &amp; face of the worlde, for good men if it fault
by theyr wisdome to correct it.</p>
   <p>And here I woulde desire all gentlemen and yomen, to vse
this pastime in suche a mean, that the outragiousnes of great
gamyng, shuld not hurte the honestie of shotyng, which of his
owne nature is alwayes ioyned with honestie: yet for mennes
faultes oftentymes blamed vnworthely, as all good thynges
haue ben, and euermore shall be.</p>
   <p>If any man woulde blame me, eyther for takynge such a
matter in hande, orels for writing it in the Englyshe tongue,
this answere I maye make hym, that whan the beste of the
realme thinke it honest for them to vse, I one of the meanest
sorte, ought not to suppose it vile for me to write: And though
to haue written it in an other tonge, had bene bothe more pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fitable
for my study, and also more honest for my name, yet I
can thinke my labour wel bestowed, yf w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> a litle hynderaunce
of my profyt and name, maye come any fourtheraunce, to the
pleasure or commoditie, of the gentlemen and yeomen of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande,
for whose sake I tooke this matter in hande. And as
for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Latin or greke tonge, euery thyng is so excellently done
in them, that none can do better: In the Englysh tonge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
euery thinge in a maner so meanly, bothe for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and handelynge, that no man can do worse. For therin the
least learned for the moste parte, haue ben alwayes moost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
<pb facs="5"/>
to wryte. And they whiche had leaste hope in latin, haue
bene moste boulde in englyshe: when surelye euery man that
is moste ready to taulke, is not moost able to wryte. He that
wyll wryte well in any tongue, muste folowe thys councel of
Aristotle, to speake as the cōmon people do, to thinke as wise
men do: and so shoulde euery man vnderstande hym, and the
iudgement of wyse men alowe hym. Many English writers
haue not done so, but vsinge straunge wordes as latin, french
and Italian, do make all thinges darke and harde. Ones I
communed with a man whiche reasoned the englyshe tongue
to be enryched and encreased therby, sayinge: Who wyll not
prayse that feaste, where a man shall drinke at a diner, bothe
wyne, ale and beere? Truely quod I, they be all good, euery
one taken by hym selfe alone, but if you putte Maluesye and
sacke, read wyne and white, ale and beere, and al in one pot,
you shall make a drynke, neyther easie to be knowen, nor yet
holsom for the bodye. Cicero in folowyng I focrates, Plato
and Demosthenes, increased the latine tounge after an other
sorte. This waye, bycause dyuers men y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> write, do not know,
they can neyther folowe it, bycause of theyr ignorauncie, nor
yet will prayse it, for verye arrogauncie, ii. faultes, seldome
the one out of the others companye.</p>
   <p>Englysh writers by diuersitie of tyme, haue taken diuerse
matters in hande. In our fathers tyme nothing was red, but
bookes of fayned cheualrie, wherin a man by redinge, shuld
be led to none other ende, but onely to manslaughter and bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye.
Yf any man suppose they were good ynough to passe the
time with al, he is deceyued. For surelye vayne woordes doo
woorke no smal thinge in vayne, ignoraunt, and younge min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
specially yf they be gyuen any thynge thervnto of theyr
owne nature. These bokes (as I haue heard say) were made
the moste parte in Abbayes, and Monasteries, a very lickely
and fit fruite of suche an ydle and blynde kinde of lyuynge.</p>
   <p>In our tyme nowe, whan euery manne is gyuen to knowe
muche rather than to liue wel, very many do write, but after
suche a fashion, as very many do shoote. Some shooters take
in hande stronger bowes, than they be able to mayntayne.</p>
   <p>This thyng maketh them sūmtyme, to outshoote the marke,
sūmtyme to shote far wyde, and perchaunce hurte sūme that
looke on. Other that neuer learned to shote, nor yet knoweth
good shafte nor bowe, wyll be as busie as the best, but suche
<pb facs="6"/>
one cōmonly plucketh do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ne a syde, and crafty archers which
be agaynst him, will be bothe glad of hym, and also euer rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
to laye and bet with him: it were better for suche one to sit
doune than shote. Other there be, whiche haue verye good
bowe and shaftes, and good knowlege in shootinge, but they
haue bene brought vp in suche euyl fauoured shootynge, that
they can neyther shoore fayre, nor yet nere. Yf any man wyll
applye these thynges togyther, shal not se the one farre differ
from the other.</p>
   <p>And I also amonges all other, in writinge this lytle trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
haue folowed sūme yonge shooters, whiche bothe wyll
begyn to shoote, for a lytle moneye, and also wyll vse to shote
ones or twise about the marke for nought, afore they beginne
a good. And therfore did I take this litle matter in hande, to
assaye my selfe, and hereafter by the grace of God, if the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
of wyse men, that looke on, thinke that I can do any
good, I maye perchaunce caste my shafte amonge other, for
better game.</p>
   <p>Yet in writing this booke, some man wyll maruayle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce,
why that I beyng an vnperfyte shoter, shoulde take
in hande to write of makyng a perfyte archer: the same man
peraduenture wyll maruayle, howe a whettestone whiche is
blunte, can make the edge of a knife sharpe: I woulde y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same
man shulde consider also, that in goyng about anye matter▪
there be .iiii. thinges to be considered, doyng, saying, thinking
and perfectnesse: Firste there is no man that doth so wel, but
he can saye better, or elles summe men, whiche be now starke
nought, shuld be to good: Agayne no man can vtter wyth his
tong, so wel as he is able to imagin with his minde, &amp; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectnesse
it selfe is farre aboue all thinking. Than seing that
saying is one steppe nerer perfectenesse than doyng, let euery
man leue maruaylyng why my woorde shall rather expresse,
than my dede shall perfourme perfecte shootinge.</p>
   <p>I truste no man will be offended with this litle booke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte
it be sūme fletchers and bowiers, thinking hereby that
manye that loue shootynge shall be taughte to refuse suche
noughtie wares as they woulde vtter. Honest fletchers and
bowyers do not so, and they that be vnhonest, oughte rather
to amende them selues for doinge ill, than be angrie with me
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>o: sayinge wel. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> fletcher hath euen as good a quarell to be

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> archer that refuseth an ill shaft, as a bladesmith
<pb facs="6"/>
hath to a fletcher y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> forsaketh to bye of him a noughtie knyfe:
For as an archer must be content that a fletcher know a good
shafte in euery poynte for the perfecter makynge of it, So an
honeste fletcher will also be content that a shooter knowe a
good shafte in euery poynt for the perfiter vsing of it: bicause
the one knoweth like a fletcher how to make it, the other kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>weth
lyke an archer howe to vse it. And seyng the knowlege
is one in them bothe, yet the ende diuerse, surely that fletcher
is an enemye to archers and artillery, whiche can not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that an archer knowe a shafte as well for his vse in sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge,
as he hym selfe shoulde knowe a shafte, for hys ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage
in sellynge. And the rather bycause shaftes be not
made so muche to be solde, but chefely to be vsed. And seynge
that vse and occupiyng is the ende why a shafte is made, the
making as it were a meane for occupying, surely the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
in euery poynte of a good shafte, is more to be required in
a shooter than a fletcher.</p>
   <p>Yet as I sayde before no honest fletcher wil be angry with
me, seinge I do not teache howe to make a shafte whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
onelye to a good fletcher, but to knowe and handle a
shafte, which belongeth to an archer. And this lytle booke I
truste, shall please and profite both partes: For good bowes
and shaftes shall be better knowen to the cōmoditie of al sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and good shotyng may perchaunce be the more occupied
to the profite of all bowyers and fletchers. And thus I praye
God that all fletchers getting theyr lyuynge truly, and al ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
vsynge shootynge honestly, and all maner of men
that fauour artillery, maye lyue continuallye in
healthe and merinesse, obeying theyr
prince as they shulde, and louing
God as they ought, to whom
for al thinges be al ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and glorye for
euer. Amen
