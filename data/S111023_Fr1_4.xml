   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F the little Ant, &amp; the sillie Bee
seek by their diligence the good
of their Commonwealth; much
more ought Man. If they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the drones and sting them
steales their labour; then blame
not Man. Little hony hath that hiue, where there
are more Drones then Bees: and miserable is that
Land, where more are idle then well imployed.
If the indeauours of those vermin be acceptable,
I hope mine may be excuseable; Though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
it were more proper for mee, To be doing
what I say, then writing what I knowe. Had I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
rich, I could not haue erred: Now hauing
onely such fish as came to my net, I must be taxed.
But, I would my taxers were as ready to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
their purse<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, as I, purse, life, and all I haue:
or as diligent to furnish the charge, as I know they
are vigilant to crop the fruits of my labours. Then
would I not doubt (did God please I might safely
arriue in <hi>New England,</hi> and safely returne) but to
<pb facs="5"/>
performe somewhat more then I haue promised,
&amp; approue my words by deeds, according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
   <p>I am not the first hath beene betrayed by Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats:
And foure men of warre, prouided as they
were, had beene sufficient to haue taken <hi>Sampson,
Hercules,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, no other way
furnisht then I was. I knowe not what assurance
any haue do passe the Seas, Not to bee subiect to
casualty as well as my selfe: but least this disaster
may hinder my proceedings, or ill will (by ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour)
the behoofefull worke I pretend; I haue
writ this little: which I did thinke to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
from any publike vse, till I had made my
returnes speake as much, as my pen now doth.</p>
   <p>But because I speake so much of fishing, if any
take mee for such a deuote fisher, as I dreame of
nought else, they mistake mee. I know a ring of
golde from a graine of barley, aswell as a golde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith:
and nothing is there to bee had which fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
doth hinder, but furder vs to obtaine. Now
for that I haue made knowne vnto you a fit place
for plantation, limited within the bounds of your
Patent and Commission; hauing also receiued
meanes, power, and authority by your directions,
to plant there a Colony, and make further search,
and discouery in those parts there yet vnknowne:
Considering, withall, first those of his Maiesties
Councell, then those Cities aboue named, and
diuerse others that haue beene moued to lend
<pb facs="5"/>
their assistance to so great a worke, doe expect (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
the aduenturers) the true relation or euent
of my proceedings which I heare are so abused; I
am inforced for all these respects, rather to expose
my imbecillitie to contempt, by the testimonie of
these rude lines, then all should condemne
me for so bad a Factor, as could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
giue reason nor account of
my actions and
designes.</p>
