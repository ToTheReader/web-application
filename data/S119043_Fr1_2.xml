and his singuler good Lord, the
Lorde Russell, Earle of Bedforde, one of the
Queenes maiestyes most honourable priuye coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
and Knighte of the honourable order of

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had first taken
in hande (righte honourable
and my singular good Lorde)
the translation of this worthy
and famous writer Flaui{us} Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius,
at the request of the
right worshipfull sir Edmōde
Brudenell knight: I thought I should haue had no
further labour, but that the sayd translatiō beinge
so diligently and plainlye handled according to the
authors meaning, as my simple wit and knowledge
could do it, should haue contented and satisfyed the
sayde sir Edmonde onelye for his owne priuate vse
and readinge. But he beinge a man alwayes studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
not so muche to pleasure himselfe, as to benefite
his countrye, and also desyrous to make all men par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of such commoditye, as he himselfe alone, or
a fewe besides him, mighte take by readinge of the
same: did afterwarde purpose to cause the sayde
<pb facs="3"/>
worke to be printed. And althoughe the rude and
simple translation thereof, mighte worthelye haue
withdrawen him from his sayde intente: yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
consideringe what profitable thinges are
therein contayned: how wyse and prudent counsels
for all gouernours and Captaynes are there decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
how expedient and necessary the knowledge of
these thinges may be for all times and seasons, and
especially for this our time wherein we now do liue:
he thoughte it better to cause the sayde worke to be
openlye set forth and published, although in a very
base and homelye stile, then that this worthye au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
whom not onlye the Italians, Almaines and
Frenchmē, but also many other Nations, haue most
diligentlye translated in their owne peculiar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
should any longer be hidde and kepte from
all his natiue countrye men: Geuinge thereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to such as shall thinke the sayd worke to home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
and baselye handled, being yet, as it were, but he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
out of the rough, to plane and polishe the same,
if they will be disposed more curiouslye, and to set it
forth with finer and purer eloquence. VVhiche
thinge so much the better may be done, that the Ise
is now cut vp before, and the way made open, which
at the first might seeme more harde and daūgerous
to passe. The weaker that any thing doth appeare,
the more expedient and necessarye it is to seeke for
<pb facs="3"/>
helpe and succour for the same: the more simple
that this translation is, the more neede it hath of
sure protection and defence. VVherefore when
as sir Edmonde Brudenell, the chiefe causer and
doer in settinge forth of this worke, had conferred
together with me as cōcerning the publishing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and had not yet determined to whom chiefelye it
might most conueniently be dedicated: your honour
amongest al others came to our remembraunce, for
manye and sundry causes, as most worthye of so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and passinge knowledge therein contained:
Not that these thinges maye seeme vnknowen to
your honour, but beinge ouerseene perused and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of the same, might more safely come abroade
and therby deserue the better fauour and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the Readers thereof: as allowed of him,
whose noble actes as wel within the Realme as with
out on euerye syde, haue alwayes from time to time
so well appeared. Pleaseth it your honour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to accept in good parte this homelye and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
worke, offered by vs of verye true and hartye
loue: on sir Edmondes behalfe, as a declaration of
the inwarde and vnfayned good will that he doth
beare towardes your honour: and on my behalfe as
a testimoniall both of like good will, and also of my
verye bounden dutye: which nowe manye yeares
latelye passed, haue receiued a liberall annuitye or
<pb facs="4"/>
stipende of your honoure, whereby I haue bene the
better able to expresse suche poore knowledge as
I had, or at least my good will, not onelye in setting
forth of this present worke, but also in that trade,
which I haue professed a long time, as I trust to the
honour of Almightye God, and also to the benefite
and profit of my country. And wheras here I haue
communicated the settinge forth of this treatyse w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
him that hath beene the only and chiefe occasion of
first takinge the same in hand, I thinke he maye of
verye righte chalenge the greatest commendation
thereof (if anye be) who ayded mee not onlye wyth
his good aduyce, but also wyth Bookes, which els
where I could not haue had for the accomplishmēt
of the saide translation. And to speake vnfayned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
my owne labour and trauayle can loke for no
manner of prayse at all, excepte peraduenture the
onlye commendation of painfull and faythfull dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
whiche as Vegetius sayth himselfe, is h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>re
more requisite, then elegancye and finenes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des▪
not addinge therevnto anye thinge of myne
owne, after the maner of a Paraphrast to dilate the
matter more at large wyth a curious and eloquent
stile: but vsinge onlye the office of a translatour,
plainlye and compendiouslye expressing so neare as
I could, the true sense and meaning of the Author.
Wherefore if this my endeuour maye be accepted
<pb facs="4"/>
of your honour, I thincke it a greater commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then eyther I can deserue or iustlye looke for:
as thereby muche boldned and encouraged to take
like paynes hereafter, if good and meete occasion
may serue thereunto.</p>
