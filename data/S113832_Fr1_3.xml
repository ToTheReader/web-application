      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Otwithstanding the worlds complaint, of the surfeit of Bookes (hasty wits being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-forward to vent their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe and mishapen conceits;) yet in all ages there hath been and will be necessary vses of holy Treatises, applyable to the varietie of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the time; because men of weaker conceits, cannot so easily of themselues discerne how one truth is inferred from another, and proued by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, especially when truth is controuerted by men of more subtile and stronger wits. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Gods truth hath in all ages beene opposed in some branches of it; so the diuine prouidence that watcheth ouer the Church, raised vp some to sence the Truth, and make vp the breach: Men gifted proportionably to the time, and as well furnisht to fight Gods battels, as Sathans cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions haue beene to stand for him: neither haue any points of Scripture beene more exactly discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, then those that haue beene most sharpely oppugned, opposition whetting both mens wits,
<pb facs="4"/> and industry, and in seuerall ages, men haue beene seuerally exercised. The ancientest of the fathers had to deale with them without (the Pagans,) and especially with proud Heretickes, that made their owne conceits the measure of holy truth, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no more then they could comprehend in the articts of the Trinity, and natures of Christ; whence they bent their forces that way, and for other matter wrote more securely. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the enemies of grace, and flatterers of nature, stirred vp Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> to challenge the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Gods predestination and grace, out of their hands, which he did with great successe as fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with grace, learning, and wit, for such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and no Scriptures are more faithfully handled by him, then those that were wrested by his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites, and such as made for the strengthning of his owne cause. In other writings hee tooke more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. His Schollers prosper. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers interessed themselues in the same quarrell.</p>
   <p>In processe of time, men desirous of quiet, and tyred with controuersies, began to lay aside the study of Scriptures, and hearken after an easier way of ending strife, by the determination of one man, (the Bishop of Rome) whom virtually they made the whole Church; so the people were shut vp vnder ignorance and implicite faith, which pleased them well, as easing them of labour of search, as vpon the same irkesomenesse of trouble, in the Easterne parts, they yeelded to the confusion and abomination of Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p>And least Schollers should haue nothing to doe, they were set to tye, and vntie Schoole-knots, and spinne questions out of their owne braine, in which brabbles they were so taken vp, that they sleightly looked to other matters; as for questions of weight, they were schooled to resolue all into the decisiue sentence of the sea Apostolicke; the authoritie of which they bent their wits to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance; yet then Wisedome found children to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie her: for Scriptures that made for authority of Princes, and against vsurpation of Popes, were well cleared by <hi>Occam, Marsilius, Patauinus,</hi> and others, as those of predestination and grace by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riminensis, Bradwardine,</hi> and their followers, against Pelagianisme then much preuailing.</p>
   <p>At length the Apostasie of Popery spread so far, that God in pitty to his poore Church, raised vp men of inuincible courage, vnwearied paines, and great skill in Tongues and Arts, to free Religion, so deepely inthralled; from whence it is that we haue so many iudicious Tractates and Commentaries in this latter age. And yet will there be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vse of further search into the Scriptures, as new heresies arise, or old are reuiued, and further strengthned. The conuiction of which, is then best, when their crookednesse is brought to the streight rule of Scriptures to be discouered. Besides, new expositions of Scriptures will be vsefull, in respect of new temptations, corruptions in life, and cases of conscience, in which the minde will not receiue any satisfying resolution, but from explication and application of Scriptures.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>Moreouer, it is not vnprofitable that there should be diuers Treatises of the same portion of Scriptures, because the same truth may be better conueyed to the conceits of some men by some mens handling then others, one man relishing one mans gifts more then anothers. And it is not meete that the glory of Gods goodnesse and wisedome should be obscured, which shineth in the variety of mens gifts, especially seeing the depth of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is such, that though men had large hearts, as the sand of the sea shore, yet could they not empty out all things contained; for though the maine principles be not many, yet deductions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions are infinite, and vntill Christs second comming to iudgement, there will neuer want new occasion of further search, and wading into these deepes.</p>
   <p>In all which respects, this Exposition of this holy man, deserues acceptance of the Church, as fitted to the times, (as the wise Reader will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne.) He went through the whole Epistle, but left large notes of no Chapter but this, which in some few places are not so full as could be wished for clearing some few obscurities; yet those that tooke the care of setting them out, thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to let them passe as they are, then be ouer bould with another mans worke, in making him speake what hee did not, and take them as they be, the greatest shall finde matter to exercise themselues in, the meaner matter of sweete comfort and holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, &amp; all confesse that he hath brought some light to this excellent portion of Scripture.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>He was a man fit for this taske, a man of much communion with God, and acquaintance with his owne heart, obseruing the daily passages of his life, &amp; exercised much with spirituall conflicts: As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epistle neuer seemeth to satisfie himselfe in aduancing the glory of grace, and the vilenesse of man in himselfe; So this our <hi>Paul,</hi> had large conceipts of these things, a deepe insight into the mystery of Gods grace, and mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; hee could therefore enter further into <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, hauing receiued a large measure of <hi>Pauls</hi> spirit. He was one that sought no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the world, being taken vp with comforts and griefes, vnto which the world is a stranger; one that had not all his learning out of Bookes; of a sharpe wit, and cleare iudgement: though his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations were of a higher straine then ordinary, yet he had a good dexteritie, furthered by his loue to doe good, in explaining darke points with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some similitudes. His manner of handling questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this Chapter is presse, and Schoole-like, by Arguments on both sides, Conclusions, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres, a course more sutable to this purpose then loose discourses.</p>
   <p>In setting downe the obiect of Gods Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, hee succeedes him in opinion, whom hee succeeded in place; in which point Diuines accord not, who in all other points doe ioyntly agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the troublers of the Churches peace, in our neighbor Countries; for some would haue man lye before God in predestinating him, as in lapsed and
<pb facs="6"/> miserable estate; others would haue God in that first decree to consider man abstracted from such respects, and to be considered of, as a creature alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and capable either of happinesse or misery, and fit to be disposed of by God, who is Lord of his owne, to any supernaturall end; yet both agree in this. First, that there was an eternall separation of men in Gods purpose. Secondly, that this first decree of seuering man to his ends, is an act of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty ouer his creature, and altogether inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant of any thing in the creature, as a cause of it, especially in comparatiue reprobation, as why he reiected <hi>Iudas,</hi> and not <hi>Peter;</hi> sinne fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene cannot be the cause, because that was common to both, and therefore could be no cause of seuering. Thirdly, all agree in this, that damnation is an act of diuine iustice, which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth demerit; and therefore the execution of Gods decree is founded on sinne, either of nature, or life, or both. My meaning is not to make the cause mine, by vnnecessary intermedling; The worthinesse of the men on both sides is such, that it should moue men to moderation in their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures either way; Neither is this question of like consequence with others in this businesse, but there is a wide difference betweene this difference and other differences. And one cause of it, is the difficulty of vnderstanding, how God conceiues things, which differs in the whole kinde from ours, he conceiuing of things, altogether and at once without discourse, we one thing after another, and
<pb facs="6"/> by another. Our comfort is, that what we cannot see in the light of nature, and grace, we shall see in the light of glory, in the Vniuersitie of heauen; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which time, that men should in all matters haue the same conceipt of things of this nature, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be wished for, then to be hoped. That lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Bishop, (now with God,) that vndertooke the defence of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Perkins,</hi> hath left to the Church, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the benefit of his labours, the sorrow for his death, the fame of his worth; an example likewise of moderation, who though hee differed from M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Perkins</hi> in this point, yet shewed that he could both assent in lesser things, and with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect maintaine in greater matters. If we would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne of differences, the Church would be troubled with fewer distempers; I speak not as if way were to be giuen to <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>â¢</desc>
         </gap>rstian,</hi> lawlesse, licentious liberty of prophesie; that euery one, so soone as he is bigge of some new conceipt, should bring forth his abortiue monster: for thus the pillars of Christian faith would soone be shaken, and the Church of God, which is a house of order, would become a Babell, a house of confusion. The dolefull issues of which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended liberty, we see in <hi>Polonia, Transiluania,</hi> and in countries neerer hand. We are much to blesse God for the Kings Maiesties firmenesse this way, vnto whose open appearing in these matters, and to the vigilancie of some in place, we owe our freedome from that schisme, that troubleth our neighbours.</p>
   <p>But for diuersity of apprehensions of matters
<pb facs="7"/> farre remote from the foundation; these may stand with publike and personall peace. I will keepe the Reader no longer from the Treatise; the blessing of heauen goe with it, that through the good done by it, much thankesgiuing may be to God, in the Church, <hi>Amen.</hi>
