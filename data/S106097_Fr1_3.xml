   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight courteous Gentlemen, we haue brought out of <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>England</hi> two of the Muses, <hi>Clio</hi> and <hi>Euterpe,</hi> as desirous to see the lande as to learne the language; whome I trust you wil vse well because they be women, and you can not abuse them because you be Gentlemen. As these speede so the rest will followe, neyther altogether vnwilling to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake theyr owne Countrey, nor yetouerhasty to arriue into this, reposing the ende of theyr counsayle in the proofe of youre courtesie. If you lyke them not for the attyre they weare, yet bid them welcome for the newes they bring, which I confesse are in many poyntes straunge, but for the most parte true. The first of these hath trauelled through three Countreys of auncient fame, <hi>Lydia, Persia,</hi> and <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> making reporte of all suche things as in the same are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther memorable for antiquity, or famous for excellency. The second eyther lesse able to trauayle farre, or more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring in that Countrey, kepte resyaunce in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where she found the people so witty, the countrey so wonderfull, all things so straunge, and differing from the common course of nature, that abiding there, shee thoughte <hi>Aegypt</hi> to haue greater store of myracles, then all the world beside. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore trauelling to no place but to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> she telleth no news but out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> howbeit, in such exquisite manner, that for the countrey, the people, the princes, the lawes, the course of all antiquitie, hearing her, ye will desire no more. Neyther of these are braued out in theyr coulours as the vse is now adayes, and yet so seemely, as eyther you will loue them because they are modest, or not mislike them because they are not impudent, since in refusing ydle pearles to make them seeme gaudy, they reiect not modest apparrell to cause them go comely. The truth is (Gentlemen) in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them newe attyre, I was fayne to take example by theyr olde array, cutting out my cloth by another mans

measure, beeyng great difference whether wee inuent a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion of our owne, or imitate a paterne set downe by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whiche I speake not to this ende, for that my selfe coulde haue done more eloquently in englishe then our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour hath in Greeke, but that the course of his writing beeyng most sweete in Greeke, conuerted into Englishe, looseth a great parte of his grace. Howsoeuer the case stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Gentlemen, if it be not so well as it might be, I would it were better than it is, wishing the best albeit I can not attayne to the best, yet least I condemne my selfe before I neede, I wil stay vpon the censure and opinion of others when the time shall come. Till when, and euer, leauing you to God, and the good successe of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, I ende.</p>
