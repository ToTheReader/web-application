   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Han Pericles had
gathered an armye,
makyng expedition
towardes the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle
of Pelopone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
whan his nauy
was ready rygged,
and at the poynte to
launche forthe, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynly
there chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
so great a darknes through an Eclips
of the Sunne, that the daye was as dark
as yf it had bene nyght, in so muche that
the starres appered: at whiche so sodayne
and prodigious a wonder the Pylote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
amased and affrayed, as were also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of the souldyers, refused to sayle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
farther. Whiche whan Pericles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued,
whether it were in contempte of
Astronomye, or to encorage his astonished
souldyers, be toke his cloke and blynded
there with, the Maryners eyes: and at
the last vncouering them agayne, he asked
hym yf he thought it any wonder because
his eyes had be couered a whyle, and yet
were neuer the worse therfore. And whan
the Pylote answered that it was not: No
more is it (sayde Pericles) althoughe the
Moone shadowyng the Sūne, take away
<pb facs="5"/>
his lyght for a season. And so contemning
a good admonicion sent as than by god, he
sayled forwarde, to the destruction of hys
souldyers, besydes the great detriment of
all the whole lande of Brecia.</p>
   <p>In lyke maner there be manye nowe a
dayes, which as Pericles despysed Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomye,
despyse all other sciences: deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng
proper toyes (as he dyd) to dasshe
them out of countenaunce, tunnyng head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
through Ignoraunce, into contempt
of all good learnyng: Not only inuentyng
tryfelyng toyed, but also wrestyng the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scriptures whiche they vnderstand not
to serue for their pyuish purpose. For yf it
chaunce them to be improued with any of
the good sayinges of the auncient philoso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phers,
which so playnly impugneth theyr
vices, that they be vnable by good reason
to refell it, tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> on goeth the brasen face,
and a cloke must be sought oute of Scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
eyther to do deface all Phylosophye, or
els to blynde mennes eyes withall: But
yf they vnderstoode the Scriptures, or yf
arrogancie woulde let them learne to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
them as they be trulye meaned,
than shoulde they, confessyng theyr lewde
and wylful blyndnes, be ashamed of their
many vices, &amp; cease to disprayse that, that
is greatly to be commended.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
For although (Good Reader) that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophye
is not to be compared with the
moste holy scriptures, yet is it not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
to be despised: whiche (yf men wyl cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyt
the holy doctours) maye be proued by
the iudgement of S. Augustine, which in
his booke <hi>De doctrina Christiana. cap. xl</hi>
exhorteth vs to the reading therof, saying
Yf they whiche be called Phylosophers,
specially of Plato his secte, haue spoken
ought that is true, and appertinent to our
faythe, we ought not onely not to feare it,
but also to chalenge it as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> owne, from
them whiche are no ryght owners therof.
For lyke as the Egyptians had not onely
Idoles and great burdens which the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
did hate and flye, but also vessels
ornamentes, and goodly Iewels of golde
and syluer, whiche the Israelytes depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
from Egypt, vnder the colour of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowyng,
stole priuilye from them, not of
theyr owne mynde, but by the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of God, to turne that to a better
vse whiche the Egyptians abused: So in
the doctrine of the Bentyles are not only
contayned supersticious and fayned rites,
with great burdens of vayne labour, all
whiche we Christians followyng Christe
out from among the vnbeleuyng gentiles,
shulde vtterly detest and auoyde: but also
much good learnyng, mete for to serue the
<pb facs="6"/>
truthe, wyth some moste profytable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes
of good maners, wherein are folide
some truthe, howe to worshyp the eternal
and onely God. &amp;c.</p>
   <p>These be the woordes, iudgement, and
councell of that moste holye Doctour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng
Philosophie, the whiche yf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
had wel remembred. whiche vnder the
tytle of philosophicall science, haue with
Sophistrie, corrupted the true sense of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scripture, neyther shoulde ther haue ben
suche contencion as nowe raygneth euery
where, neyther faultles philosophye haue
bene so muche despysed. Yet thynke not
(Louyng Reader) that I allowe philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie
to be Scriptures Interpretour, but
rather woulde haue it as an handmayden
to perswade suche thynges as Scripture
doeth cōmaunde. In whiche kynde whan
it is vsed, than maye al the prayses be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryfyed
therupou, with whiche the auncy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
phylosophers haue magnifyed it.</p>
   <p>Emonge whome Demosthenes the moste
famouse Oratoure among the Greciens,
calleth it, namely the moral parte, An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencion
and gyfte of God. After whome
Licero the mooste excellent aud eloquent
Oratour emong the Romaynes, calleth it
the gyde of lyfe, and the expulser of vice.</p>
   <p>These and many moe lyke cōmendaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
haue ben therto attributed, whiche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
<pb facs="6"/>
it excedyngly, neyther disagreyng
with the holy Scriptures. Wherfore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
christen man ought diligently to applye
it, namely the morall parte: whiche God
wrote fyrste in the hartes of men, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
wyllyng to haue euerye man to
knowe it, he wrote it in the tables of stone
whiche he gaue to Moyses, promisinge by
hym a rewarde for suche thynges, whiche
before were obserued for vertues sake.</p>
   <p>So that Moral philosophye maye wel be
called that parte of goddes lawe, whiche
geueth commaundement of outwarde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauyour:
Whiche differeth from the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
in as muche as the gospell promyseth
remission of sinnes, reconciling to god, and
the gyfte of the holy goste, and of eternal
lyfe, for Christes sake, whiche promyse is
reueled to vs from aboue, not able to be cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prehended
by reason, according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of S. Iohn. The sunne whiche is in
his fathers bosome hath shewed it to vs.
And as for philosophie is nothyng els but
the obseruyng &amp; eschuyng of such thinges
as reason iudgeth to be good &amp; bad in the
mutuall conuersacion of lyfe, to whyche
god hath promysed a rewarde, and threte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a punishment: so that the gospel is cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
only by faythe, and philosophy
is iudged by reason.</p>
   <p>Reason only was the cause why al the
<pb facs="7"/>
phylosofers haue so extolled philosophie
whiche consydered that nothiuge was so
requisite and behouefull for mannes lyfe,
as to lyue togyther well and louyngly.
For lyke as lyfe can not be mayntayned
without meate and drynke and other lyke
good gyftes of Nature: no more coulde it
continue long withoute lawes &amp; maners:
the lacke wherof, saynt Iohn in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
argueth to be the lacke of godlynesse,
saying: Yf we loue not oure neyghboure
whome we see, howe can we saye we loue
God whome we see not? Which texte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
well pondered, maketh as muche for
the commendacion of Moral philosophie
as any of saynt Paules do to the dispraise
therof. Wherefore I humblye beseche the
(most gentle Reader) to take in good part
this simple philosopycal treatyse, &amp; so to
vse it as sainct Augustine hath taught vs,
takyng the good, and leauyng the bad, ney<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
reuerencyng it as the gospel, neyther
yet despysing it as a thing of no value.</p>
   <p>And sithens the hollye Scriptures are
nowe come to lyght, &amp; Christians haue
professed to followe and fulfyl the same,
hauyng also innumerable blessynges and
rewardes promysed of God, for oure so
doyng: let vs be ashamed that a droppe or
sparkle of reason shoulde doe more in the
<pb facs="7"/>
Heathen Infidles (as we cal them,) than
