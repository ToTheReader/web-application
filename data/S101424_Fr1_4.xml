   <head>The Preface to the gentle
Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Anatomie of popish Tyrannie,
(gentle Reader,) was compiled and made
readie for the presse before the tenth of
October, in the yeare of our lord God
1602. but by reason of casuall accidents,
and other circumstances concurring, it
was not printed vntill this present yeare
1603. before which time, it pleased the
Almightie to call hence to his mercie,
our most gratious Soueraigne the mightie Princesse <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
late Queene of England, France, and Ireland. Against whose
sacred person, the Pope, the Spaniards, and Englist Spanioli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
Iesuites with all Iesuited popelings, deuised, contriued, and
practised, many most cruell stratagems and bloodie complottes.
All which were effected, for this sole and onely purpose, because
forsooth her most excellent Maiesty of holy memorie, did euer with
singular Christian zeale and rare magnanimitie, protect, patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize,
and stoutly maintaine, Christs holy gospell and his diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
throughout her Realmes and Dominions. These treacheries
and most villanous conspiracies against her royall person, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
indignities against her Realmes &amp; most louing subiects,
contriued and put into actuall execution, by the cursed crew of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Iesuites, and Iesuited papists, are compendiously, distinctly,
and pithily, comprised in this present volume. By reason whereof
it commeth, that though this present worke be published, after that
the imperiall Diademe of the Realmes afore named, came and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
wholy and lawfully to the high and renowmed prince now our
vndoubted Soueraigne lord, <hi>Iames</hi> the first, King of England,
Scotland, Fraunce, and Ireland, yet must all the chiefest parts
thereof, be referred principally to our late Soueraigne ladie Queene
<hi>Elizabeth.</hi> I say (principally) for that the same doe in some sort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
his royall person &amp; regall prerogatiues, who this day most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
raigneth ouer vs. For, the cursed and trayterous Iesuites, who
for their manifold treasons against their Soueraigne lords, the late
king of France &amp; the king now regnant, are iustly banished out of the
<pb facs="8"/>
whole kingdome of Fraunce, euen by publike decree of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
(as the French papists tell vs,) and who also (as the Secular
priests their owne brethren write of them,) haue endeuoured with
tooth and nayle to stirre vp sedition in the kingdome of Scotland,
so to set the imperiall Crowne thereof vpon a Spaniards head, will
not now doubtlesse surcease, from their inueterate and wonted bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
treacheries, (seeing their profession is linked inseperably with
treason, as the priests affirme against them,) if our liege lord king
<hi>Iames</hi> the first, shall graunt them any footing and resting place,
within any of his kingdomes, territories, or dominions. God for his
mercie sake, (which hath no end,) eyther conuert them soundly, or
confound them vtterly, for the peace of his Church, the
safetie of our gracious King, and the comfort of
all his true hearted subiects, English,
Scottish, and Irish. Amen.</p>
