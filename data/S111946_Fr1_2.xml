                 <title>A sermon preached at Paules Crosse, the sixt of February. 1596 : In which are discussed these three conclusions. 1 It is not the will of God that all men should be saued. 2 The absolute will of God, and his secret decree from all eternitie is the cause why some are predestinated to saluation, others to destruction, and not any foresight of faith, or good workes in the one, or infidelitie, neglect, or contempt in the other. 3 Christ died not effectually for all.

   <head>To the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,
Sir Thomas Egerton Knight,
Lord Keeper of the great Seale
of England.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honorable (my sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
good Lord) Your
integritie in bestowing
spirituall liuings, and
making choyse of learned
men vpon whom you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
them, hath satisfied
the common expectation, and fully answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that great hope which the Cleargie of
Englande hath conceiued of you. It is the
voyce of all them which are religiously affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that God in his mercy hath raysed you vp
to bee an especiall instrument of his glorie.
My selfe, among many other of both the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersities,
<pb facs="3"/>
had set my heart at rest, as one
resolued to die within the precinctes of the
Colledge, like a Monke shut vp in his cell,
or an Heremite mured vp within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of a wall, without hope of euer being
called to any Ecclesiastial preferment in this
corrupt and simoniacall age, (had I not bene
by your Honor preferred). VVherfore in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
I could do no lesse, thē for my poore por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō
of learning, to offer vnto you this my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
as a schollers myte, which here I humbly
present vnto your Honour, as vnto my good
L. vnto whom I am especially bound. It may
please your Lordship to weigh it, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my skill, which is but weake, but
according to the soundnesse of the doctrine
therin conteined, which is warranted by the
authoritie of the scriptures, the same scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
being rightly vnderstood: as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the analogie of the scriptures: the
consent both of the Fathers of the primitiue
Church, and the new writers of our times,
which do concurre in iudgement, and agree
vpon the same interpretation. The Lorde
continue this your great loue of godlinesse,
<pb facs="3"/>
and singular zeale in furthering of religion,
that here you may liue long to his glory, and
hereafter liue for euer to your owne euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
comfort.</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your Honours in all
humble dutie,
Iohn Doue.</signed>
