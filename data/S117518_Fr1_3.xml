   <head>To the godly, and well affected Reader.</head>
   <p>BELOVED, the chiefest care of euery man in this life should be how hee may glorifie God, and saue his soule; and there is great reason it should bee so; for as he is the fountaine from whence all good
<pb facs="14"/> things flow, so he is the end<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 36. Ps. 148. 13 Isa. 42. 8. 48. 11.</note> vnto which all things tend; and as his glory is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and deare vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as being the end of all his workes of Creation, of Election, and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">Pro. 16. 4. Eph. 1. 5, 6 Tit. 2. 11.</note> so also of continuall preseruation of mans life. Therefore the Angels, those<note place="margin">Iohn 11. 4.</note> glorious Creatures, out of their zeale to their Creator, are swift winged Heralds to diuulge his glory, and are restlesse in giuing honour<note place="margin">Isa. 6. 3.</note> and praise vnto him, whose practise the Saints in all ages<note place="margin">Reu. 14. 7. 4. 8.</note> haue imitated in glorifying
<pb facs="15"/> their Creator; and in all<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 20.</note> their actions haue stil aimed at his glory; extolling him in<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 20 1 Pet. 4 11. Ier. 13. 16. Psa. 116. 5.</note> his greatnesse, goodnesse, and mercy; whose example and practise teacheth vs, as to ayme at the glory of our Creator in the first place; so in the second place our principall care should be to worke out our saluation with feare and trembling,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> and to giue all diligence to make our calling and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10</note> sure; and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our soules are so preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,<note place="margin">Ps. 49. 8: Eccl. 12. 7.</note> being the gifts of God, which being lost could not
<pb facs="15"/> bee redeemed without an<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18 19. Luk. 13. 24 1 Co. 9. 24. Iohn 6. 27. 1 Pet. 4. 18</note> infinite price; and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this price could not bee obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great paines and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour on our part; because of the difficultie, and the many enemies that seeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue vs of our saluation; in which respect, that man which is carelesse of his owne saluation, is also mindlesse of Gods glory, &amp; so by these means he failes, and comes short of the end for which he was created.</p>
   <p>If this must be the care of euery godly man, then sure
<pb facs="16"/> our age abounds with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny carelesse and negligent men, which in stead of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God, and seeking the saluation of their soules, their chiefest care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is to honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance themselues in this world, as appeares by their practice &amp; proiects, which is all for pleasures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,<note place="margin">Isa. 22. 13. Hab. 1. 15.</note> in these things they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and are glad; greedily seeking after them, that they may spend them vpon their<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 3.</note> lusts; making themselues merry while their time lasts.<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 19 1 Cor. 15. 32.</note> These men, as they disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb facs="16"/> God in seeking for their<note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 15.</note> portion in this life, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these trāsitory things are the vtmost choyce of Gods reward, as they are of their hopes; so they cozen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as the rich foole did,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 21</note> who laid vp treasures in the world, and was not rich toward God; so also they<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 10.</note> pierce themselues through with many sorrowes, by seeking content in that which yeelds none, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to hold that w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> hath no stay, till at last they fall into temptation, and snares, &amp; many foolish &amp; hurtfull
<pb facs="17"/> lusts, which drowne men in destruction, and perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 9</note> The consideration here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath moued mee (the meanest of the sonnes of <hi>Leui</hi>) out of loue to your saluation, to exhort you to seek the Lord while he may be found. For I feare that many of vs are so lulled asleepe in the cradle of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as that neither the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<note place="margin">Isay. 58. 1.</note> Bels of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring trumpet of <hi>Isajah,</hi> the well tuned Cimbals of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> nor yet the sweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Euangelists can as yet awake vs out of our
<pb facs="17"/> sinfull securitie, and moue vs to turne to the Lord by true and vnfaigned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that hee may haue mercie vpon our soules: yet for as much as times &amp; sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are in Gods hands, &amp;<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 8.</note> that his Spirit blows where he lists; I haue therfore in the strength of my God presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to present vnto your consideration <hi>The World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Looking-glasse,</hi> wherein hee may clearly see and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the world, and all worldly things to be vaine and vncertain, louing none but those which are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb facs="18"/> to Christ; and many<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> times deceiuing them also of their hope and expectation; saucing their pleasures with gall and wormwood. For worldly prosperity proues dangerous snares to bring men to destruction; for when it fawneth most, then it hunteth most eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after our saluation, vnless wee take the better heed. Then <hi>what is a man profited if he gaine the whole world, if hee lose his soule?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The life of man is short,<note place="margin">Iob 14. 1.</note> and passeth away like a shadow, and that which
<pb facs="18"/> worldlings enioy, they buy at hard rates; paying full deare for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany pleasures, which many times proue full of misery, &amp; vexation of spirit.</p>
   <p>But yet alas, though we see the deceitfulnesse of the world, and the misery of it; yet we are content to be deceiued therby, &amp; so to fall at noone dayes when our eyes are open. Wee vse to laugh at little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which runne vp and downe after a feather, or some vaine toy, till they fall downe and take harme;
<pb facs="19"/> and then wee pitty their folly: But when wee see man, which should haue reason to guide him, to toile so eagerly after these transitory things, which at last will deceiue him, and steale away his heart from godlinesse; how should wee lament his misery?</p>
   <p>Let the consideration hereof moue vs all to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a pearle wee are like to lose for the gaining of these deceitfull vanities, that so at the last wee may be perswaded to labour for the saluation of our soules.
<pb facs="19"/> For is it not better to serue God, and to worke out our owne saluation here, that we may bee blessed hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; then for the loue of this base world to bee tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for euer and euer? Is it not better to want these sinfull pleasures, then for enioying of them, to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Hell? For what<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 8.</note> shall we reape of the flesh, but corruption? And what shall we gaine of the Deuill for al our seruice, but eternal torments? And what shall<note place="margin">Psal. 37. 35.</note> wee gaine of the world but speedy forgetfulnesse?</p>
   <pb facs="20"/>
   <p>Seeing then the loue of the world is so vaine and deceitfull, let vs then labour for heauen and heauenly things, and take no thought<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 14</note> for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof; minding not so much this present world, as that which is to come; for this is temporary and must haue an end, but that is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 8.</note> and will abide for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. This must bee done,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 1, 2.</note> that thereby wee may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue our sanctification; for here wee liue by faith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 7.</note> and therefore our conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> must bee sutable. This
<pb facs="20"/> will bring vs present ease,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 19. Ioh. 16. 22.</note> for our hope is certaine, and cannot deceiue vs. This is the onely way to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 18.</note> of God, and to gaine a good report among men. This will bring a sure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at last; God himselfe hath pronounced, that it shal goe well with the iust,<note place="margin">Isay 3. 10.</note> for their end shall bee euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 22.</note> life: For the ground of their hope is founded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 12. Tit. 1. 2. Heb. 6. 18.</note> his power that cannot faile, &amp; on his promise that cannot lye, and vpon his Iustice that will not forget<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 10.</note> to reward. This, as it will
<pb facs="21"/> bring comfort when worldlings are at their wits<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 8.</note> ends, so also it yeelds an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable imployment in the meane time, while wee exercise our selues in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly<note place="margin">Col. 3. 2.</note> things. For the things<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> of this life, as they are base, so they are shamefull, and the end of them is death. <hi>Then what is a man profited if he gaine the whole world, and lose his soule?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Spare no paines then for to gaine thy saluation, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and cast away all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and delights, till thou art perswaded thy <hi>name is
<pb facs="21"/> written in heauen.</hi> Wee see<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 20</note> worldly men will toyle &amp; labour to gaine riches, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and preferments; hope of gaine will make Raine and windie weather seeme faire and pleasant. For shame then let not world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings diligence condemne ours, for how shall wee escape, if wee neglect so<note place="margin">Heb. 2▪ 3.</note> great saluation? Christ hath done more for vs, and shall wee doe nothing for our selues? wee shall lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the end, but gaine exceedingly; then it shal not repent vs that wee haue
<pb facs="22"/> sowne in teares, when wee see we shall reape in ioy. As we desire to bee members of the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, let vs now labour to haue the assurance sealed vp to our soules▪ by denying the world, and all worldly things. For the glory of the world is but like a blazing Starre, which terrifies the minde, by presaging ruine; and the pleasures of the world like candide Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, which deceiues the taste, and imbitters the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke.</p>
   <p>Thus farre Christian
<pb facs="22"/> Reader, for thy sake I haue diued into the world, and all worldly things; if I haue said any thing in this ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discourse, which may yeeld thee any profit, giue God the glorie, and me thy friendly censure, and <hi>helpe</hi>

As also compose a Table for the reading, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the Scriptures, and how to reconcile such places as seem to contradict one another; &amp; to prescribe rules to know when the

   <p>But alas, there are manie now adayes that can spie a moate in anothers eie, that had need to haue a Beame pulled from their owne. some there are so curious in their conceits, as that they can easier finde two faults in another mans worke, then know how to mend one. If thou be of that mind, (friendly Reader) I doe not intend to make thee my Iudge.
