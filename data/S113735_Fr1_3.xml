   <head>The Preface of the Authour.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE last yeare, I wrote a small Treatise (chiefly for my owne spirituall good) of the <hi>Ascending of the mynd to God,</hi> by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of <hi>certaine steps,</hi> or <hi>degrees</hi> of things created. Now, in that it hath pleased the diuine Maiesty, to draw out a little longer my feeble old age, it came into my thoughts, to make <hi>the Heauenly Citty</hi> (to the which all we Sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> who bewayling do inhabitate this Vale of mortality, do greedily seeke after) the subiect of my present meditations: and to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the same to print, to the end they may not wholy perish. Therefore in the sacred Scriptures (which are, as it were, certaine <hi>Consolatory Epistles,</hi> sent from our <hi>Father</hi> in this our exile,
<pb n="10" facs="6"/> or place of banishment) I fynd foure Names, by which the good and <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of that place may in some sort be made knowne vnto vs.</p>
   <p>The Names an these: <hi>A Paradise,</hi> a <hi>House,</hi> a <hi>Citty,</hi> a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> Of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise S. Paul</hi> thus saith, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Scio hominem in Christo &amp;c. I know a man in Christ, aboue foureteene yeares ago, rapt euen to the third Hauen:</hi> And then a litle after: <hi>rapt into Paradise.</hi> And that we might not imagine, he spake of the earthly <hi>Paradise</hi> he did promise and set downe before those words; <hi>rapt euen to the third Heauen.</hi> Concer-a <hi>House,</hi> the Sonne of God himselfe thus speaketh: <hi>In my Fathers House, there be many Mansions, Ioan.</hi> 14. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>a Citty</hi> these be the wordes of the Apostle: <hi>You are come to the Citty of the liuing God, the heauenly Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. Hebr.</hi> 12. To conclude, of the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen,</hi> our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe thus in <hi>S. Matthew</hi> 5. <hi>Beatipau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peres spiritu &amp;c. Blessed are the poore in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdome of Heauen:</hi> And no other name through out the whole body of the Scripture, is more frequently vsed, then this of the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb n="11" facs="6"/>
   <p>The Place of the Saints in Heauen is called a <hi>Paradise,</hi> because Heauen is a most pleasant place, abounding withall spirituall delicacies. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some Men may coniectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e, that a <hi>Paradise</hi> is but a small Garden, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in some one corner of a <hi>House</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to receaue but few Men; the Holy Ghost did adioyne in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Word &amp; name of <hi>House,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Regall and Princely <hi>House</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to be a great Pallace, in which besides the Garden or Orchard, there are certaaine open Halls, or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of disport, diuers Chambers and roomes of repose and retirement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many others of different sort.</p>
   <p>Now seeing a <hi>House</hi> (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it be great) cannot containe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men; therefore, that wee should not thinke that they are but few, who belong to the <hi>Kingdome of Heauen,</hi> the Scripture doth annexe the Name of a <hi>Citty,</hi> which vsually comprehendeth in it selfe many Orchards, and many Pallaces of Pleasure. But seeing <hi>S. Iohn</hi> writeth in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> 7. of the nū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Blessed: Vidi turbam magnā &amp;c. I saw a great multitude, which no man could number.</hi> And that there
<pb n="12" facs="7"/> is no <hi>Citty,</hi> which is capable of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable multitude; therefore the Holy Scripture vseth the name of a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Heauen;</hi> then which place no other throughout the whole <hi>Vniuersity</hi> of things created, is more capacious.</p>
   <p>But now againe, to shew other reasons in warrāt of the former foure different Appellations or Names. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in a most ample <hi>Kingdome,</hi> there are many Men, who neuer see nor know the Names of d uers inhabitāts of the same <hi>Kingdome;</hi> nor know not whether such Men are, or haue an Existence or Being; and also in that it is certaine, that all the Blessed doe see and know one another, and as friends conioyned in a strait bond of loue, do familiarly conuerse among themselues; therefore the Scripture, as not being content with the Name of a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> added the Name of a <hi>Citty;</hi> giuing vs to vnderstand thereby, that all those, who doe dwell in that (though most vast) <hi>Kingdome,</hi> are truly <hi>Citizens</hi> of the Saints, and are so conioyned in familiarity among themselues, as the Citizens of one small <hi>Citty</hi> are accustomed to be. And
<pb n="13" facs="7"/> that we may be further instructed, that all those happy Men, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Citizens</hi> of the Saints, but also the domesticke friends of God, yea the Sonnes of God; therefore the same <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who had called it a <hi>Citty,</hi> calleth it also a <hi>House.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, in that all the <hi>Blessed</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen do enioy the same delights and pleasures in Heauen, therfore is that place, entituled by the Name of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</hi> Thus these foure Wordes; to wit, a <hi>Kingdome, a Citty, a House, a Paradise</hi> do signify one and the same thing: And that <hi>Paradise</hi> heere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is so spacious and large, as that it may be truly called a <hi>House,</hi> a <hi>Citty,</hi> a <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Therefore I haue heere determined to commit to Print, whatsoeuer God sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>l vouchsafe to suggest and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to me (by way of meditation) in the secret Closet of my soule, of this most happy place. And this, first vn-the name of a <hi>Kingdome;</hi> next vnder the name of a <hi>Citty;</hi> then of a <hi>House;</hi> and lastly of <hi>Paradise.</hi> Towards the end of the discourse, I will subioyne six other Names (not of places, but of things) out of the Parables of our Lord▪
<pb n="14" facs="8"/> to wit, <hi>A Treasure hidden in a field; A precious Pearle or Margarite; The dayly Penny; The ioy of our Lord; A great supper; And a regall or Princely mariadge;</hi> As also two other Names out of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> which are, a <hi>Price</hi> or <hi>Reward,</hi> and a <hi>Crowne;</hi> so in all, there shalbe twelue distinct Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, by the which the <hi>Eternall Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi> of the Saints is described in the sacred Scriptures.</p>
