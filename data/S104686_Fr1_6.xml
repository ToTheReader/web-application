      <p>¶The fyrst booke of the treasure for trauellers, contayning the particuler conclusion of the Scall for to know the hieght of any Tower, Steeple, or Hill, or Walle, and the dystance vnto them, and the particuler conclusions of the Crosse staffe, and to know the thinges before rehersed after the playnest order of teachyng, &amp; also there is the conclusion of the horizontal or flat Sphere how to take the plat of any countrey, after the playnest order, with such other lyke, very necessary for all sortes of trauelers eyther by sea or by Land, written by <hi>Willyam Bourne.</hi>

         </gap> heigthes, bothe by right sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, and contrary shadowe: and also howe to knowe any distance by the Skalle. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that <hi>M. Thomas Dygges</hi> hath set out a booke cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pantometria,</hi> whiche is extant in print, as touching the conclusions of the Skall, whiche is very learnedly done. Yet notwithstanding I doo not thinke it hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to shewe it particularly and plainely, whereby they may doo it in most causes, without Arithmetike. For the Skall being put but into .12. partes, it may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the head, without Arithmetike: but if the Skal be put into many partes, then it must of force require the ayde of Arithmetike. And also there is the parti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cular
<pb facs="13"/>
conclusions of the Crosse staffe, as to take the widenesse betweene any two markes, and the length of any wall, and the distance vnto any place, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessarye matters to be donne with the playne Crosse staffe. &amp;c. And also there is the Conclusion of the horizontal or flat Sphere, howe to take the plat of any Countrey, after the playnest order of teaching, that is to saye, by the poynt, and partes of poyntes of the Compasse: For it is al one matter, whether that the Instrument be diuided into degrees, or partes of poyntes: and that same may be done by playne lynes of opposition, without any Instrumēt or circle, which I doo omyt at this tyme to speake of. And although gentle readers, that it seemeth not vnto you, to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like done, yet notwithstanding it is possible, that there is some thing that is not common in those books that are extant, that maye doo you pleasure. For the learned sortes of bookes (it may be) are not most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be common, and yet it woulde doo well, that the common sorte of people shoulde haue some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</p>

      <p>And furthermore, for that in this first part there is the conclusions of the Scall, and the Crosse staffe, she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng by them howe for to knowe the distance vnto any place assigned: Therefore it is very necessarie for to knowe the partes of measure, as it is not vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen vnto all men, what a foote is, and that .12. yn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches maketh a foote, so .3. foote is a yarde, and .5.<note place="margin">A Foote.

Rodde and .1/33. that is halfe a foote, is a myle of lande mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and .277.
