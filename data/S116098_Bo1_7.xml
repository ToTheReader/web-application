   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T cometh communely to passe that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters,</hi>
Masons, and such like Artificers are
put eyther to measure Timber euery waye
square, or squared logs, broader on thone, thī
on thother syde, yea many tymes mutilate or
vnperfecte stuffe: some tymes. 3. 5. 10. or, 20,
square in the heade and so throughe, oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
rounde stone or tymber, with hollowed.
&amp;c. Afore I shewe vnto them what muste be
done with suche peces of Tymber or stone to gette theyr true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
my desire shall be, that suche Craftesmen will leaue to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
or self willed, yea so gredily to sticke to theyr olde corrupted rules
that vtterly they refuse to be taught.</p>
   <p>Both learninge &amp; experience declareth vnto me, that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> groundes
whiche the best of them haue are false. To open howe and where, it
nedeth not: neyther doeth it apperteine to instruction. Only it maye
suffice hym that liketh the true way, here to receyue it appointed to
him. Yet to satisfie and content him whiche wil not beleue any such
errours or false groundes to be: I say (and truelye) that the Ruler of
tymber measure, which the more parte of them hath, is not made by
right arte. Besydes that theyr craft in seekinge the square of some
tymber, is very false. They vse in measuring to lay the broader and
narrower sydes together in a summe: and to take the halfe of that
number for the square. Then they seke this vntrue square vpon the
false ruler: and so measuringe the tymber, they conclude of it vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
As this is corrupted, so are other groundes which they take to be
infallible. Now to the purpose, touchinge the correction of those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
with other not mencioned, wherby true measuringe may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
this way shall be taken. After I haue opened how ye must han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
all such fashioned tymber (as afore is spoken of) there shall folowe
a table, in whiche ye may fynde (as I will declare) the square of any
stone, or tymber. That knowen, it is requisite to haue an other ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
immediatly folowinge, whiche may appoint to all true squares,
from. 1. to. 6. inches, the iust lengthe to make a Foote euery waye
square.<note place="margin">In a foote square is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined 1728. Inches.</note> With that length agreable to your square, your logge must
be measured. And as oft as ye finde it from the one ende to thother
of your tymber, so oft ye may conclude the foote square to be contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="12"/>
in that tymber logge, or stone: that is, so many square sete there
to be included. This Table of tymber measure standeth in the place
of a good Ruler, well docked with true measures. By this ye maye
make or correct rulers at pleasure, as after appeareth.
Nowe orderly foloweth the true measuringe of all
fashioned Tymber or Stone
afore named.</p>
