   <head>The Preface To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F it be true (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der) that the chefe point in knowledge is to knowe God, the second to know oure selfe, the thyrde (whiche is also the firste part of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) to know al other men, thā must it nedes follow that such menes as leade vs to the nerest perceyuing of any of these three, must nedes be both good, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and necessary. What folly is than in those heades whiche condemne or dispise natural Philosophy, whiche as Saincte. Paul affirmeth, leodeth vs to the firste, and as Kyng Salomon sayeth, dryueth vs to the seconde. And as the whole consente of all that haue been learned beareth wytnes, doth throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structe vs in the thyrde. For the excellencye of the creatures as heauen (whose course &amp; effectes Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticke and Astronomy declare) and earth, (whose compasse, scituacion, and alteracion Geometry and Phisicke publysheth) cause men to graunte not onely the excellency but also the almyghtynes of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and ruler. The vse and effectes of natural reason whose trueth and pleasantnes logicke and rethoricke dooe playnly set furth, teache vs how we differ from
<pb facs="3"/>
other creatures, for what end we were created, and how we maye behaue vs to come to that ende: for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thys laste poynte morall Philosophy is onely occupied, teachyng what is iuste, what honeste, what cumly, and what profitable. And as the excellencye of the creature maketh vs knowe the creator, whose name be blessed for euer, and as the vse of Reason in vs doth cause vs to knowe our seiues: so doeth the effectes and wurkyng of nature, comprehended by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son, teache vs to know and iudge of al other thynges, As firste of the elementes and of their powers in in them selues seuerally vnnixed, secondlye of theyr myxture in thynges, thirdlye of the effectes caused through their mixtures, which be playnly set furth in Phisiognomie, that is to saye knowledge of bodyes. Thys Phisiologie is learned two wayes: by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion or by apparence. Meditacyon is a conceyuyng in the mynde of suche thynges as cannot be perceyueo by any sence, as the substaunce of soules, spirites, and vertues. Apparaunce is the iudgemente whiche the senses haue of suche thynges as are obiected agaynst them: as the felyng, of substaunces: the hearynge of mouynges, the tast and smelling of qualities and mix<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures, the syghte, of forrmes and Colours. Whych sences although they be all excellente in theyr kindes for vs to iudge and discerne thinges by, yet the chefest truest and most ready is the syght, which is chiefly oc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cupyed about Phisiognomie, as we may cal it in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glysh, body skyl, or the knowledge of the temperaunce of bodyes by theyr shape &amp; fourmes, Which although it be of al creatures, both stones, plantes, verbes, fish foule, beastes and men, whose inward prop r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>yes and difference are knowen by the outwarde shapes: yet be cause that of all the rest man is most excellente, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it specially belongeth to hym. And of hys nature the Philosophers haue chefely sought, &amp; that because man is not onely the chefest good to manne, but also
<pb facs="4"/>
the chefest euil both to man &amp; al other thīges. Which causeth Tully in hys boke de natura deorum, to call Reason (which is the excellētest creature that god e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer made) the wurst of al other creatures: because that onely by man (the only possessour therof) al kīdes of iniquities and sinnes agaynst nature are diuised, and cōmitted. But to leaue Tully in hys errour til an other tyme because he distinguisheth not lust and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but attributeth the effectes of thone to the other, we wyll come to the matter concernyng Phisiognomy chefely in man, whiche teacheth the thyrde parte of wysdom, and first of prudence, that is: how to discerne the disposicions of al men by their fourme and shape, wherby we maye knowe whom to make oure frendes and familiers, whom to preserue frō beyng our foes, &amp; whom to auoyde as daungerous to haue to doe with all. Al these poyntes are marked by nature in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porcion and liniamentes of mans body, with diuers other more secrete, whiche are well knowen to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as knowe the arte, and specially in the face and handes, whiche as it should seme, god hath made opē and vncouerable because al men mighte at all tymes see and perceyue them. And to thende no man shoulde thynke thys incredible (as the grosse heades dooe of all thynges whiche they cannot comprehende) I wyll counsell them by thynges more euident, to credit such as be more obscure, yet not obscure of them selues but hidden from vs for lacke of searche. Can not we knowe by a mans countenaunce whan he is merye, whan sad, whan angry, whan fearfull, whan ashamed, and whan shameles? and that by newe and so dayne alteracions of the visage? Doe we not by the coloures and makyng iudge and not fayle of stomacke and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perties of horses, dogges, Cockes, &amp; other creatures? Doe not the Phisicions likewyse iudge the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, crasis, and diseases of the body by the colour
<pb facs="4"/>
and alteracion of the qualities and quantyties of partes? And how are all these thynges knowen but by consideryng what elemente is strongest and what weakest in the composicion. For the elementes wurke the same or muche lyke effectes in composicions of bodyes where they rule, as they haue in themselues simply, and so cause the proporcyons both of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres and liniamentes, and bryng furth the lyke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions and propertyes. Which what they bee, and how they differ, the best learned me from tyme to time haue searched, noted and put in wrytyng. Wherin as they are to be commended, wyth al other which haue followed their good example, so of al other nacyons I am forced most to disprayse myne owne country men, whiche haue leaft no monumente of their skil therin. For there are fewe other nacions but haue in theyr own tounge diuerse treatises therof set furth in print, wheras we (so farre as I haue seen), haue neuer a worde therof. And although I knowe that no begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynges can lacke disprayse, yet to set other on wurke therin, I haue wyth blynde bayarde aduentured to turne into Inglish, that whiche I haue founde in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tounges, wrytten by the best learned in that arte as Hermes, Aristotle, Rasis, Formica, Locius, Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Palemon, Conciliator and other, wishing that al mē at vacant tymes myghte occupye theyr wittes therin. And one thyng I warne (as I my selfe am war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned) not to Judge by any one part alone, but by all (or at the least) by many together: so shall we be sure not to bee deceiued. I meane we shall not bee deceyued to know the trueth of the naturall disposicion, and yet we maye fayle of the mans condicions, whiche So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates hymselfe well declared. For whan he with hys disciples about hym, asked of a Phisiognomer what condicions he perceyued to be in hym, Ah Socrates (quoth the Phisiognomer) thou art a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eachour, a craftye felow, subtyle, and geuen to all wyckednes.
<pb facs="5"/>
Thys answereso vexed Socrates Scolets, who know the contrary to be most true, that they rayled at the Phisiognomer, and woulde wyth strypes haue recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed hys paynes, had not Socrates stayed them. For it is all true that he sayeth (quoth Socrates) for such I am by nature, but I haue (as al other mē may haue if they wyl) a reasō and grace that ruleth about nature. By this it is euident that reasō and grace ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> brydle nature or turne the prouocacions therof vnto goodnes. For the cholericke or irefull man maye ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by grace represse hys lust, or els vse it well in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectyng of vices. The malicious man maye by gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> asswage hys lust, or els turne it agaynst the wycked and so furth of al other natural inclinacions. And therfore although a man may perfitly by Phisiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my declare the natural inclinacions of any man, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> may he not perfectly iudge hym except he know wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther he haue grace or no. And the lacke of thys consi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raunce hath brought thys science to be thought fals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> because grace brydeleth or vseth wel the naturall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clinacions of man. Thys well remembred, the boo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> maye be safely read, and thou (good Reader) therby mayst infallibly iudge the state and condicions of any manne. For the better knowledge wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I entende shortly to sette furth palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strye, In the meane ryme I beseche thee to take in good parte thys my rude en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours.</p>
