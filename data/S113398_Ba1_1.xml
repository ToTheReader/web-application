      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Eere, and with these (Christian Reader) I thought good for this present to end, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Almightie God through his goodnes of these miraculous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes as yet maketh no end. The addition of those miracles which at our <hi>Montaigu</hi> this last yeare haue been wrought, after due examination are now vnder the printers hands, whereof in tyme (by Gods help) I wil make thee partaker. Meane whyle with the deuout Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical woman make thy profit of these which here thou fyndest: and with her not onely inclyne thy hart to beleeue, but also lift vp thy voice to professe and confesse the happines of this sacred Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

at whose intercession they are wrought, and withall the infall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ble assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red authoritie of the Catholik Apostolik and Romane Church, in which onely, and for whose onely comfort, credit, and confirmatiō they are atchiued. Remēber who they were that would haue killed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and in deed killed our Lord and Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> whome therfore they should haue beleeued and honored, whē they saw by his most doubtles signes the truthe was so manifested and theyr im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie detected. Beware thou turn not with them to the reason of state, and earthly pollicie, saying: <hi>Neveniant Romani</hi> or such like, thereby diuerting thy self from that which principally thou art bound to regard, least through the iust iudgement of God, that which thou now most fearest apprehend thee, and that which should be thy soueraine obiect, hereafter faile thee. Doost thou not see how our Catholik doctrin by the same powerful hand at this present is vpholden and fostered, by which at the beginning it was planted and took root? Read read, and see Yet for thyn own good I am to increat thee, to auoid all curiositie in thy

reading, as thou seest how I haue auoided it in my translation: endeuouring rather truly then trimly to expresse my Author, as he hath labored purely &amp; punctually to deliuer vs the truthe. Lykewyse be thou careful, not curious in learning the truthe, and Christiāly coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious in confessing the truthe, that in the hower of thy chiefest peril the truthe may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer thee.</p>
