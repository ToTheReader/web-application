   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Was in a doubt after I had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
this treatise, whether I
should publish it, or pull it a
peeces, I thought it too base
to bee read, and better worth
than to rende, but seeing I
haue bestowed some paines in
the pēning, I meane to hazard
my hap in the printing, hee
shall write well that can satisfie all, and he as bad that can
please none, if Christ could not content al, being a God,
it is no maruaile wee mislike many, being but men; In
times past they did not care how plaine a thing were, so
it were profitable, and now we force not how bad it be, so
it be pleasant, it is this that maketh so many writers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their time more wantonly than wiselie, because
they see a vaine trifle is more accepted thā a diuine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.
If it bee so, that those bookes which are most light
are best liked, and those men that employ their learning
to leuitie, are most laudable, then the tenor will but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
the title of my booke: for it will not be worth the
reading: but (good Reader) thou must obserue in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the manner of it according to the matter, wee must
not paynt the Scriptures with superfluous speaches, as
men doo their owne fictions after their fancies: for the
maiestie of the word requireth modesty in the wrter,
this is not vnlike that gem Chalazias, which will be cold
though it be cast in the fire or the Chorall, which is best
without colouring, those be like water which is apt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
coulour as it hath course, or the Camelion which
<pb facs="4"/>
wil change it self into any hewe it beholds, but this I am
sure, there is none can afford so fruitefull a phrase as the
Bible, though they practise neuer so fine tearmes in
their bookes; I speak this not to that end I would glose
to get credit by my words, or to disgrace those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
it by their workes, but to shew what difference
there is betweene a pleasant story (which wee may han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
according to our humors) and a graue discourse
(which must be penned according to the platforme.)
Well seeing my former attempts haue found such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
my care shall bee the lesse for the latter, for this I
knowe, that the enuious will spite, bee a thing neuer so
speciall, the flatterer will sooth, be it neuer so simple, the
idle will inuay, be they neuer so ignorant, and there are
some will finde fault, be they neuer so foolish; (were not
he a wise man could stop al their mouthes?) but my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is not to satisfie such readers which bee rude, but
reasonable, not the curious but the curteous, the one
will excuse and couer a fault with discretion, the
other will but carpe and cauill without
cause: so farwell. <hi>Bury S. Edmond
