   <p>RIght Reuerend. When I first prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched these Sermons, I little thought to haue put them forth to publike view, yet such hath bene the importunitie of some of my best hearers, in mouing me to penne them, or some others of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; As I might haue bene thought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and vncurteous, if I had altogether denied that their godly and earnest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. And the rather was I perswaded by them, because it was hoped that the publishing of these, might yeeld some bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, not onely to those persons who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard them, but likewise to those, who hereafter should reade them.</p>
   <p>It is well knowne that the papists make small account of hearing Gods word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched they hope to be saued, rather by sight then by hearing.</p>

Wherein as they doe most blasphemously preferre their owne inuented idoll, before Gods most holy ordinance: So doe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray their ignorance, touching the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie and efficacie of the word preached. If they would duely consider the scope and doctrine of this parable, they might easily perceiue, that the hearing of the word, is as necessarily required for the direction of their liues, and the saluation of their soules: As the sowing of the ground with good seed, is necessarily required of them that would reape a plentifull crop at har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest. And that it is not the sight of their abhominables doll, but the reuerend hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gods sacred word, that must make them fruitfull in all good workes.</p>
   <p>Againe, wee cannot but acknowledge, that the Lord hath sent many skilfull and painefull Husbandmen, to some his fields with vs: who according to their office and
<pb facs="4"/>dutie, sow it in due season, after a good maner, and with the best seede. And yet it yeeldeth litle fruite. People heare much, learne litle, and practise lesse. Which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imputed to the want of good prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but at her to the want of good hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: the fault is rather in the ground, then in the sower, or in the seede. The seede is good, and great store is sowne, but the ground is barren. The doctrine is sound, and the maner of teaching profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the people heare amisse, and so for want of good hearing, loose the fruite of many good sermons; because the profit of hearing, dependeth on the maner of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. A medicine fitly prescribed and rightly compounded, looseth his vertue in curing the patients disease, if it be not duly administred, and orderly receiued. We to our great griese loose our labour in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and the people to their great perill, loose their labour in hearing, because they heare amisse. As therefore I was at first enduced to preach those sermons. so was I afterward perswaded to penne them, that by them the simpler sorte (for whose sake onely I do now publish them I might haue some plain direction how to heare for their profit.</p>

I thinke few will complaine of the vnprofitablenes of our labours, but
<pb facs="5"/>those who doe reioyce thereat, and would haue vs remoued, lest our labours should become more fruitfull hereafter: who would rather haue the countrey still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine addicted to popery and impiety, then brought to the obedience of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. How fruitfull our labours haue bene, your Lordship can better iudge then any of them. Yet must we needes confesse that the fruitfulnes thereof, hath bene, and still is greatly hindered by two sortes of persons, namely by popish priests, and profane Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. The priests like <hi>Samballat</hi> and <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biah,</hi>
      <note place="margin">nehem. 4, 7, 8</note> hinder vs in edifying the Lords Temple, and labour to pull downe, as fast as we build vp: like the old seducers, <hi>they creepe into houses, and lead captiue,<note place="margin">2, Tim: 3, 6</note> simple women laden with sins, and led with diuers lusts.</hi>
      <note place="margin">2, Tim: 38</note> They withstand vs, as <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres withstood Moses.</hi> Yea they <hi>subuert whole hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,<note place="margin">Tim: 1, 11</note> teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre.</hi> They are sent by the Pope to recouer, if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the reuenews, rents, &amp; tributes which once he had out of this kingdome, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other meanes wherby to liue, haue raised a gainefull trade of seducing, and

      </gap>e them by their footesteps, and take notice of their presence by their practises, euen as we may discerne where a snaile hath crept on the wall, by the slime which it leaueth behind it. Who maryeth our recusants, who baptizeth their children, but they? Not one recusant is maryed, not one of their children is baptized by our ministers. Shall we thinke that they who hold Matrimonie to be a sacrament, would liue together as man and wife, and neuer be maried? Can we imagine that they who hold baptisme to be absolutely necessarie to salvation, will suffer all their children to remaine vnbaptized? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they verifie the Poets saying: <hi>In veti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nefas gens humana ruit.</hi> Before we had any statute lawe against mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages and baptizings by popish priests, it
<pb facs="6"/>was a rare thing to heare of any one who offended that way: But since that law was made, it hath bene a rare thing in this countrey, to heare of a Recusants ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage solemnized, or a Recusants childe baptized by any of our ministers. So as if our law-makers had foreseene the issue, it may be they would haue forborne the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that law, least as <hi>Solon</hi> thought of a law to be made against Parricides, they should put men in mind of such an offence. What is the reason of this their wilfulnes? Not onely impunitie, our lawes made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, being like an vntimely birth, dead assoone as borne, and wanting exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution which is the life of them: but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially because the priests doe euermore excite them to disobedience, and will ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize them for holy confessours; for that their contemptuous breach of our lawes.</p>
   <p>And whence commeth it, that scarce one of an hundreth, of all our Recusants and non-communicants, would come to take the oath of allegiance, when they were therevnto lawfully called? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the priests disswade them from it, by authoritie of the Popes bulles, and by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Cardinalls bookes.</p>
