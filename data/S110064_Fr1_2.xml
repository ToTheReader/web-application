I thought good to present the same to your woorship; for that your selfe hath beene an eye witnesse, how I was there challenged, and how through the grace of God, and the trueth of so good a cause as I delt in, I defended my self To auoyde ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the speeches of people, who now a dayes will iudge lightly, and condemne quickly, because I was there called foorth, somewhat in woords touched, and yet I thanke God nothing disprooued: I esteemed it a pointe of wisdome, to laye their obstinate endes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

to the view of all, not sparing my selfe in the woords that were vsed against me, which will cause the godly and vertuous to account them as they were, and me as I am. This breefely compacted together, I present to your woorships perusing, as my defence against slaunderous tongues, in that I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported nothing therein, but the meere truthe. Thus desiring God to blesse your woorship with all yours: in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie I remaine.</p>
