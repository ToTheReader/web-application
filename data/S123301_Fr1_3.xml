   <p>OH most gracious and most glorious God, before whom the Sunne and the Moone become as darknesse, the blessed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels stand amased, and the glorious Cherubims are glad that they may cover and hide their faces, as not daring to behold that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible greatnesse, and that infinite goodnesse which thou art; with what confidence shall we forlorne sinners be ever once able to appeare before thy all seeing providence, that terrible and angry countenance, that sinne-revenging justice of thine, which is so fierce and terrible, that it will shake the heavens, melt the mountaines, dry up the seas, and make the tallest Cedars in Lebanon to tremble: Good Lord, where shall we hide our selves from thy presence; masses of corruption, mountaines of sinne, dead and dry trees, fit fewell for thy fierce wrath to worke upon: if we should climbe up into heaven to hide us from thee, thou art there, or goe downe into the bottome and depth of hell, thou art there also; or take the wings of the morne, and fly to the utmost part of the seas even there also will thy allseing eye behold us, and thy right hand will quickly visit and finde us out: we will therefore here dissolve and melt our selves into a floud and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of many teares, bewailing and bemoaning our wofull and miserable estate; for albeit by reason of that soule Chaos, and staine of naturall corruption and originall sinne, we have deserved long since to have had the sweete issue of all thy good blessings to be stopped and dried up, thy milde and gentle corrections to be turned into the sodaine execution of bloody tortures and fearefull judgements upon us even in this life, and at our departing out of this world to be plunged everlastingly into a pit of destruction, there to be fryed and scorched with Satan and his Angels for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. And yet for all this, O Lord, wee have never ceased to adde oyle unto this flame, and to blow up the coales of thy feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full displeasure, through the hot and eager pursuit of many loud crying actuall sinnes and transgressions; so that from the crowne of the head to the sole of the foote, there is not one place sound
<pb facs="4"/> or whole within us, but we are all full of sores and swellings, and botches, full of sinne, full of corruption: our understandings which should have knowne thee to be our true God, and him whom thou hast sent Iesus Christ our Redeemer, these are blinded and missed with ignorance and doubting, our affections which should have beene good guides to have directed our feete into the way of peace, they are become swift messengers of Satan to buffet us; our bodies which should have beene sweet Temples for thy blessed Spirit to dwell and lodge in, they are sinks of sinne, and cages of filthy birds: our eyes O God, are like open win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and doores to receive sinne, our hearts like common Innes to lodge sinne, our heads like skilfull Politicians to contrive sinne, our tongues smooth and sweet Oratours to pleade for the maintaining of sinne, and all our hands like stout souldiers and couragious Champions to fight in the defence of sinne. Thus have we waged and managed warre against thee our God, ever since we were borne, so that now thou maist justly spue us out of thy mouth, cut us off in the midst of our sinnes, come amongst us this very present, and binde us hand and foot, and at the end of these few and miserable dayes send us all into hell together, that so Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan might pay us our wages onely, whom thus long we have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed and served: thus emptying our selves from all trust and confidence in the arme of flesh, we fly unto thee O God, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of our hope, and the tower built for our defence, with many deepe sighes and groanes from our perplexed consciences and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cased soules, most humbly intreating thee to be gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to all our sinnes, for they are wondrous great, make it thy glory to passe by and to winke at them; poure into our soules the oyle of thy mercies, supple our hard and dry hearts with the sweete influence of thy best graces, and cure all our swelling wounds with the true balme of <hi>Gilead;</hi> purge (good Lord) and cleanse all the polluted and infected corners of our hearts, that though at this day our sinnes be as olde as <hi>Adam,</hi> as numberlesse as the starres of heaven, as high as the tallest Cedars in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, Lord plucke them up by the rootes, bury them in everlasting forgetfulnesse, that they may never stoppe the issue of thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, nor draw downe upon us the vialls of thy wrath, nor be a wound and griefe to our troubled consciences in this life, or
<pb facs="4"/> worke despaire in us at the end of our dayes; nor stand up in judgement to be the utter ruine and condemnation of our soules and bodies at the last day. Good Lord prepare us all for a better life, fit us all for the kingdome of thy Sonne Christ Iesus, guide us all with thy blessed Spirit, tutor us out of thy holy word, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us by thy mercifull corrections, and by thy fatherly blessings, wed our affections, and knit our hearts more neere unto thee in newnesse of life, than ever heretofore they have beene: that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as becommeth thy obedient children and servants an holy and a religious remnant of our dayes, we may by thy grace and mercy be partakers of a joyfull and a comfortable death, and after death of a glorious resurrection to everlasting life &amp; peace among thy Saints. Neither do we pray to thee for our selves only, but for all people and Nations of the earth, but more particularly for the place in which we live, and therin according to our bounden duty for thy servant &amp; our Soveraign, <hi>Charles,</hi> by thy special providence King of <hi>Great Britaine, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Defender of the most true, Ancient, Catholicke and Apostolike faith, and in all causes, and over all persons within these his Majesties Realmes and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions next under thee and thy Sonne Christ Iesus supreme Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, adde unto his dayes, as thou didst unto the dayes of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> that he may enjoy a long and a prosperous reigne over us; and in the meane time remember him in goodnesse for the good he hath done already to thy Church. Bestow the sweetest of thy blessings upon our gracious Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> our hopefull Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and the rest of those royall branches beyond the seas, season them in their young and tender yeares with thy feare, that they may be great in thy favour: and if it may stand with thine eternall Decree, let us never want a holy and a religious man of that house and line to governe the scepters of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and to maintaine the preaching of thy glorious Gospell within these his Majesties Realmes and Dominions so long as the Sunne and Moone endures. Blesse our King with an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, valiant and a religious Councell and Nobility, blesse him with a learned, painfull, and a zealous Clergy, by what names or titles soever they be called, whether they be Arch-Bishops, or Bishops, and all other painfull labourers in this thy Vineyard: blesse him with a wise, prudent, and a religious Gentry: blesse him
<pb facs="5"/> with a peaceable, a loyall and a religious Commonalty, and good God we beseech thee to shower downe thy blessings upon the right hand and upon the left to them whom it hath pleased thee to send to this Congregation, that by the blessing of thy good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit whensoever they shall stand on thy Mountaine to deliver a Message from thee, give them good Father, (what wilt thou give them?) give them wise and understanding hearts, that they may open to thy people the wondrous things of thy law; good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touch their tongues with a coale from thy holy Altar, that by the blessing of thy holy Spirit they may be able to worke some holinesse in the hearts of a sinfull and unbeleeving people: and cut downe the head and strength of some sinne that remaineth in us: and to this end and purpose make them sound in thy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, terrible in thy threatnings sweet in thy comforts, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and effectuall in all thy perswasions; and mercifull Father make thy word like the bow of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and like the sword of <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Gideon,</hi> that never returned empty from the blood of the slaine, and the fat of the mighty.</p>
   <p>Lastly, we come unto thee for our selves againe thy most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy servants, that are here assembled in a reverent feare of thy most holy and blessed name, most humbly intreating thee in Iesus Christ to be gracious and mercifull to all our sinnes, and to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually present with thy blessed Spirit in the midst of us all, and grant that thy word may drop and distill upon our tender consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, like raine upon the mowen grasse, and as dew comes down from heaven to water the earth; take away the scales of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from all blind and dark understandings, remove farre from us all lets and hinderances whereby the blessed seed of thy word hath bin to many and sundry times made unfruitfull in the hearts of sinfull and unbelieving people: and to every soule that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in thy house this day, or at any other time, grant us all holy diligence to seeke thee, godly wisdome to know thee, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied understanding to finde thee aright; that so thy word may prove the sweet savour of life unto everlasting life, through Iesus Christ our Lord and only Saviour; in whose most holy and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed name we are bold to conclude these our weake and imperfect prayers in that perfect forme of prayer which Christ hath taught us, saying, <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi>
