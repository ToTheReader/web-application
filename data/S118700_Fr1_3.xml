(As for my selfe I seeke no higher digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then to be reported to set forth a trueth: and therefore without any wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted cloquence, I make bold to offer the vse of the Globe, to the exquisite vewe of your curious eyes: (though farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour as I suspect to some mens expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) to the end such grosse enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might bee amended, as often times in diuers haue bene discouered. Who for want of right conceat of things by them attempted: haue in the ayer built such fortresses, as haue without assalts woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their louing enemies. But happely
<pb facs="4"/> such men wil now retire, and arme them selues better against the next assault, lest they be like to the dogs in the capitall of <hi>Rome:</hi> which were placed to the end, that if by night spoylers should ariue, they might sound a warning. For, true it is, that by night these barke out false Allaromes at their enimies: but if by day, they barke likewise at friends: I hope ye wil iudge them worthy to haue their legs broken. which things I leaue to your gentle interpretation. Nothing misdoubting, but if in this tract either anything bee escaped contrarie to my will: or omitted not satisfying your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation: ye wil aequally suffer the same. For if ye receaue the fruites of my labor and care of your commoditie, I require no more. Wherefore my trauaile I bequeath to your discreet consideration, and your selues to the protection of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God.</p>
