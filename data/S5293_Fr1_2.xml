   <head>TO THE RIGHT worshipfull Sir THOMAS MIDLETON Knight, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman of this Citie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship may well account mee bold to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this my bare Translation vnto you but indeede I know not well how to auoid the imputation, because that if I should haue presented it to any other, I
<pb facs="3"/>
must haue done you wrong, as the case standeth; for may it please you to vnderstand, that being in your Sonnes studie at Grayes Inne (vnto whom for a while I read the French tongue,) he chanced amongst other bookes to find out the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall of the two last Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of this booke, which in our perusing, J in my poore iudgement found to be such worthy matters, that I could not content my selfe with the reading of them, but bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the booke of him, and
<pb facs="3"/>
my wast times tooke occasion (as well for my owne further satisfaction, as to impart it vnto others, my particular friends,) to translate it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our English tongue, not meaning to haue had it published in print. Which when your said Son (whom J haue still found to bee a louer of such godly workes) vnderstood, hee was very desirous to haue it printed, alledging that it could not chuse but bee verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb facs="4"/>
whereunto (although somewhat vnwilling in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of my weaknesse in the performance thereof) yet at last I condescended, and to amplify the volume, annexed another excellent Treatise to comfort the sicke, written by the same Author, which for order sake I haue placed before the other two, and do present them together vnto your Worship, as belonging vnto you of right; beseeching you to take them in as good part as they are willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="4"/>
offered, and to haue in mind in your iudiciall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that although I haue not shewed the part of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Orator in setting of it forth in our newe refined Phrases, yet that J haue done the duty of a faithfull Translator, in following the originall word for word so neere as with sence J could. And if this my first little labour shall proue agreeable and profitable, I shall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinke it well bestowed, but also be much encouraged, to
<pb facs="5"/>
goe on with the rest of the same Authors works which will bee of a greater conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, wherein at the request of some, J am already well entred. And thus beseeching the Almighty to grant you plentie of his Graces, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you, and all yours to his most blessed protection. From my house in London this <hi>14.</hi> of May. <hi>1611.</hi>
