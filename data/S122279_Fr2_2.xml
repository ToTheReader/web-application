   <head>THE PREFACE TO
the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or so much as shewes and spectacles of
this nature, are vsually registred, among
the memorable acts of the time, beeing
Complements of state, both to shew
magnificence and to celebrate the feasts
to our greatest respects: it is expected (according now
fo the custome) that I, beeing imployed in the busines,
should publish a discription and forme of the late
Mask, wherewithall it pleased the Queenes most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Maiestie to solemnize the creation of the high
and mightie Prince Henry, Prince of Wales, in regard
to preserue the memorie thereof, and to satisfie their
desires, who could haue no other notice, but by others
report of what was done. Which I doe not, out of a
desire, to be seene in pamphlets, or of forwardnes to
shew my inuētion therin: for I thank God, I labour not
with that disease of ostentation, nor affect to be known
to be the man <hi>digito{que} monstrarier, hic est,</hi> hauing my
name already wider in this kind, then I desire, and more
in the winde then I would. Neither doe I seeke in the
divulging hereof, to giue it other colours then those it
wore, or to make an Apologie of what I haue done:
knowing, howsoeuer, it must passe the way of censure,
<pb facs="17"/>
whereunto I see all publications (of what nature
soeuer) are liable. And my long experience of the
world hath taught me this, that neuer Remonstrances
n<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> Apologies could euer get ouer the streame of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
to doe good on the other side, where contrarie
affection, and conceipt had to doe: but onely serued to
entertaine their owne partialnesse, who were fore-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
and so was a labour in vaine. And it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
an argument of pusilanimitie, and may make <hi>vt
iud <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> nostrum, metus videatur,</hi> and render a good
cause suspected by too much labouring to defend it,
which might be the reason that some of the late grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Princes of Christendome would neuer haue their
vndertakings made good by such courses, but with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
indured (and in a most wittie age) the greatest
batterie of paper that could possibly be made, &amp; neuer
once recharged the least ordinance of a pen against it,
counting it their glorie to do whilest other talked. And
shall we who are the poore Inginers for shadowes, &amp;
frame onely images of no result, thinke to oppresse the
rough censures of those, who notwithstanding all our
labour will like according to their taste, or seeke to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid
them by flying to an Army of Authors as idle as
ourselues? Seeing there is nothing done or written, but
incounters with detraction and opposition, which is
an excellent argument of all our imbecillities &amp; might
allay our presumption, when we shall see our greatest
knowledges not to be fixt, but rowle according to the
vncertaine motion of opinion, and controwleable by
any surly shew of reason, which we find is double ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and strikes euery way alike. And therefore I do not
see why any man should rate his owne at that valew,
<pb facs="17"/>
and set so low prises vpon other mens abilities. L'<hi>hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
vaut l'homme,</hi> a man is worth a man, and none hath
gotten so high a station of vnderstanding, but he shall
find others that are built on an equall floore with him,
and haue as far a prospect as he, which when al is done,
is but in a region subiect to al passiōs &amp; imperfections.</p>
   <p>And for these figures of mine, if they come not drawn
in all proportions to the life of antiquity (from whose
tyrannie, I see no reason why we may not emancipate
our inuentions, and be as free as they, to vse our owne
images) yet I know them such as were proper to the
busines, and discharged those parts for which they ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
with as good correspondencie, as our appointed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
would permit.</p>
   <p>But in these things wherein the onely life consists in
shew: the arte and inuention of the Architect giues the
greatest grace, and is of most importance: ours, the least
part and of least note in the time of the performance
thereof, and therefore haue I interserted the discription
of the artificiall part which only speakes M. <hi>Inago Iones.</hi>
