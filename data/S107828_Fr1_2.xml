         <hi>To the Christian Reader:</hi> Grace mercy and peace be multiplied in Iesus Christ.</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>CHristian Reader, I do here present unto thee, three Treatises joyned together in one book: which I wish may proue as profitable to the Church and people of God, as they are needful for this age, &amp; estate of things, wherein we liue. Whereabout there are some few things that I would advertise thee, before thou come to read the treatises thēselues.</p>
   <p n="1">
      <hi>1.</hi> That thou wouldest obserue, how our Lord Iesus Christ, giving ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to his Church under the Gospel, hath derived them from the practise &amp; particulars had among the Iewes of old, varying therefrō as litle as might be, in such a different estate. For example, as they had their Synagogues, so haue we our particular churches and assemblies, Psal. 74, 8. Mat. 4.23. &amp; 9.35. with Act. 20.28. Col. 4.16. Rev. 2.1. &amp;c. They had in their Synagogues the ministration of the word of God and prayer: so likewise haue we. Act. 13.14.15. &amp; 15.21. &amp; 16.13. with Act. 2.42. 1 Cor. 14.3.15.16. 1 Tim. 2.1. &amp; 4.13. They had for ordinarie Sacraments &amp; seales of Gods covenant, Circumcisiō &amp; the Passeover:<note place="margin">See M. Brought. on Dan. 9.25, 26, 27. with that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth out of R. Moses ben Maym. in Asure bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah perek 13. And Ioseph. de bel. Iud. 6. cap. 31. And Paulus Burgens. in Psal. 112. &amp; Tremell. &amp; Scaliger de emendat. tempor. l. 6. And Beza on Matt. 26.20.</note> we haue likewise baptisme &amp; the Lords supper answering thereunto. Touching baptisme also, our Lord took it (as some haue observed) frō the Jewes baptizing of Proselytes, &amp; washing of thēselues frō uncleannes, which was knowen &amp; usual among thē. And the Lords supper likewise, frō a custome observed among the Iewes at the Passeover: at the end of the celebration wherof, the fathers of families were woont to take a cake of bread, &amp; after the blessing thereof, to break &amp; distribute it to the cōmunicāts: as also after that, a cup of wine, in like sort: Whereunto that may haue refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which David speaketh, saying: <hi>What shal I rēder to the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I vvil take the cup of salvation, and cal on the name of the Lord.</hi> Psa. <hi>116.12, 13.</hi> They had Sacrifices, which led thē to Christ, who was then to come to dye for our sinnes: we haue in stead thereof the Lords supper, which cōfirmeth unto us that Christ now is come, &amp; hath dyed for our transgressions: the memorial whereof we doe stil obserue, shewing forth his death, til he come againe at that great day. Lev. 1. &amp;c. Esa. 53.7 — 10. Dan. 9.24.26.27. with Ioh. 1.29. 1 Cor. 5.7. &amp; 10.16. &amp; 11.23. &amp;c. They had the Sabbaths and Feast dayes for the solemne worship of God, in stead whereof we haue the Lords day. Exo. 20.8. Lev. 23. ch. Esa. 66.23. Zac. 14.16 — 19. with Act. 20.6.7. Rev. 1.10. They had Priests for offering the Sacrifices that were types of Christs death: we haue Pastours for celebration of the Lords supper, a memorial of his death &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion now performed, and still thankfully to be remembred. Exod. 28. Lev. 1. Num. 16. 2 Chron. 35.1. Ezech. 43, &amp; 44. &amp; 45. &amp; 46, &amp;c. with 1 Cor. 10.
<pb facs="3"/>
16. &amp; 11.23. Ephes. 4.11.12. Col. 4.17. They had Priests &amp; Levites; we Pastours and Teachers for the work of the Ministerie. Num. 18. Deut. 33.8 — 11. 2 Chro. 35 ch. Esa. 66.21. with Ephe. 4.11.12. Rom. 12.7.8.</p>
   <p>They had for government, besides Priests and Levites, Ruling Elders al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, of the chief of the Fathers of Families among them: and we haue for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, besides the Pastours and Teachers, the Ruling Elders also taken out of the people, in that behalf. And so, as they had a Synedrion or Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of Elders, consisting of Priests, Levites, and Fathers of Families of the people among thē: so haue we a Presbyterie or company of Elders, consisting likewise of Pastours, Teachers, and Ruling Elders, chosen out of the people for the churches government. Deu. 19.17. 2 Chro. 19.8. Jer. 19.1. with 1 Tim. 5.17. Rom. 12.7.8. 1 Cor. 12, 28. Act. 20.17.28. Heb. 13.7.17.24. They had for the Treasurie the Leviticall treasurers &amp; other the like, to whō that busines was committed: we haue the Deacons for that use &amp; service in that church. 1 Chro. 26.20— 28. 2 Chron. 31.12. &amp;c. Neh. 13, 13. with Act. 6. 1 — 6. 1 Tim. 3.<hi>8</hi>— 13. They had for censures, <hi>Niddui, Cherem,</hi> and <hi>Schammatha,</hi> Seclusion, Cutting off, &amp; utter devoting to judgment till the Lords comming at that day. We also haue the use of Suspension, of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, &amp; of Anathema Maranatha. Num. 19 ch. Esa. 66.5. Iude v. 14 22.23. Luke 6.22. 2 Thes. 3.6.14.15. <hi>1</hi> Tim. <hi>1.20.</hi> 1 Cor. 5.5.11.12.13. &amp; 16.22. Finally, they had Ierusalem, where God set his name, and the Temple where he dwelt among them, &amp; whither he required them to come with their sacrifices, &amp;c. Which typed out unto us not onely the Ʋniversall church, but the particular churches also of Christians, where the Lord setteth his name, &amp; dwelleth among us by his spirit, calling us thither to eate at his Table, and in all things to worship &amp; serue him according to his word, Deu. 12.5, 6.7. &amp; 16.2. Psa. 26.6, 7, 8. &amp; 27.4. &amp; 36.8 9. &amp; 65.4. &amp; 132. Esa. 27.13. &amp; 66.23. Dan. 8, 11.13.14. &amp; 11, 31. with Mat. 28.19.20. <hi>1</hi> Cor. 3. 16.17. &amp; 2 Cor. 6.16. <hi>2</hi> Thes. <hi>2.4.</hi> Rev. 3.<hi>12.</hi> &amp; 21.<hi>2.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
   <p>By this may also appear, how M. Ainsw. in his plea against M. Smyth, about the Ministerie, worship, &amp; government of the Church, wrote once well (if he could haue kept unto it) whē he asked him, saying: <hi>What one thing haue we in the worship of God, which Israel had not before us?</hi> M. Ainsw. Defence of Scrip. pag. 10. Which being well observed, wil giue good light to many matters now in question. But I wil proceed to other things.</p>
   <p n="2">
      <hi>2.</hi> Whereas sometimes I alledge many Scriptures together, my meaning is not, that each of them proue the point in hand; but that to this end they are to be compared &amp; layd together, &amp; corfirmation of the truth to be derived frò thence, by consequence, &amp; discourse of reason, as in questions of religion is woonted to be done.</p>
   <p n="3">
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>3.</hi> The questions that I set down are divers: &amp; abort them there is great diversitie of judgment. Touching some of thē I set down reasons but one way, &amp; answer the objections to the contrarie. For others of thē sometimes I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound reasons both waies: &amp; so leaue al to be examined &amp; judged of, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of God. At first, I had thought onely to haue insisted upon the points thēselues, without mention of any adversaries, or confutation of any Opposites by name. But afterward, upon divers waighty reasons, I chaunged my purpose &amp; course: &amp; of manie Opposites haue named a few, &amp; giuen a litle tast of the manifold Opposition that is made against us: noting withall a few instances of the many shifts, errors, contradictions, &amp; abuse of Scriptures, into which they run &amp; are caryed exceedingly.<note n="‘" place="margin">M. Ainsw. Animadv. &amp;c.</note> Where also I could mention (if I would) sundrie manifest untruths published by some: which are so very untrue, as I need not produce any other proof or witnes herein, but the publike records of Amsterdam stil extant, &amp; the testimonie of such as were present, and heard and saw what was done: not excepting M. Ainsw. owne followers. Whom now moreover by this occasion I doe once againe exhort to consider their waies &amp; estate in their heart: &amp; to cal to mynd, both how they haue ben wanting in yeelding &amp; bearing witnes to the truth, and how long now they haue continued in their schismaticall and scandalous Division frō the Church whereof they were: and that both for the matter, time, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thereof: besides many other sinnes and transgressions, which they run into withall. A just recompence of their contumacie, frō vvhich they would not be reclaimed by any meanes. Neither doth it availe thē, that some others joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hand in hand with thē, becoming (as Simeon and Levi did) brethren in evill. In such cases we must still remēber and obserue what Iacob the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark said, <hi>O my soule, come not thou into their secret: unto their</hi>
      <note n="†" place="margin">Or, Church as M. Ains. doth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally translat the word KAHAL: which here he doth not so. Note it.</note>
      <hi>assembly myne honour be not thou united.</hi> Gen. 49.5.6.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Now of the Anabaptists, &amp; Arminians, I need not speak particularly, Some of their opinions here following I haue noted and refuted,<note place="margin">Gen. 37.9. Phil. 2.15. Iudg. 5, 31. Prov. 4.18. Dan. 8, 10.12. &amp; 11.31.32. Act. 2.20.40. Rev. 6.12.</note> both for the more clearing of the truth, &amp; the further helping of others against their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which do now here so much trouble &amp; endaunger the estate of church &amp; Common wealth. The Reformed churches, may for the faith of Christ which they professe, wel be estemed (as Israel was of old) in their measure &amp; degrees, to be as the Sunne and moone, the lights of the world: Which should therfore stil increase in al shining light of the truth, &amp; holynes, shyning more &amp; more unto the perfit day, yea til they go forth as the Sunne in his might: &amp; should be the more carefull hereof, seeing the Scrtpture also teacheth, how euen<note n="‘" place="margin">Rev. 16.8. &amp;c. Or, by the Sunne here, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand hotte persecution. Sal. Song. 1. 6. Mat. 13.6, 21.</note>
      <hi>upon the Sunne, shal a vial of Gods wrath be powred out,</hi> before the utter extyrpation &amp; destuction of the Beasts throne &amp; kingdome: &amp; that the day is a comming, wherein <hi>the moone shalbe confounded,
<pb facs="4"/>
&amp; the Sunne ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reigne in mount Zion, &amp; in Ierusalem, &amp; before his auncients gloriously. Esa. 24.23.</hi> Which whether it shalbe at the conversion of the Jewes to the Christian faith (which now hasteneth on) time and the work of God will manifest: As also, in what manner shalbe verified that which the same Prophet hath foretold, saying: <hi>The light of the Moone shalbe as the light of the Sunne, and the light of the Sunne shalbe seuen fold, as the light of seuen dayes, in the day that the Lord byndeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="5">5. In the meane time, who doth not obserue and lament, that among the Lutherans and Reformed churches every where, there should still remain so many &amp; great corruptions, errors, superstitions, &amp; other transgressions, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed or amended in the worship of God, &amp; conversation of men? Which threaten some heavy judgment of God, not to be far off, if we meete not the Lord with true and unfeyned repentance in time.</p>
   <p>In which regard, al are to be exhorted, carefully &amp; without delay, to think on their wayes, &amp; to turne their feet into the Testimonies of the Lord. Buy the truth (sayth<note n="‘" place="margin">Pro. 23.23.</note> Salomon) but sell it not: Part with any thing for it, but part not with it for any thing. Enter in at the strait gate (sayth<note n="”" place="margin">Matt. 7.13.24.</note> Christ) for wide is the gate, &amp; broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, &amp; many there be which goe in thereat: but strait is the gate, &amp; narrow is the way which leadeth to life, &amp; few there be that find it. Finally, let us all labour (what in us is) to grow in grace, &amp; in the knowledge and obedience of the truth, in all things: not regarding the applause or displeasure of men: but endevouring to please God more and more, &amp; not onely to know &amp; profeesse in word, but to obserue and practise in deed whatsoever the Lord hath commanded us: knowing that<note n="”" place="margin">Deu. 4, 1, 2. Matt. 28.20. Ioh. 7.17. &amp; 13, 17. 1 Tim 6, 13.14.</note> this hath the promise of blessing &amp; acceptance with the Lord. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if these my poore labours shal any waie help and further thee, giue praise unto God: and remember me in thy prayers to the Lord:</p>
