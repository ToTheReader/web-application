   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O tell you, that I haue tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated, this booke shall bee an honor to the Author, but a hazard (peraduenture) of your opinions to my selfe. But seeing a desire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit others, must not looke at those curious obseruatiōs, which displease some: <hi>I</hi> thought there was small losse, if I benefitted the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort, though <hi>I</hi> gaine vnto my selfe the scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing reprehension of some few; there are in my opinion few bookes of a more generall information or fitter for this age; this age, this vnthankeful age, wherin all states (almost) are infected with this poyson, to be discontent;
<pb facs="4"/>
and by reason of their discontentments to be vnthankefull; for there is no euill, that man sooner apprehendeth, then the opinion of his own; which maketh him (for the most part) an vniust esteemer of what good, he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; so consequētly vnthankfull vnto him that gaue it. If <hi>I</hi> could cure this disease, this naturall and contagious disease (which grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the increase of sence and decay of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue) <hi>I</hi> should in some thinges reforme their iudgements, whom I know to bee farre wiser then my selfe. I will not tell you (a thing too well known) how all conditions are vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but I will say with my Author (which may serue to cure them) that the great and awfull ruler of men, times, and things; the liberall and wife disposer of all that are annexed to mans life, <hi>Knoweth how to deuide, much better, then wee can chuse.</hi> In this Treatise, thou shalt find much rypened wisedōe to cure this sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. If thou vnderstandest the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, reade him, as he wrote; for he receiueth but darkenesse, and a blemish from my penne, Faults which <hi>I</hi> doe vnto him, yet against my
<pb facs="5"/>
will. If thou vnderstandest him not, read this, for it is better to heare a good tale euill told, then not at all; it is labour to me, more then to thy selfe; If thou thinkest, that <hi>I</hi> am wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie small thankes, <hi>I</hi> know, in this <hi>I</hi> deserue as little blame; vnthankefulnesse is that fault, which is reproued in this Treatise; <hi>I</hi> would bee sorrie this fault should bee in thee, if it be, it is dangerous, seeke to cure it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this well, and to mee, thou art thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enough; greater benefits require grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thankes; consider to whom thou art most bound, and make him the contemplation of thy thankefulnesse; so shalt thou make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, not to be losses; nor thy selfe vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie.</p>
   <p>This which thou readest translated into thy owne tongue (for thy vnderstanding) is the worke of a verie wise, and great man; and such a one (as in my weake opinion) to Chronicle the ciuill warres of that great Kingdome <hi>Fraunce,</hi> hath not in the circuit of his large Empire, any more iudiciall, or more eloquent; <hi>I</hi> thinke a Historie written
<pb facs="5"/>
by him, would not bee much inferiour to that of <hi>Tacitus;</hi> whose impenetrable iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (doubtlesse) had not been so great, if he had not set downe great vices striuing with great vertues; much euill, with much good; all concurring in new gouernours, what he hath performed in this, toward the curing of the common disease of vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnesse, thou that readest, maist easely iudge; and though hee neede not, yet <hi>I</hi> craue thy pardon (courtious Reader) and so end. farewell, the 2. of October, 1604.</p>
