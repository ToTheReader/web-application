   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, thou shalt find many things in this worke placed out of order, for that I haue lacked time and am vnlettered, neither haue bene able to kéepe anie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant whom I might commaund to write when I would, which hath bene the cause that I haue left out many notable things in this worke, which thou shalt haue héereafter, God sparing me life &amp; abilitie therevnto. Perhappes some curious riders may finde fault with my homelie kinde of teaching, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>, I set not down how they shuld teach their horses to coruet, nor how to torment thē vainlie with a chain or cauisō, which is one of the principal causes that they make their horses restie runawaies, and hard mouthed, but my intent is not to teach anie of them which make their horses more fit to daunce on a carpet, then for anie other kinde of seruice, but onelie to teach those, whose noble mindes delights in armes, and to haue their horses made for seruice and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, which is the thing wherevnto God hath ordained that beast. <hi>Clifford</hi> take héede what you doe, will you speake against the chaine and coruetting of horses? Mée thinke that shewes in you small skill in riding, sith they are both vsed throughout all Christendome. I know that this shall be the obiection of those, that either knowes not the difference betwéen the snaffle &amp; the chaine, or else y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> will know it for no other cause, but that they wil after an obstinate manner maintaine it to be good, because they would differ from others in order of riding, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why it is naught, is, that being once buckled to the horses head, as they vsuallie doe, or drawne close, it doeth grieue the horse continuallie, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

      </gap> that the horse not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the cause of his néedlesse griefe, falleth into a number of disorders. And y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first reason why it is naught to teach a horse to coruet, is, because it doth greatlie wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="4"/> his backe and loines. The second, it is a most cruell torment to a man in armes, for that a number of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>des be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing giuen to coruet by nature, &amp; vsed therevnto, will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times fall a coruetting when his rider woulde not haue him: and the third and last reason why it is naught, is, for that when you would encounter your enimie at hand strokes with your sword, these mistaught i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>

      </gap> or common wealth, that is not so voide of enuie and mallice, that he shal take a thousand times more delight in pardoning of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, than to be reuenged of them, and for proofe héereof, I doe not onelie giue frée leaue to all you to amend what so euer you find ami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
