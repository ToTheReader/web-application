   <head>The preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two thinges, which according to mine opinio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> haue been the principall causes in consideration whereof aswell they of auncient times, as those of our age haue been enduced to trauell into farre and remote regions. The first hath beene the naturall desire which we haue to serch out the commodities to liue happely, plentifully, and at ease: be it whether one abandon his naturall cuntrie altogether, to dwell in a better, or bee it that men make voiages thither, there to serch out and bring from thence such thinges as are there to bee found, and are in greatest esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and in most request in our cuntries. The second cause hath beene the multitude of people too frutefull in generation, which, being no longer able to dwell in their natiue soyles, haue entred vppon their neighbours limites, and oftentimes passing further haue pearced euen vnto the vttermost regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. After this sorte the north climate, a frutefull father of so many nations, hath oftentimes sent foorth this way and that way his valiant people, and by this meane hath peopled infinite countries: so that most of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Europe drawe their original from these partes. Contrariwise the more southern regions, because they be too barraine by reason of their insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heate which raigneth in them, neede not any such sending foorth of their in habitances, and haue beene oftentimes constrained to receaue other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more often by force ofarmes then willingly. All Africke, Spaine, and Italie, can also testifie the same, which neuer so abounded with people that they had neede to send them abroode to inhabite else where: as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Scythia, Norway, Gotland, and France haue done. The posterite of which nations remaineth yet not only in Italie, Spaine and Affricke, but also in frute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and faire Asia. Neuerthelesse I find that the Romains proceding farther, or rather adding vnto these two chiefe causes aforesayd, (as being most curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to plant not only their ensignes and victories, but also their lawes, cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes, and religion in those provinces which they had conquered by force<note place="margin">Planting of colonies.</note> ofarmes) haue oftentimes by the decree of their soueraine Senate sent forth inhabitantes, which they called colonies, (thinking by this way to make their name immotall), euen to the vnfurnishing of their owne countrye of the forces which should haue perserued the same in her perfection: a thing which hindred them much more, then advanced them to the possession of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall monarchie, where vnto their intention did aspyre. For it came to passe that their colonies here and there being miserably sacked by strang people
<pb facs="6"/>
did vtterly ruine and ouerthrowe their empire. The brinkes of the riuer of Rine are yet red, those of <hi>Danubius</hi> are noe lesse bloodie, and our France be came fatte with their blood which they lost. These are the effectes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes of al such as being pricked forward with this Romaine and tirannicall ambition will goe aboute thus to subdue strange people: effectes, I say, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the profitte which those shall receaue, which only are affectioned to the common benefitte, that is to say, to the generall pollicie of all men, and endeuour to vnite them one with another as well by trasicke and forraine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersations, as also by militarie vertues, and force of armes, whenas the sauages wil not yeeld vnto their endeuours so much tending vnto their profite.</p>
   <p>For this cause princes haue sent foorth out of their dominions certaine men of good actiuitie, to plante themselues in strang countries, there to make their profite to bring the countrie to ciuilitie, and, if it might be, to reduce the inhabitantes to the true knowledg of our God: an end so much more commé<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dable, as it is farre from all tiranicall and cruell gouernement: and so they haue alwayes thriued in their enterprises, and by lyttle and little gained the hartes of them which they haue conquered or wonne vnto them by any meanes. Here of we may gather that sometimes it is good, yea very expedient to send foorth men to discouer the pleasure and commoditie of strang countries: But so, that the country out of which these companies are to passe remayne<note place="margin">Two conditiō required in cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quests of coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tries newe dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>couered. Nota.</note> not weakned, nor depriued of her forces: And againe in such sorte that the companie sent forth be of so iuste and sufficient number, that it may not bee defeited by strangers, which euery foote endeuour nothing else but to surprise the same vpon the suddaine. As within these fewe dayes past the french haue proued to my great greife, being able by no meanes possible to withstand the same, considering that the elementes, men, and al the fauours which might be hoped for of a faithful and Christian alliance fought against vs: which thing I purpose to discouer in this presēt historie with so euident truth, that the kings maiestie my souerainge prince shall in parte be satisfied of the diligence which I haue vsed in his seruice, and myne aduersaries shall find themselues so disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in their false reportes, that they shall haue no place of refuge. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beginne, I wil brefely set downe the situation and description of the land where vnto we haue failed and where we haue inhabited from the yeare 1561 vnto sixtie fiue, to the ende that those thinges may the more easily be borne a way, which I meane to describe in this discourse.</p>
