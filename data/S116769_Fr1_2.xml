Augustin saith of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilicall Philosophers &amp; heretiks they come to kill, &amp; destroye.</p>
   <p>Iuste in this manner doth it passe with the teachers &amp; establishers of the new Religion in England. They veste themselues with sheeps skins in that they make profession of reformers of the Church, but vnder the specious &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant color of reformation, they deforme all true Religion, &amp; faith, &amp; virtue. King Henry the 8. altho' he was not of this Religion which is at this present professed &amp; practiced in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, yet was hee the first that opened the way vnto it, &amp; this vnder the color of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: an yet what monster was euer more deformed then hee? he was <hi>vniformiter defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter deformis,</hi> deformed I meane both with in &amp; without, both in bodie &amp; soule. What a rauenous wolfe was hee? Howe manie reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>conuents, &amp; monsteries did he deforme deface &amp; destroye. What a number of religious persons did he turne to the wyde world to lead an irreligious life, exposing them to the breach of their solemne vowes to God.</p>
   <p>Finally what a generall libertye did he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, both in faith &amp; manners, in all sortes of people, he him selfe being the master of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule &amp; ringleader to all licentiousnes.</p>
   <p>And according to this begining, his sonne &amp; successor did continue, who altho' his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeares &amp; weaknes of bodie did not permit him to imitate the vices of his Father, yet had he tutors &amp; protectors that were not farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde their old master, neither in corruption of faith nor manners. Whoe seeking for new Euangelists in forraine countries, foūde Bucer, Martir, &amp; others whoes fingers tickled to be working in the newe haruest, who coming in to the countrye &amp; finding the people generally inclined to libertie easily made their entrance into change of Religion, &amp; so in a shorte tyme vnder the plausible title of reforming abuses in the Church, they introduced a forme of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion neuer heard of in England as neither in the rest of the Christian world in all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: &amp; thus promissing Christian libertie they intruded an vnchristian corruption both in doctrine &amp; lyfe, making by that meanes of an ill begining in the Father a worse conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>in the sonne. Which ill begining &amp; continuatiō (excepting that religious interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Queene Maries tyme) had a yet more vnchristian progresse in the Reigne of Queene Elisabeth, who not content with the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings eithers of her Father or brother in that nature, but adding euill to euill for politique ends, as not houlding her selfe &amp; Crowne safe except she did first extinguish the ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Realme, by reason of the knowne flawe of her title, she inacted those seuere lawes against both Catholike Clergie &amp; lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which haue ben still executed by her suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors; iltho' throu' the naturall clemencie of our present soueraine, not in that sanguinarie manner that then they were put in practice &amp; execution.</p>
   <p>And thus I haue signified in breefe the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, continuation &amp; progresse of the new professed faith in England, which notobstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it carieth with it neuer so glorious a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of reformation, yet is it but a new fashion framed mierly for the profit &amp; conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie of the inuentors, &amp; to please phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, &amp; curious itching wits, &amp; myndes incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to libertie: And so daylie altering as newe fashions in apparell vse to alter, by diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence it will at leingth vanish away &amp; turne to the old fashion againe, I meane to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Religion most vniuersally euer professed
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>both ther &amp; in the rest of the Christian world, For the furtherance &amp; adnauncement of which, that which here I intende to proue is that the Religion whose begining &amp; successe I haue nowe compendiously declared as publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely &amp; commonly professed at this day in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, is no true Religiō but a false &amp; erroneous doctrine, &amp; practice, deceitfully masked &amp; disquised with the apparell of trueth: &amp; on the contrarie that the present Roman faith is the onely true Religion, as with Gods assistance by my arguments against the one &amp; in fauor of the other it will appeare to the learned louers of trueth, to whome cheefely I consecrate these my labors as to the most ingenious &amp; inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous myndes.</p>
