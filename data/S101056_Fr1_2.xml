   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honourable, hauing read ouer two lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bookes, set foorth by two seuerall Knights, the one dedicated to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestrates of England by Syr <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> Knight, the other by Syr <hi>Roger VVilliams</hi> Knight also, dedicated to the right honourable the Earle of Essex: the which two Bookes either dooth or ought


<pb facs="3"/>
to tende both to one purpose, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse in some speciall pointes therein, are such great diuersitie of opinions, that it would make men not perceiuing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and what thinges are: euen to wauer and doubt of the trueth of those causes, and considering that they are men both of good account and quality, loyall and faithfull to one Soueraigne, and also well trauelled, whereby they ought to haue the better knowledge in warlike weapons and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall Discipline: the varietye whereof see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to many verye strange. Where-vpon I haue at sundry times had conference with diuers persons of sundrye callings, touching some parte of the seuerall discourses of the said two Knights, wherein I haue found so very many addicted to the opinion of Syr <hi>Iohn Smith,</hi> as touching the commending of the Archerye of England with so many reasons and arguments by him alleadged in that behalfe, that many are thereby perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the long Bowe is the onelye wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon of the Worlde for the obtaining of


<pb facs="3"/>
Battailes and victories in these daies, with so manye allegations against Muskets, Harquebuzies and other weapons of fire, as in the same Booke appeereth.</p>
   <p>Syr <hi>Roger VVilliams</hi> vpon the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dooth seeme to except of the Muskets speciallye, with the rest of the weapons of fire, and partely seeming to proue the long Bowe to be the woorst shot that are vsed in these dayes, as by diuers argumēts are set down in the 46. and 47. leafe of his discourse.</p>
   <p>Wherfore may it please your good Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to accept of my intent, being one of the meanest of a great number that are and hath beene vnder your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships gouernement: to explaine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter according to my simple knowledge and experience in this cause, and that it maye vnder your Lordships protection be published in the behalfe of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors duetifull and obedient Souldiour, so shall I thinke my trauell in dooing but


<pb facs="4"/>
my duetye towards her Maiesties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye and your Lordship, most happilye harboured, and in the mean time remain ready to serue and obey at your good Lordships com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.</p>
