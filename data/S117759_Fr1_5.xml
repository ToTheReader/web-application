      <hi>The Preface of the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Historiographer</hi> Justine, <hi>vpon the Histories of</hi> Trogus Pompeius, <hi>dedicated vnto</hi> Anthony <hi>the Emperor.</hi>

      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas many of the Romaines, euen such as had attained to the state of consuls, had put the acts of the Romans in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, first in Greeke, and after into other forrain languages: Trogus Pompeyus, (a man of auntient eloquence) whether it were for the desire of the like renowne and glory, or for the pleasure that he had in the variety and strangenesse of the worke, compyled as well the Histories of the Greekes, as the Histories also of the whole worlde besides, in the Latine tongue; to the intent that as our Chronicles are reade in Greeke, the Chronicles of the Greekes might be published in our owne tongue: Wherein he enterprised a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labour both of body and mind.</p>
   <p>For first seeing many authors haue taken vppon them to set downe the raigne of some one King, or the actions of some one peculiar kind of people, and thoght them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to haue vndertaken a weighty businesse; wee may well thinke Pompeyus to haue bin as bold as Hercules, that durst aduenture vpon the whole world. In whose books are conteined the gouernment of all ages, of all Kings, of all Nations &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: And those things, that the Greek Chroniclers haue disorderly set downe, as euery man thought most conuenient to please himselfe, the same hath Pompeyus compiled into one maine history, omitting nothinge, saue onely those thinges al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither vnprofitable to be spoken of. Therefore of these xliiii. volumes (for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did Pompey set foorth) by leisure, during this time of my residence in the Citty, I drew out all such principles as I thought worthy to be remembred, onely leauing out such notes, the knowledge whereof, could not either be delightfull, nor yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for example. I haue therefore gathered, as it were a bundle of Flowers, to the entent that all such as haue knowledge in the Greeke, might fully bee satisfied, and as for them which are therein vnskilfull, matter of instruction.</p>
   <p>All which I haue dedicated to your Maiesty, not so much to read, and peruse, as to correct, and also to giue an account of my time, whereof <hi>Cato</hi> vvilleth a due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count should be rendred. It sufficeth me at this present, if your highnesse doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe my labours; trusting hereafter, that vvhen the brunt of slaunderous enuy is ouerpaste, they that come after, shall beare vvitnes of my trauell and paines taking.</p>
   <closer>Farewell.</closer>
