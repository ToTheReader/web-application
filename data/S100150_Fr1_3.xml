   <p>When <hi>Moses,</hi> vpon the <hi>top of Pisgah,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Deut, 34, 1, &amp; 3, 27.</note> did view the <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphie</hi> of the promised land, <hi>to the East, West, North, and South, with the Plaines, Mountaines, and Seas;</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted satisfied, because <hi>his eie was not dim.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iosua, 18, 8, 9.</note> And whē the land was <hi>Topographically</hi> to be <hi>described,</hi> to giue vnto seuerall men their inheritances, the Suruaiors presented their plots to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> the Captaine of the Lords host; who, by Gods authoritie, should quiet all questions that might arise by striuers. But when I climed the <hi>Pisgah</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,</hi> where might bee taken the <hi>perspectiue</hi> of the land, that <hi>Christ,</hi> with his holy people, shall possesse, by the preaching of the Gospell; taking due notice of the dimnes of mine eies, I submitted all my labour to your Lordshippes true, and perfect sight, and censure.</p>
   <p>And now, hauing drawne a plot of one particular place thereof, labouring to put the seuerall tenures, in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, yet proper colours, (seeing the importunitie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would not suffer me to secreate it) I doe humbly returne
<pb facs="3"/>my suruey, not onely to your Lordships censure; but also to your most fatherly and Christian patronage. Humbly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing your good Lordship, (seeing all the tenants will neuer be pleased with my doing) both to defend me frō the cauils, and calumniations of the contentious, (of whose fury I haue had too much experience:) and also to interpose your honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable authority, that all men may content themselues with theyr owne lots. My skill is small, &amp; therfore I desire the iust to reproue mee, where my hand, or eye hath fayled: but I dare be bold to say, that, in that which I was able to doe, I haue been faithfull. If your Lordship vouchsafe me this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable fauour, to accept, and protect my labours, I shall be much encouraged to take the like paines in the rest: I hope, to the glory of almightie God, the benefite of his Church, &amp; demonstration of my dutie vnto your good Lordship, whom God euermore preserue vnto eternall happines. <hi>Ianu: 25. 1606.</hi>
