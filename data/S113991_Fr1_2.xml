                 <title>The secrets of physick and philosophy : divided into two bookes: in the first is shewed the true and perfect order to distill, or draw forth the oyles of all manner of gummes, spices, seedes, roots, and hearbs, with their perfect taste, smell and vertues. In the second is shewed the true and perfect order to prepare, calcine, sublime, and dissolue all manner of minerals, and how ye shall draw forth their oyles and salts, which are most wonderfull in their operations, for the health of mans bodie.

   <head>TO THE RIGHT Reverend Father in God, and his singular good Lord, <hi>Iohn Watson,</hi> by the grace of God, Bishop of <hi>Winchester, and Prelate of</hi> the right Honourable Order <hi>of the Garter,</hi> I. H. <hi>wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth health and peace, and long life in</hi> IESVS CHRIST.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Rettie and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie is the tale (my Good Lord) that <hi>Plato</hi> tells in his <hi>Protago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>and somewhat appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and therefore not absurd for mee to set downe, to the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment of my pretence. Among other his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Inventions (as hee is in all his things most like himselfe still verie divine) hee sheweth how <hi>Ioue</hi> looking down from heaven with a pitifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard upon the hard &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward cōdition of men, seeing the sundry calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and infinite miseries that they were subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, while yet they lived savage like beasts amōgst
<pb facs="3"/>beasts, every man leading his life after the levell of his owne lust, took order strait with his winged Messenger <hi>Mercurie,</hi> to descend downe with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, with travell to collect and gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the dispersed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that so united they might both bee stronger to defend themselues frō the bruit beasts their cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemie: and linked as it were in a bodie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique, each presented as well with the dayly view of his owne want, as the continuall shew of the like lacke in others,
<pb facs="4"/>might with ioynt assent and consent (as driuen by necessitie) endevour to driue necessitie frō them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. For the speedier accomplishing whereof, he had in charge to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish a law, that if any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them were found vnfurnished with iustice, and voyd of shamefast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: the same should be compted as an vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table droane among la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring bees, and should suffer punishment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. A worthy talke, and fit so worthy a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher. By the which hee highly delivered in
<pb facs="4"/>generall tearmes, that which wee dayly finde in particular proofe: to weet, no cōmon wealth, nor societie to continue long happy where the members and parts ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of either for loue of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, or feare of shame are not like affectioned each other. Now lest I should seeme to allow of this tale in speech, and to dislike it in practice, I haue presumed by this bare translation, to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my forwardnesse in furthering her that fost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers mee. And yet is not my Translation so bare,
<pb facs="5"/>(my good Lord) but that it carryeth in it more plainnesse to the Reader, then perhaps they shall find in the first writer: For beside that I haue culled out their choise things, I haue from the same choise proined, and cut off their superfluitie, I haue supplied their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, I haue laid open their obscuritie, and I haue shadowed their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults, neither yet arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating to my selfe, not derogating from them, but as <hi>Dies diem docet,</hi> So; <hi>Experimentum experiendo confirmatur.</hi> What my
<pb facs="5"/>travel herein shal profit, I know not: but sure I am, my trouble in the triall of them hath been great, my expences large, my proofes painfull, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all heerein plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant saue onely a little knowledge that I haue got, aboue the capacitie of the common sort, a thing sure that I value far aboue the price that it cost me. Which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge indeed such is my grossenesse, or such the subtlenesse of the matter if selfe that I can easilier by demonstration shew it, then by declaration
<pb facs="6"/>teach it: and therefore dare I not vnder-credite warrant perspicuitie to all men, but to those that are <hi>Filijartis,</hi> I promise more then I found, and yet found I more then they hauing would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly loose: To the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue I may say, that as Hennes sit, but hatch not Chickens in one day: so men reade, but learne not Artes in one day.</p>
   <p>To you, my good Lord, whose Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance heerein I craue for protection, whose iudgement and skill I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
<pb facs="6"/>to for favour, I must needs confesse they are not written) although loth to haue them mast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlesse like their master, I am over bold, to shroud them vnder your wings) to you I say they are not written, except overladē with the deepe and graue mysteries of higher and more heavenly Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, it may please you for delight, now &amp; then to looke downe into the plentifull and pleasant store-house of Nature; a matter no doubt that all your whole life time, you haue beene singular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="7"/>delighted with, as most plainely do declare the singularitie, that you haue happily attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto in all &amp; every the parts of her, no lesse to your great content at home, then to your like commendation abroad: which because I can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praise to your desert not in praising please your desire, I leaue to speake farther of: onely desiring your good Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with your wonted clemencie, to accept of this small testimonie of my great good will, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring your selfe, that
<pb facs="7"/>amongst the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your well wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, there is no one more dutifull then your poore</p>
