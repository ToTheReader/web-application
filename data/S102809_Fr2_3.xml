      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue</hi> something dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from others, not onely in nature of the <hi>Argument,</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that most needfull, and holy truth which is the ground of all Christian comforts, to wit, Iustification by faith in Christ, whereof I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing hath beene written so fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, and plainely as this is; also in the Number of persons who conferre, occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the great differences about this point (more opposed by Satan and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, then any one Diuine truth whatsoeuer, as being the very soule and life of Christianity) yea and in a third thing this <hi>Dialogue</hi> differeth from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, because the most part of it was <hi>(res<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gesta)</hi>
      <pb facs="19"/> a thing truely done, namely so much as concernes the nature and office of faith resisted by a deceiued spirit, (or rather spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, for they were sundry) vnder the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Philautus:</hi> whose shifts and eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to the Arguments brought against him, as also the obiections in fauour of their execrable vnheard of errour, or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors rather, are here truly set downe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any falsification, and orderly without confusion, as neere as such confused stuffe could be reduced to Order. And for as much as we are all by nature prone to erre, al men hauing the seeds of Heresie, as of all other sinnes, euen from the wombe, yea and there is none which doth not embrace some one corrupt opiniō or other, howsoeuer we espie it not, seeing our iudgement is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: also the loosenesse and prophanenes of our liues doth deserue that we should haue strong delusions to beleeue lies in Religion, because wee doe not receiue the loue of the truth; therefore vnto the <hi>Dialogue</hi> of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi> I haue ioined a receit against <hi>Heresie,</hi> both to preserue Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors from running into it, and if any
<pb facs="19"/> be ouertaken with errour (as all may be) to pull them out. Good Reader, endeauour to profit by this booke; it hath cost the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor more then much paines, euen great griefe and trouble of minde, as well as of body; I would be loth euery or any godly Minister should buy the wrestling with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous spirits at such a rate, as I haue done.</p>
