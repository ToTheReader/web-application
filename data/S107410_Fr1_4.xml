   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He title of this booke (gentle Reader) may seem somewhat strange vnto thee at the first blush, and such, that if it be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōstrued, may procure me some dislike or discredit. It may be, that I haue followed the example of others, who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues greatly pleasured, if they can get their betters, maisters, landlords, to name their children after their names. If this bee the meaning, it may somwhat abate that dislike, discredit, and derision, which otherwise would fall vppon me, in which respect I may be vouchsafed of pardon. Or otherwise I may bee taken in an other sence, as to declare my affectionate good will to my honourable patrone deceased, as if I had caused this to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graued by his tombe, <hi>Hoc monumentum posuit.</hi> And if it be such that it may not deserue that credit, as I know it cannot, but wil haue his time to vanish, much like the earth or the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is frozen, and is anon resolued; (for a wonder had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the gift to continue long, much lesse a trisle) yet thus much it may declare, that I was not altogither forgetfull. Or if it be a meane, to encourage others of wealth and account, to be beneficial to poore students, let the one haue the good report, the other the profit, and let the derision redound to my selfe. For my part concerning my patron, the right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable sir <hi>Thomas Bromley</hi> Knight, Lord Chancellour, and one of her Maiesties most honourable priuie Councell in his time, I must needs confesse, &amp; make it knowne to the world, how the beames of this gracious sun did shine vpō me. Diet, apparrell, bookes, siluer &amp; gold, preferment, countenance, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, good wil, and what euer my heart might desire; neither
<pb facs="4"/>
can I satisfie my selfe, or expresse my bounden dutie, by any gradation. And as I was vnworthy of so great benefits, so the chiefest of them came vnto me vnlooked for. Such was the bountifulnesse of him, whose renowne shall remaine, so long as the deliuerance, from the Scottish Queenes conspiracie is remembred! Oh that poore &amp; painfull students might meet with such liberall purses! and with such noble and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bromleion</hi> hearts! <hi>Sat sit optasse, et siinuenisse rarum.</hi> What the poore both see and receiue, let them report, to the shame of them, that hoord vp their wealth, and consider not that God hath made them but stewards, and hath put it in their hands, if they had hearts to dispose. Especially if they could remember this, which is set downe in sacred writ; <hi>Pro. 19. 17. He that hath pitie vpon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lord, and looke what he laieth out it shall be paide him againe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now as concerning these my rude and rurall labours, if I might, I would auoyd disdaine, or if I may do any good, it is the thing that would reioyce me greatly. This vnlearned worke, some will say, should haue laine by me a long while, vntill it might haue bin done more perfectly, or else it should neuer haue bene put foorth. Other excuse haue I none, but this, that I could not tell how otherwise to shewe my dutie, and to giue a proofe of my good will, where I was so greatly indebted. It may be taken in good part, if I answere you, as one <hi>Iohn Philpot</hi> in the raigne of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, answered certaine noble and honourable personages, who found themselues greatly agreeued, that a merchant had got a prize on the enemie. His answere was; That he did it not, to take away the praise of chiualry from them, but rather that they might be incouraged, to do greater exploits. I haue not put foorth this slender exercise, to barre any (that are well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed, better learned, and right willing to edifie) of their praise and due commendation; of the which I confesse my selfe farre vnworthie, but rather to animate them, that they let not their gifts lie hidden, which being made manifest and knowne, might procure the benefit of many. He that cannot
<pb facs="5"/>
do better, to him this may be some helpe, the rest may take it in good part, and labour to do other good, who do both long for good helpes, and would be glad of that which might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them, to ease their painfull studie. They that would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to learning, lightly are those of the poorer sort, who haue many hinderances. Want of bookes, want of sufficient maintenance, want of time, and many other lets. I must needs acknowledge many wants, and my imperfections are great, wishing other that are better able, that they would be of that minde, as to do good to others, whose capacitie is but weake and simple, who haue small helpes, and yet are set in such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where they of dutie should edifie and instruct, and wold, if they were better able. If in this booke I haue not done wel, I will be glad to be better enformed, and willing to hearken to the direction of others, and to follow their counsell, Ending this tedious Epistle, with this my wish, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and request, to them that are learned, and willing to doo good;</p>
