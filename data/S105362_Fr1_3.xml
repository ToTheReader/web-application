Notwithstanding, seeing the Booke it selfe doth carry with it a deuice of some Noueltie, and matter of varietie: wherein, had there been vsed any kind of learned skill in the penning, mought (pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Therefore, crauing your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships fauourable acceptation hereof, and pardon for this my bould attempt; fearing to be tedious, I humbly take my leaue.</p>
