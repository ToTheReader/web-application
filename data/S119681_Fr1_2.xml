<pb facs="3"/> but they by them rob'd God of his honour: be you to be a tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar god, <note n="*" place="margin">Ps. I haue sayd you are Gods.</note> (you may be hereafter a titular god) so God shall haue prayse by this my labour. When <hi>Adam</hi> beheld his owne naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he ran to a Bush to hide his follies: Now the World must view my many weaknesses, I come to you to shelter my fraylties. But <hi>Adam,</hi> and I differ in this: He like a Wood-cocke thrust his bill in a Bush, to be kept close from the eyes of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: I would be shrowded vnder your bowes to be kept dry from the stormes of Calumny. <hi>Adam</hi> might thinke that God would follow him: the Diuell I thinke (for detractors are <hi>Diuels</hi>) will follow me: if he do, your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous name on the front of this Pamphlet shall be a generall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcisme to coniure this spirit, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuring
<pb facs="3"/> him to more then Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorian silence. But silence: why should I looke for any such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, as that these nifles and trifles should purchase your Countenance? Beleeue it Sir, the fault is yours, because you haue beene benevolent, therfore am I growne impudent: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue that cause, the effect cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, if you restrayne your cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, I shall refrayne mine inso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lency; but your worship (as yet) hath not done the one, therefore am I presumptuous in not doing the other.</p>
