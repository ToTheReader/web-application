      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Vertues and my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise are the two wings wherewith this my Translation of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Booke of the Noble and
<pb facs="120"/>
Learned, <hi>Monsieur de Refuges)</hi> Treatise of the Court flies to your Protection and Patronage. You saw when I did most part thereof in loose sheets, both in Paris and London, as also in your Husburne, and in seeing it, likewise desired it might be seene of the World, and consequently taught aswell to speake English, as French. I cannot flatter, I disdaine to desemble, for looking from you to my self, I find many reasons that your requests should still bee to me commands. In which respect I haue done it, and despoylde and Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it from its French Garbe into our English attire; but how well or ill, whilst the World censureth, I leaue to your knowledge and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity to iudge, sith you like a wise
<pb facs="120"/>
and iuditious Traueller haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably traueld aswell through the bowels of the Language, as the Countrie of France.</p>
   <p>Tis true, the Campe, not the Court, is your more proper Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as rather desirous (if the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of your Prince and Country required) to dye a Souldier, then to liue a Courtier, not that you are ignorant in the profession of the first, because expert in that of the second, or any way hate that facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, because you better loue and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this; and therefore sith this French▪ Courtier is Noble, and withall honest, I hope you will entertaine him, although he come to salute you, clad in homely and plaine English: I could wish my selfe more happy in meeting with
<pb facs="121"/>
some weightier and greater occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion wherein I might testifie you, how much I am yours. Till when (Right Worshipful) my best wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es shall euer zealouslie wish you the best prosperities, and for mine owne part I shall neuer repute my selfe truly fortunate, till my future seruice make satisfaction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall for your former fauours.</p>
