O bury them in the Graue of Christ, they neuer rise vp to appeare against vs: bathe our wounded and stayned soules in his precious bloud: infuse and stirre vp in vs, a sound and sauing faith, to receiue and put on the spotles roab of his Righteousnesse, wherein appearing we shall be iustified.</p>
   <p>Open the eyes of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, that seeing wee may know the truth; rectifie our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that knowing wee may loue it: conforme our wils that louing we may expresse obedience in practice, with perseuerance in
