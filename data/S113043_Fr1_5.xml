   <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas many of our Latine writers of great authoritie, haue written manie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse things of the famous deeds of Scanderbeg, and of the greatnesse of his exploits: for that their honorable testimonies may in some sort argue and confirme the truth of this historie: and because it were too great an iniurie to defraud this Greeke Prince and straunger, of his true and deserued praises: I haue therefore thought it good here to make mention of their names, and to cite the places where they haue written of him: to the intent the Reader may at his good pleasure and best leisure peruse them: The Autors are these:</p>
   <list>
      <item>1. <hi>Volaterrane,</hi> in the 8. booke of his Geographie, in the description of Macedonie.</item>
      <item>2. <hi>Aeneas Siluius,</hi> in the description of Europe. Cap. 15.</item>
      <item>3. <hi>Andrew Theuet,</hi> in his Cosmographie. 1. Tome. 11. booke. Chap. 3.</item>
      <item>4. <hi>Paulus Iouius</hi> Bishop of Nucera, in his Commentarie of the affaires of Turkie, dedicated to the Emperour Charles the fifth.</item>
   </list>
   <p>The cause why I haue not set downe the verie text and testimonies themselues, as they are in the preface of the French copie, is, because in manie points they haue varied and erred in the report of Scanderbeg his actions, and are much mistaken in the truth of the historie. Howbeit I do impute their error vnto this, that they being straungers to the Estate and affaires of Epire, and hauing intelligence of the deedes of Scanderbeg onely by heare say and by report, they could not so truly and exactly set downe the truth of matters as they are here deliuered in this Historie by the Latine Author: who being natiue of the same countrey with Scanderbeg, and liuing in the same age and time that he did, is to be reputed the best witnesse and most perfect reporter of his deedes.</p>
