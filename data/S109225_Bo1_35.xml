it was not so great a part of the Heauen awry, as they would
make it; we request him but to looke downe vpon these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Reasons.</p>
   <p>1 There hath been <hi>President</hi> of the like Presentation in diuers
Playes: and is yeerely in our Cittie <hi>Pageants</hi> or shewes of
<hi>Triumph.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>2 It is to be conceiu'd, that <hi>Macilente</hi> being so strongly possest
with <hi>Enuie,</hi> (as the <hi>Poet</hi> heere makes him) it must bee no
sleight or common <hi>Object,</hi> that should effect so suddaine and
straunge a cure vpon him, as the putting him cleane <hi>Out of
his Humor.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>3 If his <hi>Imagination</hi> had discours't the whole world ouer for
an <hi>Object,</hi> it could not haue met with a more Proper, Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or worthie <hi>Figure,</hi> than that of her Maiesties: which
his <hi>Election</hi> (though boldly, yet respectively) vs'd to a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>
and <hi>Mysterious</hi> end.</p>
   <p>4 His greedinesse to catch at any <hi>Occasion,</hi> that might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
his affection to his <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> may worthily plead
for him.</p>
   <p>5 There was nothing (in his examin'd <hi>Opinion</hi>) that could
more neare or truly exemplifie the power and strength of her
Inualuable <hi>Vertues,</hi> than the working of so perfect a <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
on so oppos'd a <hi>Spirit,</hi> who not only persisted in his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi>
but was now come to the <hi>Court</hi> with a purpos'd reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
(his Soule as it were new drest in <hi>Enuie</hi>) to maligne at
any thing that should front him; when sodainly (against ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
<pb facs="67"/>
and all steele of his <hi>Malice</hi>) the verie wonder of
her <hi>Presence</hi> strikes him to the earth dumbe, and astonisht.
From whence rising and recouering heart, his <hi>Passion</hi> thus
