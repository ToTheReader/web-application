   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, hauing at length finished the Translation of this FRENCH Treatise of morall Philosophy, I presume the rather to recommend it to your Worships fauour, because your selfe did first commend it vnto me for the variety of excellent sayings and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wherewith it is replenished. And surely I perswade my selfe, that howsoeuer for want of a skilfull Translator it hath lost much of that grace, which otherwise it might haue had, yet by reason of the matrer it selfe, and good disposition obserued throughout the whole booke, it will be of some account with so many as preferre the soundnesse of substance before the swelling froth of curious phrases True it is, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words vsed by the Authour, and retained by me, are almost the same with the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall tongues from whence they were deriued, and peraduenture wil sound harsh at the first in their eares that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard them before: but if they will haue patience a while, and let them passe to and fro vpon the file oft heir teeth, no doubt but in short time they will be as smooth as other Greeke and Latine words which now are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for meere English. I might here alleadge reasons to prooue the necessity of retaining such words in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating: namely, that many of them are proper names and words of Art; that as all occupations and handicrafts haue their seuerall names of instruments belonging to their science, so is it with Philosophy, and with euery part thereof: but I make no doubt of finding the Reader fauourable in this point, considering that it tendeth to the enriching of our owne language, and hath beene practised by the learned of all nations that haue gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, as is euident to such as are skilfull in the tongues. Concerning the profite of this booke, I referre the Reader either to the title thereof, which promiseth no more (in my opinion) than is performed with aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the body of the same; or else to the Authours Epistle to the Reader, wherein he setteth downe a sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of that doctrine, which is afterward handled more at large. Wherein howsoeuer hee hath very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently behaued himselfe, and (as I am perswaded) gone farre beyond those that haue handled the same matter before him, yet considering each mans infirmity to bee such, that he attaineth not to perfection in any worke, neither speaketh all things that are to bee spoken of the same thing, nor yet is free from error in those things which he speaketh or writeth, I exhort all that shall peruse this Treatise following, so farre onely to approoue euery sentence and example of life, as it may bee prooued out of the recordes of holy Scripture. Moreouer, as many as are desirous to bee bettered by the reading of this booke, they must thinke seriously vpon the end vnto which this Authour had regard when he penned it, which was the same that <hi>Aristotle</hi> had in writing his Ethicks or booke of Manners: namely, <hi>The practise of vertue in life, and not the bare knowledge and contemplation thereof in braine.</hi> And, lest any man should haue that opinion of these Morall precepts, which all men haue <note place="margin">
         <hi>Arist. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Eth. cap.</hi> 2.</note> of <hi>Platoes</hi> Common wealth, or of <hi>Aristotles</hi> Felicity, of <hi>Tullies</hi> Orator, or of <hi>Moores</hi> Vtopia, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in them rather an <hi>Idaea</hi> of good life, than such a platforme as may bee drawne from contemplation into action, he hath ioyned workes with words, practise with precept, and the fruits of rare examples with the faire flowers of Philosophicall instructions. But many are so farre from concerning any such excellency in them, that so soone as they heare the name of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> they thinke they haue sufficient cause to condemne as hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, all the writings of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> alleadging that sentence of Saint <hi>Paul. Beware lest there bee any man that spoile you through Philosophy:</hi> not considering that the Apostle doth in the very next words expound himselfe, and sheweth that he meaneth nothing else but the deceitfull conclusions of mans reason, disagreeing from the doctrine of Christ reuealed vnto vs in his word. I grant that the word of God is onely perfect, and containeth in it an absolute rule both of piety towards God, and humanitie towards men; but it followeth not therefore, that we may not vse the benefit of humane precepts, or tread in the steps of heathen men, so farre foorth at their learning and liues dissent not from the truth of holy Scriptures. Will any man refuse pearles because they are offered him i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="3"/>
from the twilight of naturall knowledge, and not from the cleere sunne-shine of the word of God' Let vs rather hearken to Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> in his second booke of Christian doctrine, where hee hath these words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing very fitly to this matter: <hi>As for those</hi> (saith he) <hi>that are called Philosophers, if they haue vttered any truth</hi>

      <hi>agreeable to our faith and doctrine (especially the Platonists) we are not onely not to feare it, but rather to challenge it from them as from vniust possessors thereof. For as the Egyptians had not onely; dols and heauy burdens, which the people of Israel were to detest and flee from, but also vessels and ornaments of gold, siluer and raiment, which that people at their departure out of Egypt challenged couertly to themselues for better vses, although not of their owne authority, but by the commandement of God, &amp;c. So the doctrine of the Gentiles hath not onely counterfeit and superstious forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and heauy packes of needlesse labour, which euery one of vs departing from their society vnder our Captaine Christ, ought to detest and shunne: but also liberall Arts meet to set foorth the truth by, and certaine profitable precepts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yea some true points concerning the worship of one onely God.</hi> What their knowledge was concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and then duty one toward another, the whole Treatise following expresseth at large, vnto which I had rather referre you than vse any needlesse repetition in this place. And as for the other point concerning the knowledge of one onely God, it is most certaine, that from the light of Nature holpen with industry, study, <note place="margin">

      </note> and education (according to the wisedome and dispensation of God) many notable conclusions proceeded from sundry of them, as <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe sheweth by a long discourse in his eight booke <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi> where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other he alleadgeth these out of <hi>Plato: That God is a spirit, and of a farre more excellent nature than the soule of man, or any other spirit whatsoeuer: that God is one and the same, and alwaies like vnto himselfe: that God is the light of our mindes, whereby we attaine to all our knowledge and vnderstanding: that no man is therefore blessed and happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath abundance of wealth, honour, strength, beauty, or of any external thing, nor yet for any gift of the minde, but because he enioyeth God the soueraigne good.</hi> How diuinely doth <hi>Aristotle</hi> write of God, and of his fatherly prouidence, in his Tractare <hi>De Mundo</hi> dedicated to <hi>Alexander?</hi> I know that many with force of reason carrying them thereinto, haue vehemently suspected, that this peece of worke came neuer out of his shop. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be graunted for true, yet the booke doth euidently declare, that the Author thereof was a meere hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man, and directed onely by his pure Naturals, when he wrote it: which being sufficient to shew how farre the darknes of nature doth comprehend the light and knowledge of heauenly things, is as much as I require. This treatise being wholy occupyed in these two principall points: namely, in the description of the vniuersall <note place="margin">
         <hi>Aristotle de Mun.</hi> 10.</note> frame of the world, and in the declaration of the nature of God the worke-master thereof, I will briesly set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you the summe of the last part, which the Philosopher painteth out vnto vs very notably in liuely and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent colours. First he acknowledgeth, that <hi>All things are of God, that they consist and haue their being by his power, that no nature whatsoeuer is able to continue, if it be not maintained and preserued by him.</hi> And in setting out the manner of working whereby this mightie power of God is forceable in the gouernment of all things, he goeth beyond the common reach of naturall men, affirming, that although God be present euery where, yet not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bodily or local presence, as the common receiued opinion then was: <hi>That all things whatsoeuer wee perceiue by sight, hearing, or any other sense, were full of Gods,</hi> and as <hi>Seruetus</hi> blasphemously taught of late yeeres, <hi>That God was an essentiall part of euery creature,</hi> but that he gouerneth all thing▪ <hi>by his power and vertue,</hi> whereby he effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whatsoeuer pleaseth him. Againe, as hee subscribeth to the almighty power and prouidence of God in the being and rule of all things, so he laboureth to make knowne the great wisedome of God by the contemplation of the excellent course of nature, which is certen without inconstancy, beautiful without blemish, &amp; diuerse with out disorder. For what can be more certaine than the ordinary course of the Sun, Moone, and Stars, which haue continued in their appointed race from time to time and from one age vnto another? What greater certainety then that which to our comfort appeareth in the naturall turnes and returnes of times and sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ons, of Sommer, and Winter, Spring and Autumne, day and night? in regard of which constant continuance of the irrevocable order appo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nted by God in this whole frame, the world is called by the Hebrewes <hi>gnolam:</hi> and in the Epistle to that people, it is expressed by this word <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, (which many times signifieth perpetuity) <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. &amp; 11. 3, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the beauty and glorious shew thereof, what thing more beautifull then the glittering face of the heauens decked and adorned with star<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es both great and small, as it were with iewels and precious stones of all sorts? And for this selfe same cause it receiued that name of <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> from the Grecians, and of <hi>Mundus</hi> from the Latines.</p>
   <p>Lastly, if we looke either to the variable motions of the Spheres in the ethereall region, or to the contrary qualities of the elements in the aery and lower part of the world, or to the variety of fowles, fishes, beasts, plants, graine, stones, mettals, &amp;c. and consider withall what a sweete harmony ariseth from all these, as it were from a well tuned instrument that hath strings of all so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ts, or like to a liuely picture that hath all kinds of colours min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in it, or to a well ordered city compounded of sundry occupations, callings, and conditions, of poore and rich, young and old, bond and free, we may see if we haue but halfe an eye, and feele if we be blinde, that in this rare peece of worke and frame of the world, there is most excellent conuaiance without confusion, great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety concurring in vnity, and diuersity of all kindes without disorder. All this and much more is attributed by the Authour of that booke <hi>De Mundo, (Aristotle,</hi> or some other heath: n Philosopher) <hi>to the onely working of the power of the muisible God, of whom</hi> (saith he) <hi>we must conceine that for his power he is most mighty, for his beauty most excellent, for his life unmortall, and for his vertue most absolute:</hi> and therefore hee cannot bee seene of any mortall creature, but is notwithstanding knowne by his workes. <hi>For all accidents in the aire in the earth, and in the water, may truly be called the works of God, who containeth and preserueth this world, of whom</hi> (as <hi>Empedocles</hi> saith) <hi>proceeded,</hi>

      <l>All things that were, that are, and shall be heere,</l>
      <l>Plants, Men, Beasts, Birds, and Fish in waters cleere.</l>
   </q>
   <p>But this Philosopher not contenting himselfe with this consideration and view of God in his workes, entreth into a deeper meditation of his nature, by setting downe a very good exposition, and as it were a Commentary vpon those names and titles, which vsually were attributed in his time vnto God, thereby to make his powerful gouernment ouer all the world more knowne vnto men <hi>Although</hi> (saith he) <hi>that God be but one, yet we call him b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>of mans life, It is to be vnderstood of God only, who (as it was said in old time) is the beginning, midst, and end of all things. To conclude, there is a iustice that is neuer separated from God, which is the reuenger of all tranfgressions committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against the law of God, wherein euery one must be well instructed that would be partaker of humane felicity &amp; happines.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now iudge, I pray you, whether a Christian may not with profite enter into this Schoole of nature, and reape commoditie by this little light of naturall knowledge, which as it serued to make them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuse that were endued therewith, because they knowing GOD, did not glorifie him as GOD, neither were thankfull, but became vaine in their imaginations: so it is to be feared, that those selfe same men shall rise vp in iudgement against vs that professe Christianitie, and condemne vs in that great and terrible day. For how many of vs want that knowledge of the eternall power, diuinitie, and prouidence of God, which was in <hi>Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle,</hi> and others, indued onely with the light of nature, whereby they were ledde from the view of the creatures, to the consideration of the invisible things of God? And if we look into the liues of men in these dayes, and consider what neglect there is of those duties which God commandeth vs to exhibite one to another, we shall soone see, that many a million of carnall gospellers come farre short euen of those ciuill appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and halte vertues of the heathen, and may therfore be sent backe to learne holinesse of <hi>Socrates,</hi> iustice, and innocencie of <hi>Aristides,</hi> charitie of <hi>Cimon,</hi> vpright dealing of <hi>Phocion,</hi> fidelitie in performing promises of <hi>Regulus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">

      </note> moderation of <hi>Camilsus,</hi> parsimonie of <hi>Curius,</hi> grauitie of <hi>Cato,</hi> and what not of heathen men, whose sight in these things was better at mid-night, then ours is at mid-day? But my meaning is not to approoue that Apocryphal tradition of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> who saith, that <hi>As the law was a Schoolemaster to the Iewes to lead them to Christ: so Philosophy was to the Grecians to bring them to saluation.</hi> Now although this erronious doctrine be as contrary to truth as darknesse is to light, and as hell is to heauen, yet did <hi>Andradius</hi> defend it in a booke set forth by him at their instigation (as himselfe protested) who were of greatest authority in the late Tridentine Councel. Doth not the Lord by the mouth of <hi>Esay</hi> tell vs, that there is no light in them that haue not recourse to the law and to the Testimony, and speake not according to his word? <hi>Esay</hi> 8. 20. Doeth not our Sauiour Christ send vs to the Scriptures for euerlasting life? <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 39. How then dare any professing Christianitie, affirme, that <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers by the light of nature, and knowledge of Philosophie, without the direction of the writtē word of God, were made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the righteousnes that commeth by faith,</hi> and so consequently of eternall happinesse? But to let this half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous mouth passe, let vs make that account of the writings of men which they deserue, and reape that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity by them, which we may without preiudice to the written word. For my meaning is not in commending <hi>Philosophy,</hi> to giue greater credit vnto it, or further to alow the vse therof, thē may stand with the maiestie of the holy and sacred Scripture, which being the Mistris of all human arts &amp; disciplines, vseth them as her handmaids to serue and obey her. Therefore as it is vnseemly for a maid-seruant to go before her mistresse, to speak before she be spoken vnto, or to vse three words for one, especially in company where seruice and modestie is most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired so it beseemeth not the Embassadors of Gods word (vnto whom indeed the knowledge of tongues and human arts is a singular help) to vse these gifts otherwise then as handmaids in their studies and meditations to serue the Scripture to the more plaine and pure exposition of it, seeing they are sent to edisie others, and not to set out themselues. Now when they stuffe a great part of their speech with Poeticall fictions, Philosophicall sayings and examples (as also they are wont to alledge Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine sentences, to draw men into admiration of their great learning) they set the mistris behinde, and giue the first and chiefest place vnto the handmaidens. Is not this <hi>To make the crosse of Christ of none effect?</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. 17. To vse that kind of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that standeth in the inticing speech of mans wisedome, and not in plaine euidence and power? Is it not <hi>To build faith vpon the wisedome of men, and not vpon the power of God?</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. 4. 5. If disagreement of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and forme bee vnseemely, how vndecent is it in spirituall doctrine to vse a carnall and humane kinde of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. 13. to allay the strength of the word of Christ with the warerish sayings and fables of men? to put vpon the naked and glorious face of God the beggerly clokes of Poets and Philosophers?</p>
   <p>When the Lord hath sanctified, not the corruptible seed of the sayings of men, but the incorruptible seed of his owne most holy word to the begetting of faith, are not these new begetters ashamed to bring in another way of regeneration? When Gods will is to haue his children nourished with the sincere and vnmingled milke of his word, dare man vse the infusion of water, to the weakening of them whom he ought to confirme? When the King hath appointed for his Sonnes and Daughters the purest and finest wheate, shall the Steward, as if they were swine, prouide Acornes for them? But I detaine you too long from entring into the pleasant walkes of this Platonicall Academy and Schoole of Morall Philosophy, which being hewen out of the choisest timber of all Countries, was raised vp, and set together in France, and is newly rough-cast (as you see) by an English workeman: whose earnest desire is to haue this small labour of his knowne to other, and receiued of you as a monument of his gratefull minde towards your Worship, for the manifold benefits which he hath from a childe receiued at your hands. In consideration whereof I am bolde, or rather bound, to offer my selfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with these my first fruits vnto your good liking beseeching him that turned your bountifull heart towards me, to knit it so neere vnto himselfe, that he may be your chiefe riches in this life, and your onely happinesse in the world to come. Thus commending you and that good Gentlewoman your wife with all yours, to the grace of God, I take my leaue of you, this 17. of October.</p>
