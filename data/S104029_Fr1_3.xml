   <head>¶ To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, Little did I dreame, that these priuate Meditations, intended only for a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, should be made thus publicke, to the view of the whole world. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo proponit, Deus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit,</hi> Man purposeth, but God disposeth. Importunitie wrung them from me, not onely beside, but against my intention. My pleas were many, if they might haue beene heard. The short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of time allotted for preparation, multitude of other distractions, which would scarce giue me leaue either to write what I had Preached, or to review what I had written before the publication.</p>
   <p>The curiositie of the times, and various humour of men, what one likes, another dislikes, one thinkes it too curious, another too carelesse; one too facile, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too obscure, one too loose, another too elaborate. So impossible is it for any one man, to please all men.
<pb facs="5"/> The same sentence which pleaseth one, dislikes another; the same man, that receiues content this houre, is out of charitie the next; so various is man in his thoughts, so vnconstant in his censures to others and himselfe. Adde to this beside the ficklenesse of some, the perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of others, who <hi>Malchus</hi>-like, heare all with the <hi>left eare;</hi> and as if the right hand were withered, like <hi>Ieroboams,</hi> take all with <hi>the left.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If some passages accord (in substance) with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine materiall poynts that are delivered of other Writers, though never so different in the carriage and circumstance, they must needes be transcribed. As if divers men, building on the same founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, guided by the same Spirit, may not in their Meditations border each on other, vnlesse they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row one from another.</p>
   <p>All these iust allegations were vrged by mee, but in vaine; I did but <hi>surdo narrare fabulam,</hi> my friends would haue no nay; for their sakes haue I ventred to put my finger once againe into the fire, though already scorched with the slame. Happily the subiect matter of this Discourse will procure better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement.</p>
   <p>Many, I confesse, haue written of this <hi>Theame,</hi> and as our <hi>Adversaries</hi> querulously complaine, too many. Wherefore els doe they say, What? nothing but the <hi>Powder-Treason?</hi> nothing but the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Treason?</hi> When will you haue done with your <hi>Cole-worts,</hi> twice thrice sodden over. It vexeth them to the Heart, that wee should rubbe this Soare, and make this wound bleed afresh, but by their
<pb facs="5"/> leaues, <hi>GODS goodnesse,</hi> and <hi>Their wickednesse</hi> deserues a <hi>Monument</hi> of <hi>Marble,</hi> and let them haue it. They loue the Treason, but hate the Memory of it.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Istis siquidem pudor est audiendi quae secerunt,</l>
      <l>Nullus faciendi quae erubescant.</l>

   <p>Let all Ages ring of this transcendent match-lesse mercilesse <hi>Plot.</hi> Let every true-hearted <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> tell what great Wonders the Lord hath done for this <hi>Nation,</hi> how Hee carried our Fathers in the <hi>yeare Eightie-Eight through the waters:</hi> how Hee carried vs their children <hi>this fifth of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember through the fire.</hi> Let this be graven with a <hi>Penne</hi> of <hi>Iron,</hi> with the <hi>Point of a Diamond,</hi> on the Tables of our hearts, on the Postes of our Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, on the Hornes of our Altars, in such Capitall Letters, as he that runnes may reade them. Let the Fathers report it to their children, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their childrens children, that the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come, as yet vnborne, may discerne the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious mischievous attempts of <hi>Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes.</hi>
