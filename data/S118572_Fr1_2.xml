   <head>¶ To the Christian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>George Elliot wisheth all</hi> due reuerence.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome experience (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiā Reader) that I haue gathered by keeping cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with suche sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people as <hi>Campion</hi> and his associates are, partly moueth me to write this booke, and partly I am vrged therevnto (although my wisedome and skill bee very slender to set downe and penne matter of lesse moment then this) for that I beyng one of the two in commission at that time, from her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse most honorable priuie counsell for the apprehending of the sayd seditious <hi>Campi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and such like, and the chiefest cause of the finding out of the sayde lewde people, as hereafter more at large appeareth: do thinke it a greate abuse, that the most parte of her Maiesties louing subiectes, shalbe seduced to beleeue an vntrueth, and my selfe, and hee which was in commission with me, whose name is Dauid Ienkins, one of the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb facs="3"/>
of her Maiesties Chamber, very vilel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> slaundered with a Booke set out by one <hi>Anthony Munday,</hi> concerning the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the sayd lewde people, which for the trueth thereof, is almost as farre differēt from trueth, as darknes from light, and as contrary to trueth, as an egge is contrary in likenes to an oyster.</p>
   <p>And therefore, considering, I am able to report a troth for the manner of the finding and taking of the saide seditious persons, (although fine skil be farre from me to paint it out) hoping the wise will beare with my want therein, and esteeme a true tale, bee it neuer so bluntly told, rather then a lye, be it neuer so finely handled: I haue imboldened my selfe to take this Treatise in hand where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (God willing) I wil describe nothing but truth as in brief by the sequele shal appeare. Which is this: That aboutes foure yeeres past, (the Diuell being a craftie Foxe, and chiefe Patrone doubtles of the Popes prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) hauing diuers and many Officers and inferiour substitutes to the Pope his chiefe Viear, and intēding by them, to encrease the kingdome of this Antichrist. Dispersed his sayd officers in diuers places of this Realme,
<pb facs="3"/>
where like vagrant persons, (refusing to liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>within the lawful gouernment of their coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) they lead a loose life, wandring &amp; run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hither and thither, from shire to shire, and countrey to countrey, with such store of Romish relikes, popish pelfe, trifles &amp; trash, as were able to make any Christian hearte (that hath seene the tryall of such practifes as I haue done) eue for sorrow to bleed, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-thereby to drawe the Queenes Maiestres subiects their heartes and faithes both from God and her highnesss, as namely by deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto them Bulles from Rome, Pardons, Indulgences, Medalls, Agnus Dei, hallowed graines and beades, Crucifixes, painted pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp; such other paltrie▪ euery part wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they will not let to say to bee matters ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry necessary for saluation. By reason wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (most louing Reader) I my selfe about that time by the space of one quarter of an yeere together, was deepely be witched and drawn into their darknesse, as the blindest bayarde of them all. But at the last euen then, by Gods great goodnesse, mightie prouidence, and especiall grace, all their inchauntments, witcheraftes, sorceries, diuelishe deuises and practises we are so broken and vntyed in me
<pb facs="4"/>
and the brightnesse of Gods diuine Maiestie shining so surely in my hearte and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that I perceiued all their doings to bee as they are in deede, only shewes without substance, manifest errours and deceitful iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling castes and none others. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I determined with my self (for certain causes which I omit) to sound the depth of their diuelish drifts (if I might) &amp; the rather therefore vsed and frequented their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, whereby appeared vnto me not a few of their vngracious and villanous false harts faiths, and disloyall mindes, slaunderous wordes, and most vile treasons, towardes my most excellent and noble mystrys the Queenes maiestie, and towardes diuers of her most honourable priuie councell, in such sorte as many times did make mine eyes to gush out with teares for very sorrowe and feare to thinke of it. Wherefore lately I made my humble submission vnto the right honourable her Highnesse priuie councell for my vnlawful liuing as aforesaid: at whose handes I founde such honourable dealing &amp; by their meanes such mercie from her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, that I wishe with all my hearte all the papists which are subiects borne to her high
<pb facs="4"/>
nesse to runne the same course that I haue doone, and then shoulde they easily see what difference there is betweene the good and mercifull dealing of our most gracious louing and naturall prince: &amp; the great trecheries of that great enimie to our Countrie the Pope. For her highnesse freely forgiueth offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but the Pope pardoneth for money: her graces handes are continually full of mercie, readie to deliuer enough freely to any that will desire and deserue it, and the Pope his great clutches and fistes, are readie to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nothing but diuelish deuises and paltrie stuffe of his owne making, to set Countrie and Countrie together by the eares, and yet for these hath hee money. Truly it is a most lamentable case, that euer any Christian should be seduced and drawne from the true worshipping of God, and their duetie to their Prince and Countrie (as many are) by the Pope and his satanicall crewe. I beseech God turne their heartes, and graunt vs all amendment, which can neither be too time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (if it were presently) nor neuer too late, whensoeuer it shall happen, vnlesse wilfully they proceede in their dealings, which God forbid: for <hi>humanum est errare, perseuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>belluinum.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Shortly after my submission and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation as aforesaide. It pleased my Lords of her Highnesse moste honourable priuie councell to graunt the commission that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spake of, to my selfe, and to the saide Dauid Ienkins, for the apprehension of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine lewde Iesuite Priestes, and other sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious persons of like sort, wheresoeuer wee shoulde happen to finde them within Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande. Whereupon wee determined a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine voyage, in which <hi>Edmond Campion</hi> the aforesaide Iesuite and others were by vs taken and brought to the Towre of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in manner as heereafter followeth▪</p>
