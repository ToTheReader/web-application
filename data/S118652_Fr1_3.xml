   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing had some small experience, of
your zealous loue to Gods truth, and
dayly care for preseruing the same, in
most Christian and religious maner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you: I could not but expresse
some fruit of mine vnfained affection
towards you. And, as a true testimonie thereof, I send
you this learned and worthy labour, as a poore New-yeares
gift, which was first written by a brother of yours
in our Lord Iesus, and by mee instructed to speake our
natiue English tongue. For I did account it, as a wrong or
iniurie done to you, that a worke of such worth, receiuing
his originall from Gods reformed Cburch among you:
should here bee made publique, and you to haue no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
at all therewith, or interest therein. To
preuent which inconuenience, in the bonds of Christian
loue and amitie, I dutifully haue directed it vnto you,
desiring (according to the high deseruing merit therof)
that it may not onely haue acceptation among you, but
<pb facs="5"/>
that it may likewise finde fauour in your houses and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
where it may doe more good, then easly can bee
imagined. So, entreating your best construction, of
this my verie sudden, yet honest boldnesse: I commit you
all, my selfe, and this my poore paynes, to that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of blessednesse, which it shall please
our Lord God (in mercie) to
bestowe vpon vs.</p>
