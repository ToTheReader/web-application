      <hi>That they had golden Chali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but wooden Priests.</hi> The like may not unfitly bee affirmed of some women, who <hi>have golden garments, and guilded bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or leaden soules.</hi>

      <hi>they shine and make a brave shew with brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and Iewels, but are base and sordid in their maners and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But it was farre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otherwise with your Honours <hi>worthy kinswomā, whose adorning was not
<pb facs="4"/>outward in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of gold, or putting on of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
<note place="margin">1 Peter 3.3, 4.</note> but the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is much set by in the sight of God.</hi> Therefore I have the rather presumed to prefixe your Noble name to this discourse of
<pb facs="5"/>mine (how meane soever) hoping of Your Honours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, in regard of the relation that it hath to that most worthy, &amp; (in mine opinion) matchlesse Gentlewoman, of whose rare vertues, and singular graces Your Lordship hath often beene an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesse,
<pb facs="5"/>and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. So that I am assured you will thinke it no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to Your High and profound stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to cast your eyes upon such an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly body, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limated soule, as she was, but rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it as a meanes to refine Your deepe
<pb facs="6"/>contemplations, and make them ascend above the <hi>Stars</hi> and al <hi>inferiour Orbs</hi> even into the <hi>third Heaven,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.2, 4. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note> where the <hi>Apostle</hi> heard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable words, which is not possible for man to utter, which all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, save that
<pb facs="6"/>which is called <hi>Ars artium, &amp; Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia scientiarum,</hi> to wit, <hi>Divinity.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For this blessed <hi>Gentlwoman</hi> was the <hi>mirrour</hi> of her time, considering her <hi>Age,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage,</hi> and may bee a <hi>Patterne</hi> to Posterity, both for admiration, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
<pb facs="7"/>Because she so seriously bent her best indeavours to the best things. For having once found that <hi>Pearle of greatest price,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. ver. 45, 46.</note> she was willing with the wise <hi>Merchant</hi> to part with all for the purchase of it, as being the <hi>only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament</hi> of men and women, surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="7"/>al other pearls and precious stones. She was able <hi>to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne of thing; that differ, and did approve the things that are excellent,</hi> so that she became, <hi>wiser than the ancient, because shee kept GODS precepts,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Psalm.</hi> 119.100.</note> wherby she was ripe
<pb facs="8"/>for heaven, before others of her age, and quality, begin so much as seriously to set themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that holy place. She could not satisfie her selfe, as most doe, with that which went for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in <hi>Salvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> time,
<note place="margin">

      <note place="margin">Phil. 3.13, 14.</note> But <hi>forgetting that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to that, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, shee pressed toward the mark, for the high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of GOD in Christ Iesus.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="9"/>
   <p>Therefore I had two speciall motives which induced mee to wenter this little labour into the light in this <hi>curious,</hi> and <hi>criticall</hi> age.</p>
   <p>First, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To preserve the happie memory of Your Lordships deare and well-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Neece, who was <hi>worthie
<pb facs="9"/>to be had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
      <note place="margin">Your zeale hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked very many, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2.</note> That by her zealous and Heavenly Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple J might (if it were possible) wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and quicken the dead, and drouzie hearts of men and women, who in the worst things want
<pb facs="10"/>the bridle, but in the best the spurre. J know that the best men or women, want warmth and heate in this old, and cold age of the world, therefore I thought so lively, and spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a spirit as shee had, might bee of much force to make many, either blush
<pb facs="10"/>for shame, or burne with zeale for the glory of God.</p>
   <p>Thus Noble Lord having had often experience of Your rare humility and courtesie, as also of your approved piety and charity; I was willing by these lines to let the world know, how much J
<pb facs="11"/>honor you, and your choyce learning, mixt with singular modesty, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed true Nobility But being perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that you had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do things prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy than read your own praises,
