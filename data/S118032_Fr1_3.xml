<pb facs="5"/> the duty, calling and condition of a seruant, not for any worthinesse or excellency that is in it, but to doe good (if it may be) to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, to teach the inorant, to reprooue the stubborne, and to let all seruants see and vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstand what is required of them, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they be called and the rather for that this doctrine being so needful, so little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (to my knowledge) hath beene of late written therof: although of many good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, many good men, haue written many good bookes, spent many good houres, to the honour of God, and edification of his church for all which blessed bee the name of the Lord, from this time forth for euermore.
