   <head>¶ The Preface of <hi>Frederike Dedekind to maister</hi> Simon Bing <hi>Secretarie</hi> of Hassia.</head>
   <l>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch happinesse on you (deere friend)</l>
   <l>the heau'ns I pray bestow,</l>
   <l>As you for your so vertuous minde</l>
   <l>most requisite doe know.</l>
   <l>If that your matters of more weight</l>
   <l>did not your presence crave,</l>
   <l>Your counsell and your ayde, concerning</l>
   <l>this my booke I'de have.</l>
   <l>My Muse, which whilome in two bookes</l>
   <l>did rusticke faults deride,</l>
   <l>I have recalld, and into three,</l>
   <l>foorthwith will it divide.</l>
   <l>And now againe, through all the worlde</l>
   <l>I purpose it to send,</l>
   <l>If fortune, friends, and you doe favour</l>
   <l>that which I intend,</l>
   <l>Then marke I pray, for vnto you</l>
   <l>I'le open all the truth,</l>
   <l>My minde, my meaning, and intent,</l>
   <l>vnto well nurturde youth.</l>
   <l>Those manners which vnseemely are</l>
   <l>in these decaying times:</l>
   <l>And auntient rude simplicitie</l>
   <l>I checke in iesting rimes:</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="4"/>If this my Booke will profite yeeld</l>
   <l>to men of any kind,</l>
   <l>And make them weed home-bred behavior,</l>
   <l>quite out of their minde:</l>
   <l>That's all I want, that's all I crave,</l>
   <l>that is the furthest scope</l>
   <l>Of all my paines, of all my cares,</l>
   <l>of all my furdest hope.</l>
   <l>But out alas, how dares my Muse</l>
   <l>such good successe exspect?</l>
   <l>Since bad mens ill conditions</l>
   <l>do so the times infect.</l>
   <l>I hope, but other mens examples</l>
   <l>do me much dismay,</l>
   <l>Which have in vaine whole ages spent</l>
   <l>in counselling that way.</l>
   <l>What skill'st too late for to relate</l>
   <l>renowned <hi>Platoes</hi> Bookes?</l>
   <l>And all those lights, and guides, whose losse</l>
   <l>poore <hi>Greece</hi> but hardly brookes,</l>
   <l>Which tride indeede, but all in vaine,</l>
   <l>those vices to amend,</l>
   <l>Which did mens mindes, by follies meanes,</l>
   <l>in beastly sort offend.</l>
   <l>And for our later Latine writers,</l>
   <l>did they aught prevaile?</l>
   <l>Which did so long, with such great paines,</l>
   <l>gainst rusticke vices raile.</l>
   <l>Did not sage <hi>Tully</hi> in his bookes,</l>
   <l>mens dueties plainely tell?</l>
   <l>And teach both yong and old, the meanes,</l>
   <l>to live and die right well?</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>Yet for all this, what good? what gaines?</l>
   <l>procur'd that learned worke,</l>
   <l>Since vntamde actions well doe shew,</l>
   <l>what in mens minds doth lurke:</l>
   <l>So did old learned <hi>Roterodam</hi>
   </l>
   <l>set foorth a booke of price,</l>
   <l>From which, for manners straitest rule,</l>
   <l>all youth might take advise,</l>
   <l>And yet what profite did he get</l>
   <l>by that most worthy booke?</l>
   <l>Or who did on it, as he ought,</l>
   <l>for better counsell looke?</l>
   <l>Too few do now (God wot) regard</l>
   <l>that jewell of such price,</l>
   <l>Whenas whole multitudes of men</l>
   <l>runne headlong vnto vice.</l>
   <l>I touch not heere small common faults,</l>
   <l>of a disorderd life,</l>
   <l>(Although of these in every place</l>
   <l>the world is too too rife)</l>
   <l>But let them passe as trifling faults,</l>
   <l>and vertues, in respect</l>
   <l>Of those great crimes and beastly deedes,</l>
   <l>which I will heere detect.</l>
   <l>For you shall finde, if you vncloake</l>
   <l>mens manners base and rude,</l>
   <l>Many which in Rusticitie,</l>
   <l>farre passe the multitude.</l>
   <l>Put case you finde them eating meate,</l>
   <l>to stuffe them till they burst,</l>
   <l>Or quaffing liquor pot by pot,</l>
   <l>to quench their drunken thurst.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>You'le sweare they do no whit respect</l>
   <l>the end of their creation,</l>
   <l>Nay, (which is more,) you'le almost sweare</l>
   <l>they care for no salvation.</l>
   <l>What though their souls were sent from heaven?</l>
   <l>as things of peerelesse price,</l>
   <l>Yet thei'le love Reason worse then Follie.</l>
   <l>Vertue worse then Vice.</l>
   <l>They square their actions by the rule</l>
   <l>of beasts of brutish kinde,</l>
   <l>And to their bellies blinde desires,</l>
   <l>they captivate their minde.</l>
   <l>Their wide stretcht guts, beyond the vse</l>
   <l>of Nature or of neede,</l>
   <l>In every place, at every time,</l>
   <l>vnsatiately they feede.</l>
   <l>Pots by the dozens filld to'th brims,</l>
   <l>into their guts they presse,</l>
   <l>Whenas (God knowes,) their greatest thirst</l>
   <l>might well be quench'd with lesse.</l>
   <l>If after Gods gifts thus abus'd,</l>
   <l>they heere at length would end,</l>
   <l>T'were well, but they exspect for faults,</l>
   <l>that men should them commend.</l>
   <l>And yet this fault, this great offence,</l>
   <l>which daily men live in,</l>
   <l>By custome and continuance,</l>
   <l>goes currant for no sin.</l>
   <l>But what's the cause I pray, that men</l>
   <l>neglecting counsells guide,</l>
   <l>Leave Vertues straight and narrow path,</l>
   <l>and hold on Vices side?</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="6"/>Why this, bid him that doth offend,</l>
   <l>in sober quiet talke,</l>
   <l>To mend his faults, and in the steps</l>
   <l>of vertuous men to walke.</l>
   <l>Hee'le either laugh in pleasant sort,</l>
   <l>as if you tolde a iest,</l>
   <l>Or else with scorning scouling lookes,</l>
   <l>your absence hee'le request.</l>
   <l>But if against his greater faults,</l>
   <l>with bitter words you scolde,</l>
   <l>Hee'le tell you that in others faults,</l>
   <l>your iudgement is too bolde.</l>
   <l>So that, he which doth nowadaies,</l>
   <l>precepts of manners give,</l>
   <l>May preach, and teach, but all in vaine,</l>
   <l>men as they list will live.</l>
   <l>And so, good men which in this subiect</l>
   <l>have great studie spent,</l>
   <l>Have lost their labor, for to follow them,</l>
   <l>no man is bent.</l>
   <l>And yet example of their fortune,</l>
   <l>troubleth me no whit,</l>
   <l>But that same marke which all they misst,</l>
   <l>I'le venture for to hit.</l>
   <l>And though to dance after their pipe,</l>
   <l>the vulgar sort refuse,</l>
   <l>Yet I'le presume to teach them manners,</l>
   <l>which they ought to vse.</l>
   <l>Perhaps I shall be counted rash,</l>
   <l>and all my hopes but vaine:</l>
   <l>And yet I'le hope, perhaps my meanes</l>
   <l>more auditors will gaine.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="6"/>Dame Fortune is vnconstant, changing</l>
   <l>course each other while:</l>
   <l>Then, though on some she frowne,</l>
   <l>yet she on me may glance a smile.</l>
   <l>Tush, no man knowes the wages, which</l>
   <l>I looke for at her hand,</l>
   <l>I doubt not but the vulgar sort</l>
   <l>my methode will command.</l>
   <l>Fortune, I'le try thee, for I thinke</l>
   <l>in triall there's no harme;</l>
   <l>And god <hi>Apollo</hi> from ill lucke,</l>
   <l>my enterprises charme.</l>
   <l>What though perhaps I not prevaile?</l>
   <l>t'is but my labour lost,</l>
   <l>A few ill verses spent in vaine,</l>
   <l>and this is all my cost.</l>
   <l>But for because austere commands,</l>
   <l>and precepts cannot win,</l>
   <l>Which say, that all but honestie,</l>
   <l>to do, or thinke, is sin.</l>
   <l>I'le try by other meanes new found,</l>
   <l>the selfe-same marke to hit,</l>
   <l>Refusing all those other waies,</l>
   <l>wherein fore-fathers writ.</l>
   <l>Free leave to live disordredly,</l>
   <l>vnto all sorts I give,</l>
   <l>And I command, that in good order,</l>
   <l>none presume to live.</l>
   <l>Each clowne shall see what fits him best,</l>
   <l>and what his manners be,</l>
   <l>And I affirme, that craftie deeds</l>
   <l>with crafty knaves agree.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="7"/>Perhaps when many see these faults</l>
   <l>so fitting their owne name,</l>
   <l>Such clownish manners from their mindes,</l>
   <l>thei'le banish quite for shame.</l>
   <l>No other meanes is left behinde,</l>
   <l>to cure this eating sore,</l>
   <l>For being sencelesse of their faults,</l>
   <l>they love them more and more.</l>
   <l>Within the minde of sinfull man,</l>
   <l>vice now hath got such roote,</l>
   <l>As by slight meanes to weede it out,</l>
   <l>it would be little boote.</l>
   <l>Yet let vs not dispaire for helpe,</l>
   <l>since this one meanes is left,</l>
   <l>Whereby our mindes of vices buds,</l>
   <l>may quickly be bereft.</l>
   <l>Since to forbid vice will not helpe,</l>
   <l>we will alow vice too;</l>
   <l>The common people, that which you</l>
   <l>forbid them, often doo.</l>
   <l>Health most dispaired, healths greatest causer,</l>
   <l>sometimes proved is,</l>
   <l>And that from which men looke for bale,</l>
   <l>doth often bring forth blisse.</l>
   <l>You see the good Phisitian,</l>
   <l>whenas he cannot cure</l>
   <l>By medcines might, a sicknes great, sprung</l>
   <l>from a bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> impure.</l>
   <l>How many waies he seekes, to ease</l>
   <l>his patients grievous smart,</l>
   <l>By seeking learned phisickes aide,</l>
   <l>by labour or by Art.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="7"/>One while with Poticarie drugs,</l>
   <l>he mitigates his paine:</l>
   <l>Now he with dust opens his wounds,</l>
   <l>now shuts them vp againe.</l>
   <l>One while with mangling salve, he cuts</l>
   <l>a member almost dead,</l>
   <l>Another while he seares the same,</l>
   <l>with yron burning red.</l>
   <l>At length when all <hi>Machaons</hi> arte</l>
   <l>and phisickes force hath done,</l>
   <l>(And yet the patient is as sicke,</l>
   <l>as when he first begunne.</l>
   <l>He gives him hote preservatives,</l>
   <l>to comfort vp his heart,</l>
   <l>But all in vaine, he still is sicke,</l>
   <l>(diseases master Art.)</l>
   <l>At length he comes to contraries,</l>
   <l>and alters quite the case,</l>
   <l>From hote, to colde, he gives him Antidots</l>
   <l>in Cordialls place.</l>
   <l>And thus to him he doth restore</l>
   <l>his vnexspected health,</l>
   <l>Which he before could not procure,</l>
   <l>by phisicke, friends, nor wealth.</l>
   <l>So I perceiving wholesome precepts,</l>
   <l>fitting for the minde,</l>
   <l>Neglected, and fault-finders workes,</l>
   <l>to purchase naught but winde.</l>
   <l>All that which good men ought to practise,</l>
   <l>I forbid them flat,</l>
   <l>And all which country clownage</l>
   <l>counteth currant, I bid that.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="8"/>That so, whereas throughout my booke.</l>
   <l>I still forbid the good,</l>
   <l>The contrarie I meane, the bad</l>
   <l>I would have vnderstood.</l>
   <l>Perhaps while some with greedie minde,</l>
   <l>my iesting rimes doth view,</l>
   <l>He shall behold of his owne life,</l>
   <l>a looking-glasse most true.</l>
   <l>And blushing, of his owne accord,</l>
   <l>when no man doth him see,</l>
   <l>Will spie his faults, and mend them all,</l>
   <l>and give some thanks to mee.</l>
   <l>But by the way, thou which within</l>
   <l>this glasse dost thus behold</l>
   <l>Thine owne disordred manners, and</l>
   <l>thy life, be not so bold,</l>
   <l>As to finde fault with me thy friend,</l>
   <l>or with my little booke,</l>
   <l>Which vpon thee, as vpon all, with</l>
   <l>selfe-same eyes doth looke.</l>
   <l>If any will assume these faults</l>
   <l>as theirs, at the first view,</l>
   <l>Know they that they confesse themselves</l>
   <l>some of the rusticke crew.</l>
   <l>Wherefore, vnlesse he purpose</l>
   <l>to proclaime himselfe a clowne,</l>
   <l>All anger lately taken vp,</l>
   <l>I wish him to lay downe.</l>
   <l>Perhaps some severe Catonist</l>
   <l>will this my booke accuse,</l>
   <l>Because I good behaviour,</l>
   <l>by contraries abuse.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="8"/>And say that I in common sence,</l>
   <l>have made a grievous breach,</l>
   <l>Who those things, which to do t'is sinne,</l>
   <l>have thus presum'd to teach.</l>
   <l>And I confesse, within my booke</l>
   <l>there are bad precepts store,</l>
   <l>And I may seeme to spurre a horse,</l>
   <l>which ranne too fast before.</l>
   <l>But those which looke into the worlds</l>
   <l>bad nature with good eyes,</l>
   <l>I thinke concerning this my booke,</l>
   <l>will iudge farre otherwise.</l>
   <l>And finde that in this booke of mine,</l>
   <l>no hurt at all doth lurke,</l>
   <l>But that a man without much danger,</l>
   <l>may pervse this worke.</l>
   <l>For clownish customes long ago,</l>
   <l>have made our mindes so bad,</l>
   <l>That to our ill behaviours</l>
   <l>we can no worser adde.</l>
   <l>We neede not have a master then,</l>
   <l>to make vs sinne the more,</l>
   <l>For we without a guide, of vice</l>
   <l>can quickly get great store.</l>
   <l>Men sinne most willingly, and for their</l>
   <l>hainous faults seeke praise,</l>
   <l>And have such persons as will still,</l>
   <l>to skies their vices raise.</l>
   <l>Whatse're I write, in other men</l>
   <l>I often have it seene,</l>
   <l>From things oft done, the subiect of</l>
   <l>my booke deriv'd hath beene.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="9"/>Those faults, which ere I thought to write,</l>
   <l>in other men were knowne:</l>
   <l>How can you iustly say, that I</l>
   <l>devisde them of mine owne?</l>
   <l>Or by what meanes should this my booke,</l>
   <l>make any to be bad,</l>
   <l>Vnlesse before from vertues paths,</l>
   <l>their mindes declined had?</l>
   <l>Wherefore I guiltlesse am of this,</l>
   <l>that I should now devise,</l>
   <l>Or set new found rusticitie,</l>
   <l>before the readers eyes.</l>
   <l>If none I profite, (as God knowes,)</l>
   <l>I meane to profite many,</l>
   <l>Yet sure I know that this my booke</l>
   <l>can bring no hurt to any.</l>
   <l>And now at length (my good friend <hi>Bing,</hi>)</l>
   <l>whose favour I esteeme,</l>
   <l>Thou which the chiefe of all my friendes,</l>
   <l>at all my neede hast beene;</l>
   <l>Respect these youthfull verses, fruits</l>
   <l>of an vntamed braine,</l>
   <l>And let your favour these my lines,</l>
   <l>with wonted love maintaine.</l>
   <l>Be ready now to take tuition</l>
   <l>of my booke and me,</l>
   <l>And let my verse be patroniz'd,</l>
   <l>vnder the name of thee.</l>
   <l>Gainst all the poisned tongues of those,</l>
   <l>that would my booke defame,</l>
   <l>Defend these trifling toyes of mine,</l>
   <l>vnder thy worthie name.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="9"/>In briefe, this booke with all his faults,</l>
   <l>I dedicate to thee,</l>
   <l>That by thy hand from after-claps,</l>
   <l>it may defended bee.</l>
   <l>If aught I have, (as sure I have)</l>
   <l>let passe in this my booke,</l>
   <l>Supply the wants I you desire,</l>
   <l>as over it you looke.</l>
   <l>If any thing in this my worke,</l>
   <l>be added more then should,</l>
   <l>Correct it for its masters sake,</l>
   <l>for so full faine I would.</l>
   <l>And so I being well perswaded,</l>
   <l>of your strength and might,</l>
   <l>Commit this scepter to your hand,</l>
   <l>which is your owne by right.</l>
   <l>And furthermore, vnto your lawes,</l>
   <l>all such I do subiect,</l>
   <l>Which this my perfect worke, of old</l>
   <l>Simplicitie respect.</l>
   <l>Behold your mightie empire stretcheth</l>
   <l>over sea and land,</l>
   <l>And in all kingdomes of the earth,</l>
   <l>your kingdome hath command.</l>
   <l>For this great gift, what benefit</l>
   <l>can you repay to mee?</l>
   <l>Let me be thine, and thou be mine,</l>
   <l>that's all I aske of thee.</l>
   <l>Keepe me thy friend, and with the favour</l>
   <l>which thou hast begunne,</l>
   <l>Pursue me, and my heart to thee</l>
   <l>for ever thou hast wonne.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="10"/>Behold thy friend, whom if thou lov'st,</l>
   <l>as of him lov'd thou art,</l>
   <l>Thou maist command to do thee good,</l>
   <l>himselfe, his goods, his heart.</l>
   <l>And if the gods respect my thoughts,</l>
   <l>I hope ere long, to send</l>
   <l>A greater matter than this trifle,</l>
   <l>for thee to defend.</l>
   <l>Meane time, because thou of thy selfe,</l>
   <l>deservest to live ever,</l>
   <l>The gods preserve thee from all harme, and</l>
   <l>grant thee to die never.</l>
