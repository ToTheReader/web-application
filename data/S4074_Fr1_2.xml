   <head>TO ALL GODS
PEOPLE, WHO
HAVE ENIOYED
any benefit by my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie,
especially of my
Pastorall charge.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>EARLY Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in the Lord,
although I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
to my selfe,
of many defects
in discharge of
my dutie which
God required at
my hands toward you, (which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beseech the Lord and you to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,)
yet this hath beene, is, and I
hope shall be, to the end of my dayes,
my comfort, that I haue not laboured
in vaine amongst you. What were my
labours and successe thereof, I must
<pb facs="3"/>
appeale to the consciences of you who
are yet liuing; for you know that not
a few are now at rest with the Lord,
whose holy liues and happy ends gaue
good testimony hereof. But to leaue
these to the wise consideration, of such
whom they may concerne, and to giue
vnto all, to whom these presents shall
come, a iust account of my proceedings
herein: I doe professe that for many
yeares past, I haue had my thoughts
much exercised about this prime grace
of Faith; (by which alone we receiue
all sauing grace, and without which
none:) and after that, by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
I found through conference with
many of diuers sorts, that very few at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the true knowledge, much
lesse to the right vse of Faith, either in
the assurance of their saluation, or well
ordering of their conuersation. For to
passe ouer all carnall Protestants, who
only <hi>haue a forme of godlinesse,</hi> making
an outward shew thereof, <hi>and deny the
power of it,</hi> in walking after their owne
lusts: I haue obserued very many, who
haue in truth laboured after saluation,
yet through want of good direction
haue made forsaking of their sinne, the
ground of their beleeuing, and so buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
such a weightie matter, vpon so
weake a foundation, could neuer come
to such certaintie of their saluation, or
<pb facs="3"/>
constancie in a holy conuersation, as
true Faith would haue brought them
vnto. Some others I haue seene, who
being deeply affected with the sense of
their misery, and knowing that there is
no meanes of recouery, but by Christ,
haue desired nothing more, then to be
deliuered, and restored by him; yet
these not knowing the right way how
to attaine to Faith, by which alone
doe receiue Christ and all his benefits)
haue spent many yeares vnprofitably
and vnfruitfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ly. Others there be who
perswading themselues, that they haue
Faith, and thereby bee quieted from
feare of condemnation, yet much wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the life and power of Faith, neither
so honour God and their profession,
nor in time of triall, finde that sound
peace and comfort, which a liuely Faith
would certainly procure. By all which
it appeareth, how few they be that haue
attained to the true knowledge of Faith
what it is, how it is go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ten and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and how to liue by it. The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
whereof grieuing my soule
to see so many mistaken in so weightie
a matter, and so much labour to be lost,
hath been the chiefe moouer of me, to
imploy all my thoughts, how this great
euill may be redressed. Whereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
into deeper consideration, how
this might be attained, I well perceiued,
<pb facs="4"/>
that (seeing Gods truth reuealed vnto
vs in his Word, is the sole ground of
Faith,) the only way to get and keepe
Faith, is to bee well acquainted with
Gods Word, in which I cannot suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
admire the wisedome and loue
of God; in prouiding such store of
heauenly comforts, to releeue vs in all
our necessities: so that had wee the
knowledge, and the right vse of them,
we should then see, what were the Life
of Faith, and the blessed estate of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer
in this world, aboue all other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
though neuer so excellent. These
thus being, I gaue my selfe to the search
of the Scriptures, to finde out what
these heauenly comforts were, which
God hath so abundantly prouided
for our reliefe, in all time of neede.
And to this purpose, (with no small la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour)
haue gathered out all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as well as I could out of both the
Testaments, which being laide toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
made a great heape of heauenly
treasure, such as any of vnderstanding,
would greatly admire and reioyce in
and I may in truth professe, I was much
affected with the bare reading of them.
But well considering, that the naked
laying downe of these promises, would
not be sufficient to direct euery one, to
the right vse and fit application of
them, for the begetting and increasing
of Faith:</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
I haue laboured to draw these vnto
seuerall heads, such as in my opinion
may containe all our necessities, that
at leastwise the weakest sort may more
fitly apply them to their seuerall vses,
and so by Faith be comforted, when all
other helpes faile them. If in this my
labour I haue not so sufficiently satisfied
the desires of the most iudicious: I must
content my selfe, that according to the
measure of grace receiued, I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to be helpfull to such as stand
in neede hereof; and haue carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided,
whatsoeuer I haue thought
might hinder their profiting, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
all controuersies about Faith, and
haue plainly shewed out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
what I haue conceiued to be the
truth; wherein I may haue this defence
of my failing, that I haue not had any
guide in this labour, neither haue I
seene any who haue in this way gone
before me; and therefore I entreate, my
<hi>Reuerend</hi> brethren in the Ministerie,
whose abilities doe farre exceede mine,
that they would perfect this, which is
but weakely begun. And for my part,
I will not cease to pray, that this may be
as profitable to others, as painfull to
my selfe, which the Lord grant, for his
Christs sake.</p>
