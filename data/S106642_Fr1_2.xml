   <p>IT is a question hardly to be determined (my most honorable Lord) whether Musicke may esteeme her selfe more graced by the singularskil &amp; exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site knowledge wherwith your Lordship is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both in the speculation and practise thereof: or by the many benefites, and infinite fauours your Honourable bountie hath conferred on the professors of that faculty: in both are the muses greatly honoured, and we (their seruants) high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blest; whose vertuous endeuours and studious labours, not in this onely, but in many other kindes of Learning, haue receiued their life; growth, and perfection, chereshed and enabled by the warmth your beames haue cast vpon them. Amongst many, that on the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses behalfe doe owe your Lordshippe the tribute of their pennes, I must profes my self to stand deepliest engaged in the debt of dutie, in that the poornes of my merit holds least proportiō with the largenes of your grace, and that my vtmost desert can reach no further, then humbly to acknowledge, that what delight or sweetenes soeuer these my simple trauels may bring to such generous and well composed spiritsas beare affection to this quality, was inspired meby no other power then the influence of your fauour. And though the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of conceite cannot make me so far ouervalew them, as to esteem them worthy your Lordships iudicious hearing, yet I will confesse their want of worth (wherewith my selfe as an impartial censurer, haue already iustly taxte them) could not diuert my purpose from publishing to the world the zeale I beare to thankefulnesse: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I am ambitious of nothing but your Lordshippes fauourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and protection, which if it may please you to vouchsafe to this first birth of my Muse. I shall then be as farre from fearing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and censure, as I am free from affecting glory and prayse.</p>
