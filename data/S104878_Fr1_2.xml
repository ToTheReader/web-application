   <p>GRace and peace wyth all maner spiritual felyng and lyuinge wor thy of the knidnes of Christe, be with the reader and with all that thrist the will of God Amen.</p>
   <p>The cause why I set my name before this litle treatise &amp; haue not rather done it in the new testament is, that then I fo lowed the councell of Christe whiche ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth men Matth. vi. to do their good deades secretly and to be content with the conscience of welldoynge, and that God seeth vs, and pacyent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ye to a byde the rewarde of the last day which Christ hath purchased for vs: and nowe would fayne haue done lykewyse, but am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled otherwyse to do.</p>
   <p>¶ Whyle I a bode a faythfull compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion whiche nowe hathe taken another viage vpon him, to preache Christ where (I suppose) he was neuer yet preached (God which put in his hert thither to go sende his spirite wyth hym, cōforte him, and bringe his purpose to good effecte) one Willyam Roy a man sō<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>what craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye when he cōmeth vnto new acquayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce and before he be thorow knowen and namely when all is spent, came vnto me and offered his helpe. As longe as he hade no money, somwhat I coulde rule hym, but as soone as he had gotten hym
<pb facs="3"/>
money, he became lyke hymselfe agayne.</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse, I suffred all thynges tyll that was ended whiche I could not do alone without one both to wryte and to helpe me to compare the textes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whan that was ended, I toke my leaue and bad hym farewel for oure two lyues, and as men say a daye longer, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we were departed he wente, and gat him new frendes whiche thynge to dooe he passeth all that euer I yet knewe. And there when he had stored hym of money he gote hym to Argentyne where he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth wonderful faculties and maketh bost of no smal thinges. A yere after that and now. xii. Monethes before the pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of this worke, came one Ierome a brother of Grene whiche also, throughe Wormes to Argentyne, saiynge: that he entended to be Christes disciple another whyle &amp; to kepe (as nye as God woulde geue him grace) the profession of his bap tysme, and to get hys lyuynge with his handes, and to lyue no lenger ydely and of the sweate and laboure of those cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyues whiche they had taught, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in Christ: but in cut showes and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sset coetes. Whiche Ierom with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence I warned of Royes boldnesse and exhorted hym to be ware of hym and to walke quiyetly and with all pacience and longe sufferynge accordinge as wee haue Christ and his Apostles for an ensample,
<pb facs="3"/>
whiche thynge he also promysed me. Ne uerthelesse when he was comen to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentyne willyam Roye (whose tunge is able not only to make fooles sterke mad, but also to deaceyue the wyseste that is at the fyrst syght and acquaintaunce) gat hym to him and set him a worke to make rymes, whyle he hym selfe translated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyaloge out of laten in to englyshe. In whose prologe he promiseth more a great deale than I fere me he will euer paye.</p>
   <p>Paul sayeth the seconde Epistel to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothe the seconde Chapter, the seruaunt<note place="margin">Wyth Gods word ought a man to rebuke wikednes and false doctrine and not wyth raylyng times</note> of the Lord must not stryue, but be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto all men and ready to teach, and one that can suffer the euell with meke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; that can enforme thē that resist, if God at any tyme will geue them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ce for to knowe the trueth. It be commeth not then the lordes seruaunt to vse raylynge rymes, but Gods wordes whyche is the right weapon to slay sine, vice and all iniquitie. The scripture of God is good to teache and to improue. ii. Ti. iii. ii. Tes. ii. Paul speaking, of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ sayeth, whom the Lorde shall dest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roye with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sprete or breth of his mouth, that is, with the worde of God. And. ii. Corinthians, tenth The weapens of our warre are not carnall thinges (saieth he) but mighty in God to cast downe strong holdes and so forth: that is, to destroye
<pb facs="4"/>
hye buyldinges of false doctryne. The word of God is that day whereof Paul speaketh. i. Cor. iii. whiche shall declare al thynges, and the fyre whiche shall trye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans worke and consume false doc tryne: with that swearde ought mē sharp ly to fight, and not to rayle with foolysh rymes. Let it not offende the y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> sōe walke inordinatly, let not the wickednes of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das cause the to despise the doctryne of his felowes. No man ought to thynke that Steuē was a false preacher because that Nicolas whiche was chosen felowe with hym. Actu, vi. to ministre vnto the wydowes, fell after in to greate heresies as histories make mencion. Good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell go alwayes together, one can not be<note place="margin">Antichryst.</note> knowen with out the other. Marke this also a boue al thynges that Antichriste is not an outward thynge, that is to saye, a man that shoulde sodenly appeare wyth wonders as oure fathers talked of hym.</p>
   <p>No verely for Antichrist is a spiritual<note place="margin">Antichryst is as much to sai as agaynst Chryst and is nothyng but a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
