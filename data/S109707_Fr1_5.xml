      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE</hi> time is already come, which our Saviour fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, should be, before the Fabrick of this world should be dissolved; take heed (saith he) you bee not deceived, for many shall come in my name, and shall say, I am Christ; and that time draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh, but go not after them. And when you shall heare of wars and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, be not affraid; for these things must first be, but the end is not yet; for Nation shall rise against Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Kingdome against King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and there shall be great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaks in divers places, and famines, and deaths, and there shall be terrors and oppositions, and great signes shal
<pb facs="6"/> be seen from heaven, and there shall be great tempests; but before all these things come to passe, they shall violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay hands upon you, they shall perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you, and deliver you up to their Synagogues, &amp; into prisons, and shal set you before Kings and Governors, for my Name sake; your own parents, brethren, kindred and friends shall betray you, and they shall put some of you to death, and you shall bee hated of everybody. He that makes a doubt of the fulfilling of this Prophesie, let him cast his eyes upon the actions of the former age, and behold the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, which is even acted in the sight of all men, which dyes in purple both the body and estates of all men, and yet its Catastrophe doth not yet a peare to us! How many imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christs forged in hell! hath the old Serpent put upon us; he hath suffered (almost) no age to passe, wherein he hath not hammered out new Authors, and Princes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and hath prepared new ways
<pb facs="6"/> for impious devotion; so that we are (even) reserved to that time, than which none was ever more fierce for Religion, nor more barren in Piety. If any more sincere, and more unspot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than the rest, be given us from heaven, that may shew us the path to those heavenly mansions, and that faith which is the only ladder to life eternall, and commands to bee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with works, &amp; bids those other personating sectaries of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to carry more devotion in their hearts than in their countenances, and to be fiercer in doing than say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he shall scarce get from them without hissing, and a clownish jeere; I dare say that these very things doe happen even within the Orchyard of the Church. How many witnesses of the Gospels truth are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by our adversaries to make themselves pastime, to be destroyed by the cruell sword, to be consumed by the devouring flames, and to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within a dark prison. In our age
<pb facs="7"/> have wee seene Nation to rise up against Nation, and their great burden pressing the earth more than ever wee reade of in our bookes; we find, by daily experience, that fathers grow mad and cruell, against their own sonnes; mothers against their daughters, and children against their parents, and that either for Christs, or Mammons sake. Though we see not innumerable Cities over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by earthquaks, yet we know it to bee true in other parts of the World. We see armies of fires in the Firmament, representing unto us and besmeared with the humane blood, which is after to be shed; net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the breaking in of seas, and floods, any new thing; and more I need not say: for as <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, out of whom wee have taken something of that we have formerly declared, doth write, when the swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling waves hang over us, and doe threaten death, which they bring with them, wee call to mind, no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="7"/> pleasures, yea we cast over boord those very things for which we have made a long voyage; and all things, compared with our life, are set at nought. So we also, when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the waves of Gods wrath to swell high, we laye aside the burthen of our wordly possessions, we remove our vaine desires, and cast from us the weight of all our worldly cares; being earnestly and only sollicitous for our hoped for eternal life. So shall it bee that thus lightned, the ship of our devotion may floate, which laden must sink; for the cares which depresse us in this life, do draw our soules in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deep, which is borne so much the higher, amidst the billows of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as wee are carefull to rid it from the thoughts of this world; but there is another thing which wee should duly consider; in these our tempestuous times when a storme doth first arise, the waves are then but small, but presently after they swell to bigger volumes, at length they
<pb facs="8"/> mount so high, that by their lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse they overturne all those that saile upon them. Now also hastens that extreame tempest of soules, that shall overwhelme the whole World, which sets forth unto us its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by wars &amp; slaughters, as it were by some of his waves: And the neerer we do daily come to the end, so much the greater are the volumes of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which we behold; but at the last, when all the Elements are in a hurly burly, the Iudge will come amongst us and bring an end of all things with him; and certainely it is but a moment till he shall shake, not only the earth, but the heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. We ought (vigilantly) to looke for this tempest, and to be afraid of the waves that daily swell against us, and to foresee what must follow upon these troubles, which buffet the World. God himselfe warnes us so, saying, take heed least at any time your hearts be over charged with gluttony and drunkennesse, for drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse
<pb facs="8"/> is a smooth devill, a sweet poyson, a delightfull sin; he that is possessed with it, hath not himself; and he that acts it, commits not a sin, but is wholly sin it selfe; and as the soule which is free from wine, is most wise and of the most excellent temper; so moystned with the vapours of wine, it is as it were enveloped in a cloud, it doth confound nature, makes us lose grace, destroys our glory, and makes us incurre eternall damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He warnes us that we be not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with the cares of this life. For we cannot serve two, God and Mammon; for the love of riches doth farre more torture than refresh our soules: to get them is toylesome, we keepe them with feare, and lose them with much sorrow. He warnes us that we watch at all times, and pray that wee may bee worthy to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the evils to come, and to stand before the sonne of man. Let us watch, O let us watch! for that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day of our Lords comming is kept
<pb facs="9"/> secret, that we might every day stand in awe. The Lord will come in an houre when wee thinke not of him, when wee shall say peace, and all things are safe. Whether we eate, or drinke, or whatsoever we do else, let that dreadfull voice alwayes sound in our eares. Arise ye dead, and come unto judgement. Let us watch, my companions, let us watch; hee shall be blessed, whosoever he be, that doth nothing without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this Iudgement: let us pray, O my companions, let vs pray, let us pray without ceasing, and let us cry with a strong voyce to the Lord; and though wee cease with our tongue, yet let us cry with good workes, and that without ceasing; for prayer is rather of the heart, than of the lippes; rather of our workes, than of our words: the words of him that prays, are not so much observed by God, as the heart of the suppliant. By how much more we are oppressed with the tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb facs="9"/> of carnall things; so much the more fervently we ought to bend our selves unto prayer. Let us pray continually, because wee are alwayes tempted, and because our sins doe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour without intermission to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent us, the world to deceive us, hell to devour us, and the devill to insnare us. Let us surround God, making as it were a power against him by our prayers, that we may bind and overcome our sinnes, the world, hell and the devill, and may without blame wait for the fixed houre, and the day of the universall doome. That houre shall not be unprofitable to us, which to others hath proved most fruitfull; for prayer quenched the fiery fornace for the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; stopped the Lions mouthes that they could not hurt <hi>Daniel;</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the seditious Israelites, for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi> opened Paradise, locked up hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, made the barren wombe fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; loosed <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> bands; nay, he hath enlarged the confidence
<pb facs="10"/> of prayer, which carryed <hi>Cornelius</hi> to heaven, and did justifie the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane.</hi> That I might stirre up and encrease this desire of prayer of Groanes, and of Sighes in my selfe, not long since I framed this incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when <hi>Hanibal</hi> (as it were) was even at our gates, and rash death commanded mee to cease from my other labours: and I doe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impart it to the youth that love learning and religion, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that please, to whom I wholly enthrall my selfe. I have willingly and wittingly passed over those quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and brawles which many make against things of this nature; for I endeavoured not so much to sharpen and embelish the wit, as to amend and better the soul; nor could I with a soaring wing of wit, compasse heaven and earth. If any desire a smooth style, let him know that I made choyce rather to speak in other mens words, and to recollect the sentences of the Ancient, than to speake in
<pb facs="10"/> mine owne phrase; and let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, not the style, but the sense of the matter wherin these things are writ; neither whether it bee according to the usuall manner of phrase, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the matter be true; for if the sense hee true, What skils it, saith a learned German, in so abstruse a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, whether thou cloath it in a fine or a course vaile or garment, so it be not uncomely? Surely my minde is good throughout, and if my humane tongue, or pen; shall any where fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let mee not bee too severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, for there is no malice or obstinacie in it, though there may be weaknesse and obscurity: if any shall maintaine that these things are neither beseeming my age or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I shall willingly give him leave to abound in his owne sense, and (if he please) to bee wise in his owne conceit, yet every man ought to hold piety deare, and to be studious of it, of whatsoever qualitie or years they be of. I am young, sayes one, and
<pb facs="11"/> now I will take my pleasure, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will I repent. This is as much as to say, I will wound my selfe with my sword, and then I will goe to the Chirurgion. Alas knowest thou not that a wound is received in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, that can hardly bee cured in a long time? Thou mayst sin of thy selfe, but rise from sin, alone, thou canst not: in which most grave sentence of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> I end, and seriously rest, <hi>I beseech you doe so with me.</hi>
