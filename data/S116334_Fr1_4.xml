   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S a number do please themselues with so little diuine knowledge as may be: so can they not but oftentimes <hi>maledict good things they vnderstand not,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Iude</hi> 10.</note> as hauing too necre affinitie with the Spirits which Saint <hi>Iude</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. It is sufficient (say they) that we know <hi>Christ Iesus, and him crucified</hi>: and that (say they further) we haue learned, seeing we vnderstand the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of Faith. I answer, there is no Booke in the whole Bible, that teacheth not Christ Iesus and him crucified. Nay more, there is no one Chapter or open head of Scripture but it setteth forth Christ, if not directly also his sufferings. The first and second of <hi>Genesis</hi> setteth out Christ, seeing hee was that <note place="margin">
         <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.1 <hi>and hebr.</hi> 1.3</note>
      <hi>Word</hi> whereby all was created: as also that <hi>Word</hi> which beareth vp al the creature. The 3. Chap. in his 15. vers. doth teach the stooping downe of that <hi>Word</hi> for assuming womans seede: and the Genealogy of <hi>Adam</hi> by <hi>Sheth</hi> doth teach that, till hee came that was promised. Else <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> had drawen the Genealogie to no purpose. For the doctrine of <hi>Chrono-logie,</hi> it is no more but <hi>Speach-of-time,</hi> treating of this diuine businesse. And without Speach-of-generation
<pb facs="6"/>
and Speach-of-time, there can be no Story, no Bible. As for the Genealogies spoke against in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.2.16.23. <hi>&amp; Tit.</hi> 3.9. they be none of these which be diuine, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-ghost must not be brought against himselfe: but (as the Apostle there testifieth) they be <hi>Prophane,</hi>

      <hi>foolish, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous-ones</hi>: which without blasphemie cannot be affirmed of any Scripture: but well inough of diuerse Iewish Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, tending rather to the subuersion than edification of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuers.</p>
   <p>This doctrine of Christ and his Crosse w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s pressed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the eare by voyce, but also to the eie by sensible <hi>signes.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lawe giuen by <hi>Moses,</hi> they had oblations, and lastlie Circumcision and the <hi>Paschal Lamb:</hi> but vnder the Lawe, they had moe oblations with more frequencie. In all which they were to see Christ, and in many of them, his crucifixion and effusion of blood also. And who could with knowledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the Priest-hood, and therein not see Christ? Or who could contemplate the Tabernacle and Temple, and therein not first see Iesus in whome the Godhead should dwell essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and then in a secondarie sence, his mysticall members. In all these the Church was led to Christ, euen as we by baptisme and the Lords Supper.</p>
   <p>But bicause Christ could neuer haue beene crucified, but for sinne (and therefore in himselfe and in his mem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>rs to suffer by the hands of sinners) as indeede he did finally by the hands of Iewes and Romans, a Genealogie therefore of such sinners are set downe and a Chronologie vttering the times of Christ and his Crosse, whether <hi>before, in,</hi> or <hi>since</hi> his Incarnation: the finishment of all which, is vnsealed in the booke of <hi>Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> The enemies to Christ and his Crosse, they are often-times branded out by names of wilde beastes, serpents, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane birds &amp;c. that so in them may be expected but brutish affections and actions: as also termed thornes, brambles and
<pb facs="7"/>
what not vile? The friends to Christ and his Crucifixion, are on th' other side represented by creatures also Vegetatiue and Sensitiue, but in respect of some commendable qualification: and in no Scripture so much, as in this <hi>Song of Songs.</hi> So that for vnderstanding some excellent things in this good people, we are appoynted first, to consider some other creatures, whereby (as by steppes and staires) wee may ascend to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ine qualifications of the Church. Said I, of the Church? Yea of Christ himselfe also; who heere (as also oft in the New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament) hath vouchsafed to be sacramentally set forth vnder names of inferiour creatures.</p>
   <p>This remembred, I further make answere to our Nouices, which delight themselues in I know not what measure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and supposed principles:<note place="margin">

For when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beginne to please themselues in a little Catechisme doctrine, they begin to enter into a defection and backe sliding from the little which they haue already receiued. Secondly, there is no peece of GOD his Booke, but it hath <hi>direct, Collaterall,</hi> or an <hi>Antitheticall</hi> relation to <hi>CHRIST,</hi> if not also to his sufferings: insomuch as all that is more largely and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably saide, it doeth finally returne to that one foundation, Iesus: whereon wee are euer to be building, vntill wee haue

      </note> History in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Allegorie: entertaining (and good enough for that purpose) the Apocripha-writings also. By the which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not easily be otherwise perswaded; but as first: they shut vp God and Diuell, Christ and Antichrist, Heauen and Hell, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse and <hi>Canaan,</hi> good and badde Angel, within mans soule, as being all of them but <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Their dotage is neuer countenanced in the truth of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Allegorie: Seeing this truth lieth in establishing the Historie, the Genealogie and Chronologie: but their fanatike forme of Allegorizing ouerturnes it.

   <p>As I would haue thee to auoid this Familists error on the left hand, in making Religion an Allegorie: so, to flie the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour on the right hand, whereby some would haue Religion without all Allegorie.
