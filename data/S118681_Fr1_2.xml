      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall obseruations in that Honourable iourney into <hi>Spain,</hi> lately performed by the right honourable and worthy Earle, The Earle of <hi>Nottingham;</hi> although amongst many reasons which perswaded me to be therein to my selfe secret, and to the world sparing in diuulging this Treatise, I found especially (and which I must of necessitie confesse) mine owne weakenesse in compiling the same and making it fit and worthy of so generall a reading, as by this consequence it must vndergoe: yet being ouer-weighed with many especiall motiues which I could not well answer or contradict, I thought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="3"/> to expose my selfe to the fauourable censure of the worthiest &amp; best minded; (who rather respect a plaine and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred stile, yet true, than a tale consisting of eloquent phrases, but doubtfull) than pleasing my selfe in mine owne fearefull humor, giue cause of offence to them whom most I laboured to content. The first of these motiues being, That many of my friends, knowing me to haue been by especiall appointment an Attendant vpon his Lordship in that honourable emploiment, and vnderstanding of the care taken by me in obseruing some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in the same; exceedingly vrged me to giue them a perfect knowledge and satisfaction thereof: which as it was a thing likely to be tedious, so could they not receiue that contentment by a briefe Report, which a more ample Relation
<pb facs="3"/> and Discourse might better affoord. Another was, That for that it came to our knowledge, how many false and ill contriued reports had beene bruted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad after our departure from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> aswell derogating from that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable enterteinment we receiued in generall whilest we were in <hi>Spaine,</hi> as from the proceedings of his Lordship and his Company in some particulars, I could not but (taxing my selfe of dutie to his Lordship and the rest) endeuour to satisfie all doubtfull and vnsatisfied minds with relating and declaring the truth thereof. But a third and a more especiall cause is, That sithence our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, one not well informed hauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to know much of the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of that Iourney, and mistaking himselfe in his own vnderstanding, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="4"/> published a Pamphlet of many false and erroneous obseruations: therby pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing the Readers with an vntrue Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that, the trueth whereof they so much desired. Ʋpon these former consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations therfore, I was aduised to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto your generous acceptance my wel-meaning endeuors; which although they cannot giue that pleasure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in reading you happily expect, yet shall they assure you what they promise: That is; A true Relation of such things which happened in that honorable Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. In reporting whereof, I had rather be condemned for plainnesse, than once suspected for reporting an vntrueth.</p>
