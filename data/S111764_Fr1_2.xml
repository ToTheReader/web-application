      <salute>Noble Sir.</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He good assurance of your native worth, and thrice ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous disposition, as also the continuall manifestation of your bounteous favour, and love towards my selfe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, hath so bound my thankfull acknowledgement, that I count it the least part of my service to present the first fruites of my farre-fetcht experience, to the kinde acceptance of your charitable hands: well knowing that though this my worke, owne not worth enough to deserve your patronage, yet such is your benigne humanity, that I am confident you will daigne it your protection, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which it willingly shrowdes it selfe. And as it is reported of that man whose name was <hi>Alexander,</hi> being a cowardly milke-sop by nature, yet hearing of the valiant courage of that magnificent <hi>Hero, Alexander</hi> the Great, whose name hee bore, he thenceforth became stout and valorous; and as he was animated by having the very name of puissant <hi>Alexander</hi>; so shall these my weake and feble la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb facs="3"/>
receive life and courage by the patronage of your much esteemed selfe; whereby they shall bee able to out-face the keenest fanges of a blacke mouth'd <hi>Momus.</hi> For from hence the world may conclude, that either there was some worth in the booke, that caused so wise a person to looke upon it, and to vouchsafe to owne it; or else if they suppose that in charity he fosterd it, as being a poore helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse brat, they may thence learne to do so likewise. If here I should take upon me the usuall straine of a soothing Epistolizer, I should (though upon better grounds than many) sound forth a full mouth'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiasticke of your incomparable worth: but though your deserts may justly challenge it, yet I know your vertuous modesty would not thanke me for it; and indeed your owne actions are the best <hi>Heralds</hi> of your owne praise, which in spite of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy it selfe must speake you Wise, and truly Noble: and I for my part, if I may but present any thing, which either for its profit or delight may obtaine your favourable approbation, I have already rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the harvest of my expectation; onely I must desire you to pardon my bold presumption, as thus to make your well deserving name, the frontispeece to so rude and ill deserving frame. Thus wishing a confluence of all blessings both of the throne, and foot-stoole, to be multiplied upon your selfe, and your vertuous Consort, my very good Lady, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the Stemmes of your Noble family, I take my leave and rest,</p>
