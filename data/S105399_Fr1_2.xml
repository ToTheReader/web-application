   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>TO thee that shalt peruse this Poem, and not conuersant in the histories of those times, (I am perswaded) these briefe Annotations shall not be altogether impertinent. By reason the letter (without my knowledge) was chosen too large for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I am constrained to doe as men sometime preparing great bankets, and deceiued of table roome, to send in one dish what should haue serued to set out many; as to put in this one preface what should haue been in marginall notes stuck in sundrie places against the stanzaes to which they are apropriate: as this.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The 9. page, the 2. stanza, <hi>For hauing Boston businesse</hi> &amp;c. The towne of <hi>Boston</hi> sued to the Pope for the reauthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing their Hauen, which had been suspended from that Sea, selecting one <hi>Chambers</hi> for that businesse, who being on his way at <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> finding <hi>Cromwell,</hi> a man industrious and experienced, made choyce of him as his assistant, whom he wan to goe along with him to <hi>Rome.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The 11. page, the 1. stanza, <hi>Russell and Pace</hi> &amp;c. both great States men of that time, and imployed by <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. in forraine Intelligence, after both Secretaries, and <hi>Russell</hi> by him created Earle of <hi>Bedford.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The 15. page, the 3. stanza, <hi>Where learned More and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner</hi> &amp;c. For the former so famous, as who knoweth not I hold him vnworthie to know; the latter, <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> after Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> a learned and politike Prelate, and one that was in the end a chiefe instrument of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> ouerthrow.</p>
   <p>The 20. page, the 2. stanza, <hi>Bedford whose life</hi> &amp;c. This was that <hi>Russell,</hi> as I haue said before, by <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="2"/>
Earle of <hi>Bedford</hi>; as in the same stanza, <hi>And reuerend Hayles,</hi> &amp;c. Sir <hi>Christopher Hayles</hi> Master of the Rolles, a man in great grace with the King, and an especiall fauourer of <hi>Cromwell.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The 23. page, the 1. stanza, line 2. <hi>Of hospitable Friscobald and mee</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Friscobald</hi> a Florentine Merchant, relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Cromwell,</hi> being in great necessitie, who after being Chancellor of England he honorably requited. This sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie containeth some 14. stanzaes.</p>
   <p>The 28. page, the 3. stanza, <hi>And the King late obedient to her lawes, against the Clerke of Germany</hi> &amp;c. King <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. wrote a booke against <hi>Luther,</hi> which booke afterward <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (forgetting all kingly titles) roughly answered.</p>
   <p>The 34. page, the 1. stanza, <hi>Pierce the wise Plowman</hi> &amp;c. The morall of Contrition and the Frier, the matter of which is <hi>Pierce Plowmans</hi> in his vision, the workmanship therof wholly mine owne, containing about 10. stanzaes.</p>
