      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat one age may tell ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the memoriall of the just shall be ever blessed, when the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and names of those that are otherwise min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded shall rot and vanish away: It hath beene the pious custome of ancient and later times, to commend to posterity the eminent graces of the Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Famous are those Panegyricke Orations made at the tombes of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in the Primitive times; when as their persecuting Emperours, priding themselves in their lamentable deaths, have left no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="9"/>
noyse behind them, than the loud and long continued cries of spilling innocent bloud.</p>
   <p>Memorable also are the Funerall Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the two <hi>Gregories, Nyssen</hi> and <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> on <hi>Basill</hi> the great: And in later times, to give a few instances, (for the number in this kinde is infinite) <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius</hi> wrote the life of <hi>Martyn Luther; Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the life of <hi>Vrsine; Beza</hi> the life of <hi>Calvin; Antonius Faius</hi> the life of <hi>Beza; Iosias Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> the life of <hi>Peter Martyr;</hi> and D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> the life of our most renowned <hi>Iewell.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This manner of honouring the Saints is warranted by GODS owne example; who (for ought is revealed to us) tooke order for <hi>Moses</hi> buriall, digged his grave, covered him with molds, and made for him that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Funerall Sermon expressed in the first Chapter of <hi>Ioshuah.</hi> And that all-wise GOD who sweetly disposeth all things, thinkes it needfull thus to grace his owne people, that he may hereby uphold their spirits amid those many pressures, scornes, reproaches, <hi>cruell mockings,</hi> and innumerable
<pb facs="9"/>
other miseries which they endure of the world, meerely for his service; be they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise never so wise, just, meeke, peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and unrebukeable amongst men: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse those many terrible persecutions (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned<note place="margin">

   <p>According to these examples, and for the<note place="margin">3</note> very same causes, I have adventured to publish to the world, the life and death of
<pb facs="10"/>
this man of GOD the Authour of this Work, now a Saint in heaven. I confesse his worth and parts deserved rather an advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by some such eloquent Orators as I mentioned before, than a depression by my pen; but yet a pearle may be shewed forth as well by a weake hand, as by the arme of a gyant, I shall do no more. And let his owne worth and workes praise him in the gates. I knew him from the beginning of my youth, being my first Tutour in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and my selfe one of his first Schollers, and from that time to the day of his death, being above seven and twenty yeares, none knew him better, or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him more; our familiarity was such, that (alluding to that betweene <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>)<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1, 4.</note> I may say, I knew his doctrine, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, faith, charity, patience; and now will onely relate what I have heard and seene, wherein I will not exceed the bounds of modesty or truth.</p>
   <p>To begin with his birth; I observe that<note place="margin">4</note> throughout the sacred Bible, and writings on the persons of holy men, their places of
<pb facs="10"/>
birth are ever remembred; GOD loves the very ground his servants tread on: <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>shall count</hi> (sayes <hi>David) when he</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 87. 6.</note>
      <hi>numbreth up the people, that this man was borne there;</hi> whereas of other men there shall be no remembrance of them, they shall have none to lament or bury them, but shall be cast forth as dung on the face of the earth: so that I may say of them, as was said of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, famous for nothing but his wickednesse; <hi>intravit vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, regnavit leo, exivit canis;</hi> the Prophet <hi>David</hi> renders it thus in plaine English. <hi>They spend their daies in mirth, and suddenly go downe into hell.</hi>

   <p>He was borne at <hi>Blackborne</hi> a towne of<note place="margin">5</note> good note in <hi>Lancashire</hi> on Whitsunday,<note place="margin">Camb. Brit. pag. 752.</note>
      <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1572. His parents being not of any great meanes, yet finding in him a great towardlinesse for learning, destinated him to be a scholler, and strugled with their estate to furnish him with necessaries in that kind, apprehending the advantage of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Schoole-master that was then in the<note place="margin">M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Yates.</note> towne. He plied his booke so well, that in
<pb facs="11"/>
short time he became the best scholler in the schoole: and no marvell; for, he had those sixe properties of a scholler noted by <hi>Isocrates</hi> and others, which concurring in<note place="margin">

      <item>1. He was (<gap reason="foreign">

         </gap>) of excellent parts and abilities of mind, and of a sound constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of body.</item>
      <item>2. He was (<gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>) of a very strong me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; I meane such a memory as was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably actuated by his ready and quicke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. For, (as Philosophers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve) that memory which tends to admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being of a quite differing temperature from the understanding, inclines rather to folly, and becomes the ground of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, <hi>The greatest Clerkes are not alwaies the wisest men.</hi>

      <item>3. He was (<gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>) a moover of doubts and questions; this was ever an evident signe of learning; by this our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our approoved His learning amongst the<note place="margin">Luk 2. 46.</note> Doctours in hearing them and asking them questions: So did the Queene of <hi>Shebah</hi> to

      <item>4. He was (<gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>) a speciall lover of learning; it was alwayes his delight to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise himselfe in studies, and would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any aversions from them, as shall be hereafter shewed.</item>
      <item>5. He was (<gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>) a very laborious pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full student, as shall be more largely shewed, for it is worthy imitation.</item>
      <item>6. He was (<gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>) a great listner after the sayings and speeches of others, and hath beene often observed to be onely a hearer, and to sit silent himselfe, unlesse he was urged with some importunity, and the things he heard, he suffered them not to be lost, (if they were of worth) but alwayes put them downe in a booke which he particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly kept for that purpose.</item>

   <p>He continued long at schoole, and came<note place="margin">6</note> not to the Vniversity till about the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">His studies in Lincolne Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> yeare of his age. He was placed at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> in <hi>Lincolne Colledge</hi> under the tuition of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Randall,</hi> a man of no great note then, but
<pb facs="12"/>
afterward became a learned Divine and godly Preacher at <hi>London.</hi> In that Colledge he fell close to the studies of Logick and Philosophie, and by reason of that ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke of learning he got at schoole, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of yeares, he quickly got the start of those of his owne time, and grew into fame in that House. In the middest of these his studies his father died, and then his meanes failed, for all his fathers lands fell to his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brother now living: but this crosse by GODS providence prooved a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him for his growth in learning, though it put him to monstrous paines of body and mind: for now wanting meanes to buy him bookes, he borrowed of his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and others the best writers on Naturall and Morall Philosophy, and the Politicks, and read them all over, and abridged them all in his note-bookes, which are now to be seene, and then returned the bookes to their owners. Nay such a desire he had to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a perfection in the things he studied, that though he was very well skilled in the Greeke tongue, yet that he might attaine an
<pb facs="12"/>
exactnesse in it, he did with intolerable pains write out with his owne hand all <hi>Homer,</hi> (or <hi>Hesiod</hi> I am sure) for I have seene it in a faire Greeke character; for he wrote that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage better than he did either English or Latine; and asking him the reason of his paines, he told me, it was onely that he might accent perfectly. This brought him to such a readinesse, that he could with as much facility <hi>course</hi> in the publike Schooles (for he was a famous disputant) in the Greeke tongue, as in the Latine or English: and in them all he wrote and spake <hi>Stilo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratorio,</hi> as <hi>Lipsius</hi> calls it, <hi>viz.</hi> a high and lofty stile, which was so familiar to him, as that he could not avoid it in ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
   <p>From <hi>Lincolne Colledge</hi> he remooved to<note place="margin">7</note>
      <hi>Brasen-nose:</hi> For, by the Founders of that<note place="margin">In Brasen-nose Colledge.</note> House most of the Fellowships therein were ordained for <hi>Lancashire</hi> and <hi>Cheshire</hi> men, but comming to that Colledge, having but few friends, he stayed long without a Fellow-ship▪ about which time (that I may not bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in silence the charitable acts of such men

And such was his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme in the Vniversitie for his publike dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,
<pb facs="13"/>
which he ever performed with such readinesse and acutenesse of speech and wit, and such profoundnesse of learning, that when he was a Master of Arts but of small standing, he was chosen by the now <hi>Lord Arch-Bishop of Canterburie, Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi> at King IAMES His first comming to that Vniversity, to be one of the disputants before the King, and to read in Naturall Philosophy in the publike Schooles. Besides his knowledge in Logick and Philosophy, wherein he excelled, he was also well study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Metaphysicks and Mathematicks, and in all Schoole-Divinity, especially in <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> which he had read over once or twice, and had exactly noted him throughout, as may appeare in his notes.</p>
   <p>But all this while though he was <note n="*" place="margin">I may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say of him, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

very anguish of spirit. And to augment his spirituall misery, he was exercised with fowle temptations, <hi>horribilia de</hi> DEO, <hi>terribi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia de fide,</hi> which <hi>Luther</hi> called <hi>Colaphum Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> for as he was parallell with <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> things as I shall shew anon: so was he in these spirituall temptations which were so vehement upon <hi>Luther,</hi> that the very ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of them dranke up his spirits, and his body seemed dead, <note n="*" place="margin">In his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon.</note>

<pb facs="16"/>
shall be likewise further shewed.</p>
   <p>Vpon this he resolved to enter into the<note place="margin">10</note> Ministery, and about the thirty fift yeare of his age was ordained Minister, after which he wholly applied him selfe to the worke of the Ministry, and improoved all his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and time to that excellent end: A little while after he was in the Ministry, he was by meanes made knowne to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Iustice Nicolls,</hi> at that time <hi>Serjeant at Law,</hi> who observing the comlinesse of his person and the stuffe that was in him, had it alwayes in his thoughts to advance him, and about the thirty seventh yeare of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Boltons</hi> age, the personage of <hi>Broughton</hi> in <hi>Northampton shire</hi> falling void, he did by my hand send for him from the <hi>Vniversity</hi> to his chamber at <hi>Serjeants Inne,</hi> and presented him to that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, at which time D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>King</hi> late <hi>Bishop of London</hi> being then by accident at the Iudges chamber, thanked him for M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> but told him withall, that he had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Vniversity</hi> of a singular Ornament▪ Then did he put out his first booke, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>A discourse of true happinesse,</hi> which he
<pb facs="17"/>
dedicated to <hi>Serjeant Nicolls</hi> his patron, which for the godlinesse of the matter, and cloquence of the stile therein contained, was universally bought up, and divers have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that at first bought it out of curiosity, for some sweet relish in the Phrase, tooke CHRIST to boote and thereby tooke the first beginning of their heavenly tast.</p>
   <p>About the fortieth yeare of his age, for<note place="margin">11</note> the better setting of himselfe in house-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vpon his Personage, he resolued vpon marriage, and tooke to wife M<seg rend="sup">rs</seg>. <hi>Anne Boyse</hi> a Gentle woman of an ancient house and worshipfull family in <hi>Kent,</hi> to whose care he committed the ordering of his outward estate, he himselfe onely minding the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and weighty affaires of his heauenly calling, in the which for the space of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares and more, he was so diligent and laborious, that twice every Lords day hee preached, and Catechized in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, in which Catechisme he expounded the Creed and ten Commandements in a very exact manner; And vpon every holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and on euery friday before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="17"/>
he expounded some Chapter, by which meanes he went over the greater portion of the Historicall part of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament. And in them all, as was well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a learned and graue <note n="*" place="margin">M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Estwick in his Sermon at his funerall.</note> Divine that preached at his funerall, he prepared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his people but what might have served a learned Auditory, and in all his preachings he still aimed next to the glory of God at the Conversion of soules, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry crowne and glory of a good Minister at the appearing of that great day: and herein GOD wonderfully honoured his Ministery in making him an aged father in CHRIST, and to beget many sonnes and daughters vnto righteousnesse; for I may truely say, many hundreds were either absolutely converted, or mightily confirmed, or singularly comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their grievous agonies by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery: for he had such an art in this kinde of relieving afflicted consciences, which hee acquired, partly by great paines and industry in searching into that skill, but chiefly by that manifold experience he had in himselfe and others, that he was sought to
<pb facs="18"/>
farre and neare, and divers from beyond the seas desired his resolution in divers cases of Conscience, which was the onely cause that made him put forth that last learned and godly Treatise of his, which he stiled; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions for a right comforting afflicted consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And though in his manner of preaching<note place="margin">12</note> he was a <hi>Sonne of thunder,</hi> yet unto bruised reeds and those that mourned in spirit, hee was as sweete a sonne of Consolation as ever I heard, and with a very tender and pitifull heart powred the oyle of mercy into their bleeding wounds. He (as was said of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>) was a mighty opposite to the Divels kingdome, and had a singular skill to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne his sleights and that cunning crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse whereby hee lies in wait to deceive. He ever thought that there was no such way to cast downe the strong holds of Sathan and to batter his kingdome, then after the steps of <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> to lay the axe close to the roote of sinne, and to set it on with such power, as that the Divell and all his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents were not able to resist it. By this meanes
<pb facs="18"/>
he got ground of Satan and wasted his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and <hi>there were daily added to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery such whose hearts were softned thereby.</hi> And in all his Sermons he ever used to discover the filthinesse of sinne, and to presse very powerfully upon the conscience the duties of Sanctification, in expression whereof three things were remarkeable in him.</p>
   <list>
      <item>1. Such courage and resolution of spirit as is scarcely to be found in any. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that in the cause of GOD he could have beene contented with <hi>Martin Luther, totius mundi odium &amp; impetum sustinere; to have undergone the rage and violence of the whole world,</hi> whereby he gave such vigour unto the truth he delivered, that it pierced betweene the very joynts and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</item>
      <item>2. Impartiality; he would spare none in their sinnes either great or small, he knew he was to deliver his Masters will, with whom was no respect of persons.</item>
      <item>3. His wisedome; as he was of high cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, so was it excellently tempered with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, descryed in these foure things. 1. In
<pb facs="19"/>
all his denunciations against sinne, he never personated any man whereby to put him to shame, unlesse his owne inward guiltinesse caused him to apply it to himselfe. 2. Hee would never presse upon the conscience the guiltinesse of sinne, but he would for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>ifie it by Scripture, by the ancient Fathers (in which he was ripe and ready) and the concurrence of the best Orthodoxe Writers, to stop the mouth of all slanderers that should accuse his doctrine, either of novelty or of too much precisenesse. 3. When he had searcht the conscience to the very quicke (as he would doe) he ever offred CHRIST in all his beauty and sweetnesse, and powred it forth upon the conscience with such a torrent of Eloquence as would haue melted the hearts of any, but those which obstinately refused the voice of that powerfull charmer. 4. He would alwaies protest unto his people, that it was a trouble and griefe to him to preach against their sinnes, hee delighted not to vexe any of their consciences, he should be glad the case was so with them, that hee might only preach the riches of the mercies
<pb facs="19"/>
in CHRIST all his dayes; But he knew no other way to pull them out of the snare of Satan and state of darkenesse then the way he tooke, without drawing the horrible sin of Bloud-guiltinesse upon his soule.</item>
   </list>
   <p>But that which made his preaching more illustrious, was that burning and shining light which appeared in his life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in these five particulars.<note place="margin">Piety.</note>
   </p>
   <list>
      <item>1. His Piety, wherein I need not say much, for that second booke of his concerning <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for walking with</hi> GOD, were framed out of the pious Meditations of his owne heart as a guide for himselfe for the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his steps in the waies of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which he so strictly observed throughout the course of his life that (allowing to him his frailties and <note n="a" place="margin">Et certè ea est semper{que} suit hominum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium etiam piorum &amp; Chistianorum vita, vt semper etiam in opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis &amp; castissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis moribus tamen aliquid possis desidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. <hi>Iewel.

up thither by the wings of prayer. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course was to pray sixe times a day, twice by himselfe in private, twice in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique with his family, and twice with his wife.

He was very Zealous for GOD, not<note place="margin">Zeale.</note> onely by the power of his Ministery in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting many, wherein GOD had wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blessed him, but in any publike or private good that tended to the honour of GOD, to whose glory he wholly sacrificed himselfe and all his studies, which I can the more safely affirme, in that I know he hath divers times<note place="margin">A true argument that he sought not great things to himselfe.</note> refused preferment from some of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb facs="21"/>
and Prelates of this Kingdome, and for no other cause in the world, but that hee might not be divorced from that countrey where his Ministery was so much embraced and wrought so good effects.</item>
      <item>4. But zeale is oft of such violent motion, that as the antient Philosophers supposed of<note place="margin">Wisdome.</note> the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> that if the motion thereof were not finely cooled and allayed by the <hi>coelum Christallinum</hi> next to it, it would set all the Orbes on fire; and therefore the zeale of this Reverend man was alwayes tempered with singular Wisedome and discretion, for though in all his Sermons he prest mightily upon the conscience of his hearers, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times like babes childishly wrangled at the breasts which should nourish them, yet were they never able to resist the authority by which he spake, so that for the space of 22 yeares being the whole time that his Lamp of light shined in <hi>Northampton</hi> Shire, his doctrine was never drawne into question either for error or schisme: so studious was hee ever of the unity and peace of the Church of ENGLAND which hee dearely
<pb facs="22"/>
loved that none could justly quarrell with him, but Papists and other Sectaries, as also others that were corrupted with error or evill life.</item>
      <item>5. Lastly for his Charity, hee was ever<note place="margin">Charity.</note> universally bountifull, but especially he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in those publike distresses of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, France, Bohemia, &amp;c.</hi> and to those that stood in true neede: for the enabling of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hereunto, I have heard him often say (&amp; he made it evident to me) that ever since he was Minister of <hi>Broughton,</hi> he spent every yeare all the revenewes of his Parsonage (which was of good valew) in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his family and acts of hospitality and charity; And that the estate wherewith GOD hath blessed him otherwise, was meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raised by that temporall estate hee had at first. Let them therefore of his owne coate from henceforth cease to traduce him, whom they never did nor dare to imitate. I am sure the Towne of <hi>Broughton</hi> will ever blesse GOD for his charity: for when that lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fire was among them, <hi>September</hi> 21: <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1626. besides the many pounds

he spent out of his owne purse, he was a chiefe meanes that by the only supply of the country without any Letters Patents from above, their houses which were burnt down unto the ground were all new built, and their outward estates liberally sustained and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. Nay such was his charity, that though some of his owne towne had not onely slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Ministry, but wronged him in his tithes, yet he put it up, and never called them to question as he might, nor ever had any suite with them.

<pb facs="23"/>
for perceiving after two or three sits that it mastered his strength, he patiently submitted to indure, what by strugling hee could not overcome; And called for his <hi>Will</hi> which he had made long before, and perfecting some things in it, he caused it to be laid up, and afterwards wholly retired into himselfe, quitting the world and solacing his soule with the meditation of the joyes of heaven, which he had provided to preach to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for having compiled an elaborate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, <hi>de quatuor Novissimis,</hi> of the foure last things, DEATH, IVDGEMENT, HELL <hi>and</hi> HEAVEN, an argument that some Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites and Friars have bungled in, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving finished the three former, told them that the next day he would treat of Heaven: But the day before being Saturday he was visited with sickenesse, and never preached after.

      <hi>If I shall finde favour in the eyes of the LORD hee will bring mee againe and shew me both it and his habitation, but if otherwise, loe heere I am, let him doe what seemeth good in his eyes.</hi> Being asked by another, whether hee could not bee content to live if GOD would grant him life, he thus answered; <hi>I grant that life is a great blessing of GOD, neither will I neglect any meanes that may preserve it, and doe heartily desire to submit to GODS will: But of the two I infinitely desire to be dissolved and to bee with CHRIST.</hi>

He encouraged the Ministers that came to him, to be diligent and couragious in the worke of the LORD, and not to let their spirits faint or droope for any affliction that should arise thereupon.
