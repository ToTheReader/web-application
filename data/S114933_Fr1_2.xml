   <head>COLONELL MONRO TO HIS HIGHNESSE THE PRINCE ELECTOR PALATINE OF RHINE, wisheth health, and happinesse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER seven yeares March in the warres of <hi>Germany</hi> with one Regiment, it being rent in the battell of <hi>Nerlin,</hi> at last I retired unto <hi>Britaine,</hi> to levie againe, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advancement of the good cause, and being at the Court of <hi>England,</hi> attending imployment, to expresse my love, and most humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects unto your Highnesse, having bin an eye-witnesse
<pb facs="3"/>
the accidents most remarkable, which occurred in <hi>Germany,</hi> during those seven yeares warres, though a rude, and ignorant Souldier, I was bold to set pen to paper, to discharge a long seven yeares troublesome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, in short Duties and Observations of service, cōtaining a true &amp; simple narration of the principall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences which happened in the course of this warre, without omitting one dayes March, in three yeares under the Magnanimous King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> nor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, in foure yeares March with the Royall Army, under the fortunate conduct of his Maiesty of <hi>Sweden</hi> of never dying memory.</p>
   <p>Being induced thereto, chiefely, to testifie my humble respects unto your Highnesse, to whom I have ever vowed my best endeavours of service: next, to expresse my love, and thankfulnesse to my country, and to my deere Camerades, <hi>Britaines, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Swedens,</hi> (companions, not of wants, but of valour) eternizing their memory, who after death, like <hi>Phoebean</hi> Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ride triumphing in spite of envy, being praised by their enemies, for having valorously resisted their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, till they died standing, serving the publique, through their great love to your Highnesse Royall Mother, the Queene of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> your Highnesse selfe, and the remnant of the Royall Issue. Hoping therefore (for their sakes departed of worthy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) my paines may be acceptable unto your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for their sakes alive (that long for a new Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) I have beene bold, to send unto your Highnesse at this time, worthy Counsellours, whose counsell your Highnesse may be bold to follow, and their vertues, being most Heroicke and examplary, may be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by your Highnesse, in going before us, as our
<pb facs="3"/>
new Master, Captaine and Leader, being descended, of the valiant <hi>Bruce,</hi> and of the first King of the <hi>Stewarts,</hi> through your Highnesse Royall Mother <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Queene of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> Iewell of her sex, and the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendent in brightnesse of minde, for a woman, that the earth doth afford.</p>
   <p>That great Monarch <hi>Alexander</hi> the great shewed his humanitie (in the wants of old age) to a poore and decrepite Souldier, being weary with great travell in the way, &amp; lent him his own chaire, for to warme him by the fire: and being upon his death-bed (for all the pangs and paines of Death) he disdained not to shake hands with the meanest and poorest of all his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. So Mighty and Illustrious Prince, I, though a poore Souldier, doe Dedicate unto your Highnesse, these my dutifull Observations and Expeditions. Your Highnesse being eminent, as your dignity high, hath made me presume on your Highnesse goodnesse, which, I know, is full of pardons for those, that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence your Highnesse person, as I doe. That I have prefixed your Highnesse name, was my duty, as to my Patron &amp; Superiour, to whom I am ever most bound, especially in discharging of this my duty. Neither doe I pay this tribute unto your Highnesse, as to adde any thing unto your Highnesse knowledge, being already inriched with notable vertues, but rather to expresse my love and dearest respect, in all humility to him, whom I have vowed to follow (if my breath may last so long) till your Highnesse enemies be overcome.</p>
   <p>Daigne therefore, Noble and Illustrious Sir, to let passe this my tedious expedition, and shallow obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, under the name of your Highnesse Patronage, to whom I wish the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, for a possession,
<pb facs="4"/>
as it was extended of old, from the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> at the East, to the Ocean Sea, at the VVest, the fertillest part of <hi>Asrica,</hi> at the South, and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the <hi>Danube,</hi> at the North; which to possesse, come, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sir, unto the field, and fight before us, <hi>Britaines, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who long to see your Highnesse to fight with good lucke and victory, with strength and power, with wisdome and understanding, &amp;c. against your Highnesse enemies, till your Highnesse Royall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Throne be established, after her sacred Majesty, in your Highnesse Person.</p>
   <p>Vouchsafe then, Noble Sir, of your gracious gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity, favourably to accept of my well wishing, and of these my Observations, and esteeme the Author thereof to be for ever</p>
