                 <title>A treatise of witchcraft : VVherein sundry propositions are laid downe, plainely discouering the wickednesse of that damnable art, with diuerse other speciall points annexed, not impertinent to the same, such as ought diligently of euery Christian to be considered. With a true narration of the witchcrafts which Mary Smith, wife of Henry Smith glouer, did practise: of her contract vocally made between the Deuill and her, in solemne termes, by whose meanes she hurt sundry persons whom she enuied: which is confirmed by her owne confession, and also from the publique records of the examination of diuerse vpon their oathes: and lastly, of her death and execution, for the same; which was on the twelfth day of Ianuarie last past.

The first of these mentioned, are slie and masked Atheists, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-shadow their secret impiety, loose and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute behauiour with some outward conformitie and shew of religion, snatching (as they thinke) a sufficient warrantize thereof from those disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they obserue among men, and therfore passe vncensured, hauing a ciuill, but dissembled car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.

And therefore, in respect of these, I haue at your appointment and request (for whom I am most willing to bestow my best labours and euer shall be) penned this small Treatise, occasioned by the detection of a late witch among you, whose irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious care, and vnwearied industry, is not to be defrauded of deserued commendation, and by mature deliberation, and discreete search, found out her irreligious and impious demeanour, and also discouered sundry her vnnaturall and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane mischiefes done to others, whereof being conuicted, she was accordingly sentenced, and did vndergoe the penalty iustly appointed, and due by Law vnto malefactors of that kinde. After all which, you kindled with a holy zeale of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of Gods glorie, and giuing satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to euery one howsoeuer affected, intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no meanes, vsing therein the labour of your carefull Ministers (willingly offering themselues in this holy seruice) whereby she might be broght (as one conuerted in the last houre) to the sight &amp; acknowledgement of her heinous sins in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, &amp; particularly of that of witchcraft, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the same, &amp; by true repentance, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of the tender mercies of God in Christ Iesus saue her soule (who refuseth no true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained conuert at any time.)
