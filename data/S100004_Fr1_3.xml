Wherfore, seeing the Manuell of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> which I lately sent vnto you so generally well esteemed and liked, I haue been encouraged againe the second time to offer vp vnto you this small Treatise, which is of the same stuffe, but a little better laboured. And sending the whole treatise vnto you, I haue thought good to send these letters of aduertisement along with it; for feare, least if it chaunce to light into certaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

bee iniuried before it were fullie read or perused. These shall bee therefore to aduertise you, and as many as shall happen to reade this booke, that it is nothing els but the selfe same Manuell of <hi>Epictetus</hi> owne making, which I haue taken in peeces, and transp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>sed according to that method and order which I haue thought most conuenient; hauing gathered together certaine precepts, sentences, and examples of diuers others, which haue been of the same sect; and bound them vp together in certaine small and short discourses, which I haue thought most fit and proper, to giue light vnto that which was before in their doctrine somewhat darke and obscure: in such sort, that it may serue for the present, in stead of a summarie treatise or short abridgement

of all the morall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Stoicks. Now I doe not present you their opinions, as if J could warrant them for good: and least of all, so recommending them vnto you, as if vpon the sight and view of them, you should whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betake your selfe vnto this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and puddle water, leauing the cleere and sacred fountaine of Gods word, from whence all holi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
