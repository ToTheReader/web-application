   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Onest mens Sonnes (if I giue you a wrong name, I aske your Fathers pardon) although euery one that eates Mutton, may truely bee suspected for a sheepe-biter, yet I hope my Sheepe shall finde no such dogged dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you. There are indeed three sorts of Creatures, two of which are so much repugnant to a Sheepe, that I thinke there will neuer be an vnion betwixt them, which are a Wolfe and a Dog: the third is a Goate, which although they may graze or pasture one with another, as Christians and Infidels are wouen together in the linsey woolsey web of the world, yet I did neuer know any kind of familiarity betweene them. And be thou in nature, a Wolfe, a Dog, or a Goate, that readst this, I passe not, but I rather pitty thy accursed inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then stand in any feare of thy Butting or Byting: the honest-minded Reader shall finde my Subiect or Theame both laudable and Honourable: and those who hold the name of Shepheard in contempt or derision, may heere find truely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the whole world doth not now containe, nor euer will retaine any men, who for goodnesse, honour, true worth, worthinesse and respect, that can or dare make comparison with the Shepheards of former ages. And though <hi>Virgill, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Mantuan,</hi> and many of our learned English and Scottish Poets, haue made their inuentions trauell vp the top of the
<pb facs="4"/>forked Mountaine of <hi>Parnassus;</hi> yet I would haue the Reader know, that if they, each of them had <hi>Argos</hi> eyes, to suruay and obserue, and as many hands as <hi>Briareus,</hi> to write, yet for all their paines, diligent search and collections, my weake capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie can find matter enough to make an honest Pamphlet out of what they haue ouerseene, neglected, or made slight account of. Foure things, I haue, doe, and euer will obserue in my Writings; which are, not to write prophane, obsceane, palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and odious Lyes, or scandalous Libels. In keeping which Decorum, I hope I shall keepe my selfe within the limits or bounds of good mens Respect. And this Aduertisement more I giue the Reader, that there are many things Imprinted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of two Letters, <hi>I. T.</hi> for some of which I haue beene taxed to be the Author: I assure the world that I had neuer any thing imprinted of my writing, that I was either afraid or ashamed to set my name at large to it; and therefore if you see any Authors name <hi>I. T.</hi> I vtterly disclaime it: for I am as I haue bin, both <hi>I.</hi> and <hi>T.</hi> which with addition of Letters, is yours to be commanded in any laudable endeuours,</p>
