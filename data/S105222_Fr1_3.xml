                 <title>The defence of contraries : Paradoxes against common opinion, debated in forme of declamations in place of publike censure: only to exercise yong wittes in difficult matters. Wherein is no offence to Gods honour, the estate of princes, or priuate mens honest actions: but pleasant recreation to beguile the iniquity of time. Translated out of French by A.M. one of the messengers of her Maiesties Chamber</title>

For this intent, I haue vndertaken (in this book) to debate on certaine matters, which our Elders

were wont to cal Paradoxes: that is to say, things contrary to most mens present opinions: to the end, that by such discourse as is helde in them, opposed truth might appeare more cleere and apparant. Likewise, to exercise thy witte in proofe of such occasions, as shall enforce thee to seeke diligentlie and laboriously, for sound reasons, proofes, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, histories, and very darke or hidden memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
