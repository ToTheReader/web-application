      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot gentle vngentle, nor vngentle gentle, but gentle gentle Reader, I desire no better Patron for this my rusticke Dialogue, then thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable smile. Many things pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in this conference which esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped my memorie before I could come to commit them to the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of my pen. That which I retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is here published for thy solace,
<pb facs="3"/>
and the disgrace of all pamphletting Libellers, who strut like braue Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants till their bombasted stuffings bee discouered, and then haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to shew but poore meagre carcases, which it would pitie a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eie to behold. With what fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie I haue dealt in producing the Aduersaries assertions, I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre my selfe to the indifferent sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of his booke, by which it will appeare that I haue not set him on the racke, to compell him to vtter that which was against his minde, but tooke euery clause as it did drop of it owne accord from the voluntarie euidence of his penne. The method cannot bee so exact as I could haue wished. Hee that tracts a Fugitiue, must take the

By-path as well as the Rode-way. Herein could I not be my owne Caruer, being ouer-swayed with the current of his Streame. For the conueiance of the Dialogue, some few formall passages happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are transposed, but without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration either of words or sense, If hee complaine of too much tartnesse, let him blame his owne thundring, which turned my sweet Wine into sowre Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Rather then hee shoulde bee troubled with the scratches, I haue thought good to bestow vpon him this small cast of my Office, for which if he cunne me small thankes, I shall yet comfort my selfe with the loyaltie of my seruiceable intention. And thus
<pb facs="4"/>
I referre my bold enterprise to thy best censure, and these homely lines to thy most fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble construction,</p>
