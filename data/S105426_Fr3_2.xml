Yet in so littell time, I haue obserued great arguments, of your more then most singular loue, to this neuer sufficiently beloued and admired faculty of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick: as namely, the perfit pleasure and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you seeme to take therein; Your indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable assiduitie in the priuate exercise thereof, which hath gayned you such a perfection that way, as is rare in a Gentelman of your ranck:</p>

May it please you therefore to entertaine them, comming from a good affection, with a fauourable acceptance: which I assure my selfe your gentelnesse will vouchsafe to doe; especially since they come in so seasonable a time, at the very entrance of a new yeere, when vsually all gifts are well taken, euen trifles at their hands whose abilitie will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
