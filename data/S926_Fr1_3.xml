   <p>I Cannot maruell ynough whereof it commeth
that all of vs are more mooued by iniuries then
by benefites: and that we take the one so much
too hearte imprinting them in our remembraunce,
and forget the other so suddaynely. Truely wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
denie, but that among so many other imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
wherewith wee are vnhappily defiled, wee
haue also taken this, of the greate corruption and
maymednesse of our earthly and transitorie humane
nature, wherein there cannot be imagined any thing
more vnconuenient nor more hurtefull, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochefull
vnthankfulnesse, whiche a man might
rightly terme the welspring of all Vices. For by it our
myndes are so drawne away and peruerted, that the
more wee bee besette rounde aboute, and loden with
the benefites of GOD our Soueraigne Father, so
muche the more become wee blockishe, and as it were
distraught and out of our wits, running after our own
lusts and vanities, wherthrough (as though wee had
drunke of the Riuer <hi>Lethe,</hi>) we forget our selues, and
misspende our whole time, busying our heades like li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Children that goe seeking of pinnes in the Sande,
whereaboute they are so wholly occupied, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a man call them, they heare him not, or at
leastwise make as though they hearde him not: from
<pb facs="3"/>
whence if wee did nowe and then lifte vp our eyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
Heauen, and inforce our selues too remember the
greate benefite that wee daily receiue of his right fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
goodnesse and mercy: it were not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but we shoulde be more inclined to loue him, and
too obey his holy will, than wee be: whereas (which
worse is) we be not onely carelesse to yeeld due thanks
vnto him, but also at al times cease not to offend him:
so deepely is the vice of vnthankfulnesse rooted in vs.
Rightly may he be blamed for vnthankefulnesse, which
acknowledgeth not the good that hath been doone to
him, at leastwise by saying Gramereie: Vnthankfull is
he that forgetteth it: but tootoo vnthankful is he that
rendereth euill for good. Wherefore wee can finde no
lawful excuse, because that which way soeuer we turn
our selues, the bountifulnesse of this greate God shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
throughout vppon vs. Let vs a little stirre vp ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

wittes, and let vs looke aboute vs as farre and wyde
as the huge frame of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

set together &amp; garnished with so greate diuersitie of
goodly creatures, so wel cōpassed, &amp; in such an order so
wisely cōpacted, that ther is nothing superfluous, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vnprofitable, nothing whereof there may not be
rēdred a reasō. This huge Sun the foūtain of al light &amp;
heat, &amp; the cause of al earthly generation: the Moone
which marketh vs out the yeeres, the monthes and the
seasōs: the sky so trimly azured &amp; richly set with the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>istering starres: this huge Sea which beateth vpon all
<pb facs="4"/>
sides of the earth, the weight wherof is borne vppon
his owne rounde counterpeise, the great number of
liuing creatures that are vppon it, whereof some flye
in the Ayre, euery where dispersed, and othersome
dwell in the hollow Caues of it, which nature hath fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned
of set purpose for them: what shal I say more?
So many high mountaynes, within whose veynes are
founde innumerable treasures: And others, from
whence issue many a faire spring sprouting out their
thin and cleere water: And othersome, whereout doe
gushe violent streames and pleasaunt Riuers, nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
infinite numbers and kindes of fishes: So many
trees and plantes yeelding most delicate fruites and
sweete sauours: Such store of medicinable hearbes and
rootes: So many Playnes and Valleys, moste fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
Such store of medowes beautified with their loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flowers: And to be short, the full hugenesse of the
whole, the power of the Elementes, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> naturall
beautie of the creatures: what are they else, but the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
and open shewing of Gods loue and great libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie
towardes vs: of which ech one in his kinde gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
glory to the Lord▪ yea, aske euen the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>eastes, &amp;
they will informe thee: demaund of the foules of the

spake the woorde, and wee were made: hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
and we were created. For in his hande is the
<pb facs="4"/>
life of euery liuing thing: And by him haue all of vs
our being, moouing, and continuance. Suche is the
speache of allcreatures. Onely man, who is made after
the image and likenesse of God, indued with vnderstā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
memorie, and reason, (shewing himselfe in that
behalfe more vnhappy then the brute beastes) pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
ouer the aboundance of so greate benefites with
his eyes shut, betrampling and beraying them with
his feete, as a swine doth precious stones: Insomuch
that after he hath once wholly buried remembrance,
there insueth ignoraunce and vtter blindnesse. O la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
state of reasonable man! who can hope for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
change in thee, except it be from euil to woorse, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
thou hast no knowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> at all of God, and that all
his benefites are despised through thine extreeme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefulnesse
in this behalfe? if so many creatures
wherewith this whole huge world is garnished to thy
vse, and (to touche thee yet more neerely) if the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
compacting together of thine owne body, which
may well bee called a little worlde, as wherein a man
may beholde the soueraigne wisedome of the woorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister:
if thy soule wherein shineth the inuisible
image of the euerlasting God: if thine owne life: if
the consideratiō of so great abundance of good things,
wherof he geueth thee the vse euery day, are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ynough to moue the affections of thy heart: at
leastwise yet oughtest thou of reason too bee inflamed
and prouoked by the benefite of all benefites, and by
<pb facs="5"/>
that moste precious gifte which he hath made vntoo
thee of his owne proper and onely Sonne, who is
the very image of his substance, and in whom dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the whole fulnesse of the Godheade, together
with al the treasures of Wisedome, and al knowledge:
Yea and so muche ought it too mooue thee the more
because that without hauing regarde that thou werte
his great enimie, hee hath layde all thine infirmities
pon his backe, and made him to die vppon the crosse
for thy sake, punishing thy sinnes in him, for the
which thou thy selfe haddest deserued eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Goe nowe thou vnthankefull person, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uize
all the excuses that thou wilte: and they shall
serue to no purpose, but too accuse thee and too geue
sentence against thy selfe. The woonderfull creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
order, and gouernment of this huge worlde,
can giue thee knowledge of his fatherly loue, wisdom,
and infinite power, although not in al pointes to the
ful. But in Iesus Christ crucified, all the bowelles of
Gods mercy are opened vntoo thee at large and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.
Ther is no more any veyle that can hinder thee
from the knowing of so great loue. Seest thou not how
that at his death the veyle was rente asunder in the
middes? And when he cryed that all was finished,
and bowed downe his holy head, he gaue a token that
peace was made between God &amp; man? Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
henceforth learne (O my brethrē) to acknowledge
the soueraine benefite which we haue receiued by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb facs="5"/>
Christe crucified. Let vs beholde the perfectnesse
of his life, and his most holy doctrine. Let vs open
our eyes at the vnmeasurable brightnesse of his euen
lasting trueth, and let vs with all our force, followe
the way wherein hee hath gone afore vs. Let vs
with a cheerefull and glad hearte imbrace the Crosse
which hee hath set afore vs: and discharging our
shoulders from all burdens, and all sinne wherein wee
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> wrapped, let vs runne with pacience too the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
that is appointed for vs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> hauing an eye to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner
and accomplisher of faith, Iesus Christe, who
in steede of worldly glory susteyned the Crosse, and
despised all the shame thereof. Let vs put of the old
man with all his wretched and combersome doinges
and greeuous burdens, and clothe our selues with the
new man, whose yooke is sweete, and burden light.
Let vs by true faith runne betweene the armes of his
mercy, and pray him to vouchsafe to lighten vs▪ and to
make vs capable of all his graces, and specially of the
great benefite that wee haue receiued of him by his
crosse. Concerning the which, forasmuche as there is
lighted into my hands a little treatise compiled in the
Italian tongue, where in he is merueilously wel &amp; liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawne with another maner of pensil than painters
vse: I thought it good to put it into Frenche, too the
end that my Countreymen also might take profite by
it, and receiue like comforte as I haue receiued by it
<pb facs="6"/>
and specially the simple people, and suche as haue no
great depth of knowledge. For it semeth, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
(whosoeuer he was) was wholly mynded to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
all thinges vnto them, without seeking or affecting
any finenesse of speech, or great darknesse of sentences.
But euen as in Sommer time we see the Riuer Saon
goe gently to ioyne himself with the Riuer of Rhone,
without doing any domage to any body: euen so go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this man, slyding so smoothely into the bosome
of his deare spouse Iesus Christ, without staying at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other thing, that ouermalicious shoulde hee bee,
which woulde looke awry on him, or by any meanes
let him of his course.</p>
   <p>And thus my brethren, fare yee well in God, who
enrich you with his gracious gifts, from
day to day.</p>
   <closer>Amen.</closer>
