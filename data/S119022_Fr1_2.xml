   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of some kinde of men, that they profite, but still to the worse, 2. <hi>Tim. 3.</hi> It is not long since that there was a Booke set forth, admonishing the Friars to be sober, but they have burnt so many of those Bookes, and read so few of them, as from folly they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited to extreame madnesse. It was little sobriety to excommunicate one man, for the fault, or no fault of another. But howsoever <hi>clave errante, vel non errante,</hi> the <hi>Censures</hi> are Episcopall. But for a Prelat to throw away his Keyes, &amp; to take the Sword, &amp; to hang it at a Friars belt, &amp; with it to play the Fencer, yea the Offender.</p>
   <p>Spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici?</p>
   <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> sayes, That before a man falls into any great calamity, God first gives him a rappe upon the pate, that is, hee deprives him of his judgment, well expressed by the Poet, <hi>De Ponto lib.</hi> 4.</p>
   <lg>
      <l>Crede mihi, miseros prudentia prima relinquit,</l>
      <l>Et sensus cunre, consiliumque fugit</l>
   </lg>
   <p>A wretched man, right, reason first forsakes,</p>
   <p>He reckes not of advice, nor counsell takes.</p>
   <p>The Friars began with <hi>Excom.</hi> they arrived at <hi>Exile.</hi> What's the next? <hi>Assises and Quarter-Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>The Prophet sayth, <hi>De radice colubri egredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etur Regulus, Esay</hi> 14. from the root of an Adder shall issue out a Cockatrice. By which is signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as <hi>Lyra</hi> expounds it) That from a small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, &amp; contemptible, great and intollerable mischiefes doe arise. But the Adder of <hi>Exile</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prudently oppressed, the hatch of the <hi>Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrice</hi> was prevented.</p>
   <p>Is it not to be lamented, that the Ecclesiasticall &amp; Politique estate cannot consist together, but that the advancement of the one, must bee the abatement of the other? In so much that some doubt not to say, that a Catholi{que} can be no good Subject: <hi>Vtinam abscindantur qui conturbant nos:</hi> I would to God they were cut off who were the occasions of that scandall. For my part, I professe my name in the number of those who are both good Catholiques &amp; good Subjects: And I trust in the mercies of God, so to be found living and dying. And whosoever reades this little Worke, I wish him of the same mind, and to be as I am, excepting those afflictions, persecutions, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall vexations, which I endure <hi>à falsis fratri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> and their abused followers, whom God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, as also thy friend (good Reader)</p>
   <p>PAVL HARRIS <hi>Priest.</hi>
