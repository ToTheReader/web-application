   <head>The Prologue to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Udicious Lector:</hi> If good Bookes may
be termed wise guides, then certainely
true <hi>Histories</hi> may be termed perfit <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;</hi>
Secret <hi>Counsellours,</hi> private
<hi>Schoole-masters:</hi> Familiar friends
to cherish Knowledge, and the best
<hi>Intelligencers</hi> for all <hi>intendments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
duely pondred, and rightly used.
This labourious Worke then of mine,</hi> depending on this
<hi>Preamble, is only composed of mine owne Eie-sight,
and occular experience;</hi> (pluris est occulatos test is unus,
quam auriti decem) <hi>being the perfit mirrour, and lively
Portraicture of true understanding, excelling farre all
inventions whatsoever, either Poeticke, or Theorick,</hi>
And now to shunne <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> which I disdain as Hell,
I thought it best to exhibit the profit of my painfull <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes</hi>
to the desirous <hi>World,</hi> for two respects; for as my
dangerous adventures have beene wrought out from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
variety of <hi>variable Sights, innumerable toyles,
pleasures, and inevitable sorrowes;</hi> so doth it also best
simpathize with reason, and most fitting that I should ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
dispose of the same, to the temperate <hi>iudgements</hi>
of the better <hi>sort,</hi> the <hi>sound</hi> and absolute opinions of the
<hi>Judicious,</hi> and to the variable <hi>censures</hi> of calumni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>us
<hi>Criticks,</hi> who run at randon in the fields of other mens
Labour, but can not find the home-bred way in their owne
<pb facs="5"/>
close grounds; and therefore the different disposition of the
<hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> doe best concurre with the interchangeable
occurrences of the matter.</p>
   <p>Neverthelesse, for thy more easier understanding, I have
divided this <hi>History into ten Parts, and they also into
three Bookes;</hi> which being seriously perused, doubtlesse
thy Labour shall receive both profit and pleasure. <hi>Accept
them therefore with the same love, that I offer them to
thee, since they cost thee nothing but the Reading, how
deare soever they are to me.</hi> But understand me better,
<hi>I scorne to draw my</hi> Pen <hi>to the ignorant</hi> Foole, <hi>for I
contemne both. To the</hi> Wise <hi>I know it will be welcome,
to the profound</hi> Historian <hi>yeeld</hi> Knowledge, Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and direction: and to the understanding Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
insight, instruction, and recreation: and to the
true bred <hi>Poet</hi> fraternall love, both in meane and manner.
Now as touching the hissing of snakish Papists, a tush for
that snarling Crew; for as this <hi>Worke,</hi> being fensed with
experience and garnished with trueth, is more then able
to batter downe the stinging venome of their despightfull
Waspishnes: so also they may clearely see therein, as in a Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
their owne blindnes, and the damnable errours of their
blind Guiders, Deceiuers and Idolaters: And aboue all the
cruell infliction imposed vpon me, by the mercilesse Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their profession in <hi>Malaga;</hi> which for Christs
sake I constantly suffered, in Tortures, Torments, and
Hunger.</p>
   <p>And lastly, they may perceive Gods miraculous Mercy,
in discovering and delivering me from such a concealed
and inhumane murther.</p>
   <p>And now referring the well set <hi>Reader</hi> to the <hi>History</hi>
it selfe, where satisfaction lyeth ready to receive him, and
expectation desirous of deserved thankes. I come to talke
<pb facs="5"/>
talke with the scelerate Companion: If thou beest a <hi>Villain,</hi>
a <hi>Ruffian,</hi> a <hi>Momus,</hi> a <hi>Knave,</hi> a <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

a <hi>Bubo,</hi> a <hi>Buffon,</hi> a stupid <hi>Asse,</hi> and a gnawing
<hi>Worme</hi> with envious Lips, I bequeath thee to a Carnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
reward, where a hempen Rope will soone dispatch
thy snarling slander, and free my toylesome Travailes and
now painefull Labours, from the deadly poyson of thy
sharpe edged calumnies, and so goe hang thy selfe;
for I neither will respect thy Love, nor
regard thy Malice: and shall
ever and alwayes
remaine,</p>
