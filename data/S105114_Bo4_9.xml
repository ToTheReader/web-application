   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ee, Christian brother, how in the worst times they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to die, &amp; commended to God: if the Ancient Books did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime this truth, some would not beleeue but that they had beene made in this latter time. But seeing the truth cannot be denyed. I desire thee with me to obserue these few col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, arising out of due consideration of the premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
   <p n="1">
      <pb n="83" facs="82"/> 1 Here is answer to that great question, how our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were saued, euen by the same faith as we are at this day.</p>
   <p n="2">2 How truly Christ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his promise: namely, that the gates of hell should not preuaile against the true faith, for so we see that in the vilest times this faith hath beene preserued.</p>
   <p n="3">3 Obserue how here is no touch, nor once mention of Purgatory, nor of any thing to be done for their good after this life.</p>
   <p n="4">4 Here is no relation to any pardons or indulgences from the Pope.</p>
   <p n="5">5 Here is no necessity laid downe of sending for a Priest to bring his hoste, and his Pix, and his Holy-Water, and
<pb n="84" facs="82"/> his Taper: These matters, it seemes, are rather comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; pressed vpon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by the Romish Cleargy, then much regarded by the wiser and god her sort of our forefathers: neyther are they commanded to stay till the Priest come, but (saith the booke) let these prayers bee said, and the commendation of his soule, by one of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers.</p>
   <p>Lastly, let it bee obserued, that in all these prayers, and commendations, and questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (and these saith the booke are all that be of necessity to be said) here is not one smack of Popish Idolatry or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</p>
   <p>In these respects I haue thought it no needlesse la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to communicate these
<pb n="86" facs="83"/> to thee (deare brother,) I know there be store of godly Prayers and meditations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready extant. But these are of a speciall vse more then others, and are venerable for their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and are to be the more welcome, because God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued them in the hands of our very enemies. And though they were mingled with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things not so good; yet let vs know as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> tels <hi>vs,</hi> that it is no small point of wisedome, to seeke out gold out of mire and clay. Make vse of these, and helpe mee with thy prayers, and thou shalt shortly, if God permit, be partaker of more.</p>
   <trailer>Hereafter followeth an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of some new and late formes, and models of Prayer for sundry occasions, and purposes.</trailer>
