      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the greater part both of authors and translators of bookes may be taxed of officious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and not a few of vngodlines: yet are there some whose merits in this kinde doe out-way the demerits of the other. These are either those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie lightes themselues, or else those second can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestickes to translate the light into, which God specially in these latter yeares hath bestowed as gifts (to vse Saint <hi>Paules</hi> word) vpon his Church to the edification of it. It is true indeede in one sense, that both the one and the other are but candlestickes, for the light is Gods: but otherwise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiuely the author is the light, and the translator is as it were an other candlesticke, to translate the light into, and that for those which thorough ignorance of the tongue, could not attaine to the light when it shone out of the authors owne lampe. Now although there seeme no great gifts to be required in a translator; yet the truth is, that if he be not of good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, to choose the fittest workes, of good speech to expresse the authors sentence with fittest wordes, and of so great apprehension, and former store, that by that which he seeth in the author, he hath attained to more, then paraduenture the author himselfe saw or minded: his defectiuenes will bring him in daunger of shewing what gifts are required in a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator: for a good translator is neither a paraphrast, nor a periphrast, which is committed by needeles chaunging or adding words. He so behaueth himselfe that the comparing of the originall, will commend his fidelitie, and that they which know of no originall would take the translator for the author himselfe. He must naturalize his translation for the reader, without miuring the gift of the author in the natiue worke. But these seeme criticke rules to the irregular, which offend against their authors, to please themselues: for as there are many translations of vnworthie workes; so are there many transportations of worthie workes, which like plantes ill taken vp, reioyce not to growe in the soyle into which they are translated. And yet neuerthelesse it cannot without iniurie be denied, that this age hath afforded many excellent translations of excellent and learned au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to the benefit of our people: amongst whom Maister <hi>Rollocke</hi> the reuerend Author of this worke deserueth an eminent place, as also this worke it selfe is very acceptable together with the translators godly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

in this, and other things commodious to the Church of Christ. This inclined me the rather to commend it to thee, in these few lines, not as taking vpon me any thing, but as a poore man where he is better knowne, is sometimes engaged for a rich. This labour is become ours not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is thus well englished, but also because the Author is a Scottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which is now to the wise hearted a synonymie of an Englishman. And it shall be to the praise of both the Nations to receiue both mutuall and common benefits, without that emulation which was betwixt <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iuda. It is a comely thing,</hi> (to speake in the words of that King that was so miraculously restored) <hi>to declare the signes and wonders of the high God,</hi> which we see this day, euen this vnanimitie in receiuing the King wrought (no doubt) by diuine instinct, rather then grace in some, which otherwise, <hi>mendaciter deduntie,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith. Let vs on the otherside goe out in our sinceritie and meete the King of Kings with <hi>Hosanna.</hi> And I beseech you by the wonder of our neighbours, which is our innocent aggregation to this scepter: let the solution of an obiection by King <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth of noble memorie, and of so renowned wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, be our satisfaction, that the soueraigntie is deuolued where it is, (not onely by the prouidence, but also by the ordinance of God) to the comfortable vniting of that Nation, rather then Nations which at the first vpon the matter was indeede but one, though for some yeares past it were diuided by conceit. Let vs take vp the argument of <hi>Abraham: We are brethren, &amp;c.</hi> And as this is a worke of vocation, so let vs hold the comming of our King to bee the worke of reuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to call vs backe to vnitie. And so gentle reader I commit thee to the God of peace and vnitie.</p>
