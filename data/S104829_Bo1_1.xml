   <head>The Proeme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the profite and easinesse of the Art of <hi>Stenographie.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore the preceptes of this Art be deliuered, it shall not be amisse for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter encouragement of the Reader thervnto, to note briefly, how profitable it is for vse, and how easie to be atteyned.</p>
   <p>Concerning the profit, there are fiue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall respectes wherein it ministreth espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall helpe and furtherance.</p>
   <p>First, in short or compendious writing: by conteyning that in one line, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing written with letters at large, would take vp foure lines or more: in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it hath a profitable vse, for the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of briefe Notes of remembrance, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlineations,
<pb facs="3"/> marginall Notes, and such like.</p>
   <p>Secondly, in speedie writing: For he that is well practized in this Art, may write <hi>Verbatim,</hi> as fast as a man can treateably speake: In regard whereof, it is very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, for the noting of Sermons, Orations, Mootes, Reportes, Disputations, and the like.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, in secret writing: For euen the very Characters and order, of their places taught by this Booke, doe deliuer such a forme of writing, as is secret enough to all that are not acquainted with this Art: But if any be desirous to set a further locke on his Notes and Writinges, he may out of those few and easie directions taught in the ende of this Booke for that purpose, be fully satisfied in the same.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, this Booke discouereth a true and constant forme of Art, applyable not to one Language alone, but generally to all; in so much that he which hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it throughly, as it concernerh the English onely, may by the same skill, write also in Latine, French, Italian, or any other Tongue that he hath knowledge of: And
<pb facs="3"/> therefore this Booke may serue for a good ground and president to him that shall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to set foorth the <hi>Stenographie</hi> of any other Language.</p>
   <p>Fifthly, the ingenious Reader may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by strengthen his memorie in the sure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of any speech or sentence, which he would lay vp in that Treasurie.</p>
   <p>And touching the easinesse of this Art, as the preceptes are all apparantly short; so the Characters deuised for the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of all wordes, are few in number: to wit, but 28. in all.</p>
   <p>The Rules also are certaine, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in consequence of reason the one vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the other: squared and fitted to the three lawes of Art, each principle being deliuered but once generally, and in his proper place.</p>
   <p>Also, by Notes vpon euery Chapter are explaned such wordes and Characters vsed in the Rules or Examples, as might seeme to meaner capacities hard or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
   <p>And the whole frame of this worke is so contriued, that the memorie shall not neede to be charged with a tedious labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="4"/> of a multitude of Wordes and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters by hart; but enured onely to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise order.</p>
   <p>Lastly, these thinges are herein perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in so plaine and direct a manner, as will enable any of indifferent iudgement, vpon once reading ouer these few Rules with good aduise, to vndertake foorthwith the forme of Writing by them prescribed, wherein he shall quickly attaine great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, if he but practise it in his ordinarie businesse, as occasion serueth, and thereby keepe it without all danger of loosing it: But if through many yeeres discontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the methode hereof should be cleane forgotten, yet two or three howers labour bestowed in perusing once more this short Booke, will sufficiently awaken his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and put his hand againe in true motion to write according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes of this Art.</p>
