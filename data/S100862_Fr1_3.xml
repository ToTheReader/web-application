   <head>THE PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat wonderfull propertie of the body of the whole earth, called the <hi>Magneticall</hi> vertue (most admirably found out, &amp; as learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrated by <hi>Doctor Gilbert</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian vnto our late renowned Soueraigne <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> of happy memory) is the very true fountaine of all <hi>Magneticall</hi> knowledge. So that although certaine properties of the Loadstone were knowne before, yet all the reasons of those properties were vtterly vnknowne, and neuer before reuealed (as I take it) vnto the sonnes of men. And although as yet many doe doubt and mistrust that the earth it selfe hath no such ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, I doe nothing wonder at it, because before I read his learned workes, and had tried many of his experiments with mine owne hands, and had conferred with great Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers, and pervsed the obseruations of our chiefest <hi>Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators</hi> both for their variations, and declinations, I neuer beleeued it my selfe. But this I may truely affirme that searching with diligence his first fiue bookes, and making triall of all those propositions which I iudged to be of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, I alwaies found the maine drift, touching this point, certaine, constant, and agreeable to the diligent obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of diuers men of experience; although in some other
<pb facs="6"/>
matters of the <hi>Loadstone</hi> his experiments and mine did sometimes disagree, as I signified to himselfe in his life time, which he did take in very good part, as I haue yet his owne letters to shew. But concerning his sixth Booke entreating of the motion of the earth, I thinke there is no man liuing farther from beleeuing it, than my selfe, being nothing at all perswaded there vnto, by the reasons of other men, which he alledgeth, and as little or lesse (if it were possible) by those his inventions, endeuouring to proue the motion of the earth by the earthes <hi>Magneticall</hi> force and vertue.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Amicus Socrates, Amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas</hi> is the onely cause why I doe embrace his iudgment, in the one, and refuse it in the other, in matters of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture following this Rule:</p>
   <q>Nullius addictus iurare in verba Magistri.</q>
   <p>But to returne to the <hi>Magnetisme</hi> of the whole earth, I doe hold it to be one of the rarest, and excellent est inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the best followed by him, with euident proofes and of the greatest consequence for the admirable art of Nauigation that euer was found out since the Creation of the world, so that it may well be said of him touching that point.</p>
   <lg>
      <l>Exegit monumentum aere perennius</l>
      <l>Regali{que} situ pyramidū altius,</l>
   </lg>
   <p>in respect of the manifold vse and commoditie thereof in the doings of this life. The properties of the <hi>Magnet</hi> seruing not onely for Sea-affaires, but also for trauelling by Land in vaste and solitarie deserts, for moueable Sun-dyalls in all places of the world, for the more ready and exact Choro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphie of any Countrey, or the true plotting of any ground, and for the following of any Minerall veyne that is voide of Iron vnder the earth, for Pioners and diggers in Mines.
<pb facs="6"/>
And in all this appeareth the wonderfull power and goodnes of God who hath vouchsafed to reueale vnto the weake knowledge of man now towards the end of the world, his admirable treasure, before vnknowne, of his powerfull Creation, by effect so plaine vnto the mean est capacitie: And that out of a base, contemptible and dead creature, as it seemeth to be, and yet filled with such excellent and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull vertue, that all the Gemms of the world, haue not the like; neither if it were wanting could supply the want thereof, or counter vaile the benefit that it bringeth to the life of man.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Claudianus</hi> (a famous Poet) well nere twelue hundred yeares since, saith as much in commendation of the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nete,</hi> when as yet the Serediticall or Iron-drawing property thereof was onely knowne.</p>
   <lg>
      <l>—Lapis est cognomine Magnes</l>
      <l>Decolor, obscurus, vilis &amp;c.</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And againe,</p>
   <lg>
      <l>Sed noua si nigri videas miracula saxi,</l>
      <l>Tunc superat pulchros cultus, &amp; quicquid Eoïs</l>
      <l>Indus littoribus rubra scrutatur in algâ.</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But what would he not haue said, had hee seene the true closset indeed of all <hi>Magneticall</hi> miracles vnlocked, and in glorious manner set wide open as now it is at this day.</p>
   <p>Many of our Nation both Gentlemen and others of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent witts and louers of these knowledges, not able to read <hi>Doctor Gilberts</hi> Booke in Latin, haue bin (euer since the first publishing thereof) exceeding desirous to haue it translated into English, but hitherto no man hath done it, neither (to my knowledge) as yet goeth about any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereof one principall cause is that there are very few
<pb facs="7"/>
that vnderstand his Booke, because they haue not <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones</hi> of diuers formes, but especially round ones: Also such versory needles fitly framed, and artificially placed vpon their pins, and other such implements, as he doth there prescribe, wherewith being furnished, as they read his propositions in words, they might still see the truth of them in the things themselues, according as himselfe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warneth that these skills must be learned <hi>Ex rebus ipsis non solum ex libris,</hi> out of the things themselues and not onely out of Bookes. A second cause may be for that there are diuers words of Art in the whole course of this booke proper to this subiect, and fit to the explanation of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and diagrammes which cannot be vnderstood but by the helpe of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and good trauelling in the <hi>Magneticall</hi> practise.</p>
   <p>Moreouer his alleadging of other mens erroneous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning this Argument, and his confutations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, may seeme at the first to a yong beginner somewhat harsh and tedious. Both which I suppose in the English translation (if any were) might well be omitted: like as in this my Treatise I thinke it not altogether so pertinent to handle them all.</p>
   <p>And a sport it is to behold diuers of smart witts, and such as weene themselues to be so great Clerkes, that they will aduenture boldly to dispute <hi>de omni scibili,</hi> how mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably they runne their witts on ground, when onely by a slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reading ouer of his booke, or most commonly some part thereof, they will take vpon them to define, controule, and discourse of those matters fearing nothing more than that of the Poet,</p>
   <lg>
      <l>—mihi turpe relinqui est</l>
      <l>Et quod non didici sane nescire fateri.</l>
   </lg>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>For being vrged by diuers of our Gentlemen (among whom these knowledges are had now a daies in some request) somewhat they must speake, which must be either supercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to scorne such things, as vanities, because themselues vnderstand them not, or else with slender ostentation to blunder out their masked ignorance, supposing it to be inough for them to say that they haue read <hi>D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Gilberts</hi> Booke, and so to vse that for a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to acquite them of any farther inquirie. But many, being now at length weary to take such counterfeit shewes for good payment, doe seriously seeke to haue some sound knowledge of the things themselues, and not to depend vpon other mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant disputes, but to be their owne iudges in matters that concerne themselues, and are subiect to their owne senses and reasons, and especially because some of them must aduenture their whole estates, yea and also their liues vpon the right vnderstanding of some <hi>Magneticall</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions.</p>
   <p>Wherefore vpon the earnest longing of certaine mine Honorable and Worshipfull freinds, and for the singular loue that I beare to the louers and practizers of the worthy Art of Nauigation, and to satisfie the commendable desires of such as like to haue some insight (though themselues be not praectizers in these matters of admirable knowledge, and great vtilitie) I haue vndertaken to contriue all the cheifest points of this most necessary skill, and the vse of them in this short Treatise.</p>
   <p>Not meaning to translate <hi>Doctor Gilberts</hi> booke, but to take those thing out of it which I shall thinke fit for this purpose, which are onely the <hi>Magnetisme</hi> of the whole earth, and some of the consequents thereof, and to adde the rest of mine own industry: Wherin I may be bold after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
<pb facs="8"/>
to challenge a right, as hauing endeuoured to get some insight in this argument (a matter well knowne to diuers) aboue the space of twenty yeares ere <hi>Doctor Gilberts</hi> book saw light. And in very deed I communicated many of my obseruations with him, aboue one whole yeare before he put it out in print. To be short, of all that I shall set downe in this Treatise my request is, that the Reader will admit nothing but that which shall be confirmed by good reason, or vndoubted experiments. And I purpose (God willing) to tye my selfe, as strictly vnto this rule as euer any man did that hath written of the like argument, making it euen a matter of conscienae to deliuer any thing herein for certaintie, that my selfe shall not know to be sound. And so by this meanes shall I neither abuse the Reader with any vntrue assertion, nor iniurie so certaine and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a knowledge with any doubtfull or vnapproueable conclusions.</p>
