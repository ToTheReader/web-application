   <head>TO THE SACRED AND MOST MIGHTIE EMPEROVR: AND TO THE MOST HIGH AND PVISSANT kynges and Soueraigne Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, Iohn Lesley, Byshop of Rosse wysheth peace and perpetuall felicitie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ACRED AND MOST MIGHTIE Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and ye most puyssant kynges and Princes Christian, yf you call to mynde and memorye all formes of common wealthes, wherein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse people in tymes past (aswell heathen as Christians) haue bene preserued: you shall finde none, eyther for peace and tranquyllitie more esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, or for Maiestie more gloriouse, than that, where one hathe gouerned, whiche laufullie entred, as right heyr in succession: and moderated all thinges with sincere indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencio, as a Iust and vpright Iudge. And, to omitt, that this forme of Gouernemēt resembleth that regimēt, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God ruleth the whole world, and how therfore it is the best: to omitt also that the leagues of forrain Princes, with their mariages, and mutuall agreementes in loue and amitie are herein also included, and how therfore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: Likewyse to lett passe the generall peace, quiett, and tranquillitie whiche this assureth to all men, and how ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is amiable, the trueth of this matter will more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlye appear, if you deeply consider what iniuries and calamities the people of that country is forced to endure, where an vsurping Tyrāne, not by right of successiō, as lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heir vnto his auncestor, but by ambition &amp; stronghand violently intrudeth hym selfe vpon an other mans right &amp; possession. For suche a one, (by vexing his subiectes with continuall fear, &amp; oppressing them with wicked exactions, and more wicked morders) sticketh not to subuert all lawes of God &amp; man, to the ende that he may rule all alone. Thus whiles he most cruelly tirannizeth ouer his subiects, and they most mortally doe hate hym: what mischiefes and
<pb facs="3"/>
miseries do not burst in vpon any nation by suche a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate head and suche discorde of membres? Vherupon it foloweth well in my Iudgement, that the good will of Princes toward their subiectes, and the loue of Subiectes toward their Princes is the surest meanes to keepe and preserue the publick weal of any Countrie: In somuche as, what Region so euer wanteth this, must eyther be deuided in it selfe, and torne in peces with domesticall troubles: or fall in to the handes of straungers. Therfore of all nations that haue bene in any age, I finde none, that by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of mutuall amitie hathe not bene aduaunced with great felicitye: and none on the other syde, that by want therof hathe not, eyther lyke a sore diseased or wounded bodye languished miserablye: or vtterly deuolued in to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ruyne and destruction. Yea, suche misruled nations haue not alone tasted the calamities of their enormityes: but haue wickedlye also casten out their vonim vpon others: and with suche contagious poyson, haue infected their neighboures rownd about them. So as all Princes Christian, that desire long to Raigne, haue hereby to note and learne, how it behoueth them, not onlie to rule their own Countries without all manner of Tirannie: but allso to prouyde (so muche as in them lyeth) that their neighbours be not oppressed by Tyrannes. For suche neyghborhoode can not be but contagiouse: because it is the nature of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannes, first to ransake and spoyle their own people, and afterward to breake owt vpon others, and to ruyne them, all manner of wayes. And this I wryte, to the ende, that all Christian Princes, aswell for their own sake, as for Charitie also toward their Christian neighbours, should haue some speciall care to helpe, that my Soueraigne Ladye Marye, Queene of Scotland, and the most noble King her sonne be not excluded, and barred frome their right of inheritance and succession to the Croune of England, after the laufull yssues of King Henrye the eyght be all deceassed: Least that, by vniust intrusion and inuasion of vnlaufull vsurpers, the true heyr be defeated, that florishing Kyngedome by tyrannie ruyned, and the neighbours adioyning conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouslye annoyed. Fort sithe it is euidently knowen, that all those commodities and riches wherwith England hathe plentifully furnished, not onlye it selfe, but other countries also, haue growen specially by this occasion, that it hathe
<pb n="3" facs="3"/>
bene hitherto sweetlye and peaceablye gouerned by the true and laufull heyrs, to the great honour of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and commoditie of the Subiectes: and seing it is also manifest, that after the deceases of all the yssues laufullie descended from Kyng Henrie the eight (as I sayd before) the Kyngdome of England by right euery waye belongeth vnto Marye the Queene of Scotland: who seeth not, that if the same Ladye be excluded from her right: then not only that Realm shall be spoyled of their own commodities, and their neighboures want those helpes which they haue long enioyed: but also, that Region wilbe a neast of Tyrannes, where euery familie shall robbe it selfe, and as mere straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers spoile and morder one an other?</p>
   <p>Now then, because some vniust Competitors incensed with desire of rule, doe couer their ambition by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a title to the Croune of England: I thought it to be a part of my duetie, to infringe their vntrue surmises: and by strong and weightie argumentes to proue, and ratifie the laufull title and right of the Queene and Kynge my Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes. For so, I hope it will fall owt, that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kinges and Potentates will more reddelye performe suche honorable offices of Courtesie and Charitie, as all Princes owe one to an other: and that speciallie, when they shall see the veritie, integritie, and iustice of this cause so expresselie declared, as no scruple therof can stick in the hart of any indifferent persone. For thoughe generallie all Christian Kynges are (as it wer) so lynked to gether, as they should aide and defende eache others honour and dignitie in respect that they are Kynges: Yet euery one of them in some one or other particulrr respecte is so allied vnto the Queene and Kyng of Scotland, as they owght to take her part, and to ioyne with her against her enemies. And (to surcease from speaking any more of the common bond of loue among all Princes generallye) I may not herein ouer passe that godlye father which sittethe in the holy Seat, and (as it is well knowen) like a second Samuel will not anoint with holye oyle, (that is to say, confirme by his authoritie) any other to be rulers ouer Christians, than suche Princes as might well seme to be Sauls and Dauids, whiche repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the persones of all laufull Kynges. For beside her vndoubted right of Succession (which is accounted a kynd of diuine callyng and choyse to a Kyngdome) this may spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie
<pb facs="4"/>
persuade hym to defend her as his daughter, whiche neyther by straitnesse of prison, nor by any kinde of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction could be hitherto seduced from honoring him as her father. VVhat nede is there to call vpon the most sacred Emperour, and other Kynges and Princes in particular, sith they are all allied vnto the sayd noble Queene, eyther by a sure knot of amitie, and frendship, or by a most fast bond of consanguinitie and kynred? Neyther is it necessarie to proue this by genealogies and pedegrues, seing the world allredye knoweth that she is descended, both by father and mother, from the most noble Princes, Kynges, and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the whole Christian worlde.</p>
   <p>As for the nobilitie and Commons of England, this should moue them to loue her, that she is come so many wayes of English blood, and had her great Grandmother out of the Princelie house of Somerset, and had for her Grandmother the Lady Margaret, eldest daughter to King Henrye the seuenth. And is not this muche to moue them further, that she was by this meanes so muche affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Englishe Nation, as in her troubles &amp; afflictions at home, she rather hoped for relefe at their handes, and therfore trusted the now Queene of England, vpon her, promises, so farre, as she made her choyse, rather to come for succoure to the Englishe (where now she liueth in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) than to other Princes her speciall freends: of whome she was assured to haue found relefe and succour? Adde this withall, that before all other Christian Princes, she choase an Englishe man to be her husband, and by hym brought foorthe a sonne, heyr to the same Kyngdome. VVhat should I report of the signes and tokens of her pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wiche now she showeth in England, or of her Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, good will and loue towarde the English Nation: how freendlye she thinketh of them, how honorably she spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of them, and how nobly she writeth of them, yea how that by long conuersing with them, she hath now so perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctlie lerned their manners, their language, and their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, as hauing almost forgot all other fashions, she see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be brought in to this world, by the prouidence of God, iustlie to gouerne the people of England? VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, sithe this our Queene is the woorthie heir, and the righteous heir of the English Croune: it standeth agreablie with your charitie, whiche you, as Kinges, are wont to vse
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
toward Queenes, and vith those offices of courtesie and kyndenesse whiche you owe, as Allies, to your freendes, or as Cosaines to your kynsewomen, to prouide (by all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes) that she be not defeated of her right: nor bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from that dignitie, whiche by many titles is due vnto her: lest that the harmes whiche fall vpon her by suche losses, doe procure great perilles to you and youre poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And the better to auoyde all stoppes whiche might brede in you by any obscure or breefe relation, I here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto your Maiesties with all humilitie this booke, conteyning a full discourse of the whole cause, whiche during my abode in England, about the affaires of my sayd Soueraigne, I caused to be published in Englishe, to the vse of Englishe menne: and haue now augmented it, with a Genealogie of the Competitors, whiche by discent from two Princelie families in that Realme, to wit, Yorke and Lancastre, pretend title to the Croune. And herein the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles and surmises of the aduersaries are so refuted, their sleightes so discouered and auoided, and their argumentes whiche they leane vpon so ouerthrowen, as the scruples and dowbtes (whiche before neuerthelesse to menne of equall and indifferent iudgementes were playne enoughe) may well seme to be remoued and pulled out of the hartes and myndes of the aduersaries. I humblie therfore beseche your Maiesties, to accept that freendly whiche I present vnto you: to mark that attentiuelie whiche in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting I sett downe before you: and to performe that Iustlie whiche best beseemeth you. So fare ye well: and fauour the cause of a most laufull Queene.</p>
