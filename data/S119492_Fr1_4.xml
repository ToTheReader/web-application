                 <title>An anker of Christian doctrine : VVherein, the most principal pointes of Catholique religion, are proued: by the onlie vvritten vvord of God. Not reiecting diuine, nor apostical traditions; authentical councels; Popes decrees; ancient fathers; nor other ordinarie proofes: but abstracting from them in this encounter: for better satisfaction of those, who wil admitte no other trial of true religion, but Scriptures only.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>ECAVSE the former parts of this worke, and these latter, being printed at diuers times, wil hardly perhaps come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the same persons handes; I haue thought it mete (Welbeloued Reader) here to repete the summarie contents of the former Preface. Wherby you may see the causes, why after<note place="margin">VVhy this Treatise is written.</note> so manie excellent Bookes, written in our language, for clearing al pointes of Christian Doctrine, this also is written in an other forme; prouing the same by holie Scriptures only. Which thing is vndertaken (as also the Holie Bible is for the same reasons, set forth in vulgar tongues) first to satisfie al such, as vntruly<note place="margin">The first cause.</note> suppose that we preferre anie other auctoritie aboue the holie Scriptures. Secondly to ioyne issue of trial <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with our Aduersaries, who imagine that herein they haue some aduantage against vs. And withal to geue contentment, if it be possible, to al those, which at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> this time, wil admitte no other proofes in matter of Faith, and Religion, but the onlie Scriptures: that so it may appeare, who are best grounded therein.</p>
   <p>For although our English Protestants in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning<note place="margin">Protestants sometime pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to stand to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers.</note> of Quene Elisabeths reigne, very boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked al Roman Catholiques to trie the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not only by the holie Scriptures; but also by the Ancient Councels, and Fathers of the first six hūdred yeares after Christ: as M. Iohn Iuel publikely<note place="margin">Anno 1559.</note> proclamed at S. Pauls Crosse in London; yet shortly after, finding by experience, that they were not able<note place="margin">Now they require onlie Scriptures.</note> to maintaine that chalenge, they generally euer since say plainly, that they wil not stand to anie other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie,
<pb facs="3"/> but to the onlie written Word of God. And holding opinion that the Church can erre in Faith, they endeuour to bring the very Church it self (theirs<note place="margin">Isa. 54. v. 17.</note> and our proper Iudge) to be iudged as a partie. Wherby they draw al Controuersies to this one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: Who amongst al pretenders, righstly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the holie Scriptures? Wherupō we might most iustly require, that they by onlie Scriptures, should first disproue our long established Religion; and then also proue their owne, newly pretended.</p>
   <p>But seing they can not doe it; we, for the more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation<note place="margin">VVe agree to proue by onlie Scriptures, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>ch is the true Religion.</note> of truth, and for better reducing those that erre, into the right way, doe condescend to trie this important cause, by this special, &amp; onlie meanes, to which, you our Aduersaries, seme so confidenrly to appeale. Only beseching you, that we may in sober maner, by word, or by writing, without cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous contention, or vncharitable railing, procede herein; according to these, or other reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.<note place="margin">Presupposing reasonable cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note>
      <note place="margin">See Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ductions to the true Church. ch. 9. 10.</note> For without reasonable conditions (as both ancient and present experience teacheth) it is but lose of time, to dispute with contentious spirites, out of only Scriptures. First therfore you must stil remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Condition. </seg>1</label> that we doe not grant your exclusion of other proofes, to be iust; but that we are content to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from them, vntil you shal find it nedeful, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> repaire vnto them againe. Secōdly, that in the meane while you be also limited, to the same onlie meanes of holie Scriptures. Thirdly, that it may suffice for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> either partie (which wil be as necessarie for you, as for vs) to proue the thing it self, which we beleue, by necessarie consequence, of the holie Scriptures, though the verie wordes be not there expressed. Fourtly, when in our conference, some wordes, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> sentences of holie Scripture, may some hard, or contrarie to other places, that then the same may be explaned, by the more cleare: or the more in number
<pb facs="3"/> (perteyning to the same matter) may explicate the fewer. Alwayes considering that euerie word in holie Scripture, is assuredly true: al being indited by the Holie Ghost. These conditions we suppose, al lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers<note place="margin">VVhy other points are here proued, which are not now in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie. 1. Reason.</note> of truth, and studious of concord, wil approue for reasonable. In confidence whereof, we here proue not only matters of Controuersie, but also al principal pointes of Christian Doctrine: because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Controuersies depend vpon other Articles, at this time not called into question. Because also new <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> errors doe dayly rise, which haue like nede, to be confuted. Thirdly, to shew by experience, that old <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Heretikes drew as plausible arguments from the holie Scriptures, for their errors, as anie Sectaries doe now for their new opinions. Fourtly, for our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> further instruction by holie Scriptures, as wel in al pointes of Faith, which we are bond to know: as in Precepts of life, which we are bond to performe: according to the Apostles doctrine [Be ye doers of<note place="margin">Iac. 1. v. 22.</note> the word, and not hearers only] For better explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sake, we diuide this whole worke into foure<note place="margin">The whole worke is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into foure parts.</note> parts. In the first part are explained the Articles of the Apostles Crede. In the second part, the seuen holie Sacraments of Christ. In the third, the tenne Commandments. And in the fourth part, the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie vse of Prayer: Especially Our Lords Prayer.</p>
