         </gap>tius de consol. 3. pros. 7.</note> in a Feaver, or Dropsie, better it is to be without the malady then to enioy that remedie. <hi>Riches</hi> are desired not for themselves, but for the sustenance of life. <hi>Life</hi> is not so much desired for it selfe as for the enioyment of <hi>happinesse,</hi> which when a man hath sought in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth of earthly vanities, after much vexation, and disquietment of spirit, hee must conclude, that it is onely in that truest and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest good, which is the fountaine, whence true delight first floweth, and the obiect, wherein at last it resteth.</p>
   <p>Secondly, That is mans <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> in the possession and enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof his heart resteth best satisfied. So farre a man is from true <hi>happinesse</hi> as hee is from full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in that which hee enioyes. The <hi>Bee</hi> would not sit upon so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyflowers, if shee could gather hony enough from any one, neither would <hi>Salomon</hi> have tryed so many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
<pb facs="7"/>
if the enioyment of anie creature could have made him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Would you know the cause why so many (like <hi>Ixion</hi>) make love to shadowes and leave the substance, or (that I may speake in a better phrase) <hi>forsake the fountaine of<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 13.</note> living water, and dig to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves broken Cisternes that will hold no water?</hi> Briefly, it is because man, who in his pride would have seene as much as God,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 5.</note> is now become so blinde, that hee seeth not himselfe. For if men knew either the disposition of their soules by Creation, or the distemper of their soules by corruption, they would easily escape this delusion. 1. The soule is a spirituall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, whose originall is from God, and therefore its rest must be in God; as the Rivers runne into the Sea, and as every body rests in its center. The noblest faculties are abased, not improved, abused, not imployed, vexed not satisfied, when they are yoaked and subiected to
<pb facs="7"/>
these in eriour obiects, as when <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar fedde amongst<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 29.</note> beasts.</hi> Or when as <hi>they that were brought up in Scarlet, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced<note place="margin">Lam. 4. 5.</note> the dung.</hi> Or as when <hi>Servants rode on horse-backe,<note place="margin">Eccl. 10. 7.</note> and Masters walked like Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants on the ground.</hi> Or as when <hi>70. Kings</hi> like dogges did<note place="margin">Iudg. 1. 7.</note>
      <hi>eate bread under Adoni-bezeks table:</hi> Or as when <hi>Sampson made the Philistims</hi> merry with his eyes<note place="margin">Iudg. 16.</note> put out.</p>
   <p>2. Consider the soule as it is now in this state of corruption, nothing can now content it, but that which can cure it. The soule is full of sinne, which is the most painefull sicknesse; hence the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares wicked men to the raging waves of the Sea, that is never at rest, whose waters cast up mire and<note place="margin">Esa. 57. 1.</note> dirt; what will you doe to comfort him that is heart-sicke? Bring him the choisest delicates; Hee cannot relish them; Compasse him about with merry company, and musicke,
<pb facs="8"/>
It's tedious and troublesome to him: bring him to a better Chamber, lay him in an easier bed; all will not satisfie him. Bring the Physician to him; then he conceives hope; let the Physician cure him of his distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and then hee will eat courser meat, with a better stomacke, and sleepe on a harder bed, in a worse chamber, with a more quiet and contented heart.</p>
   <p>Iust so it is with a guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, though hee is not alwayes sensible of it. What comfort can his friends give him when God is his enemie? What delight can hee take in his stately buildings, or frequent visits, who may expect, even this night, to have his <hi>soule<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 20</note> fetcht away from him,</hi> and to be cast into hell amongst Devils? What is a golden chaine about a Leprous person, or the richest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell upon a dead carkasse? Or, what comfort will a costly banquet yeeld to a condemned malefactor, who is now going to execution? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

   <p>Hee that reades his Epistles at leasure, advisedly, shall finde many errours confuted, many doubts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, many truths cleared, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny usefull directions for a holy life, recorded, and layd up, in those Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb facs="12"/>
(as, so many lewels in a rich Cabinet) for the good of posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for ever. If thence we come to these latter times, and see what large, and elaborate, and learned Epistles, <hi>Calvin, Beza, Drusius,</hi> and others have written, in other Countreyes. Or looke into those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Letters of <hi>Bradford,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blessed Martyrs in our owne language, besides many since, wee shall conclude, that this course hath beene of no small use for the direction. and comfort of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all ages. I'le adde one thing more concerning our owne Nation, and times. It's pittie, and to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that so many worthy Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as are written upon speciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casins, for resolution of spirituall doubts, from day today, by one or other, are imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>isoned in secret Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets and Cabinets, which (if they were brought to light and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, I am perswadea) would not onely exceede all that ever hath beene done in this course, since the
<pb facs="12"/>
Apostles time, but also be the best helpe for resolution of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred cases and doubts (which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet Christians) that ever hath beene, or, except some such course be taken, ever will be in the world. I will briefly touch one or two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections more, which some may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose against this worke, and so conclude.</p>
   <p>Many have already written on<note place="margin">Obiect. 2.</note> these subiects, and therefore this is superfluous.</p>
   <p>True it is; Many have written<note place="margin">Answ.</note> on this subiect largely, and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as, Master <hi>Rogers</hi> in seaven Treatises, abridged by Master <hi>Stephen Egerton,</hi> and Master <hi>Iohn Downam</hi> in a large and usefull worke, and (that I may not forget him, whom, in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, I should first have mentioned) the Reverend Deane of <hi>Worcester</hi> Doctor <hi>Hall,</hi> that true Christian English <hi>Seneca.</hi> Also Master <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> whose <hi>generall directions for comfortable walking with God</hi>
      <pb facs="13"/>
are deservedly approved of the most iudicious. Yet I answer, first, That is never too often taught, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sufficiently learned. Secondly, In the mouth of two or three witnesses the truth is confirmed. Thirdly, As God is much glorified, so the Church is much edified by varietie of gifts; <hi>Paul, Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas are yours, and you Christs.</hi> Fourthly; The Christian and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Reader shall find in this some things new, other things expressed in a new manner, all digested in such a Method, with such brevity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity, as was necessary to make the Booke a <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>de mecum,</hi> easily portable, and profitable to the poore, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>iterate.</p>
   <p>But it exceeds the limits and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion<note place="margin">Obiect. 2.</note> of a Letter.</p>
   <p>The first Coppy was more briefe, upon occasion of a second Letter, wherein some other cases were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, the iudicious Author not onely handled these Arguments largely in his publicke Ministery,
<pb facs="13"/>
but also added more particulars for his friends full satisfaction in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coppy, hence it came to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>antitie. But lest whilest I plead for him, I should seeme to be guiltie of the same fault my selfe, I will here stop, wishing thee (Gentle and honest hearted Reader) to consider that account must be given of what thou readest, as well as of what thou hearest, and therefore, to ioyne pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with thy reading, that spirituall wisedome and strength may bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in thee for the practice of what thou learnest. So I commend the booke to thy reading, and thee, and it, to Gods blessing.</p>
