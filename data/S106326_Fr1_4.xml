   <head>To the Scottish youth.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S It is a thing verie customable vnto thee, O cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious youth, greatūly to delite in poesie, ather by playing the parte of a poet thy selfe, or by exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thy spirit in reading and proclaiming the compositions of other men: So is it as common to thy indiscreit age to make a chuse of that naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie subiect of fleshly and vnlawfull loue. In such sort that in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces courts, in the houses of greate men, and at the assemblies of yong gentilmen and yong damesels, the cheife pastime is, to sing prophane sonnets, and vaine ballats of loue, or to rehearse some fabulos faits of Palmerine, Amadis, or other such like raueries &amp; such as ather haue the art or vaine poetike, of force they must shew themselnes cunning followers of the dissolute ethnike poets, both in phrase and substance, or else they shall be had in no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Alas for pittie! Is this the right vse of a Christians talent to incense the burning lustes of licentions persons by such euill ex amples and allurements? Art thon (O miserable man) well oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, that day &amp; night busies thy braine to invent these things which may foster the filthie vice and corruption that naturallie is seased in the harts of all men? Was ii to this end, that thy mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er sent thee in the world, to be an instrument of wickednes? or hes he giuen thee such gifts, and viuacitie of spirit, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in vanitie, and prouoking others to vncleannes? knowes thou not that thou must render account of euerie idle word that proceedes out of thy mouth? And that thy vngodlie conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion banishes the spirit of GOD from thee? suffocats thy gude giftes, rottis thy conscience, and makis thy GOD to become ane Enemie against thee, What count thinkes thou to giue vnto the,
<pb facs="4"/>
iust and fearefull iudge of the world (who doubtles will craue it of thee, thou knowes not how suddainely) that hath employed thy time, and abused his good giftes after this manner? I think the cōsideration of it the more terrible, because sometime I delighted in such fantasies my selfe, after the maner of riotous young men: and vvere not the Lord in mercie pulled me a backe, &amp; wrought a great repentance in me, I had doubtlesse run forward and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed my time &amp; studie in that prophane and vnprofitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, to my owne perdition. For vvhat seekes man by that kind▪ of studie? nothing but a name, but a vaine praise, and an vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued commendation. Why shuld thou not then (aspiring youth) rather bestowe thy gude gifts to the right vse, to wit, to the glory of god, and to the weil of thy brethren? which thow sall do when by thy poesie or prose thow declares the mercie, the iustice, the power, the providence, the wisedome, the holines, the gudenes, or wondrous works of thy God vnto the world: Whereof thow may haue so large a field in the scriptures, that al thy pithie words, thy figures of Rhetoricke, thy subtile argumentes, thy skill in phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, metaphysicke, mathematicke, or morall philosophie, shal not be sufficient to expres the dignitie thereof. Would thou intreat of prodigious miracles? luke the bookes if Genesis and Exod, or the workes of our sauiour, of the Prophets and Apostles? Would thow haue a subiect of valiant deids of armes? read the buikes of Iosua and the Iudges. And of the Kings of Israel &amp; Iudah? Wald thou haue store of wise sentences, read the Prouerbs, and Ecclesiastes? walde thou haue a subiect of loue? looke the song of songs, of the loue betuixt Christ and his kirk. Would thow reioyce, or lament praise or disprais; comfort, or threaten; pray, or vse imprecation Imitat the ald Hebrew Dauid in his Psalmes, as a paterne of all heavinly poesie. In a word, the high &amp; holy mysteries, &amp; felicitie of the life to come, conteined in the auld &amp; new testament, may be a more noble and worthie subiect, vvhere vpon the hole cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Eloquence of mans loftie Spirite should be employed
<pb facs="5"/>
nor vpon these trifles, &amp; sensuall villanies. But thou will perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture say, that such a subiect is ouer graue, and that a light &amp; merrie matter were more agreable to yong folks: I answere thee, that indeede vanitie and corruption are most agreeable to a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature: But let that mirrines wherein is sinne, be far from all good Christians. But if thou would meditate on this spirituall subiect, and exercise thy selfe in the Law of the Lord with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, thou should with time alter thy fleshlie affectiones, and nourish thy spirituall gifts: In such sorte, that thou shal detest that which is sensuall and brutish, and delight in that which is holie and pleasant in the sight of the Lord, and by thy example shall sturre vp others to doe the like: Heirefore, I haue heere set downe before thee, a few spirituall songs, begun in my youth, and prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in my wraslings with the world, and the flesh, whereby thou may cleerely see what aboundance of good matter is offered, which the most parte of Poets foolishlie reiectes, and dedicates their hole studie to things moste vile and contemptible. Farther, I contemne not the moderate and trew commendation of the vertuous, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actes of good men: nor yet the extolling of liberall sciences: But thou hast notable examples in the French toong set foorth by <hi>Salust</hi> of <hi>Bartas.</hi> Onely thus much haue I written in rude Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish and hask verses, to prouoke the more skilfull in that art to flee higher, and to encourage the meaner sort to follow. To the effect, that the spirits of men in all their actions may be applyed to the right end, euen to glorifie God, who must euer sanctifie &amp; prosper the interprises of his owne. At <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 9 day of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</hi> 1594.</p>
   <p>Thy louing friend,</p>
   <p>Alexander Hume</p>
