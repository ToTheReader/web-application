      <p>
         <hi>A</hi> Certayne Carauel saylyng in the West Ocean, about the coastes of Spayne, had a forcybly and continuall wynde from the East, wherby it was dryuen to a land vnknowen,<note place="margin">A harde begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng.</note> and not described in any map or carde of the sea, and was dryuen styl along by the coaste of the same for the space of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes, vntyll it came to a hauen, where in a short tyme the most part of the maryners, beyng long before very weake and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by reason of hunger and trauayll, dyed: So that onely the Pilot, with three or foure other, remayned alyue. And not only they that dyed, dyd not inioye the Indies whiche they fyrst disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to theyr mysfortune, but the resydue also that lyued had in maner as litle fruition of the same: not leauyng, or at the least not openly publyshyng any memorie thereof, neyther of the place, or what it was called, or in what yeere it was founde: Albeit, the fault was not theyrs, but rather the malyce of other, or the enuie of that which we call fortune. I do not therfore marueyle, that the auncient histories affyrme, that great thynges proceede and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of small and obscure begynnynges, syth we haue seene the same veryfied in this fynding of the Indies, being so notable and newe a thyng. We neede not be curious to seeke the name of the Pilot, syth death made a shorte ende of his doynges. Some wyl, that he came from <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> and traded to the Ilandes of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and the Iland of <hi>Madera,</hi> when this large and mortal naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation chaunced vnto hym. Other say that he was a <hi>Byscanne,</hi>
         <note place="margin">The Pylot that fyrst founde the Indies.</note> and traded into Englande and Fraunce. Gther also, that he was a Portugale, &amp; that either he went or came from <hi>Mina</hi> or <hi>India:</hi> which agreeth well with the name of these newe landes,<note place="margin">Mina.</note> as I haue sayd before. Agayne, some there be that say that he brought the Carauel to Portugale, or to the Iland of <hi>Madera,</hi> or to some other of the Ilandes called <hi>De los Azores.</hi> Yet do none of them affyrme any thyng, although they al affirme that the Pilot dyed in the house of <hi>Christopher Colon,</hi> with whom remayned all suche writynges and annotations as he had made of his voyage in the sad Carauell, aswell of such thynges as he obserued both by land and sea, as also of the eleuation of the pole in those landes whiche he had discouered.</p>

      <head>VVhat maner of man Christopher Colon (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse called Columbus) was, and how he came fyrst to the knowledge of the Indies.</head>
      <p>CHristopher <hi>Colon</hi> was borne in <hi>Cugureo,</hi> or (as some say) in <hi>Nerui,</hi> a vyllage in the territorie of <hi>Genua</hi> in Italie. He descended as some thynke, of the house of the <hi>Pelestreles</hi> of <hi>Placentia</hi> in <hi>Lumbardie.</hi> He beganne of a chylde to be a maryner: of whose arte they haue great exercise on the ryuer of <hi>Genua.</hi> He traded many yeeres into <hi>Suria,</hi> and other partes of the East. After this, he became a maister in makyng cardes for the sea, whereby he had great vantage. He came to Portugale to know the reason &amp; description of the south coastes of Affrica, and the nauigations of the Portugales, thereby to make his cardes more perfecte to be solde. He maryed in Portugale, as some say: or as many say, in the Ilande of <hi>Madera,</hi> where he dwelt at suche tyme as the sayd Carauell arryued there, whose Pilot soiorned in his house, and dyed also there, bequeathyng to <hi>Colon</hi> his carde of the description of suche newe landes as he had found, whereby <hi>Colon</hi> had the fyrst knowledge of the Indies. Some haue thought y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
         <hi>Colon</hi> was wel learned in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Latine tongue and the science of Cosmographie: and that he was thereby fyrst moued to seeke the lands of <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and the rych Ilande of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pango,</hi> wherof <hi>Marchus Paulus</hi> wryteth. Also that he had redde what <hi>Plato</hi> in his dialoges of <hi>Timeus</hi> and <hi>Cricias,</hi> writeth of the great Ilande of <hi>Atlantide,</hi> and of a great land in the west Ocean vndiscouered, beyng bygger then Asia and Affrica. Furthermore that he had knowledge what <hi>Aristotell</hi> and <hi>Theophrastus</hi> saye in theyr bookes of maruayles, where they wryte that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne merchauntes of Carthage, saylyng from the streyghtes of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> towarde the West and South, founde after many dayes a great Ilande not inhabited, yet replenyshed with al thynges requisite, and hauing many nauigable ryuers. In deede <hi>Colan</hi> was not greatly learned:<note place="margin">Colon was not much learned.</note> yet of good vnderstanding. And when he had knowledge of the sayde newe landes by the information of the dead Pilot,<note place="margin">Colon confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men.</note> made relation thereof to certeyne learned men, with whom he conferred as touching y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> like thinges mentioned of olde autours. He communicated this secrete
<pb n="2" facs="12"/>
and conferred chiefely with a fryer, named <hi>Iohn Perez</hi> of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chena,</hi> that dwelt in the monastery of <hi>Rabida.</hi> So that I veryly beleeue, that in maner all that he declared, and many thynges more that he leaft vnspoken, were written by the sayde Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshe Pilot that dyed in his house. For I am persuaded, that if <hi>Colon</hi> by science atteined to the knowledg of the Indies, he would long before haue communicat this secreate to his owne countrey men the <hi>Genueses,</hi> that trauayle all the worlde for gaynes, and not haue come into Spayne for this purpose. But doubtelesse he neuer thought of any such thyng, before he chaunced to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the sayde Pilot, who founde those landes by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, accordyng to the saying of Plinie, <hi>Quod ars docere non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit, casus inuenit.</hi> That is, That arte coulde not teache, chaunce founde. Albeit, the more Christian opinion is, to thynke that God of his singuler prouidence and infinite goodnesse, at the length with eyes of compassion as it were lookyng downe from heauen vppon the sonnes of Adam, so long kept vnder Sathans captiuitie, intended euen then (for causes to hym onely knowen) to rayse those wyndes of mercy whereby that Carauell (herein most lyke vnto the shyppe of Noe, whereby the remnante of the whole world was saued, as by this Carauel this newe worlde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the fyrst hope of theyr saluation) was dryuen to these landes. But we wyll now declare what great thynges folowed of this small begynnyng, and howe <hi>Colon</hi> folowed this matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto hym not without Gods prouidence.</p>

      <head>VVhat labour and trauayle Colon tooke in attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng his fyrst voyage to the Indies.</head>
      <p>AFter the death of the Pilot &amp; maryners of the Spanyshe Carauell that discouered y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Indies, <hi>Christopher Colon</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to seeke the same. But in howe muche more he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syred this, the lesse was his power to accomplyshe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre. For, besyde that of hym selfe he was not able to furnyshe one shyppe, he lacked also the fauoure of a kyng, vnder whose protection he myght so enioye the ryches he hoped to fynde, that none other myght take the same from hym, or defeate him therof.
<pb facs="13"/>
And seyng the kyng of Portugale occupied in the conquest of Africa, and the Nauigations of the East, whiche were then fyrst attempted, the kyng of Castyle lykewyse no lesse busyed in the warres of <hi>Granada,</hi> he sent to his brother <hi>Bartholomewe Colon</hi> (who was also priuie to this secrete) to practise with the kyng of England (Henry the seuenth) beyng very ryche and without warres,<note place="margin">Kyng Henry the seuenth.</note> promysyng to bryng hym great ryches in short tyme, if he woulde shewe hym fauour, and furnyshe hym with shyps to discouer the newe Indies, whereof he had certayne knowledge. But neyther here beyng able to bryng his sute to passe, he caused the matter to be moued to the kyng of Portugale <hi>Don Alonso,</hi> the fyfth of that name: at whose handes he founde neither fauour nor mony,<note place="margin">Barnarde knewe not all thynges.</note> forasmuch as the Licenciat <hi>Calzadilla</hi> the bishop of <hi>Viseo,</hi> and one maister <hi>Rodrigo,</hi> men of credite in the science of Cosmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphie, withstoode hym, and contended that there neither was nor coulde any golde or other ryches be founde in the west, as <hi>Colon</hi> affirmed. By reason whereof he was very sad and pensiue: but yet was not discouraged, or despaired of the hope of his good aduenture, which he afterwarde founde. This doone, he tooke shyppyng at <hi>Lisburne,</hi> and came to <hi>Palos</hi> of <hi>Moguer,</hi> where he communed with <hi>Martin Alonso Pinzon,</hi> an expert Pilot, who offered hym selfe vnto hym. After this, disclosyng the whole se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes of his mynd to <hi>Iohn Perez</hi> of <hi>Marchena</hi> (a fryer of thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of saint Frances in <hi>Rabida,</hi> &amp; well learned in Cosmographie) and declaryng vnto hym howe by folowyng the course of the Sunne by a temperate voyage, rych and great landes myght be founde: the fryer greatly commended his interpryse, and gaue him counsayle to breake the matter to the Duke of <hi>Medina Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Don Enrique</hi> of <hi>Guzman,</hi> a great lorde, and very rych: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to <hi>Don Luis</hi> of <hi>Cerda,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Medina Celi,</hi> who at that time had great prouision of shyps wel furnyshed in his hauen of <hi>Santa Maria.</hi> But whereas both these Dukes tooke the matter for a dreame, and as a thyng deuised of an Italian deceyuer, who (as they thought) had before with lyke pretence deluded the kynges of Englande and Portugale, the fryer gaue hym courage to go to the courte of the Catholyke princes <hi>Don Ferdinando,</hi> and lady <hi>Isabell</hi> princes of Castyle, affyrmyng that they woulde be ioyful of suche newes: And for his better furtherance herein, wrote

         </gap>etters by hym to fryer <hi>Ferdinando</hi> of <hi>Talauera</hi> the queenes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor. <hi>Christopher Colon</hi> therefore, repayred to the courte of the Catholyke princes, in the yeere .1486. and delyuered vnto theyr handes the petition of his request, as concernyng the discoueryng of the new Indies. But they beyng more careful, and applying al theyr mynde howe they myght dryue the Moores out of the kyngdome of <hi>Granada,</hi>
         <note place="margin">The conquest of Granada.</note> whiche greate enterprise they had alredy taken in hande, dyd lyttle or nothyng esteeme the matter. But <hi>Colon</hi> not thus discouraged, founde the meanes to declare his sute to suche as had sometymes priuate communication with the kyng. Yet because he was a straunger, and went but in simple apparell, nor otherwyse credited then by the letter of a gray frier, they beleeued hym not, neyther gaue eare to his woordes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was greatly tormented in his imagination.

And by this meanes was his sute hearde of the Catholyke princes, who also redde the booke of his memorials whiche he presented vnto them. And although at the fyrst they tooke it for vayne and false that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed, neuerthelesse they put hym in good hope that he shoulde be well dispatched when they had fynyshed the warres of <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> whiche they had nowe in hande. With which answere, <hi>Colon</hi> began to reuyue his spirites, with hope to be better esteemed, and more fauorably to be hearde among the gentelmen &amp; noble men of the courte, who before tooke hym onely for a craftie felowe and deceyuer: and was nothyng dismayde or discouraged when soeuer he debated the matter with them, although many iudged hym phantasticall, as is the maner of ignorant men, to cal all

suche as attempt any thyng beyonde theyr reache, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of theyr knowledge, thynkyng the worlde to be no bygger then the cagies wherein they are brought vp and lyue.

They gaue hym also the tenth part of all the reuenues and customes due vnto the kyng, of all such landes as he shoulde discouer, not doyng preiudice in any thyng to the kyng of Portugale. The particulars of this agreement were made in the towne called <hi>Sancta Fe</hi>: and the priuiledge of the rewarde in <hi>Granada</hi> the .xxx. daye of Apryll, the same yeere that the citie was woonne.

      <head>VVhy they were called Indies.</head>
      <p>SOme thynke that the people of the newe world were called Indians, bycause they are of the colour of the east Indians. And although (as it semmeth to me) they dyffer much in colour and fashions,<note place="margin">The colour of the East Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> yet is it true, that of India they were called Indians. India is properly called that great prouince of Asia, in the whiche great Alexander kepte his warres, and was so named of the ryuer <hi>Indus</hi>: and is diuided into many kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes confinyng with the same. From this great India (called the East India) came great companyes of men, as wrytteth <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> and inhabited that part of Ethiopia that lyeth betweene the sea <hi>Bermeia</hi> (otherwyse called the red sea, or y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gulfe of <hi>Arabia</hi>) and the ryuer of <hi>Nilus</hi>: all whiche regions that great Christian prince <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> doth nowe possesse. The said Indians preuayled so muche, that they vtterly chaunged the customes and
<pb n="4" facs="14"/>
name of that lande, and called it India: by reason whereof, Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia also hath of long tyme ben called India. And hereupon came it that <hi>Aristotle, Seneca,</hi> and certayne other olde authours sayd, that India was not farre from Spayne. After this also, of later dayes our west India was so called, of the sayde India of <hi>Prester Iohn</hi> where the Portugales had theyr trade: For the Pilot of the Carauell that was fyrst dryuen by forcible wynde to an vnknowen lande in the west Ocean, called the same India, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Portugales so called such landes as they had lately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered eastward. <hi>Christophor Colon</hi> also, after the sayd Pilot, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the west landes by the same name: Albeit some that take <hi>Colonus</hi> for an expert Cosmographer, thynke that he so named them of the East India, as to be the furthest and vnknowen ende thereof, reachyng into the West, vnder the other hemisphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or halfe globe of the earth beneath vs: affirming that when he fyrste attempted to discouer the Indies, he went chiefly to seeke the ryche Ilande of <hi>Cipango,</hi> whiche falleth on the part of great <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Cathay,</hi> as wryteth <hi>Marcus Paulus Venetus,</hi> and other: And that he shoulde sooner come thyther by folowyng the course of the Sunne Westward, then agaynst the same.</p>

      <head>Of the colour of the Indians.</head>
      <p>ONe of the marueylous thynges y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> God vseth in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of man, is coloure: whiche doubtlesse can not be consydered without great admiration, in holdyng one to be whyte, and an other blacke, beyng colours vtterly contrary: some lykewyse to be yealowe, whiche is betweene blacke and white: and other of other colours, as it were of diuers liueries. And as these colours are to be marueyled at, euen so is it to be considered, howe they dyffer one from an other, as it were by degrees, forasmuch as some men are whyte after dyuers sorts of whitnes, yelowe after diuers maners of yelowe, &amp; blacke after dyuers sorts of blackenes: &amp; how from white they go to yelow by discolouring to browne &amp; red, and to blacke by ashe colour, &amp; murry, somwhat lighter then blacke,<note place="margin">The coloure of the west In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</note> &amp; tawny like vnto the west Indians, which are altogether in general either purple or tawny,
<pb facs="15"/>
lyke vnto sodde Quinses, or of the colour of Chestnuttes or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyues, which colour is to them naturall: and not by theyr goyng naked, as many haue thought: albeit theyr nakednesse haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what helped therevnto. Therefore in lyke maner, and with suche diuersitie as men are commonly whyte in Europe, and blacke in Affrike, euen with lyke varietie are they tawney in these Indies, with diuers degrees diuersly inclinyng more or lesse to blacke or whyte. No lesse marueyle is it to consider, that men are white in Siuile, and blacke at the cape of <hi>Buena Speranza,</hi> and of Chestnut colour at the ryuer of <hi>Plata,</hi> being all in equall degrees from the Equinoctiall lyne.

An other thing is also greatly to be noted, as touching these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians: and this is, that their heare is not curld, as is the Moores and Ethiopians that inhabite the same clime: neyther are they balde, excepte very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      <head>❧ A most auncient testimonie of the VVest Indies, by the writing of the diuine Philosopher Plato.</head>
      <p>
         <hi>
            <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Lato</hi> in his famous and diuine Dialogue, named <hi>Timeus,</hi> where he entreateth of the vniuersall nature and frame of the whole worlde, taketh for his principle the moste auncient hystorie of an Ilande, in tyme of great antiquitie, named <hi>Athlantides,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng also mention of the kyng, people, and inhabitantes of the same: and that they kept warre agaynst the <hi>Atheniens,</hi> and were ouercome of them. <hi>Plato</hi> also there inducing the sayde hystorie to be rehearsed by one named <hi>Critia,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that he had often hearde it of his Uncle, who was in the tyme of <hi>Solon,</hi> one of the seuen sages of the Grekes. This <hi>Critia</hi> declared, that when <hi>Solon</hi> went into Egypt to a certayne citie named <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>im,</hi> situate vpon the riuer of <hi>Nilus,</hi> where the diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and recurryng of the riuer, maketh the Ilande <hi>Delta,</hi> he there spake with certayne learned priestes, very skylful in knowledge of antiquities of many worldes past. Insomuch that they made mention of manye thinges that were before the flood of Noe, or <hi>Deucalion,</hi> and also before the vniuersal conflagration or burning of the worlde in the tyme of <hi>Phaeton,</hi> forasmuche as the warres betweene the people of the sayde Ilande of <hi>Athlantides</hi> and the <hi>Atheniens,</hi> was long before the general flood, and the conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aforesayde. <hi>Plato</hi> induceth the priest, speaking to <hi>Solon</hi> in maner as foloweth.</p>
      <p>Thinges most marueylous and true (<hi>O Solon</hi>) remayne in auncient writynges and memorie of our predecessours, and olde ages long before our tymes. But aboue all thynges, one exceedeth al admiration for the greatnesse and singularitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whiche is this: It is in our recordes of moste antiquities, that in times past your citie of <hi>Athens</hi> hath oftentymes kepte warres agaynst an innumerable multitude of nations whiche came from the sea <hi>Athlantike,</hi> in maner into al <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia:</hi> whereas nowe appeareth no suche nation, forasmuche as the sayde sea is nowe al ouer nauigable: And yet at that tyme had,
<pb facs="16"/>
in the mouth, and as it were in the entrie (where you place the Columnes of Hercules) an Ilande whiche was sayd to be much greater then al <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and that from thence was pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to many other Ilandes neare thereabout, and from the sayde Ilandes to the continent or fyrme lande, whiche was right ouer agaynst it neare vnto the sea: Yet, that within the mouth, there was a litle gulfe with a porte: the deepe sea without, was the true sea, and the lande without was the true continent. This Ilande was named <hi>Athlantides,</hi> and in it was a kyng of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous great power and myght, who had the dominion of the sayde Ilande, and many other, and also a great part of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent lande whereof we haue spoken, and muche more towarde our partes also, forasmuche as they were dominatours of the thyrde part of the worlde conteynyng <hi>Africa, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> euen vnto the sea <hi>Tirrhenum.</hi> The power therefore of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng then so great, they came to inuade both your countrey and ours, and all other that are within the Columnes of Hercules. Then (<hi>O Solon</hi>) the vertue of your citie shewed it selfe famous in magnanimitie and feates of armes, with the assemblance of the other Grecians, in resystyng theyr great power, vntyl you had driuen them out of our lands, and restored vs to our libertie. But shortly after that this enterprise was atchiued, befel a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous great earthquake, and exundation or ouerflowing of the sea, which continued for the space of one day and nyght: In the whiche the earth opened it selfe, and inglutted all those vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and warlike men, and the sayde Ilande <hi>Athlantides</hi> sunke into the bottome of the sea, whiche was the occasion that neuer from that tyme forwarde, any shyp coulde sayle that way, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great mudde and slyme whiche remayned of the drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ilande.</p>
      <p>This is the summe of those thynges whiche olde <hi>Critia</hi> sayde he had vnderstoode of <hi>Solon.</hi> And certaynely these wordes of <hi>Plato</hi> of the said Iland, haue caused great contention among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Philosophers, which haue written commentaries vpon the sayde Dialogue of <hi>Timeus</hi> composed by <hi>Plato:</hi> Insomuche that the same in those dayes being vtterly vnknowen, many haue taken this narration of <hi>Solon,</hi> for an allegorical fable, and haue interpreted the same in diuers senses and meanynges. But it
<pb n="6" facs="16"/>
may nowe well appeare the true meanyng hereof to be this: that <hi>Plato</hi> intendyng to wryte of the vniuersall frame of the worlde, the whiche he knewe to be made an habitation for the diuine best man, and also beholdyng therin the great ornament and beautie of the heauen and starres, whereby man myght knowe his God and creatour, it myght seeme to hym a thyng to farre from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that only two partes thereof shoulde be inhabited, and the other part desolate and depriued of men: and that the Sunne and starres might seeme to shewe theyr lyght only halfe theyr course without profite, shining only vpon the sea and desolate pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, destitute of man and other liuing creatures. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> had in great admiration the hystorie of the sayde Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an priest, makyng mention of an other part of the worlde besyde <hi>Asia, Europa,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and thought it woorthy to be rehearsed in the beginning of his diuine Dialogue aforesayde. We ought therefore certainely to thinke our selues most bounde vnto God, that in these our tymes it hath pleased hym to reueale and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this secrete in the fyndyng of this newe worlde, whereby we are certaynely assured, that vnder our Pole starre, and vnder the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> line, are most goodlye and ample regions, as well and commodiously inhabited, as are other partes of the worlde best knowen vnto vs.</p>
