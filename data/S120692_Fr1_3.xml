   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had translated this treatise (frendly reader) and presented it to him for whose priuate vse I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, being moued thereunto vpon occasion in the former epistle declared: it seemed not amisse to the patron to haue the same published for the benefit of many. Whose iudgement I could not but very wel approue in respect of the matter, being both comfortable and pleasant to be red, and withall very orderly laid down, and handled after an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accustomed yet most familiar) manner.</p>
   <p>Vnderstand, that I haue for breuities sake purposely omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the epistles before the booke, which are three: (being loath to pesterre thee with a packet of letters at the first) Onely I do here alleadge out of them a few things written by my Author in his owne defence. And first whereas some men pretend he hath not handled this argument deuoutly enough in that hee applieth not places of holy scripture to his purpose:<note place="margin">
         <hi>A defence for the Author.</hi>
      </note> As he accep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth well of their admonition, so his answere is that seeing he professeth himselfe herein no diuine, but a philosopher, (yet a Christian philosopher) they ought to beare with him. Hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the only direct path-way to saluation to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in those sacred bookes: but that good letters withal, and the writings of philosophers are both an ease and help for vs to attain vnto the vnderstanding of them, and do further vs in the way of vertue and godlines, howsoeuer som new Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans maintaine the contrary, seeking to abolish all good arts &amp; knowledge in humanity. That he writeth so highly in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of RIGHT REASON, although som times with the words of the Aūcients: yet he accōpteth no reason pure or right except it be directed by God &amp; illuminated by faith. If in writing of destiny &amp; other lik profoūd matters his tongue (through an ardente and earnest intente of a good meaning mind) hapned any wher to trip or his pen to slide; Be not thou
<pb facs="4"/>
too rigorus towards him for it, he yealdeth to amend whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer shalbe proued amisse. He professeth himselfe of the nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those that haue godlinesse rather in hearte, then in their mouth; And liketh not the time that is fruitefull of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and fruitelesse impietie. Finally he is none of those subtle sophisticall ianglers, that place philosohie in the quirks and quiddities of crabbed questions. But he directeth his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to the forming of good manners, and moderating of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (especially feare, and sorrow in aduersitie) whereby hee may at length be safely harbored in the hauen of a contented mind. A notable testimonie whereof hee hath left vs in these two bookes, to the singular comforte of all that list to reade them.</p>
   <p>In englishing whereof I haue endeuored the best I could to performe the duetie of an interpreter, keeping alwaies the sense and meaning of my author;<note place="margin">
         <hi>A reason of the translators doings herein.</hi>
      </note> yea the very words precisely in al definitions, distributions, distinctions &amp; such like princi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pal heads of matter, decyphering them in a greater letter; As the places quoted out of other writers, in a lesser. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall notes appeare to be of two sortes; Some answering to the places in the text directly against them, seruing for quota<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions or expositions: (with these letters a. b. c. &amp;c) Others containing a briefe summe of the whole matter of each chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by a perpetuall continuation, as if all of them were but one intire note. And euen so the contents befere euery chapter haue not alwaies in them a perfect and full sense, but depende many times vpon the contents nexte following. In all these I swerue not from my printed copie, sauing that I haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a few marginall notes for expositions sake where neede required. Lastly I haue with some more care and diligence of mine owne, reduced the summe of both bookes into a large and plaine table containing the argument of the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference vnder one viewe, the better to helpe thy memorie, if it please thee to consider of the matter with more mature deliberation.</p>
   <p>If thou reape any pleasure or profit by this discourse, giue
<pb facs="4"/>
thanks (next vnto God) to my Author; then to the patron, for whom onely and by whome the same was both englished and published. For mine owne part I desire no more but curteous acceptation of my trauaill, I hope I deserue no lesse. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good-will and a few good wordes for many daies work, is no vnreasonable rewarde: And he that grudgeth to giue such bare wages, as I would be loth to be his man, so if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe were bound to serue a bad master seuen yeeres after the same rate, I wot well he would mislike his penny-worths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that prentiship were expired, and euer after looke on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens labours with a more fauorable eie. But for thee (curteous reader) at whose hands I doubt not to receaue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entertainement, I beg hartely of him which giueth euery good gift, that by reading &amp; meditating vpon this little trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tise, it will please him to worke in thy mind such a firme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of CONSTANCIE, as neither the violent flouds of common calamities may be able to wash away, nor the firie flame of priuate afflictions to consume the same: But that as a plant set in good ground, watred with the fruitfull streames flowing in <note n="(a)" place="marg1">I meane the Greeke and latin phrases.</note> goulden and siluer cesterns from the sweete fountaine of <hi>Lipsius,</hi> and conueighed to thee through these clayie conduite-pipes of my tempering, thou maist take deepe roote, and stand immoueable against all the blastes of fortune, neither terrified with feare of future mishappe, nor dismaied for any perilles present or past. Which victory though it seeme full of difficulty, yet if thou take vnto thee the armour and wepons here offered, hauing an indifferent courage of thine owne, thou shalt assuredly remaine a conquerour of those selfe affections, which do tirannize ouer the greatest tyrants, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their minds in more seruile subiection, then they do the bodies of their vilest captiues. Farewell. From the castle of Saint Donatts the xxiiii day of August. 1594.</p>
