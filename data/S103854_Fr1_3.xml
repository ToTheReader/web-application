   <p>MAy I craue pardon at this instant, aswell for enditinge, that is vnwoorthy to be published, as for publishing, that was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be endi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed: I wil hereafter take precise order, either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to importune you more, or to sollicite you for more especiall cause. I was first exceeding loath to penne, that is written: albcit in mine owne enforced defence, (for I make no difference betwene my decrest frendes, and my selfe:) and am now much loather to diuulge, that is imprinted: albeit against those, whose owne Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flets are readier to condemne them, then my Letters forwarde to accuse them. Vile actes would in some respectes, rather be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then recorded: as the darkenesse of the Night better sitteth the nature of some vnlucky birdes, then the brightnesse of the day: and <hi>Herostiatus</hi> in a villanous brauery, affectinge a most-noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, &amp; monstrous Fame, was in the censure of the wisest Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, rather to be ouerwhelmed in the deepest pitt of Obliuion, then to enioy any relique, or shadow of his owne desperate glory. But <hi>Greene</hi> (although pitifully blasted, &amp; how woefully faded?) still flourisheth in the memory of some greene wits, wedded to the wantonnesse of their owne fancy, and inamored vppon euery new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled toy: and <hi>Pierce Pennylesse</hi> (although the Diuels Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour by profession, and his Dammes Poet by practise) in such a flush of notable good fellowes, cannot possibly want many to reade him: enough to excuse him: a few to commende him: soome to beleue him; or to credite any, that tickeleth the right veine, and feedeth the riotous humour of their licentious vanity. To stop the beginning, is no bad purpose: wher the end may proue pernitious, or perillous. Venome is venome, and will infect: when the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons Head spitteth poison, what mischiefe may lurke in the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons Taile? If any distresse be miserable, diffamation is intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
<pb facs="3"/>
especially to mindes, that would rather deserue iust commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, then be any way blemished with vniust slaunder. They that vse to speake well of other: and endeuour to doe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ll them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: (the defectes of dishability are not to be imputed to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour) would be sory to heare amisse, without cause of complaint, or suspition: and he that like a Lacedemonian, or Romane, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Infamy worse then death, would be loath to emproue his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or to employ his patience, in digestinge the pestilent Bane of his life. That is doone, cannot <hi>de facto</hi> be vndone: but I appeale to Wisedome, how discreetely; and to Iustice, how deseruedly it is done: and request the one, to do vs reason, in shame of Impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: and beseech the other to do vs right, in reproach of Calumny. It was my intention, so to demeane my selfe in the whole, and so to temper my stile in euery part: that I might neither seme blinde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

Which if I haue altogether attained, without the least ouersight of distempered phrase, I am the gladder: if failed in some few incident termes, (what Tounge, or Pen may not slipp in heat of discourse?) I hope, a little will not greatly breake the square, either of my good meaning with humanity, or of your good acceptation with indifferency. Fauour, is a courteous Reader, &amp; a gratious Patron: and no man loueth fauour, wher it is to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; or honoureth it, where it is to be honoured, more affectionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then I: yet here I neither desire fauour toward louingest frend: nor wish disfauour toward spitefullest foe: but onely request reason toward both: and so briefly recommend both to your foresaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency: as to an equall ballance of vpright Iudgement.</p>
