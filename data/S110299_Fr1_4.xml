Mistow, Gentleman: one of

      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER THAT I HAD</hi>
(worshipfull Sir) taken
some payne, in collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
certayne hydden
Secretes together, &amp; reduced them
into one libel, or Pamphlet (for my
own behoofe, &amp; my familiar frēds:)
yet at the instance of a certayne
Gentlewoman (being my dere and
speciall frende) I was constrained
to publish the same, and considered
wich my selfe the saying of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wise:
which is. That good is best, which to
all indifferētly, is of like goodnes, or effect:
or which without respect of person, is good
to all indifferently. The consideration
<pb facs="3"/>
of which, and her importunacie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gethers
instiged me to cōmunicate
vnto the view &amp; publique benefite
of all men, this lytell Booke: The
coments wherof, doth instruct and
teach all maner of persones &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to know perfectly, the maner
to make diuers &amp; sundrie sortes of
fine Conceits aswell of meates, as
of Cōserues &amp; Marmalades, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
of sweete and pleasant Waters,
of wonderfull Odours, Operation
and Vertues: With diuers other
things that haue not hitherto ben
publiquely knowen: which fact of
myne (I know) wyll be, not onelye
dessyked of some, but altogether cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned:
Not for that it is euyll,
but that their fine heades can not
disgest, that any other beside them
selues shuld enioy the benefit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
hauing for their <hi>MAXIME,</hi> that
such thynges, are of small price, as
are common to al men: much after
<pb facs="3"/>
our Englysh Prouerbs, Quainty and
daintie: Farre fette and deare bought, is
good for great Estates. But I account
that Persone foolysh, and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
helpe of any Phisition or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
that wyll refuse to receyue,
or gayne health by the Medicine of
any suche Physition or Surgion:
Who by learnynge the same out of
<hi>A VICENE, GALENE,</hi> or <hi>HIPOCRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TES,</hi>
or any others suche lyke, hath
often tymes cured the Deseuses in
sundrie and many Persones, for
that the same hath ben commonly
vsed: but rather moste wyllynglye
and courteouslye to imbrace the
same (for present remedye) as a
thyng excellently well experymen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and prooued: I neede not (right
Worshypfull) to vse these wordes,
for the Defence of this litle Boke,

the trauayle of suche, who
