      <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>you haue heer a few principles of mine art, which as franckly I impart vnto you, as the heauens freely bestowed them vpon my selfe: I cal it mine, because it was borne with me, nor euer vsed I the benefit of any instructor saue mine owne prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise and experience. <hi>I</hi> haue (it is true) bestowed many idle howers in it, which perhaps might haue beene worse spent, yet in my iudgment I was neuer so wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto it, as to hold it any part of my profession, but rather allotted it the place <hi>inter splendidas nugas,</hi> and those things of accomplement required in a Scholler or Gentleman. I speak not any whit to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace so worthy a skill, or to discommend the true &amp; necessarie vse therof, but to giue my scholler a watch word, that like a simple wooer hee should neuer cast off the mistres to court the maid: but esteem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a great deale better graced by propounding at the table <hi>aliquid cedro dignum,</hi> (as K. <hi>Alphonsus</hi> was merily wont to say,) or maintaining an argument in Philosophy or diuinity, thē by intimating his skil with the pencil, or insight in the Chords of musick, which perhaps he that holds a trencher at his back cā excel
<pb facs="4"/>
him in <hi>Q. Fabius</hi> could paint, yet hee was a greate <note place="margin">Fidibus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisse dicitur. Tuse. Q. li. <hi>1</hi>
      </note> counsellor. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> could playe or sing excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to the Harpe or violls, but <hi>Iustine</hi> to his true glory addeth, that he was a man endued with such learning, and so great experience in military affairs, that it was a wonder how he could attaine to so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute an heigth in both: in whom alone, and at once <note place="margin">Xenoph. lib. vlt. Rer. graec.</note> sprang vp and died the glory of the Thebanes, <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> being aboue three score yeeres of age, spent one howr in a day with <hi>Conus</hi> a musitian in playing vpon the organes: Ifhe had spent aboue, I thinke we had not known him by the name of <hi>Philosophorum parens:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Politic. <hi>8.</hi>
      </note> And whereas <hi>Aristotle</hi> deseigning 4 principall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, wherein hee would haue all children in a well tuned city or commonwealth brought vp &amp; taught, (which are <hi>Grammatice,</hi> or Grammer: Gymnastice or exercising the body by wrestling, running, swimming tossing the pike, &amp;c. Graphice, or well handling the pen in drawing, writing faire, &amp;c: and lastly <hi>Musice</hi> or Musick) his meaning is, <hi>vt adseriamagis studia capessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da idonei reddantur:</hi> the same vse and none other I wish to be made of drawing.</p>
   <p>Concerning these directions I haue giuen, they are such as I thought in respect of their breuity &amp; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, fit for the capacity of the young learner, for whom they were first and principally intended: they are mine owne, not borrowed out of the shops, but the very same, Nature acquainted mee withall; and such as euer in practise I found most easie and true. I may perhaps be snarled at by some obscure fellows that affect their own priuate gaine before a generall commodity: but if (Reader) thou shalt find any thing
<pb facs="4"/>
herein worthy thy practise or liking, I care not what the other say; the worst hurt they can doe me, is to draw my picture ilfauoredly, and sell it: And perhaps <note place="margin">Plin. lib. <hi>36.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi>
      </note> I could requite them againe as <hi>Hipponax</hi> the Satirist did, who wrote so bitterly against certaine painters that sold his picture vp and down in a mockery to be laughed at (because he was hardfauoured,) that many ofthem for griefe hanged themselues. I had purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to haue annexed hereunto a discours of Armory: the manner of painting with virgin wax, and with feathers, not altogether impertinent to our purpose; but I haue reserued it (being a while imploied in som important businesse) till some other time, entreating thee in the meane while, to take vvhat I haue begun as affectionately as I offer it.</p>
   <signed>The most assured friend to all that loue or learne this art of drawing or painting. <hi>H. Pecham.</hi>
