   <head>The Proeme of the Authour.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y meaning was, at such time as I determined to write the Actions of the <hi>Florentine</hi> people, both within and without the Citie, to begin my Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the yeare of the Christian Religion, <hi>1444.</hi> at which time the house of <hi>Medici</hi> through the merits of <hi>Cosimo</hi> and <hi>Giouanni</hi> his father, aspired to more reputation then any other in <hi>Florence.</hi> For I thought that <hi>Leonardo</hi> of <hi>Arezzo</hi> and <hi>Poggio</hi> (two excellent Historiographers) had particulerly set downe all things that till those dayes had hapned. But hauing afterwards diligently read their writings, to see with what order and meanes they proceeded (to the end that following the same, our Historie might be by the Readers better allowed) I found that in their description of the warres made by the <hi>Florentines,</hi> both against Princes and other forraine States, they had vsed exceeding great diligence: but of the ciuill discords and inward enimities, &amp; of the effects by them brought forth, they had vtterly omitted one part, &amp; so brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie described the other, as the Readers could not thereby gather any profit or pleasure at all: which I thinke they did either because they iudged those matters so meane as were not worthie the writing, or else, feared to offend the posteritie of some persons who should thereby haue bene euill reported. VVhich two respects (be it spoken without offence) seeme to me, vtterly vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie men of great reputation. For if there be any thing in Histories that delighteth or teacheth, it is that, which maketh particuler description. Or if any reading be profitable for men that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne in Common-weales, it is that, which sheweth the occasions of hate and faction: to the end that being warned by harme of others, they may become wise, and continue themselues vnited. Also if euery example of Common-weales do moue the mind, those we read of our Country doo moue most, and be most profitable. Moreouer, if the diuisions of any Common-weale haue euer bene notable, the diuisions of <hi>Florence</hi> are of all others most notable. For the most part of other Common-weales (to vs knowne) were content with one onely diuision, ond thereby, according to the accidents sometimes encreased, and sometimes ruined their Cities. But <hi>Florence</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with one, had many diuisions. In <hi>Rome</hi> (as euery man knoweth) after the Kings were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed, diuision grew betweene the nobilitie and the multitude: which continued till the ruine thereof: the like hapned in <hi>Athens,</hi> and all other Common-weales which in those dayes flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. But in <hi>Florence,</hi> first the noble men became diuided among themselues. Then the nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and the people. And at last the people and the multitude. Yea many times it hapned, that one of these being victorious, diuided it selfe into two. Of which diuisions, followed so many mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so many banishments, and so many subuersions of Families, as neuer chaunced within any Citie, that can be remembred. And surely it seemeth to mee, there is nothing that witnesseth so well the greatnes of our Citie, as that which dependeth vpon these diuisions, being of force suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to subuert any Citie of what greatnes or power so euer. Notwithstanding our state still encreased. For so great was the vertue of those Citizens, by their wisedome and courage to work the aduancement of themselues and their country, as they that hapned to escape so manifold mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, could by their vertue procure more encrease to the Citie, then the displeasure of those ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which wrought the decaie, could decrease it. And withouc all doubc, if <hi>Florence</hi> had bin so happie, as it might vpon the deliuery thereof from the Empire, haue taken some forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, which would haue holden the state vnited, I know not what Common-weale either
<pb facs="4"/>
auncient or moderne, that for vertue of Armes and industrie, before it could haue bene prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For most true it is, that after the <hi>Ghibilini</hi> were banished in so great numbers that all <hi>Toscana</hi> and <hi>Lombardy</hi> was full of them, the <hi>Guelfi</hi> with the rest that remayned at the warre against <hi>Arezzo</hi> one yeare before the iourney of <hi>Compaldino,</hi> drew out of their owne Cittie of Cittizens onely <hi>1200.</hi> men of Armes, and <hi>12000.</hi> footmen. After that time, in the warre against <hi>Filippo Visconti</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> hauing rather to proue industrie, then their owne proper Armes (for at that time they were decayed) we see in fiue yeares, which that warre continued, the <hi>Florentines</hi> spent three Milions and fiue hundreth thousand Florins. And that warre being ended (as not pleased with peace) to shew more of their greatnesse, they besieged the Cittie of <hi>Lucca.</hi> I cannot therefore conceiue any cause why these diuisions should not be particulerly written. And if those notable writers before named, were withholden by feare, to offend the posteritie of such as they should haue made mention of, they greatly deceiued themselues, and seeme to know little the ambition of men, with the desire they haue to make the names of their Ancestors and themselues to continue perpetuall. Neyther do they remember, that many men wanting occasion to win themselues fame, by some laudable deede, by some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious acte, haue laboured to aspire thereunto. And they considered not, that the actions of men which haue in them greatnesse, as gouernments and authorities, howsoeuer they be handled, or what end soeuer they haue, do seeme alwayes to giue men more honor then blame. VVhich I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thought vpon, did determine to change my meaning, and resolued to begin my Historie at the beginning of our Cittie. And sith my intent is not to vsurp the place of others, I will parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly set downe what chanced onely within the Cittie till the yeare <hi>1334.</hi> and of such things as hapned without, I will not say more then that, which for the vnderstanding of the other shall be necessarie. The yeare <hi>1434.</hi> being passed, I will particulerly write the one and the other. Moreouer, to the end this Historie may be the better vnderstood, before I intreate of <hi>Florence,</hi> I shall discourse by what meanes <hi>Italy</hi> became subiect to such Potentates as in those dayes there gouerned. The first Booke shall briefly recite all accidents hapned in <hi>Italy</hi> from the declination of the <hi>Romayne</hi> Empire, till the yeare <hi>1434.</hi> The second will shew what things hapned from the beginning of <hi>Florence,</hi> till the warre which the <hi>Florentines</hi> made against the Pope, after expulcion of the Duke of <hi>Athene.</hi> The third doth end with the death of King <hi>Ladislao</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> Anno <hi>1434.</hi> In the fourth Booke we wil intreate what other things chanced till the yeare abouesaid. And from thencefoorth discourse particulerly of such accidents as befell within <hi>Florence,</hi> till this our time.</p>
