   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN Reader zelous of truth, and desirous of Saluation: A. P. wisheth the knowledge of the one in this life, and the fruition of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the life to come.</head>
   <p>IPRESENT thee heere (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) the auncient french Father <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius Lirinensis,</hi> attired after the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish cutt: a booke as learned as litle, and no lesse profitable, then pleasant: of smalle volume, if thou respect the quantitie, but of rare prise if thon con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sider the qualitie. It intreateth not of gathering &amp; scraping togither the pelf of this world, which choaketh vp the <note place="margin">
         <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. V. 22 <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. V. 24</note> heauenly seed of Gods word, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth man in a dangerous state, if we cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dite him who being rich, for our sake became poore: it disputeth not of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and gallant attire, nor of the art
<pb facs="3"/> of pampering this corruptible carcase which brought that braue belligod, of <note place="margin">Luc. 16</note> whome we read in the Gospell, to the furious flames and endlesse tormentes of Hell fire: it prosecuteth not wicked and wanton discourses, which corrupt good manners, being in very deed the bellowes to kindle the coles of carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, the nources of vnchaste thoughts, and the very baite with which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill doth daily angle and catch the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate soules of mortall men. But it handleth that which redoūdeth to the benefite of our soule, created to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, and sheweth vs the way how we may so gouerne this fraile ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of ours, in the tempestious Sea of this wicked world, that at last we may safely arriue at the porte and harbour of celestiall felicitie. For if the first step to Heauen is to beleeue aright, and the foundation and ground of all saluation be faith, as I thinke no man can doubt, that beleeueth that there is any God or truth at all, then can not this golden treatise but be acceptable to all such as loue Iesus Christ, and tender the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="3"/> of their owne soules, beeing as it were the heauenlye piller of fire that <note place="margin">Exod. 13</note> may guide vs through the deserte of this world, vnto the land of promise, and the glittering starre to leade vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Mat. 2</note> the new borne King of the Iewes &amp; Sauiour of mankind. But to the end that thou maist more plainly &amp; particulerly view the excellencie &amp; great necessitie of this rare booke, and as it were with Moises from the toppe of Mount <hi>Nebo</hi>
      <note place="margin">Deut. 34.</note> contemplate the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with milke &amp; honie. I will briefly set downe such motiues as inuited me to the labour of the translation, for the selfe same, as I verily thinke, cannot but inflame thee to the diligēt reading of the same. Three principall reasons then especiallye moued me. The first was, because it is very auncient, being written aboue an eleuē hundred yeres past, for it was composed three yeeres after the generall Councell of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as appeareth in the conclusion of the booke. And as the Author him selfe is of greate antiquitie so is his doctrine more auncient, beeing the selfe same
<pb facs="4"/> which florished in his time, and came from the Apostles of CHRIST: which thing as it was neuer of any good man doubted of, so is it also most apparant: First by sound reason grounded in gods word, because when any man writeth ought concerning faith and religion, and the same is not controld of any of that time, it is an euidēt argument, that it was consonant to the doctrine then generally taught and receaued, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise those Pastors and Doctors which God (as S. Paul saieth) <hi>hath giuen that we be not litle ones wauering and be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with euery blast of doctrine,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ephes. 4</note> could neuer haue held their peace, but would as the Prophete admonisheth <hi>Haue cried out, exalted their voice like</hi>
      <note place="margin">Esa. 58.</note>
      <hi>a trumpet,</hi> as we finde in like case, the licentious <hi>Nicholaits</hi> noted by S. Iohn for their false doctrine: <hi>Himineus</hi> and <note place="margin">Apoc. 2</note>
      <hi>Philetus</hi> reproued by S. PAVL for an error about the resurrection. Secondly <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.</note> because the author him selfe doth not only confesse the same, in setting down the answere of many excellent holy, &amp; learned men, which liued in his daies,
<pb facs="4"/> nor only because he acknoledgeth that what he hath here written, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued it from his auncestors, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, both which he doth in the very first entrance, and generally through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the wholle booke: but especially for that towardes the latter end he so highly cōmendeth the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> that is the Parlamēt of the world: which surely he neuer wold haue done, had he not ioined with thē in opinion, concerning faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and what their opinion was, him selfe recordeth, for he saith that those Fathers inspired by God decreed that nothing was to be beleeued, but that which the sacred antiquitie of our fore fathers agreeing togither in Christ, had holden and beleeued: Which surely is a notable argument, that what faith was by Christ planted, and his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples preached, was by them carefully kept and maintained: which thing is especially of vs English men to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted because the first foure generall Coū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cells, amongst which this of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is one, and the third in order, are worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="5"/> allowed by acte of Parlament. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore moued with such reasons, we may <note place="margin">Anno. 1. Elizabe.</note> without all scruple or doubt, not only read this booke but also imbrace and intertaine it, as the common doctrine of that time, as the religion practised &amp; reuerenced in the primatiue Church as the faith and beleefe of the <hi>Ephesin</hi> Councell and so consequently, as the true doctrine of Iesus Christ. Now thē seeing we liue in those daies in which so many new sectes and doctrines, such strange and monstrous opinions, such superstitious and new-fangled deuises flie vp and downe the world, and seing wee are fallen into the latter times in which <hi>Men shall heape vp to them selues masters according to their owne desires,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4</note>
      <hi>and shall not indure soūd doctrine, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert their eares frō truth &amp; be conuerted to fables.</hi> In which <hi>they shall loue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note>
      <hi>more then God, haue a shew of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, but yet denying the vertue therof,</hi> In which <hi>many scoffers shall come, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ep. Iud.</note>
      <hi>according to their owne desires, who deuide them selues, sensuall, not hauing the spirit.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>In which <hi>many false Christs, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny false Prophets shall arise and seduce</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 24</note>
      <hi>many.</hi> Very necessary it is, being thus fore-warned of God, that before all thinges we take great heed not to be peruerted, and seduced by erroneous teachers, or false Prophetes, but on the contrarie doe diligentlye preserue our faith, the light of our soules: the roote and foundation of all goodnes, &amp; with out <hi>which it is impossible to please God</hi> as S. PAVL saith. Wherin we can take no <note place="margin">Heb. 11</note> better course, no way more surer then to repaire to the time of the primatiue Church, when the blood of Christ was yet fresh bleeding in mens harts, when the Gospell was instātly preached, firm<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly beleeued, sincerely practised, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by miracles, established by the death of so many thousands of Martirs especially being exhorted hereunto by the holy scriptures, for as by thē we are admonished of the daungers and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the latter daies, so are we for a preseruatiue against them, sent to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times to conduct vs to gods true religion. <hi>Stand</hi> (saith the Prophet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie <note place="margin">Cap. 6.</note>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>vpon the way and inquire of the auncient pathes, which is a good way and walke in that and you shall finde rest for your selues.</hi> Salomon likewise in his pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerbes admonisheth vs in this sort. <hi>Do not passe the auncient boundes which thy</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cap. 22.</note>
      <hi>Fathers haue set downe.</hi> And in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticus. <hi>Do not set light by the report of thy elders for they haue learned of the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cap. 8.</note>
      <hi>forefathers, because of them shalt thou learne vnderstanding, and in the time of necessitie shalt thou giue answere.</hi> To the end therfore (gentle Reader) that thou be not caried away with the sweet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions of those licentious masters, with which the latter times, according to the predictiō of the Apostles, should be much pestered, nor seduced with the erroneous doctrine of those false Prophetes, and false Christes, of which the sonne of God, the true Prophet &amp; true Christ, hath forewarned vs. And that thou maist find out a good way to walke in, and keepe thee within the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient boundes, set downe by our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and by their report learne wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and vnderstanding: I am to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
<pb facs="6"/> thee to vouchsafe the reading of this olde Father newly translated, and I nothing doubt but thou wilt geue that censure which Queene <hi>Saba</hi> gaue of <note place="margin">3. Reg. 10.</note> the wisdome of <hi>Salomon.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The second reason which set me for ward was, for that I finde this booke, not written against some one or a few perticuler false teachers (as <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> and diuers auncient learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors did against the <hi>Arians, Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and such like) but against any he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie or erroneous doctrine whatsoeuer which is a thing of so great importāce, as I knowe not what can be deuised more. What golde were to much, or what treasures to deare for that medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine which had vertue to cure all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases? False doctrine and heresie is a greate soare, a canker more pestilent then any corporall infirmitie whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, seing this worketh only the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall distruction of our carcase: but that causeth death both of bodie and soule euerlasting. In other bookes we find the cōfutatiō of some speciall fase point of doctrine, in many the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb facs="7"/> of diuerse, but to destroy all at one blow, and those each so contrary to them selues, so distinct for time, so diuerse for place, so many for number, is a propertie peculiar only to this most excellent treatise, and therfore it may fitly be compared to that miraculous pond, wherof we read in the Gospell, <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ioan.</hi> 5</note> which cured all diseases: for as that wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter moued by the Angell cured what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer infirmity of him that first entred in: so this booke writtē no dout by the motion of the holy Ghost, hath force to cure any such as is corrupted with erroneous doctrine, or to preserue him from all infection, if he voutsafe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, that is to read it to ponder it, and to waigh diligently what is said an dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of. The reason why this booke hath this rare qualitie, in my opinion is, because it sheweth the right way of expownding Gods diuine scripture, in which so many to the great daunger of mens soules, doe so greatly go a stray: and therfore as <hi>Dauid</hi> ouerthrowing <hi>Golias</hi> the cheefe chāpion of the camp, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 17.</note> put all the <hi>Philistians</hi> to flight, so no
<pb facs="7"/> maruell though this auncient Author discouering the false expositions and gloses of sacred scripture, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall piller of all poisoned doctrine ouer throweth also all wicked heresie.</p>
   <p>The third and last motiue which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged me to this labour, and ought partly to moue thee to the reading, is the breuitie of the worke, the finenes of the methode, the eloquence of the stile: and therfore if long and large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes do litle please, this is short which can not cause dislike, if confusion be ingratfull, a methodicall order can not but like thee, if a stile harsh and course fitteth not thy taste, then I truste that which is fine, pleasant &amp; delicate will content thy humor. Only I am to craue pardon that my rough &amp; rude English, nothing aunswereth his smoothe and curious latin, and therfore I could wish thee, if skill serueth, rather to cōmon and parle with the Author him selfe, then to vse the helpe of his rude inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretor, otherwise for such as be not of so deepe reading, for whom especially I haue taken this paine, I am to desire
<pb facs="8"/> that they nothing dislike the soueraign medicine for the wodden box, nor the exquisit and rare gemme for the course casket.</p>
   <p>These be the reasons (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) which especially moued me to the translating of this aunciēt and learned Father: I beseech thee as thou tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest the saluation of thine owne soule, that thou wouldest voutsafe to reade him attentiuely, in whom thou shalte see cleerelye as in a glasse the faith of our forefathers, the religion of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue Church, and in him thou shalt finde by Gods word and authoritie of sacred scripture, the madnes of all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes crushed in peeces, and that in a short methodicall, and eloquēt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise. The holy Ghost which moued no doubt this auncient learned Father to the writing of this worke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline &amp; moue thy hart to the diligent reading and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere folowing of the same.</p>
