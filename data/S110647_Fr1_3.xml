   <head>TO THE CANDID AND INGENVOVS READER.</head>
   <p>LOoke not generous Reader (for such I write to) for more in the few following leaues, then a plaine and simple verity; vnadorned at all with eloquution, or Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call phrase; glosses fitter perhaps to be set vpon silken and thinne paradoxicall semblances, then appertaining to the care of who desires to lay downe a naked &amp; vnmasked Trueth. Nor expect heere an Encomium or praise of any such thing as the world ordinarily takes Poësy for; That same thing beeing (as I conceiue) a superficiall meere outside of Sence, or gaye barke only (without the body) of Reason; Witnesse so many excellent witts that haue taken so much paines in these times to defend her; which sure they would not haue done, if what is generally receiued now a dayes for Poë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, were not meerely a faculty, or occupation of so little consequence, as by the louers thereof ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be (in their owne fauour) excused, then for any good in the thing it selfe, to be commended. Nor must thou heere expect thy solution, if thy curiosity inuite thee to a satisfaction in any the vnder-Accidents, but in meerely the Essentiall Forme, of true Poësy: Such I call the Accidents or appendixes thereto, as conduce somewhat to the Matter, and End, nothing to the reall Forme
<pb facs="4"/>
and Essence thereof. And these accidents (as I call them) our commenders &amp; defenders of Poësy haue chiefely, and indeed sufficiently insisted, and dilated vpon; and are first, those floures (as they are called) of Rhetorick, consisting of their <hi>Anaphoras, Epist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>ophes, Metaphors, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymyes, Synecdoches</hi> and those their other potent Tropes and Figures; helpes, (if at all of vse to furnish out expressions with,) much properer sure, and more fitly belonging to Poesy then Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; yet such helpes, as if Nature haue not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand in his byrth, giuen a Poët, all such forced Art will come behind as lame to the businesse, and deficient, as the best-taught countrey Morris d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>uncer with all his bells and napkins, will ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue to be in an Inne of Courte at Christmas, tearmed the thing they call a fine reueller. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accidents of Poesy, and that are the greater part of the appurtenances thereof, in the accoumpt of our Poëts of these times, are also heere vtterly vnmencioned, such as are, what sort of Poëme may admit the blanke verse, what requires exacte rime; where the strong line (as they call it) where the gentle, sortes best; what subject must haue the verse of so many feete, what of other; where the masculine rime, where the feminine, and where the threesillabled (which the Italians call their <hi>rime sdrucciole)</hi> are to be vsed. These (I say) and the like Adjuncts of Poësy, (elsewhere amply discoursed of by many curious witts) are
<pb facs="4"/>
not heere mencioned. Only what I conceiued fit to speake (and with what breuity I could) of the Auncient Poëts in generall, and of the Forme and reall Essence of true Poësy, considered meerely in it owne worth and validity, without extrinsick and suppeditatiue ornament at all, together with the paralell of their foyle (our Moderne Poëts and Poësyes,) I haue, (to the end to redeeme in some parte, and vindicate that excellent Art from the iniury it suffers in the worlds generall misprizion and misconstruction thereof,) heere touched, and but touched; the rather to awake some abler vnderstanding then my owne, to the pursute (if they please) of a theame (I conceiue) well worthy a greater industry, and happyer lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures then I my selfe possesse.</p>
