ouer Asia minor, and a good part of Europe, was taken by certaine pirates, and presented vnto pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth: vnder whom he translated into Italian all those things which with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible studie and diligence he had written in the Arabick toong, concerning Africa, the manners, lawes, and customes of the African people, and the situation and true description of the whole countrey. Their militarie discipline he lightly passeth ouer: and briefly mentioneth the conflicts and victories of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous warrious, without any orations or ornaments of speech, rather like a Geographer then a Chronicler: and with a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall delight of new and strange things, he doth (as it were) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force detaine his Reader, &amp;c.
