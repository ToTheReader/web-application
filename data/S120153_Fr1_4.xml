   <p>I haue intitled it▪ A MIRROR FOR THE MVLTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVDE, for that as in a glasse all men may see and beholde the common course of the most parte, alienate from the<note place="margin">Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are the least number</note> truth of Christian religion: And the lesser number to bee the true seruants of the liuing God. For notwithstanding the common censure of the worlde, doth rashly attribute greatest assurance, of hauing the truth, in respect of many<note place="margin">Gods trueth contrary to the mindes of the multitud</note> heads, and generall consents of countryes and kingdoms, and doe yeeld greatest likelihood of safty vnto the might of manye adherentes: It fareth not so with Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal truth▪ which hee reuevleth vnto babes and sucklinges, and hideth it from the wise of the world, &amp; who plucketh<note place="margin">A flight of sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>than.</note> downe the mightie and proude, and exalteth the humble and meeke. And therefore is it a deceite of Sathan to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure men to consent vnto the multitude, to be sure of the truth, and to trust in the mightie showes of multitudes to be preserued from the foyle. It is not the horse that saueth a man in the battayle, but the mightie hand of God. God is not tyde to the force of man, but the puysaunce of the<note place="margin">A daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing to follow the multitude.</note> mightiest multitude, vnder the power of the inuincible God. And therefore a daungerous thing to followe the multitude. For many are called, but fewe are chosen, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are inuited to the heauenly sweete banquet of the true knowledge, and exercise of the sincere religion of God,<note place="margin">The way to true religion bodely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</note> but fewe there bee that frame their willes, and powers to performe it in deede. And why? onely for that they finde the way thereunto, rough, burdensome, and bodily dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and therefore start aside like broken bowes, and retire like dastardly souldiers, and attain not vnto the end of the race that leadeth vnto life, but take the broad, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and easie way, that trayneth vnto errors &amp; feyned ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, &amp; consequently vnto death. It is a painefull, hard, and tedious thing to fleshe and bloud, to forsake worldly<note place="margin">The flesh is weake and vnable to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> vanities, and pleasing thinges of the worlde, to followe Christ, for that in flesh there is no goodnesse, pronenesse or readinesse to do well, to denie and suppresse our owne naturall affections, and as it were to kill our owne selues in true mortification, to the ende the more freely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

The Apostle sayth for thy sake are<note place="margin">Ro. 8. 36.</note> we killed all the daye long, agreeing with the wordes of the Prophet, who likewise sayth, that for the loue and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull<note place="margin">Psal. 44. 22.</note> affection the godly bare vnto God, for his sake, they are slaine contitually: namely suffer the wicked to rage<note place="margin">The godly are for gods sake killed continuallye</note> against them, to rayle at them, to persecute them, and punish them: wherein, being led by the spirite of God in perfect holinesse, they take it not onely patiently, but to their vnspeakeable cōfort, for that they are thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to suffer such reproch, for the testimonie of their true and verie Christian profession, when they are carried as<note place="margin">The comfort of Christians in their cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> sheepe to the slaughter, for their faith in Christ, and not as wicked doers, traytors, rebels, murtherers, &amp; bloud thirsty men, for <hi>Blessed are they that suffer persecution for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse sake, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen.</hi> But if any man<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 10. 1.

And yet such is the blindnes of our late conspirators, that they are perswaded their rebellions, their treasons, murthers, and all their bloudie practises, not onely lawfull, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, only by the dispensation which they haue, from the vicegerent of Satan, who presumeth to make the word of God in this behalfe (namely that <hi>no murtherer or wicked person shall enter into the kingdome of heauen</hi>) of none effect, and not only tollerateth murther &amp; other the most intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable euils, but warranteth the actors thereof, not only<note place="margin">The miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of euill doers.

   <p>And howsoeuer these foolish and more then mad mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Romish confederacy, flatter themselues, who haue vowed the ouerthrow of the true religiō of Christ by<note place="margin">The vain hope of tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</note> taking away the chiefest props thereof, in hope (for their rewarde) some to sit at the right, some at the left hande of Christ in his kingdome, as the false father of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, the proude Pope, hath flatteringly perswaded thē: let thē assure thēselues, that if the word of God be true, then shall not such as suffer for euill dooing, nor such as haue their consciences feared with the hot iron of consent vnto such like conspiracies, enter into the kingdom of heauen, nor haue their portion in the presence of Christ, neither sit at his right or left hand, in his kingdome: no, they shal not haue the priueledge of enioying the light of his coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, the bright beams of his glory shal not extend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them, to their comfort in the laste day, but meere<note place="margin">Their assured revvard that seeke the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe of the godly.</note> horror, anguish, torment, and the worme, which is the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of their guilty cōsciences, shalbe their portion to drink for euermore, and the great deceyuer himselfe whō Sathan hath deceyued, shall haue his hire with them in vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkenes, where shalbe weeping &amp; gnashing of teeth.</p>
   <p>And therfore (good Reader) take heed that the sufferings<note place="margin">Wee muste take heed of the causes of sufferings.

euen he that dwelleth in the Cherubyns: who hath suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declared his power in <hi>Sion,</hi> wherunto all these proud boasting, murtherous, and bloudthirstie men (nill they will they) shal be for euermore subiect, and shal not passe<note place="margin">The wicked are tyed within the limits of gods povver</note> those lymits, to touch her highnesse, her crowne and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie▪ her Magistrats, and common weal, which he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie determined for our good: and therefore neede we the lesse to feare, what they can doe vnto vs: but rather let vs trust vpon the assured protection, of our mightie and most mercifull God, and magnifie his name, most terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his enemies: It is holy, they corrupt, all honor is due vnto it, and eternall plagues are due to them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say, we neede not to seeke any succour besides him, who (no doubt) will sharply punish all those rebellious multitudes, of whom and by whose meanes, we are vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endaungered.

And seeing we see the goodnes of our God, so farre extended to our continuall comfort: let vs prayse him, let vs in holinesse and righteousnesse, fall downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his footestoole, and truely worship him, for he is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">1.
