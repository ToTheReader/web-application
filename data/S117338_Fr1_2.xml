      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Comedy in the title, is a part of your Lordships
Command, which heretofore grac'd, and made happy
by your smile, when it was presented, after a long
silence, upon first opening of the Parke, is come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to kisse your Lordships hand. The Applause it
once receiv'd in the action, is not considerable with
that honour, your Lordship may give it in your acceptance; that was
too large, and might with some narrow and Stoicall judgement
render it suspected: But this, depending upon your censure, (to me
above many Theaters) is able to impart a merit to the Poem, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
opinion. If your Lordship, retir'd from businesse into a calme,
and at truce with those high affaires, wherein your Counsell and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is fortunately active, vouchsafe to peruse these unworthy papers.
You not Onely give a life to the otherwise languishing numbers, but
quicken, and exalt the Genius of the Author, whose heart pointeth at
no greater ambition, than to be knowne</p>
