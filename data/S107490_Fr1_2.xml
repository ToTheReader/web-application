      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in drawing these and former lines I haue had no other aspect or aime, saue onely to discover the by-paths which lead vnto error, and to presse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="3"/>
by a cleare way towards the truth: so in publishing of them I haue taught them to look backwards not forwards, as being more desirous to testifie my thankful respect, either to the knowne Honourable Patrons of good Acts, or furtherers of my private studies, than to feede ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fancies with the humours of the time, by obtruding my selfe vpon the dispensers of great dignities or preferments. My resolution being thus set, I saue a labour in dedicating these papers to your <hi>Lordship,</hi> whose Honourable favours and munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence towards that famous Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie (whereof I haue long continued an vnworthy <hi>member,</hi> but to which I shall ever continue the loue and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of a faithfull <hi>Sonne</hi>) doe
<pb facs="3"/>
challenge a better testimony of my observance than I can now expresse, or hope hereafter to present your <hi>Lordship</hi> withall. But God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our famous Mother hath many sonnes a great deale more able than my selfe to vndergoe this service. Leaving it therefore vnto them, I shall giue my selfe abundant satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and contentment for my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours past, and take incouragement to continue the like, if it shall please your <hi>Lordship</hi> to accept these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as an vndoubted pledge of that thankfull respect and observance which I owe vnto your <hi>Lordship</hi> for your favours and bountie towards my selfe in particular, the memory of which hath beene more gratefull vnto me, in that I was made to feele
<pb facs="4"/>
them, before I was so much as known by sight vnto your <hi>Honour.</hi> Thus with my best prayers for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of your <hi>Lordships</hi> increase of honour and true happinesse, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly take my leaue, and rest</p>
