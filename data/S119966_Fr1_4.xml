   <head>To the beneuolent
Reader, and especially
to such as are afflicted
or vnder any kinde
of crosse or
trouble.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
comfort to a
Christian man,
then here to feele
Gods ready helpe
in his necessities, troubles, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions;
euery man by nature
desires it, yet fewe attaine vnto it,
for that they vse not the meanes,
which are <hi>faith, prayer,</hi> and <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:
faith</hi> to beleeue it, <hi>prayer</hi>
to obtaine it, &amp; <hi>patience,</hi> to wayte
for it.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Patience</hi> is a most especiall
vertue, the Mistres and guide as
it were of all the affections, and
<pb facs="11"/>
gouernour of the inward minde;
which being thereby well and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
setled, will restraine thee
from all extrauagant and vnruly
wayes: It will gently curbe all
thine vngodly desires; It will
with-hold thee from taking or
seeking rash reuenge of them that
doe thee iniurie: It will keepe
thee in equall temper, as well in
<hi>aduersity</hi> as in <hi>prosperity.</hi> And
thou canst not be truly reputed a
<hi>patient man,</hi> If thou shew thy
selfe discontent (as to murmure or
grudge) in any outward crosse or
inward affliction: Or if thou can
not suffer and passe by iniuries,
wrongs, rebukes, slaunders, and
abuses (without vndiscreete and
peeuish passions) with a stayed, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and patient minde, thou canst
not truly be accounted a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
valiant man.</p>
   <p>Yet true it is, that many thinke
it such a disgrace vnto them, to
put vp any small iniurie without
desperate and rash reuenge, as hee
<pb facs="11"/>
looseth thereby the reputation of
his valour; but (if it be dulie
considered▪) he is the most mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ous
man, that can best
keepe vnder, tame and rule his
owne passions: and he that is foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by his owne froward and heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
fury, discouereth greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie,
and sheweth himselfe
vnworthie to be called a morall
vertuous, much lesse a truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
man.</p>
   <p>True Religion is euermore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companed
with a vertuous &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
minde, which (if it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect)
hath euermore patience ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with it, as chiefest of all other
mentall vertues: and therefore, he
that in euery iniury, crosse or affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
grosly bewrayeth his impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
howsoeuer he may otherwise
seeme (not moued) he is neither
rightly religious, nor truely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</p>
   <p>No man indeed, can be truly
knowne to be a religious or a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
man, vnlesse hee meete
<pb facs="12"/>
with the contraries of both, and
therein shew his valour, constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and patience, in maintaining
the one, and shewing testimonies
of the other: for the man that is
carried away or shewes himselfe
newter, betweene true and false
Religion, or betweene vertue
and vice, hath neither Religion
nor vertue.</p>
   <p>Men are not knowne to be truly
vertuous but by tryall; for, as
there are certaine minerals, that
seeme to be the very mother of
gold or siluer, which being cast
into the fire, appeare onely sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous,
euaporate, and turne to
smoake; so is there a kind of
meeke and ciuile behauiour in
some men, that giueth a certaine
outward faire lustre, and show,
that it will beare the teste; but
when it is tryed by the fire of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
crosses, troubles, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
reproches and the like, it
will appeare a meere shadowe
without any true shew of that
<pb facs="12"/>
substantiall approued vertue.</p>
   <p>Who is not a vertuous and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
man before he be tryed?
and who is not a patient man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he be crost? there be many
seeming very valiant, stout and
strong men, not dismaid or daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at any perill, yet if but a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
take them, the goute possesse
them, sickenesse befall them, or
any affliction crosse them, they
will either shewe their impatience,
by murmuring or grudging,
hanging downe their heads like a
Bul-rush, or sigh and groane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the burthen, as if Maluerne
hils were fallen vpon them; and
this for want of patience.</p>
   <p>A rich man as long as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth
health, wealth and honour,
wished successe in all his affaires,
nothing crossing him; how can he
but be patient in shewe? But when
his wealth turneth into want, his
health into sickenesse, his honour
into disgrace; when aduerse suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
crosses his hopes, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="13"/>
seize vpon him (as hee is
a man without patience) he will
change his countenance, and by
his gesture and cariage, shewe
himselfe ashamed of the change of
his estate; fretting himselfe in
the gall of his bitter impatience,
as if God did him iniurie thus to
correct him: whence also ariseth
to the increase of his impatience,
diuersities of mens censures, as
they did of holy <hi>Iob. Surely,</hi>
(sayes one) <hi>he is a wicked man
that God doth thus punish
him:</hi> Another, <hi>Hee was very,
prodigall, hee was proude,
vaineglorious, ambitious,</hi> &amp; the
like; <hi>and therefore hath God
laid this heauie crosse vpon him:</hi>
as though they had liued in the
very bosome of the man, &amp; were
priuie to the very counsell of God,
in punishing or correcting him.</p>
   <p>In like manner doth the vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
multitude commonly censure
all men afflicted, be it by <hi>sorrow
for sinne, sickenesse,</hi> and some
<pb facs="13"/>
lingring disease, <hi>pouertie, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
banishment, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
shipwracke, losse of
goods,</hi> by whatsoeuer meanes,
<hi>stubbornnesse of children, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesse
betweene maried
couples;</hi> and in what sort soeuer a
man is afflicted and visited by
the hand of God (though in his
speciall loue) hee must looke for
censures, according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
cenceits and opinions of such
as seeme to knowe the very cause
of Gods punishing and correcting
men here belowe; and yet neither
looke into themselues, nor knowe
nor thinke of the cause of causes.</p>
   <p>Seeing then, that the best and
dearest children of God are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to afflictions, crosses and
troubles of infinite kindes, and
consequently to the rash censures
of the <hi>braine-sicke vulgar,</hi> haue
they not all good cause to flie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God for this heauen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y vertue
<hi>Patience,</hi> to support and sustaine
them, not onely in their proper
<pb facs="14"/>
crosses, but in the vniust scandals
of idle men?</p>
   <p>But iudge thou no man, hee
standeth or falleth, he is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or crossed according to the
good pleasure of God; and receiue
thou thy lot whatsoeuer it be, pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
or aduerse, as sent of God
for thy good.</p>
   <p>If he visit thee with sickenesse,
accept it as his fatherly chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to reforme thee before thou
goe hence, thereby summoning
thee shortly to appeare before the
Throne of his Maiestie.</p>
   <p>If thou become <hi>poore</hi> bereft
of all thy goods, and haue little
or nothing left, content thy selfe;
&amp; consider, thou hast yet more left
thee then thou broughtest into
the world with thee: and were
thou neuer so rich, hadst thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so great possessions, neuer so
high place of dignitie in the world;
thou must be taken from all, thou
must leaue all, and all must leaue
thee: and as thy life is short, so
<pb facs="14"/>
are thy pleasures, crosses and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of no long continuance.</p>
   <p>If thou be <hi>backe-bitten</hi> and
<hi>slaundered,</hi> thinke thy selfe no
better nor more worthy the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
of the world, then <hi>Christs
owne Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> him
selfe; who were scoffed at, railed
vpon, and scornefully reuiled,
yet reuiled not, but with patience
endured <hi>buffetings, stripes</hi> and
<hi>death,</hi> in greatest meekenes.</p>
   <p>If thou be <hi>banished</hi> thine
owne natiue Countrie, and from
thy dearest friends, inforced to
wander from Countrie to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
from Citie to Citie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>wee are all strangers
and pilgrims in this world,</hi> and
nothing better resembleth our
earthly pilgrimage then doth <hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi>
which may moue vs
to thinke seriously and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of a permanent Citie promised,
after our long and tedious exile,
which endureth but a little season,
and then wee returne, ariue, and
<pb facs="15"/>
shall be receiued into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of peace, and Citie of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
freedome.</p>
   <p>If thou be troubled with <hi>diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
and refractarie chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
haue patience, remember
<hi>Adam</hi> had a <hi>Kayne: Abraham</hi>
an <hi>Ismaël; Izaacke</hi> an <hi>Esaii:
Dauid</hi> an <hi>Absalon.</hi> It is the
case of many a godly and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
father to haue an vngodly
sonne.</p>
   <p>If thou be troubled with a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
proude, sullen, tarte</hi> and
<hi>taunting wife,</hi> be patient vnder
thine vnpleasant yoake; looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Scriptures, and thou shalt
finde many good and godly men to
haue gone before thee, that haue
shewed thee the way to beare this
erosse with patience; as <hi>Moses</hi>
his <hi>Zipporah: Dauid</hi> his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal,</hi>
and others: and if thou
looke neere at home, thou shalt
finde many of thy good neighbours
sicke of thy disease; and nothing
can ease it but <hi>patience, prayer,
<pb facs="15"/>
good counsell in the feare of
God.</hi> These are the salues for
euery sore, the phisicke for euery
disease, and Antidotes against
euery poysonous and pestilent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the minde.</p>
   <p>And for thy better help, I
haue (though indeed weakely)
in this Treatise, endeauoured
briefly to touch many of the cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that may befall thee; wherein
if thou be ignorant, thou maist
therein learne in some measure,
how to prepare thee to the patient
bearing of them, wayting the
Lords leisure and his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
with prayer, in a liuely
faith, in true repentance of
all thy sinnes, which are the
cause of all thy troubles, cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and calamities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer;
and thou shalt finde
the burthen of them light, and
the yoake which the Lord, layeth
vpon thee, easie.</p>
   <p>And be assured, that if God
correct thee here, he loueth thee,
<pb facs="16"/>
and doth it to reforme thee to
saue thee. <hi>Ieremie</hi> the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
amongst the <hi>Prophets,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
<hi>that before the Lord
touched him with affliction,
he was like a wilde and vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Colte:</hi> and <hi>Dauid, the
worthiest among the Kings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth,</hi>
that <hi>before he
was afflicted he went awrye:</hi>
And <hi>Paul the chiefe among the
Apostles,</hi> thought it his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
glory to suffer affliction for
Christ; and many they were that
he suffered, see 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</p>
   <p>Outward affliction, or inward
sorrow for thy sinnes hurt thee
not; the one argues the loue of
God towards thee, the other thy
desire to obay him. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more hurtfull to thee, nor
more offensiue to God then thine
impatience, thy murmuring and
grudging at Gods gentle chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which are the euils of
thy minde and most afflict thee:
whereas <hi>true patience in faith,
<pb facs="16"/>
is as a brasen Bulworke against
all the attemptes and assaults of
sinne and Satan;</hi> the workers of
all the crosses, troubles &amp; calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the world: Imbrace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatsoeuer befalleth thee
with godly patience; and
the Lord assist
thee.</p>
