   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue a Suite: Before you run through this <hi>Holy Fire,</hi> or giue my Booke the Peepers Censure, let me beseech you to take this Apologetick Preface in your way that neither I nor you bee wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb facs="7"/> or mistaken by occasion of some passages in this Treatise.</p>
   <p>I confesse I haue entred vpon a difficult Prouince in <hi>vndertaking</hi> this subiect, and aduentured almost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillar in <hi>prosecution</hi> of it. Others haue landed at the shore of this <hi>Terra del Fuego,</hi> and look't into it; but I haue Coasted it and made a rude Description of euery Part. If any please to make a new Suruey, and more exact dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery; <hi>It will be</hi> (as the Prouerbe saith) <hi>the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for vs all.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p>I looked when Gray-hair'd Pensil should haue drawne this Picture. But if other mens better Colours bee fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, I haue now brought a Fire to thaw them, in hope that wee may once see some exquisite Peece, from some Curious Limmer.</p>
   <p>This Worke is intended to <hi>suppresse turbulencie and all extremities;</hi> and yet to <hi>presse vnto Duty</hi> too.</p>
   <p>Wonder not to finde me somewhat hot: I worke at the <hi>Fire.</hi> To write of Courage like a Coward, and of <hi>Fire</hi> as if one were fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
<pb facs="8"/> deserues the Bastinado, and the <hi>Fire</hi> to boote. My spouting of <hi>Fire</hi> among the rude multitude, is but to make way for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
   <p>He that will part afray, must not thinke to doe it with his Cap in his hand, but with a sowre Club. And you know, if fire bee gotten vp into a Chymny; doe but shoote a Musket after it, and this will fetch it downe with a Powder.</p>
   <p>My sharpnesse against some <hi>Democraticall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Ceremonians,</hi> is not meant to weake Consciences
<pb facs="8"/> ioyned with pious, sober, peaceable courses. In some cases, (if I may bee bold to speake after the Apostle,) I know, that God would haue no man to bee iudged for his<note n="a" place="margin">

         </gap>. Rom. 14.1.</note> doubting; so it bee onely in smaller matters of opinion, wherein the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned differ without blame, or schisme.</p>
   <p>But I speake to such as keepe a frantick Coyle about Ceremonies, and thinke they neuer take their leuell right, but when, with euery <hi>bolt</hi> they shoot, they strike a Bishops Cap sheere off his head; and yet are more fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall,
<pb facs="9"/> ignorant, proud, selfe-will'd, negligent and deceitfull in their particular Callings then many whom they despise and condemne to Hell for <hi>Carnall men,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth; as any obseruing eye may easily discerne.</p>
   <p>If any condemne mee of indiscretion for writing so much of <hi>Discretion,</hi> and thinke me arrogant in this Attempt: know, that I am not yet so neere madnesse as to take the height of Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the <hi>Instrument</hi> of mine owne Braine. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>aue onely collected such scat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Rules as in the sacred
<pb facs="9"/> Scriptures, Venerable Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and mine owne obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, I haue met withall, and put them vpon one File together.</p>
   <p>Touching the carriage of Zeale towards <hi>Princes,</hi> my Conscience witnesseth with mee in the sight of God, that I haue spoken nothing but what in my iudgement, is the truth, without sinister or base intents.</p>
   <p>Nor doe I touch on that, presuming to teach my Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but rather (as men vse to doe when they go for <hi>Orders,</hi> or a Benifice,) to giue account. And yet I
<pb facs="10"/> would teach withall; I meane the boysterous Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude who euer preferre the rough Channell before the temperate shore, and thinke no man preaches well in a Prince his Court, but he that is so fiery and rude, (<hi>plaine,</hi> they call it) as with his thunder shakes the very House. And if hee cast no Squibs in a Princes face, or preach not like a Priuy Councellor, they say hee hath no <hi>Holy Fire</hi> in him.</p>
   <p>If men dislike a Booke in this Age, their Censure is vsually this; <hi>It hath no
<pb facs="10"/> Salt in it.</hi> A Discourse of this Nature, should haue Salt good store, <hi>for all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices must be seasoned with</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Mar. 9.49.</note>
      <hi>Salt:</hi> so is this; but intended to Season onely, not to fret any vnlesse by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
   <p>If any Graine chance to fall into a Chapt singer, the best way is, not to cry out; but to wash it out, and say nothing: and no harme done.</p>
   <p>A fire of this nature is at no time vnseasonable. With most men it is winter within doores, when it is Summer in the fields. Some
<pb facs="11"/> are so hard frozen that they had need be set neere a good fire to thawe them; and when they are thawed, to heate them.</p>
   <p>If any man therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach these flames, and complaines, they are too hot for the season, the remedie against scorching of his shinnes is easy. Hee neede not put the fire out; but onely sit, or stand fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, and all will be well.</p>
   <p>Thus haue you my Apology (if it bee one) as a small skreene to hold betweene you and the fire
<pb facs="11"/> if you thinke it too bigg, or too neere, and that it would heate you too much.</p>
