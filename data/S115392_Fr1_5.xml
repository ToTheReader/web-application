   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost men derive the Original of Phisicke from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for those who hold the best opinion of the Creation of the world, affirme, the Elements being created and separated each from other, man being not as yet made; incontinently by the divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, all herbes and plants with infinite variety of floures, endewed with various sents, tastes, colours and formes, grew and sprung forth of the bowells of the Earth, enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with so many and great vertues, that it may be thought a great offence to attribute to any other than the Deity, the benefit of so great a blessing so necessary for so many uses: Neither could Mans Capacity ever have attained to the knowledge of those things without the guidance of the divine power. For God the great Creator &amp; fashioner of the world, when first he inspired <hi>Adam</hi> by the breath of his mouth into a living and breathing man, he taught him the nature, the proper operations, faculties and vertues of all things contained in the circuit of this Vniverse. So that if there be any who would a scribe the glory of this invention to man, he is condemned of ingratitude even by the judgment of <hi>Pliny.</hi> But this knowledge was not buryed in oblivion with <hi>Adam:</hi> but by the same guift of God was given to those whom he had chosen and ordained for Phisicke, to put their helping hands to others that stood in need thereof. Which opinion was not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the common manner and by the tacite consent of al Nations, but confirmed by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Scripture: Which thing <hi>Iesus</hi> the sonne <note place="margin">Genes. 1. Ecclesiast. 38. 1.</note> of <hi>Sirach</hi> the wisest amongst the Iewes, hath confirmed saying; <hi>Honnor the Physition with the honnor due unto him, for the most High hath created him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of necessity: and of the Lord commeth the gift of healing. The Lord hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Medicines of the Earth and he that is wise will not abhorre them. Give place and honnor to the Phisition, for God hath created him, let him not goe from thee, for thou hast need of him.</hi> The <hi>Graecians</hi> who first seeme more fully and with greater fame to have professed the Arte of Phisicke, doe in a manner consent with this opinion, in acknowledging <hi>Apollo</hi> to have beene the Inventor thereof, neither did they it without a reasonable cause. For whether by <hi>Apollo</hi> they may understand the Sun who by its gentle and vitall heat doth bring forth, temper and cherish all things; or els some <hi>Heros,</hi> who incited by an excellent and almost divine vnderstanding
<pb facs="6"/>
first taught and put in practise the Medicinall vertues of Herbs; in which sense <hi>Ovid</hi> brings him in speaking thus:
<q>
         <l>Herbs are of mine invention, and through all</l>
         <l>The world, they me the first Phisitian call.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>The originall of Phisicke arising from those beginnings shall alwayes be celebrated, as celestiall, and was increased principally after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. After <hi>Apollo, Aesculapius</hi> his sonne instructed by his father reduced this Arte being as yet rude and vulgar into alitle better and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for me, for which cause he was reputed worthy to be accounted as one of the Gods. At the same time flourished <hi>Chiron</hi> the <hi>Centaure</hi> who for that he excelled in knowledge of Plants, and taught <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> (as many report) their faculties, is thought by <hi>Pliny</hi> and some others to <note place="margin">plin. l. 7, c. 2.</note> have bin the inventor of Phisicke. <hi>Aesculapius</hi> had two sons <hi>Podalirius</hi> and <hi>Machaon</hi> who following their fathers steps &amp; professing Phisicke, did principally beautifie and practise that part there of which is called Chirurgery, and for that cause were accounted the Inventers thereof. After those <hi>Asclepiades</hi> left this Arte much enlarged as hereditary to his posterity: by whose study and diligence, that part of the Arte was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and annexed, which by a more curious skill searcheth out and cureth those diseases which lye hid within the body. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the <hi>Coan</hi> the son of <hi>Heraclidas,</hi> borne of the noble race of <hi>Asclepiades,</hi> Prince of the Phisitians that were before him, perfected Phisicke and reduced it into an Arte and wrote divers bookes thereof in Greeke. <hi>Galen</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him six hundred yeares after, who was a man most famous not only for his knowledge in Phisicke, but also in all other sciences, who faithfully interpreting every thing that was obscure and difficult in the writings of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> enlarged the science with many vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes. Thus therfore was the beginning, thus the encrease and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Arte of Phisicke, as much as can be hoped for from mans industry Although indeed we cannot deny but that Experience hath much profited this Arte, as it hath and doth many other. For as men perceived that some things were profitable, some unprofitable for this or that disease, they set it downe, and so by diligent observation and marking of singularities, they established universall and certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and so brought it into an Arte. For so we find it recorded in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Histories, before the invention of Phisicke, that the <hi>Babilonians &amp; Assyrians</hi> had a custome amongst them, to lay their sicke and diseased persons in the porches and entries of their houses, or to carry them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the streets and market places, that such as passed by and saw them, might give them counsell to take those things to cure their diseases, which they had formerly found profitable in themselves or any other in the like affects, neither might any passe by a sicke man in silence. Also <hi>Strabo</hi> writes that it was a custome in <hi>Graece</hi> that those which were sicke should resort to <hi>Aesculapius</hi> his Temple in <hi>Epidaurum,</hi> that there as they slept, by their dreames they might be admonished by the God
<pb facs="6"/>
what meanes they should use to be cured; and when they were freed from their diseases, they writ the manner of their infirmities and the means by which they were cured in tables &amp; fastned them to the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Temple, not only for the glory of the God, but also for the profit of such, as should afterwards be affected with the like maladies. All which tables (as fame reports) <hi>Hippocrdtes</hi> transcribed, &amp; so frō those drew the Arte of Phisicke. Beasts also have added much to this Arte. For one man was not only instructed by another, but learned also much from brute beasts, for they by the onely instinct of nature have found out divers herbs, &amp; remedies, by which they freed &amp; preserved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from infirmities, which might presently be transferred to mans use. Wherfore cōsidering that such &amp; so many have cōcurred to bring this Arte to perfection, who hereafter dare call in question the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency therof? cheifly if he respect the subject therof, Mans body, a thing more noble than all other Mundane thing, and for which the rest were created. Which thing moved <hi>Herophilus</hi> in times past to call Phisitions <hi>The hands of the Gods.</hi> For as we by putting forth our hand, do helpe any man out of the water or mud into which he is fallen: even so we doe sustaine those that are throwne downe from the top of health to the gates of death by violence of diseases, with happy medicines, &amp; as it were by some speciall &amp; divine gift deliver them out of the jawes of death. <hi>Homer</hi> the prince of Greek Poets affirmes that one Phisition is far more worthy than many other men. All Antiquity gave Phisitions such honor, that they worshipped them with great veneration as Gods, or the sons of their Gods. For who is it which is not much delighted with the divine force of health full medicines, with which (we see by dayly experience) Phisitiōs, as armed with <hi>Mercuries</hi> rod, do bring back those languishing soules which are even entring the gates of death? Hence it cometh to passe that the divine Poets of ancient times, as <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and <hi>Musaeus &amp; Hesiode;</hi> &amp; the most renowned Philosophers, <hi>Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Chrysippus, Cato Censorius, &amp; Varro</hi> esteemed nothing more excellent than to excell in the knowledge of Medicines, &amp; to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the same by written monuments to Posterity. For what can be more noble or worthy of a generous disposition than to attaine to that by the benefit of Phisicke, that adorned with the ornaments of dignity thou maiest have power over other men, &amp; favoured of Princes, Kings &amp; Emperours, mayest appoint &amp; prescribe to them those things which are profitable to preserve health, &amp; cure their diseases? But if you look for benefit by sciences; then know that the Professors here of have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides sufficient gain, acquired much honor &amp; many friends. <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
      <note place="margin">In what esteeme Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions have formerly beene.</note> comming to <hi>Abdera</hi> to cure <hi>Democritus</hi> of his madnes, not only the men of the city, but also the women, children &amp; people of every age, sexe &amp; ranck went forth to meet him, giving him with a common consent &amp; loud voice the title of a <hi>Tutelary</hi> Deity and father of their Country. But the <hi>Athenians,</hi> for freeing their Country from the plague, with trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
<pb facs="7"/>
pompe celebrated playes to his honor, &amp; bountifully set upon his head as if he had beene a king, a Crowne of gold weighing a 1000. peices of their golden coine, &amp; erected his statue, for a perpetuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of his piety and Learning. <hi>Erasistratus</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Aristotle</hi> by his daughter, received, freely given him by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> king of Egypt, for the cure of his son, 100. Talents of gold. The Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured <hi>Antonius Musa</hi> with a golden statue. <hi>Quintus Stertinius</hi> yearly received out of the Emperours Treasury 12000. 500. peices of gold. In the time of our Grandfathers <hi>Petrus Aponensis</hi> called <hi>Conciliator</hi> was so famous through all <hi>Italy</hi> for his knowledge in Phisicke, that he could scarse be intreated to come to any man of fashiō that was sick, unles he gave him 50. crownes, for every day he was absent from home: but when he went to cure <hi>Honorius</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he received 400. crownes for every day he was absent. Our French Chronicles relate in what credit &amp; estimation <hi>James Cotterius</hi> the Phisition was with <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. King of <hi>France;</hi> for they report he gave him monethly out of his Treasury 10000. crownes. Phisick in times past hath bin in such esteem with many famous &amp; noble personages, that divers Kings &amp; Princes delighted with the study therof, &amp; desirous to attaine glory &amp; credite therby, called sundry herbs after their own names. For so <hi>Gentian</hi> took <note place="margin">Names given to Plants.</note> its name of <hi>Gentius</hi> king of <hi>Illyria;</hi> the herb <hi>Lysimachia</hi> of <hi>Lysimachus</hi> the king of <hi>Macedon,</hi> the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> herb or <hi>Scordium,</hi> of <hi>Mithridates</hi> the king of <hi>Pontus</hi> &amp; <hi>Bithinia; Achillea</hi> of <hi>Achilles; Centorie</hi> of <hi>Chiron</hi> the <hi>Centaure; Arthemisia</hi> of <hi>Arthemisia</hi> the Queen of <hi>Caria. Attalus</hi> king of <hi>Pergamus, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> of <hi>Judea, Evax</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Juba</hi> the king of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> were not only inflamed with a desire of the knowledge of plants; but either they have writtē books of it, or for the great cōmodity of posterity, invented by their skil many choise Antidots compounded of divers simples; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the desire of learning this noble science is yet altogether extinct. As may appear by that <hi>Indiā</hi> plant <hi>Tobaco,</hi> called by some the noble herb, <hi>Catherines</hi> herb &amp; <hi>Medices</hi> herb, but commonly the Queens herb, because <hi>Catherine Medices</hi> the mother of our kings, by her singular study and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry made manifest the excellent vertue it hath in curing maligne ulcers &amp; wounds, which before was unknown to the <hi>French.</hi> For these worthy men understood that their glory, thus fastened &amp; ingrafted into the deepe, &amp; as it were everliving roots of plants, would never decay; but shold be propagated to al posterity in many succeeding ages, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up with their sprouting &amp; budding shouts, stalks, floures &amp; fruits. Neither did these famous men whil'st they adorned this part of phisick suffer the other, which treats of the dissectiō of mans body, be buried in oblivion, &amp; without their knowledge; as instructed with the precepts &amp; learning of the wisest men, how artificiall &amp; unimitable by mortall hand this fabrick of our body is. Neither is it probable that <hi>Apis, Osiris</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> kings of Egypt, <hi>Solomon, Alexander</hi> the great, <hi>Mithridates, Attalus,</hi> seeing they dedicated themselves wholy to the cōtemplation of
<pb facs="7"/>
natural things; neglected the use of Anatomie, &amp; being men most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to know themselves, to have beene ignorant of the structure of there own bodyes being the habitations of their soules immortall &amp; made to the Image of God: seeing they observed with certaine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the different lights of the Sun, Moone and stars; and passed over so many lands, so many seas, so many regions so far remote one from another, by waies so terrible by reason of cold, uncouthnes, darknes, by rocks, by fire &amp; sword, with great labour, charge &amp; danger of life, only that they might satisfie their minds thirsting after the knowledge of things; and to have left untouched a thing truly noble, admirable, and most worthy of knowledge, easie to be attained by any, and to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired without any danger of life, or fortunes.</p>
   <p>Seeing there be 3 parts of that Phisicke which at this time we professe, <note place="margin">Phisicke is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 3 parts.</note>
      <hi>Chirurgery</hi> which by the use of the hand, <hi>Diet</hi> which with a convenient manner of feeding &amp; ordering the body, &amp; <hi>Pharmacy</hi> that by medicines attempt to expell diseases, &amp; preserve health; The prime Phisitions do not without reason contend which of these may be accounted the cheife. Certainly <hi>Herophilus</hi> had <hi>Pharmacy</hi> in such esteem, that he thought medicines were first mixed &amp; administred to the sick by <hi>Apollo</hi> (whom Antiquity thought a great Deity.) And <hi>Pliny</hi> had so good an opinion of Diet, that he exclaimes; The true remedies &amp; Antidotes against dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases are put into the pot &amp; eaten every day by the poore people. Verily al learned men confesse that the manner of curing which is performed by diet, is much more facile &amp; prosperous, than that which is done by medicines; as those things which sought with much labour and cost, are taken with much loathing, and taken are scarse retained' but retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned they oft work with much labour &amp; paine: Which things long ago moved <hi>Asclepiades</hi> to exclude the use of medicines, as hurtfull to the stomack. Yet if we will beleeve <hi>Celsus</hi> neither of these parts merit the preheminēce, but both of them give place to Chirurgery. For seing that fortune is very powerfull in diseases, &amp; the same Meats &amp; Medicines are often good &amp; often vaine, truly it is hard to say, whether the health is recovered by the benefit of Diet and <hi>Pharmacy,</hi> or by the strength of the body. Moreover in those cases, in which we most prevaile with medicines; although the profit be more manifest, yet it is evident that health is often sought in vaine even by these things, &amp; often recovered without them. As it may be perceived by some troubled with sore eies, &amp; others with Quartaine feavers, who having bin long troubled by Phisitiōs are sometimes healed without them. But the effect of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery as it is very necessary, so it is the most evident amongst all the parts of phisicke. For who without Chirgery can hope to cure broken, or luxated parts, who wounds &amp; ulcers, who the falling of the Matrix, the stone in the bladder, a member infested with a Gangrene, or Sphacele? Besides, this part also is the most ancient; for <hi>Podalirius</hi> &amp; <hi>Machaon</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their Generall <hi>Agamemnon</hi> to the Trojane wars, yeelded no
<pb facs="8"/>
smal comfort to their fellow Soldiers. Whom notwithstanding <hi>Homer</hi> affirmes not to have given any helpe in the pestilence, nor in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diseases, but onely were accustomed to heale wounds by instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and medicines. And if the difficulty of learning it argue the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency <note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chirurgery.</note> of the Arte, who can doubt but Chirurgery must be the most excellent, seeing that none ought to be accounted a Chirurgeon or which can performe his duty, without the knowledge of Diet &amp; <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy?</hi> But both the other can performe their parts without Chirurgery if we may beleeve <hi>Galen.</hi> But if we consider the matter more neerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth; we shall understand those three parts have a certaine common bond, and are very neere of kinred, so that the one implores the ayde of the other; neither can the Phisition doe any thing praise worthy without the conspiracy and joynt consent of these three; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ancient times there was but one performer and user of all the three parts. But the multitude of men dayly encreasing, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary mans life decreasing, so that it did not seeme able to suffise for to learne and exercise all the three, the workmen devided themselves. Wherfore that which happens to any man either by lot, or counsell, that let him follow, maintaine and onely use, as mindful how short his life is, and how long the Arte.</p>
