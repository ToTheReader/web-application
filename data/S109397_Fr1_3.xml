   <p>The whole volume of the Nauigations of the French nation into the West Indies (comprised in three bookes) was brought to mee, to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, by M. Richard Hackluyt, a man, who for his worthy, and profitable labours, is well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to most men of worth, not onely of this kingdome, but also of forrain parts: and by him this part was select<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and chosen from the whole worke, for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vse of this Nation, to the end, that comparing the goodnesse of the lands of the Northerly parts heerein mentioned with that of <hi>Virginia,</hi> which (though in one, and the selfe same continent and both lands adioyning) must be far better, by reason it stands more Southerly, neerer to the Sunne, greater encouragement may be giuen to prosecute that generous and godly action, in planting and peopling that Country, to the better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Gospel of Christ, the saluation of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable soules, and generall benefit of this land, too much pestred with ouer many people. Which transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as I haue said) is but a part of a greater volume. If therefore you finde that some references of things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the former part of the said volume are not to be found in this translation, do not thinke it strange, in asmuch as they could not wel be brought in, except the whole volume should be translated, which of purpose was left vndone, as well to auoid your farther charges, as because it was thought needlesse to translate more then concerneth that which adioyneth to <hi>Virginia.</hi>

What good the English Nation may reape of this worke, by the onely description that is found therein of Nations, Ilands, Harbours, Bayes, Coasts, Riuers, Rockes, Shoulds, Sands, Bankes, and other dangers, which the Saylers into those parts may now the more easily finde, and auoid, by the knowledge that this translation giueth them of it, let the Nauigators iudge therof, who (for want of such knowledge) haue found themselues in euident perill of death, and many alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether cast away. If a man that sheweth foorth effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually the zealous care he ▪hath to the well-fare, and common good of his country, deserueth praises of the same, I refer to the iudgement of them that abhor the vice of ingratitude (hatefull aboue all to God, &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) whether the said M. Hackluyt (as well for the first procuring of this translation, as for many workes of his, set out by him for the good, and euerlasting fame of the English Nation) deserueth not to reape thankes. As for this my labour, if it be censured fauorably, and my good affection (in vndertaking the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this worke, for the benefit of this land) taken in good part, it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me to endeauour my selfe to doe better heereafter.</p>
