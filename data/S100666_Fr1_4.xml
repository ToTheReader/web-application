   <p>Thou shalt not rayle vpon the <hi>Iudges,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Exod. 22. 28.</note> neither speake euill of
the Ruler of the people.</p>
   <p>The Lord keepe mee from laying my hand on him.<note place="margin">1. King. 24.</note> For hee is
the Lordes annointed.</p>
   <p>Who can lay his handes vpon the Lordes annointed,<note place="margin">1. Xing. 26.</note> and bee
guiltlesse?</p>
   <p>Speake not euil of the King: no,<note place="margin">Eccle. 20.</note> not in thy thought▪</p>
   <p>Let euery soule bee subiect to the higher powers:<note place="margin">Paule to the Rom. 13.</note> for there is no
power but of God: and the powers that bee, are ordayned of God.
Whosoeuer therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance
of God: and they that resist shall receiue to themselues iudgement.
Ye must be subiect, not because of wrath onely, but also for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
sake.</p>
   <p>We call vpon the euerlasting God for the health of our Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,<note place="margin">Tertul. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologetico.</note>
alwaies beseeching Almighty God, to send euery of them
long life, happy raigne, trustie seruantes, valiant souldiers, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Councellors, orderly Subiectes, and the world quiet: and
whatsoeuer people or Prince can wish for.</p>
   <p>One night with a few firebrandes,<note place="margin">Tertul. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologet.</note> would yeald vs reuenge
sufficient, if it were lawfull with vs to requite euill with euill.
But God forbid, that eyther they, which take part with God, should
reuenge themselues with humaine fire, or bee grieued to suffer
wherein they be tried. If wee would not practise secrete reuenge,
but professe open enmity, could we lacke number of men or force
of Armes? Are the <hi>Moores</hi> thinke you or the <hi>Parthians,</hi> or any
one Nation whatsoeuer, moe in number then we, that are spread
ouer the whole world? We are not of you, and yet wee haue filled
all the places and roomes which you haue: your Cities, Ilandes,
Castles, Townes, Assemblies, your Tentes, Tribes, and Wardes,
yea the very Palace, Senate, and Iudgement seates▪ For what
<pb facs="5"/>
warre were wee not able and readie, though wee were fewer in
number then you, that go to our deathes so gladly, if it were not
more lawfull in our religion to be slaine then to slay? We coulde
without armes neuer rebelling, but onely diuiding our selues
from you, haue done you spight inough with that seperation. For
if so greate a multitude as we are, should haue broken from you,
into some corner of the world, the losse of so many Citizens woulde
haue both shamed you, and punished you. Belieue me, you would
haue been afraide, to see your selues alone and amazed as amongst
the dead, to see silence and desolation euery where, you would haue
had moe enemies, then inhabitantes, where now you haue fewer
ennemies, by reason of the multitude of your Citizens, that are
almost all Christians.</p>

      <hi>Saul</hi> had not innocencie,<note place="margin">August. con. .lit. Petil. lib. 2 cap. 48.</note> and yet hee had holynes, not of life,
but of vnction.</p>
   <p>After the Priest had reproued the attempt,<note place="margin">Chrisost. de verb. Esa. vidi dominum.</note> and the king
would not yeeld, but offred Armes, shieldes, and speares, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his power: then the Priest turning himselfe to God: I haue
done (saith he) my duty to warne him, I can goe no further. For
it is the Priests part onely to reproue, &amp; freely to admonish (with
words,) not to assaile with arms, not to vse targets, not to handle
speares, not to bend bowes, nor to cast dartes, but onely to reproue
and freely to warne.</p>
