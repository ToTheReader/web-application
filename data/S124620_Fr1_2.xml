   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN AND IVDICIOVS <hi>READER.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He</hi> Reason and Occasion inducing my <hi>Superiours</hi> to imploy mee in a service of the Church, for penning and publishing a Treatise of the Sabbath, and of the Lord's-day, is delivered <hi>in my Epistle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory to the Lord's Grace of Canterbury:</hi> And my intention in performing thereof, was to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and maintaine the Orthodoxall Doctrine of the Primitive Church, and the Doctrine of the Church of England, <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Lawes and Statutes of our Kingdome,</hi> against the Sabbatarian Error of one <hi>Theophilus Brabourne:</hi> and because this Errant had grounded the most of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, upon certaine Principles borrowed from some <hi>Moderne Teachers</hi> of our owne Nation, I was compelled to examine and confute the same.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>This</hi> service being with much Care and Diligence performed
<pb facs="3"/> by me, I expected some thankes for convicting and converting that Errant, and for <hi>preventing the farther spreading, and infection of his Error: But</hi> at least I presumed to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a charitable Construction of such Passages in my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, as were subservient to a farther discovery of Verity: and that if any had found cause of dissenting from me, they would in a charitable and peaceable manner, have propounded their Exceptions.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>It hath</hi> now so fallen out, that contrary both to my desert and expectation, <hi>A certaine clamorous and audacious Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient,</hi> a Person of a very weak judgement, but yet exceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, and arrogant, hath vented <hi>a Lawlesse, and unlicensed Pamphlet,</hi> digested <hi>Dialogue-wise &amp;c.</hi> wherein he Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with open mouth, that my Treatise of the Sabbath <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the publike Doctrine of the Church of England, touching that Question.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Now,</hi> the whole matter and frame of his Dialogue is so rude, and indigested, and <hi>the Author thereof is so notorious for his ignorance, envy, and presumption,</hi> that it rather me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits execration, than confutation: and many <hi>Persons of worth and quality,</hi> have perswaded me rather to contemne, than to confute, either <hi>the worke, or the workeman.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But</hi> when I consider the cause it selfe, and the humour of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious people, who are alwaies ready to conceive their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to be <hi>irrefragable Verities,</hi> if they passe in publike with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out just reproofe; I conceive, it can be no indiscretion in Me, or dishonour for Me, to appeare in defence of Veritie, <hi>against falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and iniquitie,</hi> how base and unworthy soever the Author is, with whom I shall contest.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Now</hi> all which I shall desire of the judicious Reader is; <hi>first,</hi> that he take into consideration, the maine accusation of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logist, which is; <hi>That in my Treatise of the Sabbath, I have overthrowne the publike Doctrine of the CHURCH of ENGLAND touching this Question.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>
      <hi>Secondly,</hi> that he will duely and impartially consider, and examine in the ballance of <hi>true judgement,</hi> the Adversaries Exceptions, and Objections against my Arguments and Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and my Answere, and confutation of the same.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Concerning</hi> the maine accusation of the Objector before mentioned, the Reader may easily discerne the falsity and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it: for the Doctrine of the Church of England concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sunday, and other Holy dayes, is in plaine and expresse termes delivered in the Statute of <hi>Quinto</hi> and <hi>Sexto</hi> of <hi>King EDWARD</hi> the sixt, cap. <hi>3.</hi> in manner following:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Neither</hi> is it to be thought, that there is any certaine time, or number of dayes <hi>prescribed in holy Scripture,</hi> but that the appointment both of the time, and also of the number of the dayes is left <hi>by the authoritie of God's Word,</hi> to the libertie of <hi>CHRIST</hi>'S Church to be determined, and assigned orderly in every Countrey, <hi>by the discretion of the Rulers and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters thereof, as they shal judge most expedient to the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth of God's glorie, and the edification of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Be it therefore enacted, by the King our Sovereigne Lord, with the assent of the Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, &amp; by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the same, that all the dayes hereafter mentioned, shall bee kept and commanded to be kept holy dayes, and none other: that is to say: <hi>All Sundayes in the yeere;</hi> The dayes of the Feasts of the Circumcision of our Lord <hi>IESUS CHRIST;</hi> of the Epiphanie; of the Purification of the blessed <hi>Virgine;</hi> of S. <hi>Matthias</hi> the Apostle, &amp;c. And that none other day shall be kept holy day, or to abstaine from lawfull bodily▪ labour.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>The</hi> former Statute being repealed, <hi>Anno primo Mariae, cap. 2.</hi> was revived, <hi>An. prim. R. IACOBI, cap. 25.</hi> and is at this day in force, as appeareth by the booke of Statutes; <hi>pag. 894.</hi> and by the judgement of the <hi>Reverend Iudges, and Masters in our Lawes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>A Second</hi> passage, which I desire the judicious Reader to
<pb facs="4"/> observe, is; That the Doctrine concerning the Sabbath day, and the Lord's day, maintained in my Treatise, agreeth exactly with <hi>the unanimous Tenet of the Orthodoxall Catholike Church</hi> of ancient times: and the same agreeth likewise with the Tenet, both of all the <hi>Schoole Doctours,</hi> ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, and also with the Tenet of the best learned and most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Divines of the reformed Churches</hi> beyond Sea: And lastly, the same is agreeable to the Tenet of <hi>the Holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> of our owne Church; <hi>Bishop Cranmer, Iohn Frith, William Tindall, D. Barnes &amp;c.</hi> And the other opinion; That the fourth Commandement is a Precept of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and purely and intirely Morall: And that the observation of the Lord's Day is expresly commanded by that Precept of the Decalogue, is a novell Position, repugnant to all, or most Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall Divines, who have instructed Christian people in the wayes of godlinesse, in former or moderne times.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Every</hi> one of the former passages, is so fully prooved and confirmed in <hi>my Treatise of the Sabbath,</hi> that no just excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be taken against my proceeding, in handling this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: and therefore the boldnesse, and impudency of <hi>this blat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Dialogist</hi> is detestable, when he affirmeth, that my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the Sabbath overthroweth the Doctrine of the Church of England.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Lastly,</hi> all the Reward which I desire to reape for my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell in this, or in any other service of the Church, is, that the Truth which I have faithfully delivered, may bee maintained, and my integrity be protected, against gracelesse, impudent, and irreverent Calumniators, such as the Author of the Dialogue hath proclaimed himselfe to be, in this, and in some other of his <hi>lewd and lawlesse Pamphlets.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For although this Dialogue penner hath concealed his name, yet <hi>Ex ungue Leonem,</hi> the world may easily conjecture who the Creature is, by <hi>his foule paw:</hi> The Scope of his writing in his Pamphlets, is, to magnifie his owne Zeale, piety, and integrity,
<pb facs="4"/> to perswade the World, that he alone is left <hi>a Prophet of the LORD,</hi> and is guided with the spirit of Verity and Fidelity; and that the present Fathers and Rulers of our <hi>CHURCH,</hi> and other conformable Persons who comply with them, are little better than Hirelings and blinde Guides: And (besides his ignorance, which is notorious) the violent Man, is so far trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with <hi>bitter Zeale,</hi> that whatsoever proceeds from him, is <hi>litigious, clamorous, scandalous, and abusive:</hi> and his Pamphlets are fraughted with such Materials, as are apt to poyson Christian people with contempt and hatred <hi>of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Government, and present Religion established in our CHURCH.</hi> Also he is possessed with a gracelesse and malignant humour, to wit, looke whatsoever gives all other judicious and godly Persons best content, enrageth him against such as are imployed in the Governement and publike service of the <hi>CHURCH.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But</hi> I shall detaine my Reader no longer from the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Man's Quarrels and Objections vented in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue; and my Answer, and Reply shall make it evident, that the Doctrine propounded, and maintained in my Treatise of the Sabbath (maugre the malice of this <hi>Blatterant</hi>) standeth firme, and is not subject to any just Reproofe.</p>
