   <head>An aduertisement to the Catholikes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, of the present state of their children brought vp in this Colledge of Vallado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and of the comfort they may worthely expect of them heer-after.</head>
   <p>BEcause I assure my self that your highines hath inhereted not the least part of your fathers loue and affection to the Catholikes of England, and that you desire to keep fresh his glorious memorie with them no lesse gratfull then the memorie of the good king Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias was to the people of Israell, and because the rigorous persecution they suffer causeth in all good Catholikes great compassion and desyre, to comfort so valorous and faythfull people, and that nothing can bee more gratefull to good parents then to heare newes of their childeren, hoping that this relatiō may come to their handes, trāsla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted into Inglish by your highnesse comaundemēt, I haue thought good to adde some particular things of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie, for their aduertisment of the state thereof.</p>
   <p>There is built a fayer house capable well-nigh of a 100 persons, for habitation of the students, and it proueth so
<pb n="66" facs="35"/>
commodious, pleasant, and healthful that none haue dyed since it was finished, and verie few falne sick, in so much as the last yeare whē there dyed in this citie a boue 6000. persons of the plage, only one scholer of this Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary well sicke of that desease, who yet recouered: so as it was atributed to Gods speciall prouidence and protectiō who as it seemed had marked the walles of this colledge with the bloud of the holy martyrs of Ingland, that the angell of reuenge should not touch the students. They liue so merily &amp; contentedly as them selues affirme they neuer liued with such harty contentment in there owne fathers houses. The grace which God giueth them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the glorious vocation whereunto he calleth thē to liue reddy to die for the conuersion of there countrie, and the dayly vse of prayer and other exercises of piety which they haue, kept them continually with feruour &amp; deuotion, notwithstanding the distraction of theire stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, as wel appeared (to omitt other exampls) in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordenarie preparation they made, and the recollection this last sommer in meditation &amp; prayer for many dayes together, to dispose them selues to receiue worthely the lubely of the holy yeare, which was graunted by especiall priuilege to the Inglish Catholikes, and in other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of late, wherein they haue made notable demonstra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of theire religion and pietie especially in the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and receiuing a deuout image of our blessed Lady de faced by the Inglish heretikes at Cadyz which no doubt, but God allmightie hath bestowed vpon them in reward of theire speciall loue and deuotion to his blessed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is not a litle stirred vp and increased in this citie by theire example. They profit notably in all kynde of studyes, specially in philosophy, diuinitie, and controuerses against hereses, wherein they defend their conclusions and publique acts with so great satisfaction and approbation of the whole vniuersitie, as they are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and esteemed not only in this citie, but of the graue and learned persons of al these kingdomes, eclesiasticall,
<pb n="67" facs="35"/>
and tēporal, and diuers of them haue adopted some one, some moe of these studēts for their childeren, prouiding them of maintenance and apparrel, &amp; comforting them with gifts and lettrrs, and visiting them in person as they were theire owne children, and the Bishops when they take holy orders, and whole cities in occasions ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king demonstration of theire good wil and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, in so much, as these two yeares past me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable for general famin, and plage, when many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and cōmunities that enioy great liuings &amp; rents, found them selues ouercharged, this Colledge maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 60. or 70. persons without want of any thing neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, through Gods holy prouidence, who hath care in such occasions to susteine at his owne expenses those that leaue theire parents and countrie for his holy name, as at other times he hath done with Daniel, Elias, S. Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, and many other of his seruantes. Finally this good wil and estimation is so much the more to be accounted, of, as it is more vniuersal and procedeth from persons of more iudgment and authoritie, in which kinde, may be rekned the extraordinarie demonstratiō of fauour which the high counsayles of these kingdomes haue shewed of late to this Inglish Colledge moued thereunto by the Earle of Ponion rostro, don Francisco Arias de Bouadilla who hauing bin Coronel in Flandres many yeares, and seeing the rigorous persecution in Ingland and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie of the Catholikes, and after knowne the Inglish Colledge of Ciuil, the time hee was gouerner of that citie, hath taken such affection to this Colledge, that he dealeth in their businesse with no lesse care then if they were his owne childeren, and so vpon occasion of two &amp; twentie students that came this yeare almost altogether, he presented petitions to the Counsayles in his owne name, &amp; with al gaue them bookes of the historie new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly published by the late kinges Confessor of the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Ingland, and a paper cōtayning diuers reasons to moue affection towards these Seminaries, which he
<pb n="68" facs="36"/>
caused to bee printed for the purpose, and is worthy to be set, (as it shal be) downe at the end of his relation, as wel for testimonie of this good noblemans zeale &amp; affectiō, as for your highnesse, who cannot chose to receiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, seeing layd together, and wel declared the grounds and foundation of the fauours, which your self and the most renowmed kings, your father, &amp; your brot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, haue shewed in sucouring this people that so much deserueth to be sucoured, &amp; the same is no smal testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the passion and blindnesse which heresie hath bred in those of England, which persecute euen to death these innocēt lambes of their owne coūtrey &amp; bloud, who one the other side, strangers of a different nation are forced (only for the example of their good life &amp; vertue) to loue so tenderly &amp; with so general approbatiō as may bee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in the fauours &amp; benefits which dayly they receiue of theire Maiesties, and your highnesse, and so many other principal persons of these kingdōs, &amp; now lately of these counsayles and communities which is the greatest testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie that can be of the general affection that is borne them. For notwithstanding the fauour and affectiō which any Prince or Prelate sheweth to a worke of this qualitie doth much commend and authorise it, yet many times it may proceed of a particular deuotion, &amp; therefore is not so great a testimony, nor so vniuersal as his other approba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, but that so many counsayls as haue cōcurred of late to fauour this worke &amp; so many persons of authoritie as be in them, in whose wisdome and discretion resteth the gouermēt of so many kingdomes &amp; countries, &amp; which do not easylie concurre in the qualification &amp; approbatiō of any thing, wherein may be doubt, should so vnite and conioyne them selues in one mind and affectiō, not only to approue, but to fauour &amp; succor an other natiō and in a thing vnaccustomed &amp; hetherto not seene in any other occasion, &amp; where only one negatiue voyce had bin suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to hinder the graunt, this I cannot see how any man can doubt to be his dispositiō &amp; handy worke, by whom
<pb n="69" facs="36"/>
      <hi>Reges regnant &amp; legum conditores iusta decernunt,</hi> Kings do reigne and lawgiuers make iust decrees, therby to giue euident testimonie to the world, that he wil make fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and ennoble this his worke, to the greater confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the heretiks his enemyes who seek by al meanes possible to calumniat, ouerthrow, and destroy it.</p>
   <p>VVherefore there is no reason that those whom God most merifully calleth to this holy worke, no lesse hard then glorious, should be dismayed, or lose hart with the troubles and new difficulties, which arise in it euery day, by the subtile meanes of the enemie of truth, seing his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maiestie one the other syde hath such particular care to prouide diligent workmen and labors for this his beloued vineyard whose learning confoundeth the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their enemies, there valor and vertue, the others malice, and there magnanimitie and patience, the others cruelty, vpholding and mayntaining by these meanes, the Catholike faith agaynst al the power of the Prince of darknes. If then God hath effectuated the conuersion of other countries, and of England also, at other times by only one, or two, or by some smal number of good men, what may wee hope for now of so many faithful seruants and workemen of his, as be in that countrie; and of the prouident care which (as wee see) he hath to cal so many chosen youth as euery day with singular &amp; strange vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations come as a new supply to the Seminaries, where being brought vp trayned and exercised in vertue &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (the armes where with they must fight against here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie) they become as valiāt Capitaines in this spiritual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Church, as were Cyrus, Hannibal, Alexander, Augustus Caesar, and Dauid in theire temporal warres, for that they began to exercise themselues in them betimes (as their histories reporte) what may wee then hope for, but a short and happie end of this combate sithence they go to it, with the skil, courage, and fortitude that beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the soldiours of Christ, as there imperisonment, theire disputations with the heretikes, theire torments, &amp;
<pb n="70" facs="37"/>
deathes do testifie; so as iustly wee may say, that these be of the number of the wise childeren, which (as the holy ghost sayeth) bring ioy and comfort to theire parents, &amp; not only comfort, but honour to them, and libertie to there country, and as God chose the banished chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deren of Babylon, for instrumentes to worke and shew forth his glory, who rather chose to enter into the hot burning fornace, in testimonie of there true religion, then to adore the idol; where by the king came to know his error, and acknowledged the true God: so by the very same meanes God is glorified with the constancie of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se Inglish youthes, who break through so many dangers and perils, because they wil not adore and follow the Idol of heresie erected in their country but rather labour to reduce it to the knowledge and obedience of the true Catholike Church.</p>
