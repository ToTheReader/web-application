   <head>To the sacred honour of the Lord God, Creator of all things, and Iudge of all men.</head>
   <p>ALmightie and euerlasting God, vvho hast set thy king vpon thy holy hill of Sion, &amp; giuen him a kingdom that all nations, and languages should <hi>serue</hi> him, a kingdom that shall haue no ende; giue vs vvee beseech thee to knovv vvhat it is to haue him for the Christ, the only King and Lavvgiuer of his church, the <hi>Anointing</hi> that thou hast giuen vs▪ and to see that vvee haue, <hi>no neede that any man teach vs, but as the same anointing teacheth vs of all things,</hi> by himselfe, and by his Apostles, and Prophets. O teach vs at last to <hi>abide in him,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> hath taught <hi>vs,</hi> that <hi>vvhen he shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, vvee may not be ashamed before him at his comming.</hi> Thou only, O Lord, canst best iudge vvhat are the things that truly belong to his kingdom and gouerument, vvhat subordinate officers thou hast giuen to guide thy church, and vvho are Intruders and vsurpers: vvho serue aright to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thy Truth and gouernment, and vvho to obscure and oppresse the same: vvho serue thy kingdom in a right vvay, &amp; vvho only pretend it, not seruing thee the Lord, <hi>but theire owne bellies.</hi> To vvhome then, but to thee, O dreadfull God, should I thy poore seruant dedicate these his vveake labours? For thou, o Lord God, best knowest the work that thou hast vvrought in thine, thou art best able to trie, and teach others to trie <hi>the Spirits vvhether they be of God, or noe:</hi> thou <hi>searehest the heart &amp; the reines,</hi> the end and scoape of euery mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, vvho are led by <hi>thy Spirit into all Truth,</hi> and vvho are only lifted vp in an opinion thereof: vvho finding thy guidance in some things, presume that thou teachest them all vvhich they beleeue, or to vvhich they are conformable, and doe not rather thinke it better to beleeue all that thou tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest, to be conformed to that, and be reformed by it: vvho haue thy Truth in respect of the persons, authoritie and
<pb facs="2"/>benefits of men, and vvho in respect of thee alone, the only fountaine of Truth. Thou, o God, the righteous Iudge, seest vvhether I haue collected these proofes &amp; obseruations for the cause of Christ alone, or for sinister respects; thou best knovvest thy ovvne Truth, and art best able to defend it, and all them that seeke it. Princes are men: such as trust to much to theire iudgment and protection, do oft finde themselues revvarded accordingly: Thou hast the hearts of kings, and all other men, in thy hand, thou canst turne them to see and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge thy truth. Thou only, that <hi>makest light to shine out of darknes,</hi> canst <hi>shine in theire hearts, to giue them true knovvledge</hi> and obedience. Other Patrons can a litle counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a booke vvith their greate names &amp; favours: but thou, o Kings of kings hast <hi>a name aboue all names:</hi> thou only canst <hi>persvvade Iapheth to dvvell in the tents of Shem.</hi> Thou only canst informe and assure the heart in thy ovvne Truth. VVho is able to hinder the light thereof, vvhen thou vvilt haue it knovvne &amp; acknovvledged? O therefore <hi>be mercifull vnto vs,</hi> &amp; <hi>cause the light of thy countenance to shine vpon vs, that thy vvay may be knovvne vpon earth, &amp; thy sauing health vnto all nations;</hi> that they may see the things that belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their peace, least haueing them hid from theire eies, they <hi>groape at noone day, straine at a gnat &amp; swallow a Camel.</hi> Thou art the greate God that vvilt take account of euerie mans vvorkes, and bring euerie secret vvorke, and counseil vnto light. It is thy grace and protection that I stand in neede of. O be vvith me, and forsake me not, but shevv thy might in my vveakenes. This g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ace &amp; vvhat else thou knovvest neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me, the Reader, or any of thy afflicted people, grant vnto vs all for Iesus Christ his sake, the Sonne of thy loue, to vvhome vvith thee, and thy holy Spirit, three persons and one God, be ascribed, as due is, all honour, might, maiestie and dominion, novv and for euer.</p>
