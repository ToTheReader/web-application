   <head>TO THE REVEREND AND LEARNED MINISTERS OF THE holy word of God: and to all true hearted <hi>Christians: Grace and Peace in the</hi> Lord Iesus.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight well beloued, worthy great loue, and reuerence, (yea double honour in the Lord, euen for the Lordes sake, and for your diligent and painefull labour in his worke) seeing I hold it my dutie, to giue a reason to you, of that which I haue done, in the publishing of these writings, which are nowe brought to your viewe, and remaine subiect to your godly censures, as you shall finde iust cause: this I desire, that you doe first of all, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably consider on my behalfe, that were it not (besides my owne perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Gods gracious assistance, in his guiding and leading of me through this busines (that I had beene incouraged by some of yourselues: that is to say, by Ministers of the word, of very good learning and iudgement, singularly zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of Gods glorie, and aboundant in loue toward his Church: I would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue presumed to haue offered these my labours, to be examined of such as haue authoritie to licence the printing of Bookes; much lesse would I haue presumed to haue published them, as now they are.</p>
   <p>And yet for all that, (that is, though I was in such wife as is specified, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged thus farre (in hope of your good liking, and of some good fruite to grow vnto the Church thereby) how moderately and modestly I thinke of that which is done, God he knoweth. And therewithall how desirous I am that none vpon the sodaine shoulde bee offended at these superfluous labours, as they may peraduenture seeme to some to be (specially they being vndertaken by such an one as I am; after the writings of so many excellent seruants of God in the ministerie of his Gospell) I would gladly it might appeare to all, by this my care to render you the reasons, which preuailed with me herevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
   <p>First therefore, this (in all humblenes of minde) I doe you to vnderstand; that insomuch, as (by the mercies of God) I haue beene a hearer of many of your owne selues, who are yet liuing, and also of some of those who haue died most blessedly in the Lord (most worthy and excellent Preachers of the word) and so haue beene a partaker of your manifold good gifts and graces, to my singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar instruction and comfort, if I haue not beene failing to my selfe, in so long a tract of time. I thought with my selfe therefore, that if (through the rich mercy and goodnes of God) I might be as the good Bee, to draw honie out of so many sweete flowers as were before mee, and bring the same together, as it were into one hieue; it might come to passe, that (through the blessing of God) I might in processe of time, performe some acceptable seruice to his Church. So that this then, is the first reason, which I haue to alledge, to shewe whence I haue beene imboldened to performe this seruice.</p>
   <p>Secondly, seeing it is so, that in respect of my owne practise in the holy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, I haue had more then ordinarie occasion (in course of Catechising by
<pb facs="4"/> the space of these 20. yeares past, to goe oftentimes through the principles of Religion; and that not onely in so briefe a manner as they might well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, for the better capacitie of the more simple in vnderstanding: but also more largely for the benefite of such as were of better discretion and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, euen till this kind of exercise, was thus farre forth augmented as you see) therefore I thought I might not with any equitie, conceale it either from such as hauing beene lesse exercised this way, desire it for a helpfull supply vnto them: or from those, who hauing no neede of this helpe for any defect; may neuertheles finde an occasion offered them of their owne more excellent thoughtes: like as the knife is made sharpe by the rude and blunt wherstone, when it is but a little whetted vpon it.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, <hi>I</hi> thought this dutie, might the better beseeme me in the Church of God, yea that God himselfe would the rather require it at my handes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it seemed good to his diuine Maiestie, to imploy me from time to time, in the course of my Ministerie, toward the people of small villages: by reason whereof, I had the fewer auocations from my studies, and so more leisure to write, then many other Ministers of the word, whom God had placed ouer greater townes, and in popular cities.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, I haue beene the rather confirmed, to thinke that it was the good will and pleasure of God, that I should performe this seruice; because, by the exercise of sundry bodily afflictions, I was in the middest of my thoughts this way, constrained to keepe house and chamber, for a long time together, more then ordinarily: and chiefly, because thereby I found my heart (through the blessing of GOD vppon my afflictions) more humbled and sanctified ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, being as one liuing in <hi>Diem,</hi> death euery day threatening dissolution, and hasting the decay of the outward man. And that in such sort, that before I am olde, the infirmities of age, are with a swift foote (as it were before the time) come vpon me. In which respect (as I thought with my selfe) necessitie lay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me also, to make as much hast as I could, to doe the best seruice to God and to his Church, that I might possibly attaine vnto, before I goe hence and bee not.</p>
   <p>Fiftly, in my very inward parts, me thought I saw and doe see very clearely, that nothing is more necessatie in these daies (wherein all things are growing to most lamentable vncertainties, for want of reuerend and studious attending to the word, as if all things might be carried after probabilities of disputation:) Seeing therefore nothing (I say) more necessarie, then such a writing, as might, by the reading of it, retentiuely stay the mindes of Gods people, in a grounded meditation of the most sure and certaine principles of religion, by explications and proofes from the word of God, which is the onely sure &amp; certaine ground and stay of mans vncertaine and weak wandering minds: &amp; hauing good trust that it hath pleased God, that this writing should bee in some measure fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted herevnto; I haue beene hereby, incouraged to proceed so farre as I haue done. And the rather also, that from the viewe of this labour, it may appeare to the Churc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es of God, yea euen in the sight of all in the world that will looke vpon it: what those things are which the faithfull Ministers of Iesus Christ doe beate their wittes about, and wherein they spend themselues among their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall flockes and charges. And that it might from hence also appeare in how many truthes: that is, in particulars aboue number, we do agree, teaching the same things from one and the same word, by one and the same Spirit, with a sweet consent, in comparison of those fewe things, wherein the iudgements of some doe differ: till God shal in them all so cleare our iudgements, and frame
<pb facs="4"/> our hearts to a more full agreement in all things, against the distractions of these heauie daies.</p>
   <p>Finally, seeing the former part of my collectiō of the doctrine of the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wel accepted of many, I conceiued so much the better hope that this of the Gospell should finde good entertainment among the good seruants of God.</p>
   <p>But now, how well all this busines hath beene performed: it belongeth to you, the well learned and godly Ministers of the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ, to discerne and iudge: and accordingly, so farre as you shall find cause, either to reproue, or to giue the glory to God.</p>
   <p>And if you finde that which your soule liketh, then say you &amp; spare not, that whatsoeuer is well, God hath heerein glorified himselfe, by as weake and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie an instrument of his, as could haue beene found out, among numbers of those, whom it might haue pleased him, to vse to such a seruice as this is. And concerning my owne selfe, this I willingly professe, and say, as it is in the peaceable and prouerbiall speech of <hi>Gideon, What is my vintage in comparison of the gleaning of the least of you,</hi> my reuerend Fathers and brethren, if your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the holy Ministerie of the word, had beene gathered together, as these are? And who am I, but as the diligent Apothecarie (to admit the greatest commendation that may seeme to agree) in comparison of the most learned and skilfull Phisition? or onely as the painefull Bee to fill the hiue, with the hony drawne out of your sweete flowers, as was acknowledged in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</p>
   <p>Now therefore, vpon these considerations, gathering some hope of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable interpretation of all things, seeing all is well meant and intended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you: yet me thinke, that I heare some say, that this kinde of writing is ouer-long and tedious, and able to discourage the minde of the Reader, before he set his minde vnto it. To this, vnder your correction, I answere; First, that if such as so may thinke, will orderly reade the Questions and Answeres onely: then shall it be freed from that conceite of theirs, by many degrees, of breuitie.</p>
   <p>Secondly, I doubt not, but euen the same being once acquainted with the Questions and Answeres, and giuing their mindes to meditate vpon them: wil growe desirous to read and stay their thoughts vpon the Proofes also: and that so doing, they shall (through the blessing of God) finde no small profite, ioy, and comfort to their soules; in that they shall find them to bee the marrowe and life of those Answeres, which bee not the very wordes of the holy Scriptures, and some lightsome clearing also, to the same holy Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, I would desire such as so thinke to answere themselues, from a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar similitude, which they may take from their owne counting-housen (I meane such as bee rich in the world, who for the most part, can afford the least time, to the diligent reading and studying of holy things) that as they doe not account it a vaine or vnnecessarie thing, to haue many more bagges of money standing together, then they can presently vse, because they can one time or other finde vse to improue them all to gaine, so they would in this case, bee of like iudgement, to thinke that it is to the best purpose in all the world, to haue the largest spirituall Treasurie that may bee, containing the greatest varietie of the instructions, comforts and duties of the Gospell of Gods heauenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: though they doe but at conuenient times, busie themselues to reade that which is brought to their hands, concerning such or such a profitable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, either for instruction, or for comfort, or to stirre vp to dutie, euen as the necessities of their soules shall from time to time require.</p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>Whom also I would in the name of God earnestly pray, that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider further with themselues, how necessarie a thing it is, specially for them that be rich in this world, that they should haue by them (besides that most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table meanes of publike Preaching which God hath sent them) the helpe of such holy writings, as might most strongly stay their mindes, in the long and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts of the necessarie points of their saluation: because otherwise, the vehement and vncessant cares of this life, wil assuredly like a cancre fret out, or as a viper gnawe out the very heart stringes of Religion, euen in them that be not the worst sort of worldly minded men. Last of all as touching length of writing, that is not to be accounted too long which is no longer then the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the matter it it selfe doth necessarily require.</p>
   <p>Thus much, in way of rendering some account of the present enterprise, with this admonition necessarily (as I suppose) inserted: in respect of some, who without such caution, were most like to mislike, to their owne greatest harme.</p>
   <p>But to returne my speech to you (the reuerend and learned Preachers of Gods word) this doe I now humbly beseech of you in the Lord Iesus, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, as yee are the salt of the earth, the light of the world, and Stewards in the Lords house, appointed by God himselfe, to giue to euery one his portion in due season: that you would as ye doe, and yet still more and more, consider, the peerlesse dignitie &amp; efficacie of your office of Preaching, farre excelling all writing or printing with incke and paper; both for the daily calling and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church of God, as well in knowledge and comfort of faith, as vnto obedience of life, euen to the comming of our Lord Iesus, at the ende of the world. You are by your holy Preaching, the most actiue pen-men of the holy Ghost: to write, yea to ingraue all holy doctrine and godlines in the heartes of all the Elect of God, with a farre more deepe and firme impression, then can be made in any thinne and shallowe papers. You are those holy instruments of God, which are most effectual, both to giue the clearest light of knowledg, and to work the best impressions in memorie, and to bring the conscience to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test remorse, and to affect the heart with the sweetest and most durable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and also most powerfully to stirre vp to the practise of the duties of a godly life, then any other can be. Whence it is, and no doubt hath alwaies bin found, that among the godly, such speeches as followe, haue more often proceeded from their hearing of the word preached, then from priuate reading, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes. I neuer vnderstood this point (saith one) so well as I did by such a Sermon. I remember such a point well (saith another) euer since I heard such a text handeled. I was neuer pricked in cōscience, as I was at such a Sermon, saith a third. Me thought the Preacher spake particularly to me, &amp;c. I was greatly cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted (saith a fourth) by the doctrine of such a Preacher at such &amp; such a time. Wee see well nowe (say all that haue any grace in them with one consent) that we ought to be more carefull, to heare the word pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>hed, and to pray more earnestly to God for his blessing vpon it, then euer we thought before. These kinde of speeches I say, being often in the mouthes of such Christians, as be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend hearers of Sermons; doe euidently declare, that Preaching hath a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power giuen it of God: to worke most mightie effects in the hearts of the people of God, aboue al that any readings, or other priuate or publicke exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of religion can worke. So that, though reading of good bookes is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, to such as doe in godly manner acquaint themselues therewithall: yet in commending of the reading of godly writings, we must alwaies admonish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he people, that they preferre the hearing of holy Sermons, and the reading of the holy Scriptures, before their reading of any other writinges besides.</p>
   <p>Yea so iust cause is there, to admonish all other hereof: that the most godly
<pb facs="5"/> and learned Preachers themselues, will from their owne experience, easily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that they could not haue vnderstoode the mysteries of Gods truth so clearely, nor haue found them so comfortable, by their owne reading, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and meditation, as by the grace of God, they now do in a more liberall taste of Gods power and glory: had they not their owne selues, not onely preached the same to others, but also heard the same mysteries preached by other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters vnto them. And so doe I willingly confesse concerning my selfe, and the present <hi>Treasurie,</hi> so called in these bookes.</p>
   <p>O therefore, be ye intreated for the Lords cause, to labour to the fulfilling of the most worthie and noble dutie of your office: that is, the dutie of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, which of all other, is the most worthy in the sight of God, &amp; most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to his Church. Without the which, no doubt, all writing, yea euen the holy Scriptures themselues, would lie contemned and despised, and without any fruit, vnlesse the people were put in minde of their duty: yea if they were not earnestly stirred vp by you, to haue the due regard of them. <hi>Spartam igitur vos nacti estis (reuerēdi in Christo Patres ac Fratres) vos inquam, prae coeteris: Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam sanè selectissimam. Hanc igitur macti virtute vestra (coelitus sc: inspirata) maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me .i. qua poteritis fide &amp; diligentia, exornate. Ita Deum remuneratorem experiemini benignissimum, locupletissimum{que}. Ego similiter (eadem gratia diuina fretus) vestrae virtutis imitator, maximé in votis habeo, vt in idem vobiscum opus, totis viribus (huic scribendi negotio temperans) multo deinceps accuratius, Domino pro sua immensa boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate concedente, incumbam. Optimé valete.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And now hence-forth, extending my speech yet more generally: this I desire, that all might vnderstand, that albeit this booke is in some most dutifull regard, dedicated to the right worshipfull aboue named: insomuch, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, by their good meanes, to vouchsafe mee the principall time, of such quiet peace, and rest; with libertie, leisure, comfort, and maintenance in the Church of God, wherein I might write any thing at all, worthy the reading of any. Neuerthelesse, that which I doe in speciall manner dedicate to them, as most properly, and of best right belonging to them: the same doe I frō a more common affection of christian loue, and duty, (and with their very Christian good liking I am sure) communicate also to you. Wishing and praying with all my heart, that it may be aboundantly blessed of God, to the singular both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and comfort, not onely of them and theirs, but also of you, and of all that do belong vnto you.</p>
   <p>To the which end and purpose, two things do I hence-forth, most instantly request of you.</p>
   <p>First, that you would esteeme of these writings, only as of a fruit of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prophecie, or interpretation, which is an ordinary gift of God in his church; to help toward the more cleare vnderstanding, of that manifold wisedome of God, which is fully and perfectly contained in his owne most holy Scriptures alone: and therewithall, to lay open more plainely that manifold comfort, which is inclosed in them: and likewise to make it more manifest, how plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fruites of thankfulnes, and obedience, is due from vs to God, according to the same. For as touching the thinges themselues, they are (as was saide euen now) to be found most perfectly treasured vp in the holy Scriptures of GOD himselfe: and in no other writings beside. Neither in very deede, doe these holy Scriptures of God, stand in need of any other method and disposing; nor of any other interpretation, then their owne most pure and bright clearenes: were it not, that our owne darknes and ignorance, with the confusion that is in our disordered minds, did stand in need of the same. For so writeth the holy Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Tim. 3.16.17. <hi>The whole Scripture</hi> (saith he) <hi>is giuen by diuine
<pb facs="6"/> inspiration, and is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and to instruct in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, That the man of God may be absolute, and made perfect to all good workes.</hi> And againe, Rom. 15.4. <hi>Whatsoeuer things are written afore time</hi> (to wit in the holy Scriptures, as we may perceiue by that which followeth) <hi>they are written</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might haue hope.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>All mens writings, whatsoeuer they be, specially such as doe concerne religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: they ought to be nothing else, but meere seruants to the holy writings of God, to the ends here mentioned.</p>
   <p>This therefore, is the first thing, which I doe earnestly desire, of all such as shall thinke good to acquaint themselues, with the reading of these or any of the best worth: that they will in no wise haue any other estimation of them, but as of dutifull seruants to the holy Scriptures of God.</p>
   <p>Now, the second thing, which I doe, to the same ends, and with like ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnes, desire as a meete consequent of the former request, is this: that none would by the reading of these, or any other bookes; be any whit withdrawne, or hindered, from the reading, or hearing of the word of God it selfe. The which, being first written by most holy inspiration (as was euen now alledged) is thereby manifestly cōmended vnto vs, as that which (euen by the ordinance of God himselfe) is to be euery way, and at all times, in season and out of season, night and day (both in reading, preaching, hearing, and meditating) most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerendly to be regarded. Psal. <hi>1.</hi> ver. 2. and 2. Tim. 4.1.<hi>2.</hi> And the same also, not without iust cause: seeing they are questionlesse, the onely true ground, and perfect Canon, of all holy instruction. And because the right vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, is as the aiming point, whereunto all instruction and teaching ought to tend: insomuch as they onely are able, to make vs perfectly wise vnto saluation.</p>
   <p>This therefore, is my second sute; that none would by any other writings, suffer themselues to be drawne away, to slack the reading or the hearing of the preaching of the holy Scriptures of God: but rather, that they would double, yea multiply their diligence that way.</p>
   <p>Thus, if any shall at conuenient leisures, reade these writings prepared for them; I doubt not, but through the blessing of God, they shall finde them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other of the same argument, no vaine helpe and furtherance: both for light of knowledge, and also to further the comfort, &amp; obedience of their faith.</p>
   <p>And now, these cautions being obserued, I beseech ye giue mee leaue, to vtter that which I haue (among these prefatorie thoughts) conceiued further in my minde: that is, that I haue good trust, that there is no iust and important cause, why it should offend any; though after many former excellent bookes, there be stil now and then, more set forth: prouided alwaies, that they be sound and orthodoxe, and in some respects of speciall good vse, moreouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the former. For herein, the common prouerb (currant in all other things of good vse) may haue a chiefe place, that <hi>Store is no sore.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The rather also, may this stone of offence be remoued, if we consider that none are inforced to buy this or that book: but it is left to their own free choice to take or to leaue; as they please themselues: or shall be aduised by the counsell of their godly friends. Wherevpon, may we not discerne, that if we should not thankfully accept the manifold good and industrious labours of our louing brethren, the faithfull seruants of God: we may easily (or we be aware of it) not onely complaine of that, which might be for our owne ease, from other mens labours; but also grudge at that, which GOD hath prepared for a necessarie helpe, and benefit, to many other; though we should for our parts, thinke our
<pb facs="6"/> selues to stand in no neede of them?</p>
   <p>Wherefore, that I may pleade this cause of the new publishing of good and profitable writings, such as we speake of. Be it, that the Church of God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie inriched, with a goodlie varietie of all sortes of good bookes (blessed be the name of our good God for it) both of lesser and greater volume, larger and more briefe, as well by Question and Answere, as in continued speech, some more fit for learned Srudents, in a more exquisite method and stile, and some for Schollers of lesse vnderstanding, &amp;c. Yet this wee cannot but easilie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that not all good bookes of all sorts (no not of the smallest and most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie price) doe come to anie one mans hands; no nor anie one kinde of booke to all: but rather to a very few, in comparison of those that doe very seldome, or not at all, heare of them.</p>
   <p>God (no doubt,) who setteth his seruants to worke, will dispose also of their labours, as it seemeth best, to the eye of his most gratious, and all-seeing Prouidence. To some, one helpe, to some, another: to some, at this time, to other afterward. Yea doubtles, so wisely and prouidently will God dispose of the labours of his faithfull seruants, that the least of them shall not bee alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in vaine.</p>
   <p>And yet, moreouer and beside that which hath beene saide in this case, this may be added further: that seeing God hath manifested his wisedome, in the varietie of his goodnes and mercie, euery other way; in his works of creation, to be seene, felt, tasted, &amp;c. for the manifold comfort of the outward man: why should we think it vnsutable to the same his goodnes, and to the bountie of his mercies, that hee should fit and furnish his seruants, with such varietie of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall graces, as might be euerie way delightfull, and beneficiall to the inward <hi>Man?</hi> Verilie, there is no reason why wee should thinke so. Let no man therefore, goe about to straighten that bountie of God, which he hath so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouslie inlarged toward vs: nor grudge against that, for the which we cannot be chearefull enough, in our praising of him.</p>
   <p>But that we may hasten to an end of this plea, Shall false-teachers, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite &amp; often renued variety of hereticall bookes, vtter their counterfet wares and marchandise, their <hi>Pseudo-chatholike</hi> &amp; counterfet <hi>Treasuries?</hi> and shall not the faithfull ministers of the truth of GOD, vse all holie diligence, to promote the same by all kinde of good and sound writings; and by laying forth therein, the true pretious catholike <hi>Treasures</hi> of the onely true Church of God? Farre be, so vnfaithfull and secure negligence, chased away from amongst vs. And the rather also, because thousandes of poore soules, haue so much the more neede of such renued helpes by good writinges, lest they should be peruerted by the bad: specially in such places, where the faithfull and diligent preaching of Gods word, (the chiefe preseruatiue against this leauen of false doctrine) is most wanting. So that for some supplie of so great a defect, what may wee thinke to be accounted of the bookes of one impression, though of more then a thousand: yea though the same booke, should be imprinted, thousand after thousand, manie a time.</p>
   <p>But to this it may be saide, that not manie thousands among many millions of people, are so well minded, as to be studious in reading of good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bookes. And in verie deede, it cannot bee denyed, but that it is too true. Neuerthelesse, this wee may as truely answere, that God hath his thousands, and seuen thousands in his <hi>Israel,</hi> better minded, then anie one, or manie of vs are priuie vnto.</p>
