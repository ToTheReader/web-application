   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Offer vnto thee (good Christian Reader) in this Treatise, the summe of our Religion. And if forraine things delight thee (as now adayes they do all men most commonly) I do offer vnto thee, I say, our Religion, proceeding out of the mouthes of the verie enemies thereof. For as the people cried and said in <hi>Darius</hi> his dayes;<note place="margin">1. Esd. 4.41.</note>
      <hi>Truth is the greatest and strongest thing of all others:</hi> Euen so this sentence shall stand true for euer. And here thou shalt see that performed in deed, which <hi>Dauid</hi> did but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurate; <hi>that Goliah his head is stricken off with his owne sword.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Sam. 17.51.</note> And surely if the bodie and the shadow bee relatiues (as the Philosophers teach) and that euerie shadow hath a bodie; then truly <hi>Dan</hi> in the law may be also a figure of <hi>Antichrist</hi> in the Gospel;<note place="margin">Gen. 49.17. 2. The. 2.2.</note> and the Madia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites of the Papists. <hi>Dan,</hi> as his name imports in Hebrew, is a Iudge: He will vsurpe the office of a Iudge amongst his brethren. And euen so doth the Pope, this spirituall <hi>Dan:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Leuit. 13.3. Matt. 8.4.</note> He will be a Iudge also by vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation: he will not iudge only <hi>betweene leprosie and leprosie,</hi> that is, betwixt notorious sinnes, as the law commanded, but he will iudge euerie light disease which the law commands not. Hee will not bee iudge onely of <hi>those knowne sins which goe before to iudgement,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.22.24.</note> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothie</hi> that he should take heede of; but also of <hi>those which follow after: He will know the secrets of mens hearts,</hi> of which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith: <hi>Iudge nothing before the time,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.5.</note>
      <hi>vntill the Lord come, who will lighten things that are hid in darkenesse, and make the counsels of the hearts manifest: and then shall euerie one haue praise of God.</hi> And is not this to be <hi>Dan?</hi> Is not this to be a Iudge?<note place="margin">Madian signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies iudging.</note> And as hee is <hi>Dan:</hi> so also his armie and souldiers are Madianites, they come of <hi>Dan;</hi> that is their name. For they take their name of him, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists do of the Pope: and they shal perish also as did the Madianites. Of whose ouerthrow thus we reade:<note place="margin">Iudg. 7.22.</note>
      <hi>When the three hundreth blewe with trumpets, the Lord set euery mans sword vpon his neighbour, and vpon all the host which fled to Beth-hashittah Tsererah, to the borders
<pb facs="3"/> of Abel-Meholah vnto Tabbah.</hi> Here first is the small number of the Lords armie, the small number of the professours of the Gospell, in comparison of the Madianites, of Papists &amp; Friers. Here are also the Lords weapons, the trumpets of the Gospell against Madian, and their destruction, by one of them drawing swords against another. Here is (to make perfect this victorie, and to conquer also Sathan, the father of <hi>Dan</hi>) the breaking of pitchers: that is, <hi>the mortification of the flesh,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 6.19. Col. 3.5. Matth. 16.24.</note>
      <hi>and of the lusts thereof,</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> so often tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth; and the <hi>denying of our selues, and the following of him, with our crosse on our backes,</hi> which our Sauiour also commands.</p>
   <p>And <hi>they fled to Beth-hashittah Tsererah, and to the border of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel Meholah vnto Tabbah.</hi> Here is that verified which our Sauiour saith of the eternitie of the Scriptures: <hi>That heauen and earth shall perish,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 5.18. 2. Tim. 3.16 Rom. 15.4.</note>
      <hi>but not one io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>te or tittle of the word of God shall perish.</hi> And that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writes of the excellencie of them: <hi>That all the whole Scriptures are giuen by inspiration from God.</hi> And againe, <hi>That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is written, is written for our learning.</hi> And againe, <hi>Nowe all these things came vnto them for examples,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.11.</note>
      <hi>and were written to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish vs, vpon whom the ends of the world are come.</hi> Euerie verse and word in them, doe edifie, and are of force; nay they edifie and teach vs: And in this one point, they surpasse almost all other writings. The lawes of <hi>Iustinian</hi> manie of them are not conuenient for our age; nor <hi>Galens</hi> prescriptions of medicines for our bodies:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.25.</note>
      <hi>but the word of the Lord is the same for euer. The Madianites fled to Beth-hashittah Tsererah,</hi> as to their castle of refuge; and that is in our language, <hi>to the afflicted house now readie to fall on their heads.</hi> And do not euen now the Papists so?<note place="margin">Ierem. 7.4,</note> Do they not crie, as the Iewes did, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord?</hi> So now they, The Church of Rome, the Church of Rome. Is not the continuance thereof so manie yeares, and the great glorie of it, their Refuge? Is not this one of their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest arguments? But what is Rome? Is it not <hi>Beth-hashittah Tserarah?</hi> that is,<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.8.</note> that afflicted house, now readie to fall on their heads? <hi>It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes daily by the Spirit of God:</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prophesieth that it should do, and euerie day is it in declining. And ere it belong, <hi>in one day,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Reu. 18.8.</note> that is, sodainly, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> prophesieth, <hi>shall her plagues come vpon her, death and sorrow, and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire. For it is the mightie Lord euen God himself that iudgeth her.</hi> And she shall fall into that miserable sorow and destruction, which here also followeth: <hi>euen to the very border or lippe</hi> (as it is in the Hebrew)
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>of Abel Meholah</hi> that is, <hi>of the sorrowes of a woman trauelling with child,</hi> euē to <hi>Tabbaath,</hi> to the last moneth in the yeare, which answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to our December, which for the abundance of waters,<note place="margin">Psal. 137.8. 1.

      </gap>herein, is called in Hebrue <hi>Tabbah:</hi> which signifieth <hi>to be drowned.</hi> Surely such flouds of sorowes and calamities remaine for Rome <hi>the daughter of Babylon,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Reue. 17.2.</note> which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:</hi> as the prophesies of the holie Scriptures do teach. Nay, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> describeth her most manifestly: <hi>That great citie which is built vpon seuen hilles, and raignes ouer the kings of the earth,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 73.27 Ier. 3 1.</note>
      <hi>&amp; made them drinke the wine of her fornication.</hi> What citie in the world is thus built, and hath had this authoritie ouer Kings;<note place="margin">Reuel. 17.17.</note> and <hi>hath made them drinke wine of fornication,</hi> that is, <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> which is so called in the Scripture, but Rome? The day shall come, that these <hi>her louers (those kings which with one consent haue giuen their kingdome to the beast) shall hate her, and shall eate her flesh, and shall burne her with fire.</hi> Wee see now the former of these fulfilled: so no doubt wee shall see the latter also, <hi>When God shall put it into their hearts, and when his wordes are fulfilled, and that euen in one day.</hi> If Rome be in this case, may shee not fitly be called the <hi>afflicted tottering house?</hi> And therefore as the father and prince of the Madianites <hi>Dan,</hi> may resemble the Pope, and the Madianites his souldiers, which shall one of them kill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so <hi>Beth-hashittah</hi> may resemble Rome, their castle of refuge.</p>
   <p>And God deales euen now as mercifully with his Church,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 20.22</note> as he did in the dayes of good king <hi>Iehoshaphat;</hi> against <hi>whom when manie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had conspired and came to make warre, it is thus written: When they began to shout and praise the Lord, the Lord (himselfe) laid am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushmēts against the children of Ammon, Moab &amp; mount Seir, which were come against Iudah, &amp; they slew one another:</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. King. 18.13. Ioh. 3.1. Luke. 25 50. Matth. 27.19</note> euen so the enemies of the Church of God at this day, by Gods speciall grace and mercy, one of them kill another. And euen as in the law <hi>Obadiah, Ahabs steward, nourished the Prophets of the Lord;</hi> and <hi>Nichodemus and Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph of Arimathea,</hi> princes amongst the Iewes,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.22. Ierem. 38.7.</note> and euen <hi>Pilates</hi> wife fauoured Iesus Christ: euen so now also in the Gospell, the Popes darlings and Friers some of them fauour the truth. And as Saint <hi>Paul also had some friends in Caesars house;</hi> and <hi>Ieremie in the kings court:</hi> so now hath the Gospell some friends among the Popes traine, and that in no smal matters. There is no one thing I am perswaded at this day doth so dazell the eyes of a great nūber, that they cannot behold the cleare light of the Gospel, &amp; keeps thē stil in the obedience of the
<pb facs="4"/> Church of Rome: as the reading of <hi>Granatensis, Stella, Ferus, Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus de diez,</hi> &amp; such like. But all shall clearly see in this book, how that in the principall points of religion they ioyne hands with vs. And that we may say of them,<note place="margin">1 King. 22.43</note> as we reade in the booke of the Kings of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat, that he walked in all the wayes of Asa his father, and declined not therefrom; but did that was right in the eyes of the Lord: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the high places were not taken away, and the people offered still, and burnt incense in the high places.</hi> Good men haue their imperfections. So these follow the way of the Fathers in preaching and setting forth zealously the word of God, in maintaining the authoritie thereof; as also the knowledge, reading, and meditation thereof: they teach also the true vse of prayer with faith, deuotion, &amp; vnderstanding: our perfect redemption by Christ, and the assured faith that we ought to haue in him; and how that we ought to trust in his merits, and not in our owne works; his exceeding great loue towards vs, and the great corruption of our nature without his grace. In these points they worship God aright, with good king <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> and they followe the wayes of their fathers. But yet the high places are not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; they burne incense there still: They maintaine the Popes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie their patron,<note place="margin">Col. 2.18, 2. King. 9.20. &amp; 10.28.</note> they make prayers to Saints and Angels, through <hi>their ouermuch humilitie,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs. Their great and good zeale is like to that wee reade of <hi>Iehu. And the marching is like the marching of Iehu the sonne of Nimshie, for he marcheth furiously.</hi> And againe, <hi>So Iehu destroyed Baal out of Israel; but from the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, which made Israel to sinne, he departed not.</hi> He was the founder of his kingdome. The policie which he deuised to maintaine his estate and kingdome, hee also (although it were against the word of God) embraced: So these are zealous,<note place="margin">Mark. 12.34.</note> but they also maintaine their founder the Pope and his authoritie. We may say of these truly, as our Sauiour Christ in the Gospel sayd of that Scribe, <hi>Thou art not far from the kingdom of God:</hi> no more surely are these. So that heere good gentle Reader, thou maist see Popery pulled vp euen by the roots, by the hands of Papists themselues.</p>
   <p>The true Catholike faith, out of the Scriptures, out of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Fathers, &amp; out of the mouthes of them, who seeme to be the verie enemies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; this small Treatise teacheth: Euery one therefore that tendereth his own saluation, let him mark wel that faith which herein is taught. In the time of ignorance, God might, and no doubt did shew mercy;
<pb facs="4"/> but now at midday, in the most cleare sunshine of the Gospell, now I say, to shut the eyes, is wilful murther.<note place="margin">Reu. 14.8.</note> For in the Reuelation our daies are most liuely expressed: <hi>Then I saw</hi> (saith S. <hi>Iohn) another Angel fly in the midst of heauen, hauing an euerlasting Gospell to preach vnto them that dwel on the earth, and to euery nation, and kinred, &amp; tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice: Feare God, giue glorie to him: for the houre of his iudgement is come, and worship him that made heauen and earth, the sea, and the fountaines of waters.</hi> Are not here our daies most euidently declared? The preaching of the euerlasting Gospell: the worshipping of God alone, that made all things, and not of any creature: nay, the verie time. <hi>For the houre of his iudgement is come.</hi> This preaching of these doctrines, and this preaching of the Gospell, shall be immediately before the iudgement: Hee that is not starke blind cannot choose but see this. Now followes the Church of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. <hi>And there followed another Angell, saying: It is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon the great citie: for she made all nations to drinke of the wine of her fornication.</hi> Here is likewise the Church of Antichrist most euidently described: <hi>She shall make all nations drinke of the wine of her fornication.</hi> She is contrarie to the true Church, which teacheth <hi>to worship God alone the Creator:</hi> but this Synagogue hath <hi>caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>d men to drinke of the wine of her fornication;</hi> that is, to worship others besides God, and to worship the creatures: and this is spirituall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. And hath not the Church of Rome done so? Who seeth it not? Hee is onely to bee worshipped according to the truth of the Gospell that made heauen and earth: but what Saint or Angell had any fellowship with God in that worke? And therefore the Church of Rome in teaching the worship of these, is <hi>Babylon:</hi> and therefore she dissenteth most manifestly from the truth of the Gospell: And therefore she is that whoore; whose fornication is rather in doctrine then in maners. Now she being thus manifestly descried, the third Angell followed them, <hi>saying with a loud voyce, If any man worship the Beast, and his image, and receiue his marke in his forhead or on his hand, the same shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, yea of the pure wine that is poured out of the cup of his wrath: and he shal be tormented in fire and brimstone before the holy Angels, and before the Lambe, &amp;c. O</hi> terrible sentence for all obstinate Papists! which as yet the Gospell being so long, and so manifestly preached, will worship the image of the beast, that is, which will acknowledge the Popes supremacie: or put their trust in his characters and consecrated
<pb facs="5"/> creatures. For as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath taught before, <hi>He shall make an image of the Beast:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Reu. 13.14.</note> that is, as the Roman Emperor was Monarch ouer the world, so he shall challenge a Monarchy ouer the Church. And hath not the Pope done th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s? God giue all men eyes to see this.</p>
   <p>And here gentle Reader if peraduenture in this Treatise I do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in some points from the godly brethren, I must desire thee to beare with me patientlie: I dissent not with a contentious mind, but with a mind longing and searching for the truth; and according to my simple Talent deliuering it to thee and to thy iudgement. Our dissensions are as diuers boughes proceeding from the same roote of the tree: and as diuers arrowes shot out of the same quiuer, aiming at the same marke, shot against Babel. Thou which art endued with Gods Spirit,<note place="margin">Ierem. 50.14, Rom. 8.9. 1. Cor. 2.15.</note> and art Iesus Christs, iudge charitably who comes nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the marke: condemne not any. Gods souldiers are commanded to shoote not on one side against Babel, but round about her. I vrge the fasts of Wednesdayes, Fridayes, and of Lent, which the Fathers, and the Primitiue Church solemnly obserued. Who as they were not superstitious in these their fasts (as the Papists were) so they were not so curious in the numbring of the dayes of Lent as wee are, They fasted about fortie dayes, which was called of them <hi>Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesima:</hi> and euerie weeke the fourth and sixt day, not superstitiously, but religiously, to studie the Scriptures, and to came the flesh. The which fasts I vrge now againe in our dayes, to rouse out of the sleepe of security the men of our age: which eate and drinke as the men did in the dayes of <hi>Noe;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luke. 17.27.</note> of whom our Sauiour giueth vs warning to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, least we perish with them. I wish that all men would watch in their priuate prayers, and that publike prayers also might be early in the morning: which times of praying are both agreeing with the Scripture, and to the Primitiue Church. I commend the signe of the Crosse as an holy signe, which diuers godly learned men haue thought to be that signe of the Sonne of man, which shall appeare before the day of iudgement, whereof mention is made in the 24. of Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi> Gospell. If that sword of <hi>Goliah</hi> that killed him, were kept reuerently lapt vp in a cloath, and that in no obscure place, but behind the Ephod in the Tabernacle: Why should not that sword which killed the true <hi>Goliah</hi> indeed (which vaunted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe against all Israel (I meane the Crosse) with which sword the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell had thought to haue killed our Sauiour Iesus Christ;<note place="margin">1. Sam. 21.9.</note>
      <note place="margin">1. Sam. 17.10.</note> and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that other <hi>Goliah</hi> was but a shadowe) bee had in reuerence in
<pb facs="5"/> Christs Church amongst vs Christians? And here we may note also, that the Ephod may signifie Christ, as the signification of the name it selfe may seeme to import, which signifies to put on aboue, or to couer ouer all. And all Christians must put on this Ephod aboue all their other garments of their good works, be they neuer so perfect: And in this respect also they may bee called Kings and Priests. Then <hi>Goliah</hi> his sword must not be placed before the Ephod, or lapt vp with the Ephod, but lapt vp in a cloath behind the Ephod: So the Crosse is not to be made equall with Christ, as the Papists haue made it, but to be placed behind the Ephod lapt in a cloath, that is, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend and sacred thing to be accounted of. So that this estimation of the signe of the Crosse (for there is a mutuall relation betweene the signe and the thing signified) makes nothing for Popery.</p>
   <p>As concerning the testimonies of the Scriptures, which concerne these points of doctrine, which are handled in this Treatise, in some places I alleage them not, because I haue handled them else where, in the exposition of the Epistle of Saint <hi>Iude.</hi> And I haue here allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the sayings of manie of the Romish Writers, whom they call Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes: In translating of whose sayings, I protest I haue vsed as great faithfulnesse as can be; and that I haue many times stucke so vnto the letter, that I haue lost the grace of the sense. Thus fare thou well good Christian Reader, and the Lord Iesus giue thee a right iudgement and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in all things.</p>
