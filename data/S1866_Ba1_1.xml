   <head>To the Kings most excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
Iohn Clauell wisheth a long, and
prosperous reigne in this, and in the world to
come, a plenteous share of those peculiar
blessings, which God himselfe (out of his
wonderfull and abundant goodnes)
hath prouided and set apart (euen for

   <l>IT grieues my soule, and wounds my troubled minde,</l>
   <l>That onely I alone must be confinde,</l>
   <l>When others are let loose, that they may gaine</l>
   <l>The honour they haue lost, whil'st my foule staine</l>
   <l>Blurres both my birth, and fortunes; had I dide,</l>
   <l>My ignominious death had satisfide;</l>
   <l>But to liue still, and still to liue in shame,</l>
   <l>(Within the summons of vpbraiding fame)</l>
   <l>Is a worse plague then euer Egypt had;</l>
   <l>It may be thought, I that haue beene so bad</l>
   <l>Cannot recant, but very likely may</l>
   <l>Fall to my old rebellion, on the way;</l>
   <l>
      <pb n="60" facs="42"/>
First let this treaty plead; then here I call</l>
   <l>My God aboue to witnesse (who knowes all</l>
   <l>The secrets of my heart) I doe intend</l>
   <l>Whilst these your warres endure, euen there to spend</l>
   <l>My time, in that braue seruice; when that ends</l>
   <l>(If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> chance to suruiue) I haue then friends,</l>
   <l>And a poore fortune of my owne, that can</l>
   <l>Fairely maintaine me, like an honest man;</l>
   <l>If so your Highnesse please, that I may haue</l>
   <l>My gratious pardon, (you so freely gaue)</l>
   <l>What is required of me, I cannot pay,</l>
   <l>If that the meanes wherewith be kept away;</l>
   <l>Confinde within these walls, is it your will</l>
   <l>That I a prisoner here, continue still?</l>
   <l>When I was past the cure, and helpe of men,</l>
   <l>You (that could onely) shielded me, iust then</l>
   <l>When death had taken leuell with his dart,</l>
   <l>Was it that I might feele this greater s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>art?</l>
   <l>O no; I neuer since haue beg'd that boone,</l>
   <l>But you (great Sir) haue granted it right soone,</l>
   <l>Yet notwithstanding your most royall pleasure,</l>
   <l>I am enforc'd to tarry others leasure,</l>
   <l>Like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> in this my hell I see,</l>
   <l>And know the grace you haue bestowd on me</l>
   <l>But may not touch it, and enioy much lesse,</l>
   <l>The more's my griefe, and my vnhappinesse,</l>
   <l>O free me from this lingring lethergie,</l>
   <l>Set me at liberty, or let me die.</l>
