      <salute>Noble SIR,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OW much J stand
obliged to your loue
and bounty, should I
be silent, others would
testifie: to conceale it,
were to call witnesses;
and to denie it, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme
ingratitude.
Neither hath your respect come single or alone.
<pb facs="3"/>
For those excellent Ladies, of pious memorie,
which successiuely made your bed happy, and I
hope your house prosperous, as they were to you
most deare, so to me most noble: neuer stranger
found either more encouragement in his labors,
or more ample remonstrance of an honourable
loue. But there is no earthly contentment, but
hath interruption or intermixtion: wee must
leaue it, or it must leaue vs. I onely, now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in this, that God hath taken those orna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments
of their sex, as fit for heauen, too goo<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

for earth, to both which liuing, I was indebted
and for both dead (by your election) the sad▪
membrancer. Others might haue set out their
perfections better, none more mournfully or
more truely. In which the rarenesse of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
haue had the power to make my weaknesse,
not onely to passe without censure, but the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
to bee importuned with an earnest zeale,
both by your selfe and others of their and your
honorable friends. The first long since went out
in written copies: this last (it seemeth) must
not be restrained within so narrow bounds, nor
the desire of many satisfied without more ample

notice. Which sithence it must come to publique
view: to whom should I present it, but your selfe,
who haue the losse, and knowe the truth, from
whom I haue receiued my meanes, and to
whom I shall euer remaine thankfull,
and faithfull in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
duties.</p>
