Wherein I endeuour to show, that there remaineth yet much to be said; and that the trueth hath not bin thoroughly discouered, neither all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge forestalled by our forerunners: Admonishing the Learned, to adde that by their owne Inuentions, which is wanting in the Sciences; doing that for Posteritie, which Antiquitie hath done for vs; to the end, that Learning be not lost, but from day to day may receiue some increase.</p>
