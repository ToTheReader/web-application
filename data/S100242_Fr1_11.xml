   <l>I Will not venture to usurpe or claime</l>
   <l>The sacred Title of a Poets name,</l>
   <l>Or dare to challenge ought that doth belong</l>
   <l>Unto their merits, least their worths I wrong.</l>
   <l>The Worlds applausive praise I will resigne</l>
   <l>To <hi>Phoebus</hi> sonnes, their Raptures are Divine,</l>
   <l>Sublime transcendent; and their Candor's such,</l>
   <l>That I can but the superficies touch</l>
   <l>Of their perfections: no, I have no skill</l>
   <l>To sound their praises, or to guide my quill:</l>
   <l>To portraict forth th' <hi>Idea</hi> of their Fame,</l>
   <l>Vnlesse by writing of a Poets name;</l>
   <l>Yet that's enough; for sweete-ton'd Poesie</l>
   <l>Makes men immortall, and doth Deifie</l>
   <l>Them by their actions: what was ever writ</l>
   <l>By a true Poet, <hi>Fame</hi> eterniz'd it;</l>
   <l>Witnesse an <hi>Homer,</hi> or brave <hi>Horace</hi> name,</l>
   <l>
      <hi>Propertius, Virgil,</hi> or sweete <hi>Ovids</hi> fame:</l>
   <l>Or looke but backe to these our Moderne times,</l>
   <l>
      <hi>Spencer,</hi> though dead, surviveth by his rimes;</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="11"/>
      <hi>Iohnson,</hi> and others, needlesse to rehearse,</l>
   <l>Are eternized by their famous Verse;</l>
   <l>Unto whose worths, Time-during Fame hath rais'd</l>
   <l>Trophies of Honour, to their lasting praise.</l>
   <l>Oh that I could but shew, or else expresse</l>
   <l>How much I honour the ingenuousnesse</l>
   <l>Of great <hi>Apollo's</hi> darlings, who surpasse</l>
   <l>So farre the Vulgar, as bright Diamonds glasse!</l>
   <l>My Lines are framed in a Leaden mould,</l>
   <l>Their Straines composed of the purest gold;</l>
   <l>Whose high-tun'd words, like precious Jems adorne</l>
   <l>The Readers eare, too costly to be worne</l>
   <l>By every Vulgar Criticke, who despight</l>
   <l>All sence or reason, be it wrong or right,</l>
   <l>Will spit the venome of their malice, and</l>
   <l>Censure mens Labours, though not understand:</l>
   <l>But's to no purpose; say they what they will,</l>
   <l>Poets are Poets, they but Coxecombes still.</l>
