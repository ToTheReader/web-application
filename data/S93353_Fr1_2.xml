But the <hi>Jesuites,</hi> (who are the only Reuellers in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>) disdaining to be tied to order, time, or ceremonie, haue taken vpō them to play the Lordes of Misse-rule, in the very midst of this yeare 1607. as if it had bin their yeare of <hi>Iubile.</hi> At <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> did they in person Act a Play: at <hi>Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>many,</hi> did they set forth a
<pb facs="3"/> Maske. The Play was full of State; the Maske full of Sratagemes: In the Play, a newe God-amightie had a part; in the Maske, the old Diuell was a Torch-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. The Play was stuft with blasphemy, irreligion, &amp; scandall: the Maske was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled with suites of Lust, prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, bloud and Treason. Thunder claps from heauen strucke the Players, yet the <hi>Iesuites</hi> called them Plaudities. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hangman desrobed the Masquers, and discouered them to bee diuells, yet the <hi>Iesuites</hi> say they are Saints. Since then God himselfe brands this Iesuited flocke with letters of infamie, to shew it is none of his: and sincs (as being giuen ouer) they set markes on their owne fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beads, to make them odious and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the world: vvho vvould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test their pride? vvho does not (euen at hand) see their dovvnefall? The scarlet-coloured beast of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath had many
<pb facs="3"/> of her heads strucke off: shee hath wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon a number offeete, vvhich gaue her strength to tread vpon the neckes of Kinges, but a number of those feete are fallen lame, many haue beene cut off, and those vpon vvhich shee novv stands, are but vveake: for your <hi>Francistan, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans, Benedictines, Mendicants, Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,</hi> and many a rabbie more of the Romish Armie, vvere (nor long since) the very sinevves to the legs of that Papall Monster, and the ribs to her body: but novv, like leaues shaken by the breath of Autume, hang they quiuering and haue but little hold, else lye they scattered on the earth, the tree from vvhich they drop tottering euery day more and more, and ready with her fall to bruise them for euer. The <hi>Iesuites</hi> onlie are the Pillers, against which shee leanes: if they shrink, shee shrinkes for euer. And that their great &amp; sudden swelling vp in the, <hi>Romaine</hi> Sea,
<pb facs="4"/> shall be but as bubbles in a Riuer? who doth not see it? who doth not laugh at it: <hi>France</hi> did of late driue them out of her dominions, yet like the Horse of <hi>Troy,</hi> were they pulled in againe: and she feares alreadie they will proue as fatall: <hi>Italia</hi> knovves them to be Machiauels <hi>Germany</hi> to be monsters: <hi>Spaine</hi> to be diuels: <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> knovves thē to be bloudily ambitious (vvitnesse <hi>Sebastian,</hi> vpon vvhom, they vvould haue strangly vvrought.) <hi>Ireland</hi> knovves them to be seditious: <hi>Scotland</hi> knovves them to be treacherous, &amp; <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> knovves them to be <hi>Iesuiets.</hi> All coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries you see haue taken their pictures yet because al countries haue not seene them, in all their true collours: I present to the vvhole vvorld this one Protraiture more, vvhich you may behold a far off, because it is penciled dovvne in bloud.</p>
