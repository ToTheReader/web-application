      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is to be vnderstoode, that when the Almightie creator had made y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worlde, he also created all manner of beasts, as well on earth as in the water, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foules, after which saith the holy Scripture, hée created man after his owne Image and similytude, and to him gaue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer all things created, and with the same, grace and reason. Through the which he was apte to rule &amp; haue knowledge of all through the spirite of God, as to haue knowledge of al things where-vnto he gaue his minde &amp; vnderstanding, as it is at this present to be séene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men in the worlde that haue knowledge of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and sundrie thinges, all necessarie for those that will liue in the world with honour: For some vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the art of husbandry, which was the first art v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the world, for so much as without it we cannot well liue as it is plainely séene. There are other that haue knowledge in keping beastes of all kinds apt or méete for mans bodie, as Goats, Kyne, Hogges, Hens, Geese, Horse, Mules, and such like. There are other that haue knowledge in Nauigation, without y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which also the world would be vnperfet, as it is séene by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. There be other that haue knowledge in <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mographie,</hi> whereby they knowe diuers partes of the
<pb facs="10"/>
world whether men may trauaile. There be other that haue knowledge in the art of warres, whereby they may helpe to defend their Prince and countries, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting of iustice. There be other that vnderstand <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologie,</hi> by the which they knowe y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> course of Planets and their effects: Other vnderstand the <hi>Mathematica,</hi> whereby they measure land and all other thinges: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther studie <hi>Musicke,</hi> to accord voyces together, &amp; other vnderstand Phisicke to helpe the diseased bodyes of humaine creatures, and also annymales of dyuers and sundrie infirmities. There be other that vnderstande Chyrurgerie, to helpe al manner of sores y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> happē vnto men: vpon which Chirurgery, we wil write a brief dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course &amp; plesant reasō, &amp; will leaue apart the science y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is doubtful, bicause ther is no science in the world wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a man may do good if there-with be no practise or experience, as a man may say. The which experience is master of all things, as it is plainly séene, and therfore we will giue you to vnderstand which of those partes be best or most necessary in this Chirurgerie, either to helpe those that are hurt, or the science, or experience. And we will shewe the méere troth without any dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation or fraude, as I haue alwayes done in my workes which are Printed, and at this present doe intend to do, if almightie God giue mée grace, and quicken my spirits or wits in writing that which shalbe to his honour, and profite to the worlde.</p>
