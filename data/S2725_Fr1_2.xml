   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He present carelesse secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of all men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, is like unto our first parents neglect of Gods sacred commandement in Paradice, when the seducing serpent no sooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded evill, but it was instantly put in practise: You shall die (said God) was heard, but you shall not die (said the divell) was belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Our eares are dayly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the threatenings of God
<pb facs="3"/>
denounced against sinners, and yet that sinne, that broad way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path and high way to hell, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted with a delectation and pleasure, so crastie and subtill are the baits and lures of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and so void of spirituall wisedome is the soule-murdering sinner. But if due considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were had of the wages of sinne, and the reward of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and to what bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it will turne in the end, it would make us lesse bold to sinne, and more fearefull to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, if wee would take into our companie for a dayly consort, the pale memorie of death, and whereto hee summoneth us after this life. Death in it selfe is very fearefull, but much more
<pb facs="3"/>
terrible, in regard of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it warneth us unto. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to see a sinner lie on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting bed, burdened and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the greevous and heavie load of all his former trespasses, goared with the sting and pricke of a festered conscience, feeling the crampe of death w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>esting at his heart strings, readie to make the ruthfull divorce betweene soule and bodie, panting for breath, and swimming in a cold and fatall sweat, wearied with strugling against the deadly pangs: Oh how much would hee give for an houre of repentaunce! at what rate would hee value a daies contrition! Then worlds would bee worthlesse, in respect of a little respite, a short truce
<pb facs="4"/>
would seeme more precious than the treasures of Empires, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be so much esteemed as a moment of time, which now by moneths and yeares is lavish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spent.</p>
   <p>How inconsolable were his case, his friends beeing fled, his sences frighted, his thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, his memorie decayed, his whole mind agast, and no part able to performe that it should, but onely his guiltie conscience pestered with sinne, continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upbraiding him with bitter accusations? what would hee thinke when (stripped out of this mortall weed, and turned both out of the service and house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roume of this world) hee must passe before a most severe Iudge,
<pb facs="4"/>
carrying in his owne conscience his enditement written, and a perfect register of all his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds: when hee should see the Iudge prepared to passe the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against him, and the same to bee his Vmpire, whome by so many offences hee hath made his enemie: When not onely the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, but even the Angels, should plead against him, and himselfe maugre his will, bee his owne sharpest appeacher: What were to bee done in these dreadfull exigents?</p>
   <p>When hee saw that gastly dungeon and huge goulfe of hell, breaking out with fearefull flames, the weeping, houling, and gnash<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="5"/>
horrour of the place, the rigour of the paine, the terrour of the companie, and the eternitie of all those punishments. Would you thinke them wise that would dallie in so weightie matters, and idlie play away the time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to prevent these intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable calamities? Would you then account it secure, to nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se in your bosome so many ougly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents as sinnes are, or to foster in your soule so many malicious accusers, as mortall faults are?</p>
   <p>Would you not then thinke one life too little to repent for so many iniquities, everie one whereof, were ynough to cast you into those everlasting and unspeakeable torments? Why then doe wee not (at the least)
<pb facs="5"/>
devote that small remnaunt of these our latter dayes, to the making an attonement with God, that our consciences may bee free from this eternall daunger? Who would relie the everlasting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the life to come, upon the gliding▪ slipperinesse, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning streame of our uncertaine life?</p>
   <p>It is a preposterous pollicie (in any wise conceit) to fight against God till our weapons bee blunted, our forces consumed, our lims impotent, and our best spent; and then when wee fall for faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and have sought ourselves almost dead, to presume on his mercie. It were a straunge peece of art, and a very exorbitant course, while the ship is sound,
<pb facs="6"/>
the Pylote well, the marriners strong, the gale favourable, and the sea calme, to lie idle at rode: and when the ship leakes, the Pylote were sicke, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners faint, the stormes boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous, and the sea turmoyled with surges, to launch foorth for a voyage into a farre coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: yet such is the skill of our evening repenters, who though in the soundnesse of health, and in the perfect use of reason, they cannot resolve to weigh the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers that with-hold them from God, neverthelesse, feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a strong persuasion, that when their sences are astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their wits distracted, their understanding dusked, and both bodie and mind racked and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb facs="6"/>
with the throbs aud gripes of a mortall sickenesse, then will they thinke of the weightiest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and become Saints, when they are scarse able to behave themselves like reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? beeing then presumed to bee lesse than men: for how can hee that is assaulted with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settled conscience, distrained with the wringing fits of his dying flesh, maimed in all his abilities, and circled in with so strange en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrances, bee thought of due discretion to dispose of his cheefest iewell, which is his soule? No, no, they that will loiter in seed time, and begin then to sow when others begin to reape: they that will royot out their health, and cast their accounts when they can
<pb facs="7"/>
scarsely speake: they that will slumber out the day, and enter their iourney when the light dooth faile them, let them blame their owne sollic, if they die in debt, and eternall beggerie, and fall beadlong into the lapse of endlesse perdition.</p>
   <p>Great cause have wee then to have an hourely watchfull care over our soule, beeing so daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous assaulted and environed: most insta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

Many shall crie Lord, Lord, and shall not bee accepted: the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Virgines did knocke, but were not admitted: <hi>Iudas</hi> had some sorrow, and yet died despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.

For which cause, let no man so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne long in sinfull securitie, or post over his repentaunce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
