   <head>TO THE CATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Was moued (gentle Reader) to translate this Booke into our mother tongue, for diuers and sundrie causes. First the fame of the authour prouoked me thereunto, who is, not in my priuate opinion, but in the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of alsuch as know gim, a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Prieste and godly Bishoppe, in the iudgement of the world, for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, wisedome, eloquence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found knowledge in al kinde of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in these our daies a singular, yea an odde man. Then I thought it expedient, to impart the benefit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto my vnlearned countrey men,
<pb facs="3"/>
bicause as it was writen generally for the commoditie of al the Churche of Christ, so it was especially meant and as it were dedicated to the Churche and cōmon weal of Englād, vnto the which, as it may appeere both by the epistle which he wrot before vnto the Queenes Maiestie, as also by this Booke, he bare siugular good will. Moreouer I iudged, that mylabour in translating it shuld be the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably emploied, bicause there are in it many goodly exhortations to stirre a mā vp to the loue and feare of God, many holesome lessons, by the whiche a Christian man may direct and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his life, many points of Catholike doctrine (whiche are in these dayes called in controuersie by our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries) so plainly set out, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
<pb facs="3"/>
maie take great profit therof, so lernedly disputed, that such as are wel exercised in Diuinitie, may find wherwith to increase their knowlege. To be short, the thing that most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to take these paines, was, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it conteineth a briefe confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manie erroneous opinions, of much heretical and pestilēt doctrine, comprised in a litle booke, set out these late yeares in the name of M. Haddon: wherin was pretended an answere to the Epistle of Osorius, (which I spake of before) but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte was nothing els, but a numbre of stout assertions faintly prooued, be sprinkled here and there with bitter tauntes, vnsauerie gyrdes, and other the like scomme or froth of vndige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted affections. These were the things
<pb facs="4"/>
that cawsed me to spare some time from my study to trāslate this booke into Englishe for the commoditie of suche as vnderstande not the Latine tongue: wherof if thou shalt receiue any profit (as thou maist very much, if thou reade it with diligence and good iudgement) thanke God of it, and with mindful hart acknowledge his great mercy and goodnes towards vs, in that it hath pleased him in this perilous time, not only to send vs at home in our owne countrie most ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, godlie, and learned men, to be vnto vs a perfecte rule both of good life and true beleefe: but also to moue the heart of this graue Father and reuerēt Bishop (whose learned wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges haue deseruedly obteined so great authoritie thoroughout al the
<pb facs="4"/>
Church of Christ) to pitie the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table state of our most miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied Church, and to laie his helping hand to the repairing of it, employing thervnto the rare gyftes and graces of God, with the which (as thou shalt perceiue by reading this booke) he is most beawtifully adourned and dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. And thus I bid the heartily fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, commending my selfe to thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout praiers, and thee to Almightie God, whome thou shalt most humbly besech, that it maie please him, either of his mercie to turne the heartes of such as are maliciously bent against the true faith of Christe, or els of his iustice to turne the wicked deuises and diuelish practises of Achitophel and all his confederacie to the glorie
