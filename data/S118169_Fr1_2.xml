   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Spouse of
Christ (right
Honorable)
who lyeth in
his bosome,
heareth his
voice, that is
his word: &amp;
keepeth his sacraments in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie,
which she receaued. This
glorious title of his wel-beloued
the Church of Rome doeth falslie
arrogat. For she hath preferred her
owne decrees to his word: to the
one sacrament she hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>dded oile,
<pb facs="3"/>
spittle, salt, and creame: From the
other she hath taken away the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
cup of his precious blood: she
hath set vp in his chaire the man of
sinne: she hath giuen his office of
intercession to Saints, and Angels:
She hath made his house a denne
of theeues, and a market of merites
masses, pardones, and other pelfe,
selling heauen, and hell for siluer,
and golde. Whereby it is cleare to
all men that hath not drunke of the
wine of her fornication, that she is
not the spouse of Christ, but the
skarlet whore, that sitteth on the
beaste with seauen heades, and
hath poysoned the nationes of the
earth with her abhominationes. It
is the guise of a whore to disgrace
the lawful spouse, to whose bedde
shee presumeth, what lyeth in her.
To this end this strumpet hath per
secu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed the welbeloued of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
euer since she gote vppe her
heade. And nowe in our dayes
<pb facs="3"/>
slandereth her with the opprobrie
of a whore, neuer harde of before
the dayes of Luther. To meete
with this contumelie, I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued
this little treatise the laste
winter, at such houres as I coulde
borrowe of my bed: because my
calling holdes me occupied at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times. In it I haue taken for
one of the surest notes of the true
spouse, the sacrament wherein he
communicateth him self, and all
his graces with her. Firste I gather
be seauen argumentes drawen out
of the well of truth, the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the wordes of the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(<hi>this is my bodie</hi>) containing
the right maner howe Christ feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vs with his precious body, and
bloode. Secondly I proue be their
owne testimonies that the fathers
of the primitiue Church, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that sense from Christ, and his
Apostles, and kept it, as they recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it 500 yeares after the firste in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
<pb facs="4"/>
Thirdlye I proue the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of the corruption: and how
it sprang, and grew with the truth
like darnell amongst wheate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence for the space of 300
yeares. Fourthly I shewe howe in
the yeare 800. it beganne to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>appe

so impudent, or ignorant as to
denye a figure, and maintaine a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall
sense in the wordes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
Fifthly that aboute that
same time <hi>Ioannes Scotus</hi> in the time
of <hi>Charles</hi> the greate, &amp; <hi>Bertrame</hi> at
the commandement of <hi>Carolus Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus,</hi>
opossed them selues, &amp; refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that erroure, whereby it maye
seeme, that that noble Prince was
of the same mind. Sixthly that the
better sid cōtinued long a partie, &amp;
that these books were not cōdem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

yeares after they were published.
Seuenthlye that this counsell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<hi>Berengarius</hi> vnhard for an
<pb facs="4"/>
hereticke, and the truth which hee
mentained of heresie. Lastly I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
the storie, that the Church
of Rome euer since persecuting
the truth with fire, and fagot could
neuer get it extinguished. That it
had alwayes assertoures, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that sealed it with their bloode.
In which discourse my intent is to
proue that the church was planted
in the truth be Christ, &amp; his Apost.
not be <hi>Caluin</hi> or <hi>Zuinglius</hi> as our
aduersaries beareth the ignorante
in hand. That there hath beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
since a Church professing it.
That the Church of Rome euer
since the Counsell of Lateran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute
550 yeares hath persecuted
her. That this little barke howbeit
driuen into manye obscure har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures,
yet all the stormes which
the deuill, and antichriste coulde
raise, hath not sunke her. This little
treatise I haue thought good to
dedicate to your Wisdomes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="5"/>
I, and al my trauelles am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
to your common wealth.
Accept my good will, and protect
the truthe with your authoritie.
The Lorde giue you wisdome to
discerne, and heartes to maintaine
his cause. Fare-well in him, who is
the well of well-fare. Edinburgh
the 18. of Febr. Anno. 1602.</p>
