      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as much as the famous Cittie
of London, (wher I am an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,)
is eftsoones infected with
the dangerous disease, called the
Pestilence, to the hindraunce as wel of them
that are cleare, as also of them that haue the
sicknesse in their houses: I (vnderstāding that
the hearbes <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi>
are preseruatiues, and medicines for
this, and many other diseases,) haue thoughte
good to gather out of the writings of learned
Phisicians, a treatise of the Pestilence, annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thervnto the vertues of the sayde herbes,
to the vse and commoditie of Londoners, and
al men elsewhere, that shal haue need of thē.
The vse of the hearbe, and the like treatise
hath bene set forth before time (I graunt) both
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> Latine and English: but in diuerse bookes,

      </gap>arbals, conteyning besides, the properties of
many other hearbes: the other most commonly
in bookes conteyning medicines for a greate
<pb facs="4"/>
number of diseases: and therefore more costly,
than that euery man could buy them. But I
haue ioyned the vertues of these hearbes with
the treatise of the Pestilence, without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of any further matter: and haue set thē
foorth more perfectly than euer they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in any one booke, and that in a few leaues
of Paper, not heauie to be carried, nor long to
be read, nor deare to be bought. For besides the
properties of many hearbes, and medicines for
a great number of diseases, euen in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of the Pestilence, I leaue out many preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiues,
and medicines too costly for them that
are of smal ability: hauing respect to the poore:
who as they can not haue the counsel of the
learned Phisitian, at al times, when they nede:
so are they not able to take those things which
commonly are by him, in wordes, or writing
prescribed. Therefore (gentle Reader,) whether
thou be rich or poore, take this my labor in good
part, and vse it to thy cōmeditie, with thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing
to God, as the Authour of all things
that are healthful, both to the bodie, &amp; to the
soule.</p>
