   <head>TO THOMAS WATSON <hi>Doctor of Diuinitie, Robert Crowley,</hi> Student of the same: vvysheth as to hymselfe, the holy Spirite of God to direct him in all Godly studie.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>WO THINGES CHIEFLYE,</hi> moued me to take in hande, to aunswere your two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which you preached before Queene Marie, and caused to be set forth in print, in the yere of our Lorde. <hi>1554.</hi> One is, for that the estimation that you haue in the Popes Church is such: that whatsoeuer is knowne to be of your doing, is of that sort thought to be so lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly done, that none can be founde amongst vs, able to aunswere any part thereof. I therefore (much inferior to many of my minde in Religion) haue enterprised to encounter with you: hauing now (by Gods prouidence) a time of more leasure therevnto, than at any time since my returne out of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie I haue had. Wyshing that you hauing the lyke leasure, might be licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to replie to this aunswere as you are able: that by the trauaile of vs two nowe being at leasure, the truth of the matters that you entreate of, might be made plaine to such as woulde reade our wrytings, and seeke for knowledge by our labours.</p>
   <p>The other is the subtile handling of the matters that you intreate of: which may easily disceyue the simple Reader, and astunnish the learned that hath not seene and weighed the places that you alledge for your purpose. The subtiltie whereof, I haue set open in such sort: that none can be discey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by you, but such as be perswaded that it is vnpossible for you to lye, or for me to write a truth. I knowe, we may both erre: and therefore, I would wishe that the readers of our writings should set aside all affections, &amp; giue credit to neyther of both, further then they shall by our wrytinges he made vnderstand, that it is the truth that we teach.</p>
   <p>As touching your person, you are to me vnknowne, as I thinke, I am to you: but what minde you were of in religion, when you made these Sermons, I can not but know, by reading and considering of the same, as you also must needes know, what minde I am of, if you will in like maner read and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb facs="4"/> this mine aunswere.</p>
   <p>According as Iesus Christ hath taught, I doe loue both your soule and body: and doe wishe both to be saued, by the bloud of that vnspotted Lambe, that by his death and bloudshedding, hath paide a sufficient raunsome for the sinnes of the whole worlde.</p>
   <p>The errours that you haue taught, I doe vtterly abhorre, as detestable and damnable: wyshing you and all other to doe the same. Embraceing now at the last, the knowne truth: which hath bene long time hid by ignoraunce, from the greatest number that bare the name of Christians, and is nowe by the knowledge of the holye worde of God, made knowne, to as many as will knowe it, and be not wilfull blinde.</p>
   <p>Such truth as you haue taught, I doe wyllingly embrace: and doe not any thing at all, mislike with any thing, for the Authors sake. But my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking is, with the matter that is not to be lyked. And when I doe at any time seme to mislike with the Author, it is for that his words haue no grounde in the holy worde of God, which is as the touchstone to trie all mens writings by.</p>
   <p>Let vs both pray for the spirite of Humilitie, that we may thereby be made meete to receyue and retaine the knowledge of the truth: which God will neuer giue to the prowde, and such as thinke themselues peerelesse, and therefore disdaine the brotherly admonitions of such as in their sight are to simple, to be teachers of such as they be.</p>
   <p>The Lorde Iesus graunt that spirite to as many as professe his name: that we may once be of one minde in the house of the Lorde, to his glorie, and the confusion of Satan. Amen.</p>
