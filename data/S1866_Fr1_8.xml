   <p>VSuall, and ordinary is your contribution to the
reliefe of those, that suffer losse by the High-way
side (the Law requiring it) great is your care and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
almost at euery Session and Assize, in tryall of those,
who that way offend; seriously to bee lamented is the
losse of many young Gentlemen (well descended) who
haue beene, for that fact, found guilty, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
suffered, vntimely ignominious, yet deserued
deaths; These mischiefes, and inconueniences I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued,
and seriously considered; so that (partly to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
my owne foule offences, partly to procure ease vnto
my burdened conscience, but most especially that the like
may not bee hereafter) I haue written this Discouery,
which I entitle my <hi>Recantation;</hi> I haue heereby not onely
preuented the baser sort of people from committing such
rebellious out-rages, but also laid open to the better sort
(I meane too such as are of Gentle Parentage) the foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and basenesse of the Act, that who so hath the least
rellish of a Gentleman, will be no more seduced, and that
way misled; now if it take this good effect (as I heartily
wish it may) I shall account my selfe happy, although I
continue still,</p>
