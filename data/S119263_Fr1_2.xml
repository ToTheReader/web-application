fit to

Treatises of <hi>Devotion</hi> are
most fit: as being freest
from offence, and fullest
of divine matter. If com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
may bee made
betwixt parts of sacred
Scripture, the Psalmes of
<hi>David</hi> have an excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in that they consist of
matters of <hi>Devotion.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the stile of
his name, is the stile of
<pb facs="3"/>
his book. The stile of his
name was,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and tooke much delight
therein. The rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
GOD incited
him to doe what GOD
required to be done. So
the Booke of Psalmes,
may well carry this stile,
<hi>A booke after Gods owne
heart,</hi> in that nothing is
more acceptable unto
GOD, nothing wherein
hee takes more delight
then <hi>Devotion.</hi> And no
<pb facs="3"/>
booke of sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
fuller of <hi>Devotion</hi>
then that booke. Most of
the Psalmes wholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
of <hi>Prayers</hi> or <hi>Praises:</hi>
very few, if any at all,
wherein there are not
some divine raptures,<note place="margin">Devotio▪ est pius &amp; humilia affectus in <hi>DEVM</hi> humilis ex conscientia infirmita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis pro priae: pius ex consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratione divinae clementiae Aug▪ de Spir. &amp; Anima Cap 50.</note>
and such heavenly ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
as manifest an
heart full of <hi>Devotion.</hi>
For <hi>Devotion is a pious
and humble affection to
God-wards. Humble
through conscience of a
mans owne infirmity. Pious
through a due consideration
of the divine clemency.</hi>
Such <hi>Devotion</hi> is never
more fully and to the
<pb facs="4"/>
life manifested then in
Prayers and Praises. For
in these divine duties, if
rightly performed, the
soule presents it selfe
before GOD, and that in
a speciall manner, being
after a sort even rapt
out of the body. Then,
if ever, doth the soule,
so farre as it is capable,
with an holy admiration
apprehend the divine
Majesty, Purity, Justice,
Wisdome, Power, yea
Mercy, Goodnesse, and
other excellencies wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
GOD is decked.
Then, if ever is the
soule brought throughly
<pb facs="4"/>
to discerne its owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">

         </gap> dixit Arist.</note>
impurity, base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
vilenesse and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse.
For contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
paralleld,<note place="margin">Rhet lib. 3 cap. 2.</note> or laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
doe most lively
set forth each other in
their owne proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
He that liveth in
a darke dungeon, will be
enamoured with the
bright shining of the
Sun, when hee can have
liberty to see it. And hee
that hath long lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
bright Sun-shine,
more thorowly discernes
the horrour and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of darknesse. Now
GOD and man are in
<pb facs="5"/>
many respects directly
opposite each to other:
This opposition is best
discerned in our most
serious contemplations
of Gods excellencies and
due consideration of our
owne manifold infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which is most to
purpose done in acts and
exercises of Devotion.
In this respect this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Treatise is worthy
of all acceptation, even
for the subject matter
whereof it consisteth,
which is <hi>divine Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Herein you shall
observe GOD most
highly advanced; and
<pb facs="5"/>
man most lowly deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
GOD advanced
above the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
Man dejected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the lowest parts of
the earth. GOD mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
in his mercies, and
justified in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
Man judged and
condemned according
to his just deserts. If the
Author of a Worke add
any thing to the worth
of a Worke, the Author
of this Worke must
needs add much to the
worth of it. For he was
a man of a profound
judgement, and a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
spirit: which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
<pb facs="6"/>
are most fit for
matters of <hi>Devotion. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi>
must have fire in
it, in which respect a
zealous spirit is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite.
<hi>Devotion</hi> hath
an especiall reference to
GOD, in which respect
solid judgement is also
requisite. As all the true
genuine Workes of this
Author give evidence
of his more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
spirit, so this Modell
especially. By it you
may perceive what
kinde of fire fired the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
which hee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up to GOD. Wee

That fire which once
came from the LORD
being continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
all things which
required fier in the
Tabernacle were to bee
fired therewith, as all
manner of sacrifice, and
incense. Such a fire, a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall,
a divine fire,
which must needs come
from the LORD, set on
fire the spirituall sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and sacred incense
which this Priest of the
LORD, the Author of
<pb facs="7"/>
this Treatise, offered up
to his GOD. We ought
therefore to give the
more earnest heed heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
and to helpe our
owne devotion, and to
quicken and enflame
our own spirits thereby.
Without all question the
Modells of some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
persons Devotion,
may be a singular helpe
to others Devotion.
Every one that hath this
divine fier of Devotion
in his soule, cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
readily bring fit
fuell to make it flame
forth. But when fuell
is brought by others, it
<pb facs="7"/>
will soone take, and
quickly flame out. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is this (as some too
weakly, though very
violently cavill) to stint
the spirit of supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For the worke of
the Spirit consists not
so much in the words
and phrases whereby
the matter of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is expressed, as in
the intention of the
heart, and in the intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and earnestnesse of
the affection, wherin the
very forme, soule and
life of true Devotion
consisteth. Otherwise,
the spirit of all GODS
<pb facs="8"/>
people in all publicke
Liturgies, and formes of
prayer would be stinted:
yea by this reason the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of every one that joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
with another in
prayer (except his spirit
onely who conceiveth
and uttereth the prayer)
would be stinted. And
if so, then away with
publick assemblies for
prayer: away with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
meetings to call
upon GOD: away with
all meetings of two
or three together in
CHRISTS name, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
CHRISTS
promise of being in the
<pb facs="8"/>
midst of them (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.
20.) But rather away

Psalme beares this title,
<hi>A Prayer for the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
when he is overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and powreth out his
<pb facs="9"/>
complaint before the
LORD.</hi> This title appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
sheweth that the
Prophet who first pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this Psalme, did it
in the persons and for the
use of any poore distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
servant of GOD. So
as we thereby are taught
what to pray when our
sins lie heavy upon us, or
when we are in any other
distresse. It is expressely
said that <hi>Iohn taught his
Disciples to pray, Luke</hi> 11.
1. This questionlesse was
done by prescribing unto
them a forme of prayer.
Whereupon when a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of CHRIST said
<pb facs="9"/>
unto him, <hi>LORD teach
us to pray as</hi> John <hi>also
taught his Disciples, he
said unto them, when ye
pray, say Our Father which
art in Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> As
<hi>Iohn</hi> had prescribed a
forme to his Disciples, so
CHRIST doth to his:
and so teacheth them to
pray, as <hi>Iohn</hi> did his. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
formes of prayers
were by the Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
composed for the
Churches in their daies.
In like manner have all
Christian Churches in
succeeding ages, had
their particular formes.
Never had any age, or
<pb facs="10"/>
countrey more pious,
pithy formes then ours,
some for publick, others
for private use, among
which the forme here
tendered unto thee hath
its excellency. As it is
lawfull to have such
helpe, so may such an
helpe be very usefull.</p>
