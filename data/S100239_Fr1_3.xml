It is no meaning of myne, to giue you heere, the full relation of this life; but I only shew, euen by the circumstance of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent man who wrote the same, what account our <hi>Authour</hi> deserueth at our hands; which must needs rebound vpon this Booke, so farre, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease your estimation therof. For this reason also, you shall vnderstand, that when he was yet in health, and subiect to the greatest importunity of busines, he<note n="(g)" place="margin">He was a man of very great Prayer.</note>
      <hi>mentally prayed</hi> foure houres euery day; and he <hi>slept</hi> but foure, euery night.
<pb facs="7"/>When afterward he grew into sicknes (which he was subiect to, and that in greate extremity, for those seauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares, which did immediately precede his death) it is probable, that he must <hi>sleep</hi> much lesse; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

      <hi>Booke,</hi> and the rest of his excellent workes in this kind, were not so much the issue of a studious and speculatiue brayne, as of a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>eeding and boyling hart. Boyling, through the loue of God; and bleeding, for the sins of the world.

<pb facs="7"/>it is the lesse wonder, if his words vvere like so many burning coales, which might serue, to seare those soules which are full of festred soares; and to set such others as are sound, on fire, vvith the loue of Almighty God.</p>
   <p>And in the same spirit, he hath also written a large Booke of Sermons vpon the B. Sacrament, and vpon some festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uityes of our B. Lady; as also a Booke of Epistles to seuerall persons, vpon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall occasions; vvhich I would to God some Reader, who hath knowledg of that language would take the paines or rather pleasure to translate. For I am much deceaued if there be any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to be obtayned, or any vice to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded, or any necessity to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or any affliction to be asswaged, wherein a man may not find some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent addresse for his purpose, in the reading of those works aforesaid, which he was inspired to write by the loue, &amp; for the loue of God.</p>
   <p>This loue of God being in him so
<pb facs="8"/>hoat, did make him profoundly loue, that which God loued so much; &amp; the ardent desire which he had to<note n="(i)" place="margin">How hethirsted after the saluation of soules.</note> gaine such (which were the soules of men, for whom Christ dyed) to God; made him employ the credit which he found with some great <hi>Prelates,</hi> and other great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (as the vvriter of his life relates) in procuring them to found<note n="(k)" place="margin">Life of D. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <pb facs="9"/>
   <p>This <hi>charity</hi> of God, the <hi>Authour</hi> doth gladly make appeare, vpon all occasions, and by great variety of most iust motiues; but especially, doth his soule euen regorge againe, when he enters into speach of the<note n="(r)" place="margin">He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth himselfe, whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he growes to speake of the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Life,</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus our Lord.</note>
      <hi>Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp; <hi>Life,</hi> &amp; <hi>Passion</hi> of our Lord <hi>Iesus.</hi> Which he pondereth so cōtemplatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet so sensibly; so profoundly, and yet so plainly; so strictly, and yet so tenderly; as is able to make, euen brasse to blush, and iron to burne, and lead to melt, for the greife, and shame, of the much, that we haue sinned; and for loue of him, in respect of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, that he hath suffered for vs. That so, in fine, we may heerafter make the consideration of the sacred <hi>Passion</hi> of our Lord, a great part of our busine, in this life; since it is by it, that we must be happy in the next, vnles we haue a mind to remayne in torment for all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. And that we may, at length, both with our hart, and tongue, make this prayer to the diuine Maiesty, to
<pb facs="9"/>which our Author exhorts<note n="(s)" place="margin">A holy prayer, which he makes in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</note> vs in his discourse vpon the <hi>Passion, That the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, may not permit vs to be so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as not to be content so much, as to thinke, or meditate, vpon those vast affronts, &amp; tormēts which the Son of God (being the King of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and God himselfe) was content, not only to consider, but to suffer. Yea and so to suffer, as that the infinite desire of loue, wherewith he suffered them, may euen put the things thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as it were, to silence; how lowd soeuer, they otherwise, deserue to be crying out, in the eares of our hart. And this he did, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all interest of his owne, and only for our eternall good</hi> (as the <hi>Author</hi> doth excellēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare) <hi>that so, insteed of enemyes, and rebels, &amp; most wicked slaues, which naturally by our descent from Adam, we were, in the fight of God, we might be translated, into the condition, of being made his seruants, his friends, &amp; his adopted sonnes, vpon the price of his owne pretious life.</hi> This is the nayle that he beats most vpon; and I beseech our Lord, that our harts may be euen riuetted to his diuine hart, thereby.</p>

   <p>In the meane tyme, you the <hi>Reader,</hi> must not spend your hope, vpon the meeting heer with<note n="(t)" place="margin">Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the stile.</note> any curious, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborate stile. For though euen in this kind, the <hi>Author</hi> be far inough frō fault; yet, <hi>composition,</hi> was the thing, which he might well disdaine to affect; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the inualuable <hi>stone</hi> which he was exposing, did deserue to be most highly esteemed, though it were not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially either <hi>cut,</hi> or <hi>set.</hi> Nor<note n="(u)" place="margin">Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Authors concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> yet, are you heer, so much as to think of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring certain flourishing, &amp; fading cōceits; though I am much deceaued, if the most fastidious mind, wil not heere find matter, whereupon to feed with great delight. But the <hi>Authours</hi> ayme, was at a fairer marke. It is not the clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of handes which he begs; he<note n="(x)" place="margin">He shootes at the soules of men, and not, at the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tickling of their eares, or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of their handes.</note> shoots at no lesse, then the souls of mē; &amp; them he conuinceth, by so pregnant reasons, and obligeth by so plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, as to make them glad (or, or least, he giues them cause, why they should be so) to cast away that
<pb facs="10"/>loose liberty, which made them slaues, to their own passions; &amp; to step, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to leap, into the chaines of the <hi>loue</hi> of God, which will put them, into a kind of <hi>soueraignity,</hi> not only ouer all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges created, but euen ouer their very selues.</p>
   <p>And<note n="(y)" place="margin">The extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary great care, wherwith he condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth his Reader, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</note> in this he equalleth in my poore opiniō, if he do not rather excel, any other whom I haue read, That he most carefully doth conduct the soule, which he instructeth in the way of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; accompanying his discourse with aboundance of caution; so to saue his Reader from sliding into any extreme; and being no lesse sollicitous, to guide him straight, then a tender mother, or nurse would be, to lead her only child, by the sleeues or armes, for feare least otherwise he might take a fall. I<note n="(z)" place="margin">The occasion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he wrote this booke.</note> will further premise to you, vpon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion he wrote this Booke; and to whom he did particulerly direct the same; and then, by way of preuention, I will both make, and answere an obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="11"/>to the end, that your selfe may be kept from errour afterward.</p>
   <p>There was a Lady, called<note n="(a)" place="margin">The person for whom he wrote it.</note>
      <hi>Donna Sancba</hi> the daughter of the Lord of <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalcaçar;</hi> who for her beauty, and other better parts, was designed to serue the <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Spayne,</hi> in quality of a <hi>Lady of Honour.</hi> Already, she was euen vpon the point of parting, from her parents; who had put her into an equipage, which was to haue becom a Court. But, before her iourney, she meant to arme her selfe with the holy <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> &amp;, in the strength of that desire, she went and cast her selfe, at the feet of <hi>Doctour Auila,</hi> in the way of <hi>Confession.</hi> She would after say, that he reprooued her a little sharply, for bringing a hart, which pretended to be penitent for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, in a body set out, &amp; ardorned too curiously, &amp; too costly for such a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. What els passed between them, in that priuate conference, and <hi>Confession</hi> of hers, God, and they do only know; but the sequele thereof, was notorious
<pb facs="11"/>to the world. For she, instantly, did vnturne Courtier; she grew quickly to cast away her vaine, and sumptuous attires; and she betooke her selfe (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugh only in her Fathers house) to a course of admirable pennance, &amp; recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, which she accompanied with a <hi>Vow</hi> of <hi>perpetuall chastity;</hi> wherein she dyed, most holily, and most happily, some ten yeares after. This <hi>Lady</hi> then as being the <hi>Child,</hi> and <hi>Creature</hi> (as it were) in spirit of <hi>Doctour Auila,</hi> was deare to him, after an extraordinary manner. And so, for her, both consolation, and instruction, he made this Booke, of <hi>Audi Filia;</hi> and she esteemed it as she ought; for she neuer would know, or call it by other name, then of her <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi> But when she was gone to God, he took the Booke againe to himselfe; and enlarged it, and enriched it to that proportion, which, at this day, we see it beares.</p>
   <p>Now, in regard that he chiefely speakes therein, to her, as to a person,
