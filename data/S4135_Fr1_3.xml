   <p>COnsider, Gentle Reader, that all Knowledge and Learning is descended f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>om rudenes, and inclines to return unto it. With much pain it was brought forth: so with might and main it must bee held up, lest all runn into confusion again. And this is the work of the Prophet. All piles incline to confusion the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>for hee seeketh to save the Law. Because in language ther bee many kindes. weigh his rule, hee write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the five books, five books: under the five beginnings out of the five books; to wit, the first wordes of every book. That he so purposed: the ends and the beginnings, do throughly prove. They make every one a perfect conclusion, and beginn directly upon the first wordes of the same book in the Law. Though the books bee precisely five: yet the number of the psalm continueth through all, which cannot but intend mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. This way is not strange to Poets, to descant upon words by allegoricall discours. by this, hee travaileth onely upon the mysteryes, and doubtfullnes of the Law, or the termes of it, in the propheticall or heavenly stile, takeing his frame from the Prophets. And this shall suffice to make the psalmes to argue the Law. Every glory hath his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering: Is. 4. so the psalms are a brief copy of the Law. They treat of the Law and of the King, as every Law must have a King. as it is a kingdom. The Law is made out of the vertues, and the psalms ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ll it much out of the names of God. The psalms do carry a fair outward stile, but their treasure is within them; and that is their holines. They are indeed the revelation of the Law and the Prophets. His way is all upon A. B. C. defect, abounding, or disordered, becaus the Letters bee so significant. This is no strange lerning, for most of the other books of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>he bible play the like. By any strangenes in the constructiō, you shal find the mystery. he works every psalm to agree with the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it, by the significatiō of the letters: becaus the letters in the tongue be so significant, that it were absurd to neglect thē, of frowardnes to thwart the allusion, or to cross them. Vnder such a cloud hee passeth, and with such a vail hee revealeth. The curiosity is not to bee wondred at, yf you consider the diligence of the Masorites, and Rabbins, and their thirteen rules for the study of the Law. He draweth all to the immortall life of the Law, and the kingdom of God, and the power and glory therof, the way of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and commendation therof, for his title PRAISES. yf this bee his way, I have set your feet therin, and I rejoyce. As for my way: first I have not versed the Psalms, becaus they can carry no mystery with us, &amp; becaus the coherence is scattered, by the curiosity of the work, that it is like a latine vers, with great distance between the Concords, neither can a psalm be construed but with relation from end to end. I have cut them into three parts, so much the better to conclude them: by how much the greater the sections are, for the gathering of the more sens before the pause. The busines of every psalm beeing threefold: the section naturally agreeth. As a Proposition, Example, and Conclusion. Mark the first psalm. Such a one is happy. How? Like a tree &amp;c. And why? Becaus. or for, &amp;c. So moste commonly the division will answer to thes questions, what, how, and why, though the psalm cannot bee cut precisely at the question. My Quotations are ordered in three Columnes, unversed, for the multiplicity of them. The first of Psalms, the next of the Law and first Prophets, to wit, all the books to Isaiah. The last, all from Isaiah and likewise the new testament. They are of as many kindes as ther can be questions: somtimes for the language, somtimes for sens, somtimes for matter, sometimes for form, sometimes for phrase, sometime for wordes, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for construction, quality, time or place, &amp;c. by the points they are to bee apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. You shall know them by their fruit, and shall soon see by the recommendation of places in the psalmes: what profit will com of the rest of all the books, yf they were requoted accordingly. for so the vers may well be spared. For variation of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter both in word and Clause: it manifesteth, how the Construction goeth, and accent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the matter and sense of every Psalme; and that in many respects. The Capitals are for Generals, to which all parts have relation. And they are usually doubled and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed: that they may be noted. The change in the Clause, is a satisfaction to all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<pb facs="4"/>
according as the stile declineth: often doubled and multiplied also. My arguments are of this sort; first, a representing of the psalme, in proper or figurative language. Secondly, a Construction which applyeth it self wholely to the letters and exposition of them. And thirdly, how every psalm hath dependance from the first words of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per book of the law. And all is to revive the Prophet, and bring his glory to light, for a light unto all nations, and a glory to our own. God give Light, and also Grace. Farewell.</p>
