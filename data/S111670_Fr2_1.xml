                 <title>A geometrical practise, named Pantometria : diuided into three bookes, longimetra, planimetra, and stereometria, containing rules manifolde for mensuration of all lines, superficies and solides: with sundry straunge conclusions both by instrument and without, and also by perspectiue glasses, to set forth the true description or exact plat of an whole region: framed by Leonard Digges gentleman, lately finished by Thomas Digges his sonne. Who hathe also thereunto adioyned a mathematicall treatise of the fiue regulare Platonicall bodies, and their Metamorphosis or transformation into fiue other equilater vniforme solides Geometricall, of his owne inuention, hitherto not mentioned of by any geometricians</title>

   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the Rules and Preceptes already geuen abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly may suffice for the exact mensuration of any mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Solides or vessels that are vsually occupied, or may be proponed to be moten, yet for the satisfaction also of such as deliting in matters only new, rare and difficile, séeke to reache aboue the common sorte, I haue thought good to adioyne this Treatise of the 5 <hi>Platonicall</hi> bodies, meaning not to discourse of their secrete or mysticall appliances to the Elementall regions and frame of Celestiall Spheres, as things remote and farre distant from the Methode, nature and certaintie of Geometrical demonstration, only héere I intend Mathematically to cōferre the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall and Solide capacities of these Regulare bodies with their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing or inscribed spheres or Solides, &amp; Geometrically by <hi>Algebraycall</hi> Calculations to search out the sides, Diameters, <hi>Axes,</hi> Altitudes, and lines <hi>Diagonal,</hi> together with the Semidimetients of their Equiangle Bases, containing or contained Circles, and as in the Problemes ye shal perceiue by Preceptes and Examples, the quantities and proportions of all these lines, Superficies and Crassitudes, with numbers Rationall and Radicall expressed, so haue I by <hi>Theoremes</hi> sowne the séede of Rules innumerable, wherin the studious may delite him selfe with infinite varietie: Finally I shall in the last Chapiter by Diffinitions and <hi>Theoremes</hi> partly set forthe the forme, nature and proportion of other fiue vniforme Geometricall So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides, created by the transformation of the fiue bodyes Regulare or Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall: but not in so ample manner, as the noueltie or difficultie of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requireth, meaning as I sée these the first frutes of my studies liked and accepted, to bestowe time and trauaile vppon an other peculiare Uolume,
<pb facs="75"/>
which shall conteyne, not onely the demonstrations of these Theorems of spherall solides, but also of <hi>Conoydall, Parabollical, Hyperbollical</hi> and <hi>Ellepseycal</hi> circumscribed &amp; inscribed bodies, &amp; many mo lynes &amp; solides produced by the sections of these, and reuolution of their sectiōs: but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to this present Treatise, let no man muse y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> writing in the English toung, I haue retayned the Latin or Gréeke names of sundry lines and figures, as cordes Pentagonall, lines Diagonall, Icosaedron, Dodecae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, or such like, for as the Romanes and other Latin writers, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the copiouse and abundante eloquence of their toung, haue not shamed to borrow of the Gretians these and many other termes of arte: so surely do I thinke it no reproche, either to the English toung, or any English writer, where fitte words fayle to borrow of them both, but rather should we séeme therby to do them great iniurie, these béeing in déede certayne testimonies and memorials where such sciences firste tooke their originall, and in what languages and countreys they chieflye florished, which names or words how straunge soeuer they séeme at the firste acquayntaunce, by vse will grow as familiar as these, a triangle, a circle, or suche like, which by custome and continuance séeme méere En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, yet to auoyde all obscuritie that may grow by the noueltie of them, I haue adioyned euery of their diffinitions, and so proceded to Problems and Theoremes with suche methode, as howe obscure or harde soeuer they appeare at the firste, through the rarenesse of the matter: I doubt not but by orderly reading, the ingeniouse Student, hauing any meane taste of cossicall numbers, shall finde them playne and easie.</p>
