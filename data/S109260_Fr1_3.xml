   <head>To all his Honourable Friends, or Honest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
Wel-wishers whereso-euer.</head>
   <p>IT would well become a deuote <hi>Hermite</hi> to begin with
<hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> vnto you, but that I hold friuolous, since
if you want <hi>Grace,</hi> go by <hi>Ieronimo,</hi> you are no friends for me:
and if you be not men of <hi>Peace,</hi> it is not my <hi>Hermites</hi> Staffe,
and my little bucker-clapdish, that will appease you, wherefore
<hi>Shokkatorum,</hi> that which will bee shall bee. If you will bee quiet
and leaue your mocking tongue you may, if not, floute on by leaue, the more
sport it breeds you, the gladder I am (as the <hi>Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> saies)
that I haue it for you. Cunning Lawyers, vpon the false mistaking of a
<hi>T.</hi> or an <hi>N.</hi> or putting in a dash ouer-plus (if the Debtor
bee rich and able roundly to fee them) will make a Writ of Error of any thing:
doe not so by mee I beseech you, for I am a very bad writer of
<hi>Orthography,</hi> and can scarce spell my <hi>Abcie</hi> if it were
laid before mee. The <hi>Printer</hi> may helpe mee to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to you true
<hi>English,</hi> but as I am a true man to God and the King, hee findes it
not in my Coppy. I meane well, that I am sure, and if I had better meanes to
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, I would make you better vnderstand it: in the meane time, what
is but meane, take it in as good part, as if it were the highest treble that
the cleerest Poetical war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling throate could shrill or quauer forth.
Dangerous mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreting I feare not, 
<q>
         <pb facs="4"/>
         <l>Since <hi>Enuy,</hi> that blacke venom'd To ad swolne
Elfe,</l>
         <l>Nere slanders a cleere conscience to it
selfe.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Onely if you could a little dispence here and there with a hard
Rime or two, (in which yet you shall not say but there is some reason)
and my verses that are like Cheaters false Dice of high-men and low-men,
one while eights, now tennes, another while foure-teenes, and sometimes
sixes, I will number you, (though I keepe no numbers) in the fore-most
ranke of my benefactors and fauourers. Me thinks a King by birth as I am,
should not debase himselfe to intreate so much. And yet I remember an
old schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes game of <hi>King by your leaue</hi> (euer since I was a
boy my selfe) and so I am afraid you will cry, <hi>King by your leaue, we
are to haue about with you, beare it off with the head and shoulders how you
can.</hi> But if you do, vpon all the Cannes and quart-pots about
<hi>London</hi> I will be sworne, (all Wine-pots from this generall rule
excepted, for them I haue for-sworne till <hi>Michelmas,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the new wine of <hi>Peru,</hi> that is made of no <hi>Grape,</hi> but a
strange fruite in the <hi>VVest-indies,</hi> and is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to
the braine and the stomacke, then any restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or cordiall
whatsoeuer) vpon them I say I will abiure and renounce, all claime or
interest I haue had in that wicked word of <hi>Poetry,</hi> and bind my
selfe and my heires, neuer more to be publicans and sinners, (or sinners
in publique) in that vnfortunate Art of <hi>Printing.</hi> It hath bene told
mee, that those that are slaine with the <hi>Indians</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>poysoned arrowes, die with their mouthes shut, and how the Butchers
in <hi>Germany,</hi> kill their sheep after the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same order, by
tying a cord about their mouthes, and so strangling them, that their
flesh may be more swolne and puft vp: so would I die, by my good will, if
this my labour mis-carry, and haue my mouth closed vp from euer spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
or writing hence-forward. Had I had learning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, I would haue framed an
inuectiue against lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, because, I know, none saue the learned will
finde fault with me: but seeing I haue it not, I must heere end my
Epistle, and desire such as descend to deepely into my
shallownesse, no otherwise to esteeme of my writings then of Drummes
and Trumpets in warre: which are not vsed so much to stir vp men to fury,
as to teach them to march in measure.</p>
