health. In all these thinges are certaine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
vertues, whiche be manifeste signes of
goddes loue and fauoure towardes man: for
he created them to thintent that men should
vse them, glorifie him, and geue him thankes
for them. And because the vse and knowledge
of them, and their vertues, is so expedient for
al creatures, God of his mere goodnes, hath
not onely geuen vnto the diligent searchers
therof, the gifte of perfitte vsage, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge
of their operation in this time of
Christianitie: but also vnto infideles before
Christ, beynge ignoraunt from whence that
gyfte came: who, notwithstanding their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce,
did so reuerence the wonderful ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tues
of thinges created in the worlde, that
they thought that eche of those thinges had
had in it selfe a certaine diuine power, or els
that there was of euery thinge a seueral god
or creatour. Now, if they gaue suche honoure
vnto thinges created, not knowinge the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atoure,
what woulde they haue doen, if they
had knowen and confessed God to haue bene
the onely maker of the worlde, of man, and of
all thinges therin, of nothinge? Trulye they
woulde not haue done as some curious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
amonge vs nowe a dayes do, whiche
(as your honour well vnderstandeth) moste
impudentlye despise all maner of medecines,
and ignorauntly dispute against the vertues
and operation of herbes, and trees, sayinge:
<pb facs="2"/>
that if the sicke man be appointed of God to
dye, all the medecines in the worlde can not
saue his life. Whervnto it may easely be aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that euery man that is vexed with a
disease, is not appointed of God to die of the
same: but the infirmitie is sent him as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for his offences, and yet hath God
created thinges to geue him ease and remedy
for his disease, which no Christē man ought
to contempne or despise: for he that despiseth
the worke, seemeth to contempne the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
And agayne, because that the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and determination of God, concerning
the life and death of man, is so secrete, and so
farre beyonde the capacitie of mans reason,
and vnderstandinge, and that we know not
when God hath prefixed the terme of our life,
we vse in our infirmities and weaknes, those
remedies that God hath created to be recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
at their handes, to whome he hath geuen
the knowledge howe to minister theim vnto
vs. All these thinges are abundantly ynough
knowen vnto your honour, with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more reasons then I am able to alledge,
and therfore I do but bring owles to Athens
in declaringe this vnto you. But thus much
I may well saye, that moost madde are they,
and voyde of all reason &amp; Christianitie, that
wyle set so light by the workes of God: yea,
they are vnprofitable members of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
welth, not worthy to bear the name of
<pb facs="3"/>
Christians: for by their fonde and false per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
to the ignoraunte and simple ones
in their diseases, against the receiuing of any
medicines, many times it chaūceth, that thei
folowynge their foolishe aduise in neglectyng
Phisick, thei be cast away and perishe, whiche
otherwise might haue bene saued. Me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this should be sufficient to perswade thē
to embrace good and holesome remedies: thei
see daylie that herbes, oinctmentes, plaisters
made of thinges growing on the earth, and
suche like, by their vertues, do cure and heale
externall and outwarde woundes, sores, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
swellinges, and other infirmities of the
body, and yet they will not beleue that suche
vertues can heale the internall and inwarde
diseases. Vtterly ignoraunte be thei, that so
imagine with them selues, for thei that des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise
Phisick, despise a heauenly science. But
what be thei that thus contempne it? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soth
ignoraunt &amp; vnlearned men, that barke
at, and backbite theim that take paines for
the commoditie of all men. But it is comonly
seene and proued. <hi>Scientia non habet ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micum
praeter ignorantem.</hi> Whiche saiynge
(I feare me) is verified more in some of vs
Englishe men, than in anye other nation, I
woulde God it were not. And yet I thincke
there is no man so bestiall, so rude, or so blunt
of wit, but that he is (by a certaine instinct of
natural inclinatiō) desirous to know things
<pb facs="3"/>
not before knowen, to heare newes not before
heard, and to vnderstand bokes in his mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
tonge, written first in a forein langage,
to thende not to seme altogether ignoraunte
in matters both of the liberall sciences, and
also of histories, set forth for his rudiment and
instruction, as in <hi>Cosmographie, in Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
in Philisophie, in Logike, in Rhetoricke,</hi>
and specially in Phisick, whereof we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so muche neede as in these our daies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the straunge and vnknowen diseases
that swarme amonge vs, and mo in number
then can be found remedy for. Therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
with my self (right honorable) that
I could not better declare my bounden duetie
vnto you, nor do my countrey a greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
than to put some thinge abroade vnder
youre honoures name, whereby it mighte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
some commodite: I haue taken in hand
to translate this noble and excellent woorke
called, <hi>The Secretes of the Reueuerende Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
Alexis of Piemount,</hi> firste written in the
Italian toungue, and after tourned into
Frenche, and of late into Dutche, and nowe
laste of al into English, because that as well
Englishe men, as Italians, Frenche menne,
or Dutchmen, may sucke knowlege and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
hereof: beyng a work come out of the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ds
of so famous a man as <hi>Alexis</hi> is, and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fyrste to suche a noble prince as the duke of
Sauoye is, to whome trifles or fables are
<pb facs="4"/>
not to be presented, nor beinge a man vnder
whose name and protection lies or vayne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions
oughte to be sette forth. Therefore
wayinge the age, the learninge and fame of
the auctor, &amp; the nobilitie of the saied Prince,
men may easely iudge that suche intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
paynes haue not bene taken in the colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of these secretes, to blowe an vntrueth
into mennes eares, but rather that this boke
hath ben published and communicated to the
worlde by the saied <hi>Alexis,</hi> for the care and
good zeale that he had to the health of mens
bodies, and that men of all countreys might
haue the knowledge of that with ease, sitting
at home in their studies, whiche he got with
greate trauayle and laboure, wandering al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moste
al the world ouer, as in his epistle here
to the reader he declareth.</p>
   <p>And nowe (right honourable) like as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher
Plantine of Antwarpe, the printer of
this worke in Frenche, chose the Prince of
Piemount, to protecte and adourne the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of his labours, vnder the honoure of his
name: euen so I the translatour hereof into
our Englishe tounge, haue thoughte it my
duety (with your honours fauour) to presente
this my translation vnto you, and to putte it
forth vnder your honours name and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
desiring, and humbly requiring the same,
to accept my poore good wyll, hauinge good
hope that you shall finde suche thinges in the
<pb facs="4"/>
discourse of the whole booke, that you will
not onely take pleasure in the knowledge of
them: but also commoditie, if it please you to
put in experience and proofe, those that seme
moste best vnto you: whereof there bee some
as excellente and as easie, as were euer sette
foorthe in any toungue, as by your honours
wisedom and iudgement, in the readyng you
shall easely perceiue. I am not able suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
to praise the excellencie of the boke, and
the diligence of the aucthour, ner to extol the
wonderfull giftes of God in men, whiche ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng
to their talent, impart to the worlde
the encrease and fruicte of soche giftes, as he
distributeth vnto them. Of the whiche giftes
I thinke I should not moche erre, if I saied
Phisike to be the best and the moste necessary
<hi>Nam si corporum nostrorū, &amp; tranquillitatis
vitae (quae sine secunda valetudine vix esse
potest) rationem habere volumus, fatebimur
medicinam excellentissimam, mortalibus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessariam
esse.</hi> And euen so <hi>Cornelius Celsus</hi>
whiche wrote moste excellente Bookes of
Phisike, affirmeth saiyng. <hi>Alimēta sanis cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poribus
agricultura promittit: sanitatem au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
aegris medicina: et idcirco deo optimo
maximo gratias habere debimus, qui vitam
nobis elargitus est: deinde medico, qui eam
nobis conseruat, diuturniorem{quod} facit.</hi>

All this learninge and knowledge doo the
Greke auctors affirme to be most aunciente,
and most necessary in a common welth. For,
as it is desyred of all men to liue in health of
body, so is it requisite that medecines, both
preseruatiue and curatiue, be hadde and vsed
amonge men, whiche not onelye comforteth
the infirme and diseased bodye, but also put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the soule in remembraunce of Goddes
great power and myght, that hath geuen
suche vertue vnto thinges growing on
the earth, for mannes commoditie,
preseruation, and health: which
health I pray God longe to
remayne with you, and
all your family
with
much encrease of vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure,
vnder the protection
of almightye God.</p>
