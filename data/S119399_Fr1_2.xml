   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, LORD THOMAS HOVVARD, Earle of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, Lord Chamberlaine, one of his Maiesties most Honourable priuie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and his very singular good Lord, T.

   <p> All actions of poize better accomplish their wished ende, either by remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a dutifull affection (I si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence both solid direction and adiument, which onely preuent errour, and supply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="3"/>
to demerit) may worthily declaime against the <hi>pioners</hi> of due desert (giue me leaue to vse that word) who bury it in base obliuion. Yet we all, I can truly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch (as that Honourable oracle of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">Northampt.</note> could say) doe happily liue vnder <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,</hi> vnder the golden line of <hi>Iustice, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> so that we cannot tell whether nights or daies be more happily passed o're our heades. Yet this surely is (nether doth errour transport me) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard<note place="margin">Iulian in his Casar.</note> of our happie <hi>Marcus Philosophus,</hi> (whome <hi>Silenus</hi> in his <hi>pasquil</hi> could not carpe at, so worthie was his deportment) I say in respect of the <hi>Princely Head</hi> it selfe chiefly, to many the fountaine heade of honour; and as we may rightly say in generall (if considering <hi>Iustice</hi>) deriuing honourable equitie to all. Nor can I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach some of the <hi>noblest senses</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants on this head; who in a <hi>Iustice Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall</hi> are euer wont to parallel reward with merit, and not like <hi>Salomons sleeper</hi> to fold vp the chill hands of their fauour in their owne warme bosomes: yet the <hi>Muses</hi> may complaine the number of such are too fewe.</p>
   <p>The auncient honours, fraunchises, and
<pb facs="3"/>
immunities of the <hi>Muses,</hi> the adoring of learning which was of olde, causeth those teares that then brast out of their faire cesternes for exultation, now in moderne time, to haue recourse back like <hi>Iordan</hi> to drowne the swolne heart in discontent: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now our pennes doe shedde forth a many teares of inke, abundance of these droppes, the liuely resemblances of our sorow-duld, nay dead eyes: and this is the reason why all our pennes (I thinke) are more imploied now then wont, like silly <hi>Israelites</hi> ener ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp the tale of bricke: to let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull world see, that as gifts are more inhaunced, so the remunerating hand is much shortned.</p>
   <p>Before the temple of <hi>Romulus</hi> there<note place="margin">Patricia. Plebeia. Plin. 15. 29.</note> were <hi>two myrtles</hi> grew, the one <hi>Senatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> the other <hi>vulgar,</hi> for so they tearmed them: whiles the one was euer greene the other withered: there was an intercourse in their flourish and decay, two intimates of <hi>Senate</hi> and the <hi>Commonaltie,</hi> either of their languid authoritie, or of their flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing dignitie: for when the Senate was in glory, the other was in subiection, and so the contrary. Fauour and dislike, reward, and neglect to learning and ignorance,
<pb facs="4"/>
wisedome and folly, be as them two myrtles to them two states: learning must needes flourish and dispread her golden bowes whiles the blessed beames of respect and fauour doe happily reflect vpon her:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>—Immensum gloria calcar habet:</hi> as the Poet saies fame, so fauour is a spurre: by this, learning (prizelesse in it selfe) gets it esteeme: whereas neglect of merit it dulls and rebates the quicker edge of all proceedings, and then folly (contemptible in it selfe) gets the vpperhand. Speake I all this, not as though your <hi>Honourable selfe</hi> (a knowne Patrone vnto learning) were in ecclips for deficiency that way, nor speake I this as if mine owne worthlesse action were worthie of the poize, or did basely expect reward, due to desert and not to me: but onely in their persons whose merit hath beene very much, and against them who haue very little esteemed it: for vertues and better parts most vsually like liuely sparks of Vestall fire, are rak't vp in embers of obscuritie: my speech doth ayme at some, who may, no doubt, peruse these lines with a blushing eye. What I harbour in my brest, I doe reserue to my owne vnsyllabled cogitations: and so much
<pb facs="4"/>
for the respectlesse world.</p>
   <p>Now for your worthy <hi>Honour</hi> which I euer will esteeme, the dutifull affection I beare and euer will to it, hath beene a spurre to pricke me on (though free and ready of my selfe) amongst the troupe of Secretaries, to presume to offer vp this poore paper sacrifice as incense on <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va's</hi> shrine. My ruder hand wherein lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not palmestred, has onely pende what it could copie out of my cogitations, though surely first they leuild at a fairer marke, not soaring for a vulgar stoope. If I haue er'd, it is in loue and in constraint: as with a disease so with actions past: a disease at first is easily cured, but hardly seene: but in processe of time, it is easily seene, but hardly cured: so that nowe a fault can not be salued, except by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious balme of a more gratious accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
   <p>Let this I pray your Honour, be attour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to plead for my defect, in that I, like the <hi>Syrens,</hi> who are wont in <hi>procella can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare, in malacia lugere,</hi> to sing in a storme, and mourne in a calme, doe likewise, being incūbred with other necessary occurences for my degree, tune these my vnpleasant
<pb facs="5"/>
notes, too rude a touch and harsh a melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for a nimble apprehensiue court-like eare, which feedes daily on diuiner foode, on the <hi>Pythagorean harmonie</hi> that raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes the inward sense.</p>
   <p>Concerning my subiect, it is nothing rare: for there is no soile in the whole <hi>Elysian</hi> field of diuine writ that lies fallow, vacant, and vnsowne, so toylesome euer hath beene the cunning hand of industrie in this fruitfull plot, both for <hi>Pauls</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and <hi>Apollos</hi> watering, so that I might worthely haue put my stammering pen to silence: onely it pleasing his excellent Maiestie to daigne to grace with vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected fauour these lines in words deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his vnderstanding eare, I so beeing called to their divulgation, did deeme it not vnmeet among the rest happily to hold the plowe, not looking backe so much as to mine own wants: &amp; therfore haue I chosen to shrowd this abortiue issue of my braine, vnder your <hi>Honours</hi> gracious wings, my selfe beeing happily couched vnder them alreadie, hauing sweete repose vnder the shade of that <hi>vine</hi> I most did affect, and whose clustred branches I wil euer honour both with my heart, my tongue, my penne
<pb facs="5"/>
and all. Humbly suiting your Honour for this, to entertaine these fewer drops of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifullnes distilled from the limbecke of an humble true heart and hand (vnanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either in their portion or proportion to your worth) which I wholly dedicate as a free will offering to your Honours sacred altar, as great an offerer (in a respectfull ballance) for this my <hi>silly Lambe,</hi> as they that sacrifice their <hi>Hecatombs.</hi> Daigne at your Honours vacancie to looke on it: the glorious sunne it selfe may without impeachment to his worth, cast his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rayes vpon the barrennest ground, as well as on the most fertile soile: so may the leaden mine partake as well the blessed hidden influence of heauenly starres, as the golden minerall without disgrace to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation: and it may so come to passe, your Honour may gather hunnie from this homely weede. Thus in all humility reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting earnestly your Honours future grace and fauour, by whose gracious meanes my happier studies may be incouraged to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyer tasks, as also my fortunes bettered: howeuer, beeing contented with the lowest ebbe, as it shall please the hand of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to dispose of me: whose fauour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

was as yet to any like the Poets <hi>Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi>
   </p>
   <p>

      <note place="margin">Virg.</note> a trustlesse anchor-hold to the sea-beaten barks: I humbly take my lowliest leaue, beseeching the Almightie that as both your <hi>Honourable selfe,</hi> your right <hi>Noble Ladie,</hi> and all your <hi>Oliue branches,</hi> that plant your table round about, haue had the mercies of God hetherto, not in any little <hi>epitome,</hi> but as we may so rightly say, in the largest <hi>volume</hi> of his vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bountie: so still and still to all posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, (euen from a single well wishing heart vnto you all) you yet may tast the ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing cup of Gods endlesse fauours, both here in the wildernesse of this world, and there in the true land of promise, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of blisse, whether we all if rightly bred, if true trauailers, must happily direct our iourneyes.</p>
   <p>And thus againe I humbly take my leaue. From my chamber in S. Iohns Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge once graced with your Honours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence. <hi>Iun. 28. 1608.</hi>
