   <l>AT length my chariot wheele about the mark hath found the way,</l>
   <l>And at their weery races end, my breathlesse horses stay.</l>
   <l>The woork is brought too end by which the author did account</l>
   <l>(And rightly) with eternall fame aboue the starres too mount.</l>
   <l>For whatsoeuer hath bene writ of auncient tyme in greeke</l>
   <l>By sundry men dispersedly, and in the latin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eke,</l>
   <l>Of this same dark Philosophie of turned shapes, the same</l>
   <l>Hath Ouid into one whole masse in this booke brought in frame.</l>
   <l>Fowre kynd of things in this his worke the Poet dooth conteyne.</l>
   <l>That nothing vnder heauen dooth ay in stedfast state remayne.</l>
   <l>And next that nothing perisheth: but that eche substance takes</l>
   <l>Another shape than that it had. Of theis twoo points he makes</l>
   <l>The proof by shewing through his woorke the wonderfull exchaunge</l>
   <l>Of Goddes, men, beasts, and elements, too sundry shapes right straunge,</l>
   <l>Beginning with creation of the world, and man of slyme,</l>
   <l>And so proceeding with the turnes that happened till his tyme.</l>
   <l>Then sheweth he the soule of man from dying to be free,</l>
   <l>By samples of the noblemen, who for their vertues bee</l>
   <l>Accounted and canonized for Goddes by heathen men,</l>
   <l>And by the peynes of Lymbo lake, and blysfull state agen</l>
   <l>Of spirits in th'Elysian feelds. And though that of theis three</l>
   <l>He make discourse dispersedly: yit specially they bee</l>
   <l>Discussed in the latter booke in that oration where</l>
   <l>He bringeth in Pythagoras disswading men from feare</l>
   <l>Of death, and preaching abstinence from flesh of liuing things.</l>
   <l>But as for that opinion which Pythagoras there brings</l>
   <l>Of soules remouing out of beasts too men, and out of men</l>
   <l>Too birdes and beasts both wyld and tame, both too and fro agen:</l>
   <l>It is not too be vnderstand of that same soule whereby</l>
   <l>Wee are endewd with reason and discretion from on hie:</l>
   <l>But of that soule or lyfe the which brute beasts as well as wee</l>
   <l>Enioy. Three sortes of lyfe or soule (for so they termed bee)</l>
   <l>Are found in things. The first giues powre too thryue, encrease &amp; grow,</l>
   <l>And this in senselesse herbes and trees and shrubs itself dooth show.</l>
   <l>The second giueth powre too moue and vse of senses fyue,</l>
   <l>And this remaynes in brutish beasts, and keepeth them alyue.</l>
   <l>Both theis are mortall, as the which receyued of the aire</l>
   <l>By force of Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>bus, after death doo thither eft repayre.</l>
   <l>The third giues vnderstanding, wit, and reason: and the same</l>
   <l>Is it alonly which with vs of soule dooth beare the name.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>And as the second dooth conteine the first: euen so the third</l>
   <l>Conteyneth both the other twaine. And neyther beast, nor bird,</l>
   <l>Nor fish, nor herb, nor tree, nor shrub, nor any earthly wyght</l>
   <l>(Saue only man) can of the same partake the heauenly myght.</l>
   <l>I graunt that when our breath dooth from our bodies go away,</l>
   <l>It dooth eftsoones returne too ayre: and of that ayre there may</l>
   <l>Both bird and beast participate, and wee of theirs likewyse.</l>
   <l>For whyle wee liue, (the thing itself appeereth to our eyes)</l>
   <l>Bothe they and wee draw all one breath. But for too deeme or say</l>
   <l>Our noble soule (which is diuine and permanent for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>)</l>
   <l>Is common too vs with the beasts, I think it nothing lesse</l>
   <l>Than for too bee a poynt of him that wisdome dooth professe.</l>
   <l>Of this I am ryght well assurde there is no Christen Wyght</l>
   <l>That can by fondnesse be so farre seduced from the ryght.</l>
   <l>And finally hee dooth proceede in shewing that not all</l>
   <l>That beare the name of men (how strong, feerce, stout, bold, hardy, tall,</l>
   <l>How wyse, fayre, rych, or hyghly borne, how much renownd by fame,</l>
   <l>So ere they bee, although on earth of Goddes they beare the name)</l>
   <l>Are for too be accounted men: but such as vnder awe</l>
   <l>Of reasons rule continually doo liue in vertues law:</l>
   <l>And that the rest doo differ nought from beasts, but rather bee</l>
   <l>Much woorse than beasts, bicause they doo abace theyr owne degree.</l>
   <l>To naturall philosophye the formest three perteyne,</l>
   <l>The fowrth too morall: and in all are pitthye, apt and playne</l>
   <l>Instructions which import the prayse of vert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

   <l>Of vices, with the due rewardes of eyther of the same.</l>
   <l>¶As for example,<note place="margin">Out of the first booke.</note> in the tale of Daphnee turnd too Bay,</l>
   <l>A myrror of virginitie appeere vntoo vs may,</l>
   <l>Which yeelding noyther vntoo feare, nor force, nor flatterye,</l>
   <l>Doth purchace euerlasting fame and immortalitye.</l>
   <l>¶In Phaetons fable vntoo syght the Poet dooth expresse<note place="margin">Out of the second.</note>
   </l>
   <l>The natures of ambition blynd, and youthfull wilfulnesse.</l>
   <l>The end whereof is miserie, and bringeth at the last</l>
   <l>Repentance when it is to late that all redresse is past.</l>
   <l>And how the weaknesse and the want of wit in magistrate</l>
   <l>Confoundeth both his common weale and eeke his owne estate.</l>
   <l>This fable also dooth aduyse all parents and all such</l>
   <l>As bring vp youth, too take good heede of cockering them too much.</l>
   <l>It further dooth commende the meane: and willeth too beware</l>
   <l>Of rash and hasty promises which most pernicious are,</l>
   <l>And not too bee performed: and in fine it playnly showes</l>
   <l>What sorrow too the parents and too all the kinred growes</l>
   <l>By disobedience of the chyld: and in the chyld is ment</l>
   <l>The disobedient subiect that ageinst his prince is bent.</l>
   <l>The transformations of the Crow and Rauen doo declare</l>
   <l>That Clawbacks and Colcariers ought wysely too beware</l>
   <l>Of whom, too whom, and what they speake. For sore against his will</l>
   <l>Can any freendly hart abyde too heare reported ill</l>
   <l>The partie whom he fauoureth. This tale dooth eeke bewray</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="3"/>The rage of wrath and ielozie too haue no kynd of stay:</l>
   <l>And that lyght credit too reportes in no wyse should be giuen.</l>
   <l>For feare that men too late too iust repentance should bee driuen.</l>
   <l>The fable of Ocyroee by all such folk is told</l>
   <l>As are in serching things too come too curious and too bold.</l>
   <l>A very good example is describde in Battus tale</l>
   <l>For couetous people which for gayne doo set theyr toongs too sale.</l>
   <l>¶All such as doo in flattring freaks, and hawks, and hownds delyght,</l>
   <l>And dyce,<note place="margin">Out of the iij.</note> and cards, and for too spend the tyme both day and nyght</l>
   <l>In foule excesse of chamberworke, or too much meate and drink:</l>
   <l>Uppon the piteous storie of Acteon ought too think.</l>
   <l>For theis and theyr adherents vsde excessiue are in deede</l>
   <l>The dogs that dayly doo deuour theyr followers on with speede.</l>
   <l>Tyresias willes inferior folk in any wyse too shun</l>
   <l>Too iudge betweene their betters least in perill they doo run.</l>
   <l>Narcissus is of scornfulnesse and pryde a myrror cleere,</l>
   <l>Where beawties fading vanitie most playnly may appeere.</l>
   <l>And Echo in the selfsame tale dooth kyndly represent</l>
   <l>The lewd behauiour of a bawd, and his due punishment.</l>

   <l>The headie force of frentick loue whose end is wo and payne.</l>
   <l>The snares of Mars and Uenus shew that tyme will bring too lyght</l>
   <l>The secret sinnes that folk commit in corners or by nyght.</l>
   <l>Her maphrodite and Salmacis declare that idlenesse</l>
   <l>Is cheefest nurce and cherisher of all volupteousnesse,</l>
   <l>And that voluptuous lyfe breedes sin: which linking all toogither</l>
   <l>Make men too bee effeminate, vnweeldy, weake and lither.</l>

   <l>The first doo also show that long it is ere God begin</l>
   <l>Too pay vs for our faults, and that he warnes vs oft before</l>
   <l>Too leaue our folly: but at length his vengeance striketh sore.</l>
   <l>And therfore that no Wyght should striue with God in word nor thought</l>
   <l>Nor deede. But pryde and fond desyre of prayse haue euer wrought</l>
   <l>Confusion too the parties which accompt of them doo make.</l>
   <l>For some of such a nature bee that if they once doo take</l>
   <l>Opinion (be it ryght or wrong) they rather will agree</l>

   <l>And lastly that distresse doth driue a man too looke about</l>
   <l>And seeke all corners of his wits, what way too wind him out.</l>
   <l>¶The good successe of Iason in the land of Colchos,<note place="margin">Out of the vij.</note> and</l>
   <l>The dooings of Medea since, doo giue too vnderstand</l>
   <l>That nothing is so hard but peyne and trauell doo it win,</l>
   <l>For fortune euer fauoreth such as boldly doo begin:</l>
   <l>That women both in helping and in hurting haue no match</l>
   <l>When they too eyther bend their wits: and how that for too catch</l>

   <l>An easie matter. Also there is warning giuen of this,</l>
   <l>That men should neuer hastely giue eare too fugitiues,</l>

   <l>It shewes in fine of stepmoothers the deadly hate in part,</l>

   <l>Although it bee a tale put in for pleasure by the way:</l>
   <l>Yit by thinterpretation of the name we well may gather,</l>
   <l>He did include a misterie and secret meening rather.</l>
   <l>This woord Prometheus signifies a person sage and wyse,</l>

   <l>It was the name of one that first did images inuent:</l>
   <l>Of whom the Poets doo report that hee too heauen vp went,</l>
   <l>And there stole fyre, through which he made his images alyue:</l>
   <l>And therfore that he formed men the Paynims did contryue.</l>
   <l>Now when the Poet red perchaunce that God almyghty by</l>
   <l>His prouidence and by his woord (which euerlastingly</l>
   <l>Is ay his wisdome) made the world, and also man to beare</l>
   <l>His image, and too bee the lord of all the things that were</l>

   <l>Thus may Prometheus seeme too bee theternall woord of God,</l>

   <l>So in the sixth booke afterward Amphions harp is sayd</l>
   <l>The first foundation of the walles of Thebee too haue layd,</l>
   <l>Bycause that by his cloquence and iustice (which are ment</l>
   <l>By true accord of harmonie and musicall consent)</l>
   <l>He gathered intoo Thebee towne, and in due order knit</l>
   <l>The people that disperst and rude in hilles and rocks did sit.</l>
   <l>So Orphey in the tenth booke is reported too delyght</l>

   <l>That men beholding what they bee when vyce dooth reigne in stead</l>

   <l>For as there is no creature more diuine than man as long</l>

   <l>For sure the marke whereat I shoote is neyther wreathes of bay,</l>
   <l>Nor name of Poet, no nor meede: but cheefly that it may</l>

   <l>But why seeme I theis doubts too cast, as if that he who tooke</l>
   <l>With fauor and with gentlenesse a parcell of the booke</l>
   <l>Would not likewyse accept the whole? or euen as if that they</l>
