   <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>

      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee are fallen into the barren age of the worlde (courteous <hi>Reader</hi>) wherein though some fewe trauaile to expell Barbarisme, (which fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately they haue done in our English tongue) yet a number of idle conceited-wise-foolish heades take vpon them peremptorily to censure other<note place="margin">The cause why many write not. Ignorance sits idle and will iudge. In vaine doe we complain of multitude of bookes.</note> mens paines: so that euery man is loath to enter into the viewe whilst Idlenes shall stand controlling and giue her sentence. I know it could fit these to write, but that <hi>magni laboris est quem plerique fugimus. Homer</hi> wrote of the trauailes of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Graecian <hi>Vlysses; Curtius</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Darius; Rome</hi> had neuer beene so renowmed but for <hi>Titus Livius; Thucydides</hi> eternized <hi>Iason</hi> and <hi>Minotaure;</hi> and sweet <hi>Salust Iugurth</hi> and <hi>Cateline:</hi> nay this wise age, long since had beene plaine foolish, if our painefull forefathers had not trauailed for their good. And if any man thinke this age is too wisely learned to read any thing which is but some fewe droppes of that mayne Ocean which ouerflowed in their daies, let him knowe this, that care added to their industrious trauailes, is easily able to perform matters of great importance. Learning was let loose ouer all <hi>Europe</hi> euer since <hi>Athens</hi> did first flourish (excepting a fevve yeares when the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandalls</hi> compelled her to liue in exile) who flying fast from their furie left <hi>Italie</hi> and those famous places, and planted her selfe so firmely in these poore countreies, that euer since amongst vs shee hath liued honourably. Thus in the abundance of our knowledge, he that hath taken pains, stands at the courtesie of euery paltrie fellowe to be censured as it please him. In consideration whereof, wise men haue deemed it the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, secretly to smile, and soberly to say nothing. For my paines I much care not, I esteeme thee (Reader) as thou dost me, for (dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous<note place="margin">Vales. Zanch. <hi>N. D. B.</hi> Gallici</note> minds intreated, grow insolent:) the daies are euill, and the argument is fit for these times; I knowe diuers haue trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the same kinde, whome I but humble (without wronging them) to speake vnto thy capacitie: Nobilitie fully learned made<note place="margin">My L.

choice to handle the same argument, and with such profounde deepe skill performde it, as that truth taketh her selfe much bound vnto him, who made her to speake eloquently that vseth to be plaine, and false prophesies ashamed, who so long haue vsurped truths titles. From hence maist thou learne (or at least remember) that the greatest Monarches (howsoeuer proud in their owne strength) must either fall with an enemies stroake, or (as <hi>Rome</hi> did) with her owne waight: here maist thou see that nothing is so made, but subiect to great change. And yet least thou desire to knowe what thou oughtest not, I haue laboured to make knowne what thou shouldest desire: my leisure will not serue to detaine thee long, and a short preface is beseeming so small paines. I take my leaue, and (if thou hast deserued) I giue thee thanks: onely this I must adde further (not to accuse others, or make an Apologie for my selfe) that I neuer yet in the least syllable of the so tearmed loosest line, meant either to modestie, pietie, chastitie, time, the Muses, or kindnes to doe wrong; neither should the surmised obiect of my muses song, or the dearest which that obiect hath, suspect in me but the least shadow of supposed eniurie: for I neither ment to make loose poetrie a true historie, or thought that wise courtesie would be so suspicious to misdeeme him, whose thoughts long since were deuoted to grauer studies: from whence taking leisure but to pause a little, my penne grewe passionate, and my idle papers scattered vnawares flew abroad (I protest) not to offend any: thus I binde thee (by that credit which truth deserues) whosoeuer thou art which reads, to beleeue what I haue spoken herein, and (if thou please) for my sake to accept<note place="margin">For such a Coxcombe.</note> this. And because euery <hi>Balductum</hi> makes diuine poetrie to be but baserime, I leaue thee (sacred eloquence) to be defended by the Muses ornaments, and such (despised) to liue tormented with endles pouertie. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
