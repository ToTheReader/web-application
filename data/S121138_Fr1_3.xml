   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am forced (gentle Reader) though
I hate contention, to contend with
a contentious man: or else, having
the better end of the staffe, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
a good cause. It is not possible
that the Lordes fielde should want
tares, his net bad fishe, or his Church offences: but
wo to them, by whome they rise. This wo in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
pertaines to the one side. It is hard, (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
impossible, that both bee guiltie. Wherefore,
as I am cleare before the Lord, so, to purge my selfe
before thee, I will set down how this dissension first
beganne. The Bishop of Salisburie that last was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his remooving to Yorke, tooke order, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
preachers should keepe lecture on the market
daies, in the cheefe market townes of his Diocese.
There is a great market euerie Satterday at a towne
called Chippenhame, in North Wilshire. Within 4.
myles of which, dwelleth one M. Wisedome, a man
for integritie of lyfe, and exceeding paines in his cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling
loued of all the godlie, hated of the wicked and
admired of both. This man was one of the prechers
appointed to that place, and preached there once in
a fourtnight, or a month, I know not which. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
on Satterday the 14. day of Februarie or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
<hi>Anno</hi> 1589. expounding in that place the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of the beleef, he deliuered this opinion, which
I defend, concerning the descense of Christ into hel.
Whē he had done, one Chalfont Vicar of that towne
<pb facs="6"/>
stood vp, and protested to the people, that hee had
taught false doctrine: and promised, that if they
would come that day seuen night, they should heare
him confuted by a learned man.. That day seuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
commes. The people flockes to the Church in
great multituds, exspecting some famous man, with
some new matter. At length, in came this. M. Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>font
himself. Hee climbes into the pulpit, and pyles
vp a heap of books, as high as his head. Then after
a psalme, and a formall prayer, hee beginnes like an
Oratour at his own person and his adversaries, that
he was M. Wisedomes senior, that he was a Bachelor
when M. Wisedome was a Scholler: and a Maister of
Arte. before he was a Bachelour. That hee had read
more, and knew more, then he. That he had learned
arithmetick, and could reckon the articles of the
creed, better then hee. That there was 12. of them,
made by the 12. Apostles. That his memorie serued
him to remember, which Apostle made which arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
That M. Wisedome did reckon them wrong, and
made but 11. of them. That al learned Fathers were
on his conspiracie. That M. Wisedome did falsefie
Calvine, and other learned writers: That Christ
might bee the day when he su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ered, as well both in
Paradice and Hell: as M. Wisedome was that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at Gritleton (that is the place where he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth)
&amp; then there vnder the pulpit. That he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the convocation, and therefore had depriued
himselfe of the Ministrie, <hi>ipso facto.</hi> And so was no
more Parson of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>tleton, then hee was Bishop of
London. He lookes downe manie times on M. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
where he sat vnder the pulpite, amazed at his
impudencie, like a meeke sheep, (as hee is indeede)
and calles him by his name. This saieth Augustine,
this saieth Ierome, this saieth Cyprian, and you say
that. Where was your learning? Where was your
<pb facs="6"/>
reading? Where was your simplicitie and plain dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which you make show of? And turning to the
people he warned them to be ware of false Prophets
that going in sheepes clothing, were inwardlie raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
wolues, meaning M. Wisedome because of his
plainnesse, and simplicitie. This exclamation, (for
sermon I cannot call it) being ended, the people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
some saying this, and some saying that: and
all, (sauing such as loue, or malice did carrie more
then truth or matter) condemning Chalfonts impu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dencie.
That day seuen-night, the people meets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
hoping to heare M. Wisdome reply, for that
was his day by the Bishops order. But M. Hil beeing
then at a towne called Leycocke, within 2. myles of
this Chippenhame by accident, or of set purpose, I
know not, came thither that morning, and tooke
the place. The same man not manie yeares before,
had dipped in the same controuersy almost after the
same manner at Sarum, against one M. Connam, a
man both learned, and Chaplane to my L. of Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke.
But to let that passe, at this sermon 28. Feb.
<hi>Anno</hi> 1589. I was my selfe, vpon the occasions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the beginning of my letter to M. Hill, (for
as yet he was not Doctor) which he hath printed. In
it with painted words, and great names of Doctors
he so varnished the matter, that at the first hearing
it seemed not improbable. Towards his aduersaries
hee behaued himselfe modestlie, geuing them the
praise both of learning and godlinesse, namely Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Beza. To blaze their error in this point, he
rubbed the Hebrew words Sheol and nepheshe, and
the greeke <hi>hades, psyche</hi> &amp; <hi>pneuma,</hi> as white, as a whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.
Then after a solempne challenge to all the
learned men in the world, that did dissent from him,
he offered his notes to anie that would haue them:
he promised faire play, if anie man would answere
<pb facs="7"/>
him: he protested loue to him, that coulde confute
him: and vowed a recantation in the same place, if
his forces could not bide the battle. I hearing this
braue challenge, and mistrusting his cardes for all
his facing: wrought a freend that had acquaintance
with him, to help mee to his notes. After two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
or there-abouts, hee sent them to mee vnder
his owne hand. Perusing them, I found them out of
their coullours, nothing answerable to the shewe
that they made in the pulpite. Wherefore, hearing
of no man, that did reply: saving M. Wisdome in a
sermon that M. Hill was not at: and hoping that his
protestations had beene as farre in his heart, as they
were faire in his mouth: I resolued to answere him
for the truthes sake, though my leasure was not
much, promising my self as much thank for my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
as his great offers led mee to beleeue. To keep
it secrete, I wrote in latine. I seasoned my wordes,
with all moderation, that might bee in a contrarie
style. I offered to confesse, if it could be shewed, that
my answeres turned not the edge of his argumentes.
To be short, I promised to yeelde to anie truth, that
he could proue. I was in hope that this conference
should haue beene priuate, amongest vs, and such
freends onelie, as hee or I, might haue acquainted
with it. Indeed, he offered mee to haue talked of the
matter at a freends house. But I considering, that in
such disputations, stormes of wordes rysing out of
hearts, heated with contradiction, doth hinder rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and stop judgement, refused any conference, but
with the pen.<note place="margin">The second consideration is better than the first.</note> This reply I finished within few daies:
But mistrusting mine own infirmities, and knowing
that <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, I kept it in my hand
till the next May following. Then going home to
visite my naturall freendes, I left it with a freend or
two to be deliuered him. They beeing doubtfull of
<pb facs="7"/>
my returne, though it not best to sturre a coale, that
they knew no man in my absence to put out. At my
returne vnderstanding that they had not deliuered
it: I tooke it into my handes againe, I added and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
diuerse things. I wrote it new: and sent it him
inclosed in a letter. In time of my absence, (which
was half a yeare and more) he had receaued by some
secret meanes, an englishe copie of the first draught,
which I my selfe had translated at the request of a
freend, not aboue fiue daies before my journey. It I
deliuered him with condition to bring it mee againe
He brought it not, and I forgot it. In time of my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
he lent it to another, &amp; the other gaue a cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
of it to one, that put it in M. Hills hands. To that
before my returne, he had fumbled vp this answere,
that now he hath printed. I not knowing it, sent him
(as I haue said) the latine. Vpon receit whereof hee
sent the other amongst his freends. It went amongst
them from one to another, from November (for in
Nouember I sent mine,) till the September follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and then he sent it mee. In this meane time spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
were giuen out, that I had answered his sermō,
that he had replied, and I recanted. These speeches
grew dailie, and lifted his heart as high as his name.
Whereon hee resolued to dispute in Oxenford for a
scarlet hood. He promised his freends to make that
one of his questions. He gaue out, that al Oxford was
on his side. But when it came to proof, hee was faine
to promise to his friends, and they to others, that he
would conferre with learned men: that hee woulde
yeeld to anie truth,<note place="margin">The admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a man to a degree of schoole in Oxford is cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led a grace.</note> that could be proued out of the
word: that he would not deall in that question, but
as he should be led by such conference, or els he had
gone as graceles out of Oxford, as he came thither.
Notwithstanding, when he was sure of his grace, to
maintain his credit amongst his friends in the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie:
<pb facs="8"/>
he took that question to maintaine in Oxfoord
on the Viper day of the Act. howe manfully hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it, I report me to them that heard him. <hi>A fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
terrae</hi> at the lower end of the schoole (a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
seene before in that place at that time) got a pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cet
of the Doctor of the chyre, to brush his skarlet
gowne: who trimmed it so neatly, that if his cheeks
wold haue taken the staines of shame, he had worne
as much skarlet in his face, as he did on his back. In
this story (thou maiest see good Reader) that my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
did thrust his hooke in an other mans har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
at Chippinhame: that he took not my reply so
wel as he promised in the pulpit. That he made that
publick which I wrote in private. That he went far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abroad, &amp; hunted for contention in Oxfoord.
That hee plaied at the same bale before, in Sarum.
That he bare the simple in hand, that all the learned
of the Vniversitie were of his mind. That hee fed an
vntrue rumour, that I had recanted. That he printed
my privat letter without my consent or knowledg.
And that to trouble the simple with it, he published
that in english, which I wrote in latine. For my part
I hope I did nothing but that which the dutie of a
Christian required. hearing the trueth impugned I
did defend it: fearing that he had bene deceiued on
simplicitie, I laboured to reforme him. I wrote in
faire tearmes to avoide offences. I wrote in a strange
tongue to keepe it secret. And I hunted not for this
contention: but was drawen into it with faire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of great thanks: wherfore I hope if thou haue
but one dramme of indifferencie, that thou wiltest
wipe this bleamish from my face. If I fall nowe into
rougher tearmes impute the fault to him, that kept
not himselfe within the same bounds as I beganne.
Moreover, it is impossible to answere this booke,
wherein are so many errours in al kinds of learning
<pb facs="8"/>
without tearms of offence. The humour also of this
adversary is such, and his estimation amongest the
simple, that if I spare him, I shall feede it, and hinder
the trueth. Add that it is impossible for me to passe
over such vnmanerly disgraces of lies, impudēt lies,
shameles lies in matters politicall, damnable lies in
maters theological: disagreing with Mathew, Mark,
Luke, Iohn, Paul, Peter, Christ himself, &amp; al the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and never turne the bale comming so faire to
the other end of the tennise. In some places hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
my words a meaning, that I neuer meant: In
some places he giues my arguments a shape, that I
neuer made. In some places hee bends his proofes
to things not denied: In many places hee slipps the
point in controversie, and passes by arguments, as
if he neuer sawe them. And in no place answeres one
argument like a scholler, much lesse a Doctor. If I
rippe vp these things in their places freely: I hope
good Reader, that thou wiltest rather lay the fault
on him, that made them such; than me, that cal them
as they are. Thus beseeching thee to weigh the cause
throughly▪ and to giue every colour his own name:
I leaue thee to the Lord.</p>
