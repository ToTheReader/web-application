   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Woulde verelye wishe (most vertuous and ryght honourable Lorde) that as I perceaue my selfe most addict and tied with the bondes of singular &amp; great benefits flowing from you, euen so Fortune would suffer that I might feele, although no faculty or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of recompence, yet at the least some hope of rē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of thanks, which may flow likewise from me vnto your honor. For as often as the remembrance of your munificent liberalitie towardes me, entreth into my mynde (which entreth truly very often) euē so often am I affected and vexed with incredible so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, fearing least the note of a Gethicall<note place="margin">
         <hi>Gethical.</hi> 2.</note> ingratitude (thē the which ther is nothing more odious) should be imputed and layde to my charge. But that this kinde of life might be no longer bitter &amp; sharpe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me: I haue thought good to seeke some waye and meanes to produce and shewe forth some argument of a gratefull hart, and thankeful minde towards your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. And although I am not ignoraunt that you do not much regard nor boaste of your benefites bestowed (as the cōmon sort of welthy men do) nor do therfore helpe them that be of lower degree, because you do eyther aspire or desire to haue thankes to be geuen vnto you for a recompence, or that you woulde haue your liberalitie to be praysed and setforth vnto others: yet I (as my dutie is) do greatlye esteeme and weigh them which you haue disposed, not onely vpon me, but also do bestow them daily vpon others, and for my part do iudge them worthy immortal laud &amp; praise. In recompence whereof, because I haue no other treasures to exhibite vnto your honour but only the litle Talent<note place="margin">
         <hi>Talent.</hi> 3.</note> of my exile &amp; sclender learning, I haue thought good to dedicate vnto your lordship these my Prelections and readinges (although simple and rude, yet playne and profitable (vttered of late by me in Paules Church in London,<note place="margin">Paules church. <hi>4.</hi> London. <hi>5</hi>
      </note> that they may bee defended and deliuered from the malignant aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by your honourable wisedome &amp; ready helpe. And this to attempt three things haue enforced and moued me: that is honesty, fidelitie, and grateful duty. Honesty to auoyde occasions of obloquie, fidelitie, to accomplish promise, gratefull duty in one or other thing to benefite my Country, vnto the which (as <hi>Plato</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Plato.</hi> 6.</note> saith) and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto our selues we be borne and brought forth:<note place="margin">Gicero lib. 1 officiorum.</note>

         <hi>Country.</hi> 7.</note> doth vendicate and chalenge, the other part our Parentes and frendes doe requyre. <hi>Cassiodorus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Cassiodorus.</hi> 8</note> who of a Senator of Rome, was made a deepe diuine, writeth of thys thus in hys Epistles: <hi>Nobilissimi ciuis est, patriae suae augmenta cogitare, sed eorum max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime quos respublica summis honoribus obligauit.</hi> It is the part (sayth he) of a noble and worthy Citizen to haue regarde for the good encrease &amp; aduancement of hys Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but in especiall it behoueth them so to doo, whom the welthe publique hath tied and enhaunced to honour &amp; dignity. <hi>Hierocles,</hi>

      <hi>est patria (ait) velut alter quidem deus, et primus maximus{que} parens, quare qui nomen ei imposuit a reipsa non temere patriam ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellauit, vocabulo quidem a patre deducto, pronunciato tamen feminina pronūciatione, vt ex vtro{que} parente mixtū esset. &amp;c.</hi> The Country (saith he) is as it wer an other god, and the fyrst and the greatest parent, therfore he which set vnto it that name, did not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduisedly name it of the thing it self, <hi>Patriam,</hi> the word being deriued <hi>a Patre,</hi> a father, yet pronounced in the feminine termination, that it should be a mixt thing deriued from both the parentes. And thys reason doth insinuate and declare the Countrye, being but one, to be honoured equalie with both the Parentes, and when it doth thus set vp the honour of the Countrye, it doth graunt that both the Parentes are not of a greater price and estimatiō, then the Country, but doth vouchsafe to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie it with equall honour. What should I molest your honourable eares with the multitude, not onely of authorities, but also of examples of most valiant and noble men? Which did not onely employ &amp; bestow al their industrie, study, labour, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, goodes and landes, but also did aduenture their owne liues for the benefit, profite, and safegarde of their Country. But because I will not ouerpasse them all, I wyll recite two or three, and will first beginne with Gods booke. What prayse
<pb facs="7"/> worthy is that mighty Capitaine and man ful of prowes Ioab, which fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Syrians for his Country sayd to his brother Abisai:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 10.</note> If the Syrians be stronger then I, thou shalt helpe me: and if the children of Ammon be to strong for thee, I wil come and succour thee: be strong therfore, and let vs be valiaunt for our people, and for the Cities of our God, and let the Lord do that which is good in his eyes. It would be to long to rehearse the history and chiualdry of <hi>Iudas Machabeus</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iudas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha. <hi>10.</hi>
      </note> &amp; other Emperours of great puissance, whose piety and loue toward their Country, is comprised and shewed in the holy scriptures, I could bring forth (besides these) the notable vertue and courage towarde their Country, of certayn Gentils. <hi>Curtius</hi> a famous Romayne, and a noble yong man, for the safegarde of his Countrye, cast himselfe into a gaping Caue of the earth, and so willingly dyed. <hi>Publius Decius</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Publius Decius</hi> the sonne, aduentred their heades for the safety of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and manfully dyed for the loue of their Countrye. <hi>Chodrus</hi> king of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, when he vnderstode by the oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi>
      <note place="margin">

      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Phileni</hi> 13</note> the twoo brethren, had leauer to haue the boundes of theyr Country, then the course of theyr liues to be enlarged, and therefore suffered them selues to be buried quicke. <hi>Herodotus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Herodotus.</hi> 14</note> of all writers of histories compted the chiefe, doth record in his seuenth booke, that two of the Countrye of Lacedemonia tooke their iourney frankly and of their own accord vnto <hi>Xerxes,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Xerxes.</hi> 15.</note> king of Persians, to the end that they might suffer such paynes as the Lacedemonians were iudged by ora<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cle to sustaine. The cause which moued them was this: The Lacedemonians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of al leagues and lawes, had slaine the Embassadours sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them from Persia. Which fact being both haynous and odious, deserued a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement to be inflicted vpon the Lacedemonians. Wherupon these two men be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore mencioned, came to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> willing him to execute on them what kinde of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and death it pleased him, that he might be moued by that to spare their Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>try, <hi>Xerxes</hi> the king (expending &amp; weighing both their piety toward their country, &amp; also their bold &amp; strōg encouragemēt of mind) did not onely deliuer thē frō al spices of tortures, but also desired them that they would remayne and make their abode with him. The parties answered: how can we liue here say they forsaking the good rules and lawes, which are put in vre in our country, &amp; abandoning our selues frō the society &amp; company of noble &amp; notable mē, for whose sakes we repaired hether to aduenture our liues? If these men (being but Heathen and Paynims, destitute and voyde of al diuine knowledge) were so feruently enclined to the beneficiall furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their Country: how much more ought a Christian (indued with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and his lawes) to be zealously enflamed toward his country? These reasons and ensamples, as wel taken out of the holy scriptures, as other prophane authours, moue me to consider (right honourable Lord) both my duty that I owe to my natural Country, and also the accompt that I haue to render for the litle ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent which God hath deliuered vnto me, wherby I am violently enticed to bestow for the benefit of my Country, some part of my study vttered in certaine Lectures. Which attemptate I trust wyl not be takē in the wurst part, neither of your honor, neither of those that shal read them, for here is not onely the exposition of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle it selfe set forth, but also certaine controuersies in religion<note place="margin">
