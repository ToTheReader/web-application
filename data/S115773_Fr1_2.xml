   <head>TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTIE <hi>PRINCE,</hi> CHARLES, By the Grace of God King of <hi>Great Britaine, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Defender of the Faith, &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, The holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, out of their due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of these times, having in the liturgie for the late Fast taught to pray, <hi>O Eternall God, and most gratious Father, wee confesse that by our manifold transgressions, we have deserved whatsoever thy Law hath threatned against sinners, Our contempt
<pb facs="3"/>of thy Divine Service is great, and wee heare thy word, but obey it not. Our charity to our neighbour is cold, and our devotion to thee is frozen. Religiō is with us, as in too many places besides, made but a pretence for other ends then thy Service; and there hath beene little or no care among us to keepe truth and peace together, for the preserving of our Church and State. Forgive us, O Lord, forgive as these, and all other our grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous sinnes, &amp;c.</hi> Have thereby signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to all Pastours and Ministers of the Church, that they should doe their part, towards the repairing of those decayes in many peoples mindes &amp; conversations. The which most necessary signification beeing proceeded from them, who in the Clergie are endued with the amplest understanding in all matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb facs="3"/>hath incited me (though the most unworthy amōg the labourers in the Lords harvest) unto greater accuration in my function, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to through helpe of the Divine grace for to compile this worke. The which now with all humility I present unto your most sacred Majestie. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is for the most part but as it were a collection of sentences out of the Divine Service Bookes of the Church, for to put the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in more remembrance and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of what therein is delivered concerning the principall points of Christian Divinity, and a quotation of Scriptures witnessing the same; yet unto all, which unfainedly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to know the will of God for to live obediently unto it, and will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially read through and seriously
<pb facs="4"/>consider every delivery therein, it will appeare to be a worke profitable for to make more knowne unto the laity the established Doctrine of the Church, &amp; to further them in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duty towards God, &amp; your Highnesse, and their neighbours. Yea it will awake many out of their sleepe of ignorance, and cause all such as are upright of heart, to say, <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place, and we knew it not:</hi> The everlasting truth of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall God is abundantly delivered in the publike prayers, exhortations, and Homilies of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and we tooke none or but little notice of it. Notwithstanding there will not be wanting spirits of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which will calumniate the work, and me by reason of the same. Wherefore I humbly crave of your
<pb facs="4"/>most sacred Majesty, that since things of this quality are subject to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of persons ill-meaning and wise in their owne eyes, it may receive pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage from your most gracious Highnesse. Your Majesties father a Prince of most worthy &amp; ever bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed memory, all the time of his happy Reigne over us, shewed most pious zeale towards maintaining the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service of the Church; and for confirmation thereof caused the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation made for the authorizing and uniformitie of the Booke of Cōmon Prayer to be used through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Realme, to bee printed with the said booke; and also the booke of Homilies to be reprinted. The like most godly care to conserve &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Church in the unity of true religion, your Highnesse in that most divine and ever most memorable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
<pb facs="5"/>afore the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> hath, unto the great comfort of all your Majesties loyall &amp; religious people, manifested &amp; testified. The Lord of heaven and earth blesse your Highnes with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny &amp; happy yeares, That as his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly hand hath enriched your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty with many singular &amp; extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary graces, So your Highnes may be the mirrour of the world in this latter age (as most truly it already is) for the prudent and zealous defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the true Catholike and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike faith, unto the honour of that great God, and the good of his Church, through Iesus Christ our Lord and onely Saviour,</p>
