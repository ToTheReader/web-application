   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Eaknes (Right honorable)

his fame went stil before him
to dilate his acts. In priuate, &amp; infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
studies, that want countenance
in themselues, the extensiue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

strength, and encouragement, to

intensiue weaknesse, when our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours

bulwarke of protection, against
the stormes of enuious and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious

to shrowd my selfe vnder your

Honour so farre to grace these my
labours, as to vouchsafe them a
passage vnder your Patronage, that
therby (though happily they haue
<pb facs="4"/>
nothing in them to deserue your
priuate reading and account) they
may yet the better by your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
finde admittance and
respect to publique view. For I
must confesse they come much
short, as well of the worthynes of
the Subiect, that they treat of, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of your regard and estimation. If
therefore out of your generall res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to all, your Lordshippe shall
bee pleased to vouchsafe mee this

admit all times, and pretermit no
