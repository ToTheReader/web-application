      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am to well asured (good Reader)
that in vndertaking this vaine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the pernicious &amp; vulgar vse
or rather abuse of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> I shall
draw vnto my selfe no small <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap>
long time glutted themselues with
the fond fopperies and fashions of our
neighbour Countries: yet still desirous of nouelties, haue not
stucke to trauell as farre as <hi>India</hi> to fetch a <hi>Dulce vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
a graecian <hi>Helen,</hi> an insatiate <hi>Messaline,</hi> and hugge a
stinging serpent in their bosomes: nor am I ignorant, that
to the wiser sort this treatise will seeme at the first a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
labour, of an idle braine, and to other some a vaine florish
of a carping minde: And that beecause in this treatise is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
reprehended and in some sort refuted, that which of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
excellent &amp; learned men hath beene most highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and by sundry persons of high estate hath beene experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
and tryed verie commodious for the health of man.</p>
   <p>For <hi>Monardus</hi> in his treatise of the West Indian sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>Carolus Clusius</hi> in his Comment vpon <hi>Garcaeas de
Stirpibus et Aromaticis Indicis,</hi> and <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> in
his 8. booke and 11. Chap: of Naturall Magick doe commend
this plant as a thing most excellent and diuine.</p>
   <p>And in these our daies many excellent Phisitions and men
of singuler learning and practise, together with many gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and some of great accompt, doe by their daily vse and
custome in drinking of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> giue great credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to the same: yet neuerthelesse if it shall please them
<pb facs="3"/>
either with patience to heare, or with iudgement to reade
these few lines, and with indifferencie to waie and ponder the
reasons herein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="4 letters">
         <desc>••••</desc>
      </gap>dged, I doubt not but they shall finde, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the great authoritie of the one, nor the vsuall practise
of the other, nor yet them both vnited and conioined in one, a
ground for this their vulgar practise of a thing so hurtfull
an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> pernitious to the life and health of man.</p>
   <p>Authorities of expert and learned men in their art (I
confesse) bee motiues of waight and importance to leade and
draw the vnlearned and vnskilfull sort, who for the more
part sticke and relie more on the authoritie of the teacher,
then on his demonstrations and proofes, to yeeld to their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions.</p>
   <p>But of all heresies in Philosophie that Pithagoricall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>(Ipse dixit)</hi> seemeth most grose, hurtfull, and perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Heerevpon wee finde that <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Morals</hi>
thought it not a matter of wisedome or worth commendaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to content himselfe with the bare authoritie of his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Plato</hi> (who no doubt was in learning most excellent:
but laying <hi>Platoes</hi> assertions in one skale of the ballance, and
reason with experience in the other, and finding his Maisters
authoritie to light to counterpease re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>son, hee made it no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to swarue and discent from <hi>Ipse dixit,</hi> and stuck to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n, as a most euident meanes to bring a sensible and
reasonable creature, to the knowledge and vnderstanding of
the truth.</p>
   <p>The like in Pnis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ke did <hi>Galen,</hi> dissenting sometimes from
his Master <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>pocrates,</hi> (for so may I terme him, for from
him he had his light:) &amp; of set purpose in his <hi>Comments</hi>
on <hi>Hippocrates Epidemicks,</hi> and <hi>Aphorismes</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
him: And <hi>Aristotle</hi> had wont to say, <hi>Amicus Plato,
<pb facs="3"/>
sed Magis amica veritas. Plato</hi> was his friend, (for from
him hee had his learning and knowledge) but Truth and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
was his greater friend, and therfore in equitie &amp; right
hee ought rather to take hir part.</p>
   <p>So for truth sake onely did <hi>Varro</hi> write against <hi>Lelius,
Sulpitius</hi> against <hi>Casselius, Saint Ierome</hi> against <hi>Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,
Saint Augustine</hi> against <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Ambrose</hi> also.
These men made euer more accompt and estimation of veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and truth, then of the authoritie of learning in any who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.</p>
   <p>Let it not therefore (good Reader) seeme a vaine thing
to you, or an argument of an Idle braine, for mee to discent
in iudgement of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> from those authors before alea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
hauing as I suppose, both sollide Reasons and true Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
on my side to counterpease their authorities founded
rather on opinion then any certaine science or demonstration.</p>
