      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He holie Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the comming of the Romishe Antichrist,<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.10.</note> sheweth that the Lorde woulde set vp that renna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate seat, as it were an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner or sergeant of his wrathfull iudgement, against those which should not haue the loue of the trueth: that they which would not effectually beleeue it, receiuing sentence of the Lord himself to beleeue lies effectually, shoulde be put to the execution thereof by the ministerie of that seat. The truth wherof as in other places of Europe, so in this our Countrey especially, is euidently seene: where the Lord sitting in his Assise not twise a yeare, but all the whole yeare long, reuengeth the shameful contempt and neglect of his truth: by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding numbers to their stie or walter againe, which bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawne into the fouldes of Christ by the preaching of the Gospell, behaued themselues coldly and careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therein. And albeit in long processe of time, this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cāker of Poperie, be able to eat vp the whole church: yet the sinnes of our Countrey crie so loude, that is to say are done so openly and so vncōtrolledly in the sight of the Lord, that as if he woulde make a short hande of all, he setteth vpon vs with diuerse engines, at once to pull downe that which he hath so graciously builded, and with diuerse axes layde euen to the roote, vtterly to cutte vp that which his owne hand hath planted.</p>
   <p>And to follow the former comparison, as where there are great store of fellons, the Iustices of Assise, are faine to seuer and single themselues, to make the
<pb facs="11"/>
speedier hande of them: euen so through heapes of those which haue no loue of the truth in them, the lord is as it were faine to erect vp other iudgement seates, by the which hee may ease himselfe of them: and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point other hangmen, for their quicker dispatch to the place wherevnto they are adiudged. And therefore contenteth not himself now with the heresie of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, which haue beene a long time the principall sincke to receiue the outcastes of the Church, nor with the heresie of the Arians and Anabaptists, as it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houses of office, whereunto some of the filth of the Church hath beene discharged: but stirreth vp other brandes of hell, to set fire as it were in euerie corner of the Church. Of this sort are the vnlouely companie of them that call themselues the Familie of loue.</p>
   <p>Wherevpon it may be vnderstanded howe vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Gospel is charged, as that which is in small fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with God: because in the time of the preaching thereof, there rise such damnable sectes, and that from them, which haue borne the name of Gospellers. Wherein the Gospel needeth so little to feare the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession hereof: that the same tendeth euen to the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying of the great price and estimation, that the Lorde hath it in. For as the great estimation of the lawes of the lande, is taken from the seuere punishment practised against the despisers of them: so these feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iudgements executed vpon them, which in their mouthes vaunting the Gospel, in their workes denied the vertue of the same, are preachers of the great ielou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, which the Lord hath ouer the doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Which also because he woulde not haue slaundered with the filth of such sectes, he so ordereth the matter: that where our Church hath no strength to throw thē out, they should willingly cast out thēselues: therby to receiue their shame vpon their owne heades, &amp; to cleare
<pb facs="11"/>
the Gospel with all reasonable men, of that slaunder which some would gladly fasten vpon it. For if holding their monstrous opinions, they had notwithstanding remained in the bosome of the Church: although fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet colourably it might haue bene said, that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel fauoureth such misshapen &amp; deformed things. But when as the Lord, in care to vphold the good report of the Gospel, hath cast them out, and they in a conscience of the hatred that the Gospelling Churches beare vnto such frensies, haue sundered themselues from them: it is maruaile that there can be anie so blind as not to see, or so impudent as not to confesse, that neither the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is the mother, nor the Churches thereof the nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie of any such hellish opinions▪ It is not therefore the loue of the Gospel professed of vs, but the want of loue, not the profession but the fruitlesse profession: that is cause of these confusions.</p>
   <p>Whereof there is yet more clearer proofe, in that as the rout of these heretiks, looked for the enmitie of our Churches: so haue they felt their hand more sore vpon thē, then the hand of any other cōpany in the world: yea our Churches litle finger hath weyed heauier vpon thē, then the loines of all other assemblies whatsoeuer. The Papists pretēd great enmitie to the Anabaptists, Swink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldians, Arians, &amp; other such detestable <hi>Antitrinitaries:</hi> yet for twentie of our fields fought against thē, they are not able to shew two: for a hundreth strokes giuen by vs, they are scarce able to shew one giuen by them: that is to say, they are scarce able to shew a line for a leafe, or a leaf for a booke. And euen in this Apostume of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of loue doubt you nothing, but the Papists make shew of such a hatred, as cannot be outmatched. How<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit it if you loke either to the cause, or the effect of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, you shall see their visard easily pulled of. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the cause, it shal plainly appere by the discourse of
<pb facs="12"/>
their opinions: that the Papistes hauing moe thinges in common with them then wee haue, haue lesse cause of hatred then we. And for the effect, let them shewe where anie of the Iustices leaning to Poperie, haue so carefully and painefully dealt for the suppressing of them: as haue the Iustices which fauour the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Or let them shewe, where anie of their Popishe Cleargie, hath laboured for the ouerthrowe of their Heresies: as haue the Ministers of the Gospel. I meane not to charge their Cleargie for not speaking, where their silence is so iust: but yet for not wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, howe can they deliuer themselues, considering their leysure which they both haue a hundreth folde more then our Ministers, and which they can vse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs at their pleasure.</p>
   <p>But as in this effect of our hatred against heresies, we haue in Christ Iesus a godly triumph, in respect of the Papistes: so for the want of that care which should fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be in vs, aswel for the preuenting of such mischiefs before they fal, as for the remouing of them when they are fallen: we, euē we all haue great cause to hang down our heads. For albeit the lord in his most iust iudgemēt, for reuenge of the contempt of the Gospel, hath giuen vp these miserable men to their owne fantasies: yet is it also' certaine that our incircumspection hath had a mighty stroke, to the bringing of it to passe. For first the gates of the Citie of God with vs, lie so wide open to all that will enter in: as if wee might looke for that securitie here vppon earth, that both doores and barres, lockes and keyes shoulde bee needelesse. For if anie will enter into our Churches, who almoste is there, to aske him from whence hee came: to instruct him of the lawes of the Citie: to require publike, both confession of his former infidelitie, and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a sounder fayth? Secondly, if being thus rashly
<pb facs="12"/>
admitted, there were yet some wall or raile to holde them in, vntill such time as they might bee better taught: The carelesse receiuing of them, might haue beene somewhat recompenced by a narrowe watche and warde, that they shoulde not issue out againe. But both the gates of our entring in, and going out, being thus vnkept: there groweth vnto the Church an infamous slaunder, whilest they are all iudged to haue beene of our Religion, the greatest number whereof haue beene such babes therein, as they knewe not the difference betwene their right and left hand. So that the bare name of Gospellers excepted, which they gat by treading now and then vpon the pauement of our assemblies: they still remained in the same ignoraunce of the truth, wherein they were at first. Where againe it appeareth, howe vniustly the Gospell is charged with these fallings away, which it woulde haue stayed, if it might haue had the full course: as is to be seene in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, where the same Gospell being receiued, such offences so thicke and threefold haue not ensued. For this happinesse, that no offences at all should bee: happened not vnto the Churches gouerned by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselues.</p>
   <p>This then being a great peece of our fault, for that we met not with these mischiefs aforehand: another peece is, that due care hath not bene taken, for the abolishing of them, after they were entred in vpon vs. Wherevnto albeit (as is aforesayd) diuerse godly, both Magistrates and Ministers haue put to their hand: yet as in a house set on fire, all runne to the quenching of it, so it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that to the suppressing of this fire, comming forth of the bottomlesse pit of hell, all ioyntly shoulde haue giuen their attendance, and euerie one haue drawne a bucket of those waters,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 7.15.</note> which the Israelites did in their calamitie. For I meane not, that they shoulde haue met
<pb facs="13"/>
to deale with the familie of loue: but with the Lorde our God. Who as in his iust wrath, hee hath raised vp this cursed sect: so vnlesse the same bee first appeased, in humbling our selues before him in prayer with wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and fasting, our eyes may faint in our heades with looking for remedie either of this euill or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hang ouer vs.</p>
   <p>But I see well enough what the cause is: why in so great an ouerplus of cares for other things, there is yet so small care taken of this, and it is, because it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed perillous vnto the estate. So (by the way) is the glorie of God troden vnder our feete, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it be defaced: yet so that it be imagined (for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it cannot be) without hazard of the estate, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most none that layeth it to his heart. But yet tell mee (I pray you) howe come we to be so secure of the estate against this route of heretikes. For let it not hurt the estate, that it is the pestilentest heresie that euer was in the land, that it leaueth neuer a peece of the knowledge of GOD whole and vnshaken, that it is a masse or packe of Poperie, Arianisme, Anabaptisme, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertisme: I say let all this not once touch the foote of the estate, which notwithstanding preaseth to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie throate of it: yet that it maketh no conscience of anie duetie to men, their owne brood onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, that they may lie to all, so they say true to themselues, that they thinke euerie thing lawfull (how filthie and howe disorderly soeuer) that their fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall spirite telleth them, doeth it not goe straitly and directly to the ouerthrowe of the cōmon wealth? For if it shoulde but suddenly come into the giddie pate of one of their perfites, that there ought to be no Magistrate, or that none ought to bee better than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or possesse more then other: it must bee by and by holden for so resolute a doctrine amongest them,
<pb facs="13"/>
as if it had beene ripely debated and decreed by all the Vniuersities in Europe: yea (a horrible thing) as if it hadde proceeded from the sacred mouth of GOD. And who can tell, whether these bee their thoughts alreadie: which they smother, vntill such time as they haue gotten an armie to execute them.</p>
   <p>A number in this lande, vppon a false alarme, haue beene in a vaine iealousie and feare of Purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme. Nowe the iustice of GOD hath payed vs. For that which was spoken before in slaunder, nowe may bee spoken in trueth: and that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, when it was not, is scarce suspected when it is. For if you seeke after the Puritans, these they bee. Which although for their loosenesse of life, they are from the toppe to the toe nothing but blottes:<note place="margin">Iud. 12.</note> yet bragge they of all perfection, euen vnto a verie deify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themselues, what mischiefe therefore yee feare might come from the Puritans, that looke for assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their handes.</p>
   <p>How beit the ouglinesse of this Heresie which shoulde driue to a feare, doeth (as it seemeth) make men carelesse of it. For they thinke that such a monstrous misshapen heresie, shoulde finde lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers either verie fewe, or if anie number: yet such sweepinges of the people, as may, at good leysure, easily bee cast out. For the first whereof, they little knowe either what the corrupt nature of man is: or what is the desert of the contempt of the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest vs. For there is no wickednesse so grosse, the print whereof our waxie and pliable nature to all euill, is not meete to receyue: and it is the Lordes iust iudgement, that they which haue despised the highest wisedome, shoulde be throwne into the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest follie.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="14"/>And if anie hartning were taken, in that they are of the rascall sort. First it is not generally true: these shamelesse dogges thrusting themselues (for a fatter soppe) into houses of great wealth. Secondly their basenesse, shoulde not free vs from the feare of them: if we remember that the Iuie which is so despised and so lowe a shrub, doth in climing by little and little, kill the tallest and mightiest Oake in the forrest.<note place="margin">Actes. 19.23.</note> Take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample first of <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Siluersmith, who set the whole Citie in an vprore, agaynst the Gospel: and then of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Coppersmith,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.14.</note> of whom by the complaintes which Saint <hi>Paule</hi> maketh of him, and imprecations against him: it is apparaunt, that he had by him receyued more hinderance in his ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then by anie other, either Doctours of the Lawe, or Princes of the common wealth. And if they were so strengthlesse, as they be supposed: yet the swarmes of them shoulde cause men to bee waking, vnlesse they haue forgotten, that neither all the wisedome nor power of Egypt, was able to resiste the armie of Lice, which the Lorde sente againste them. And it is to bee feared, least this lousie cōpany of the familie of Loue, be stirred vp, not onely to beat vs, but as it were to dry beate vs: that like as the Gospell hath beene mocked amongst vs, so the Lorde should chose him such rods, wherwith he might as it were in great scorne and disdaine strike vs againe. Such were the <hi>Hunnes, Gothes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Vandales,</hi> which being raysed out of the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil, and men of whome ther was no reckoning made: yet had they such strength through the weake professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gospel, such greate successe through the smal successe therof, such swiftnesse through the slacknesse in it: that setting vpon the mightiest and moste warlike nation in the world, they made in short time such a hād of them, as if men had had to do with Mice, or fire had
<pb facs="14"/>
met with Stubble: such a woonderfull GOD is the Lorde, who as he oftentimes in mercie, deliuereth his by thinges of nothing: so againe in wrath, hee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them by thinges of like value.</p>
   <p>But peraduenture, as the verie name of the house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde of loue, is their great glory: so it may breede in vs an opinon of their harmlesnesse. For who can feare any euill from loue, which doth good to all, and hurteth none. How beit adde only (which the trueth it selfe doth prooue) that it is the housholde of Selfeloue: and then what mischiefe is there, whiche wee may not make iust account of, if their handes be as able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it, as their heartes are frutefull to conceiue it. For except a fewe faire speaches, wherewith they would (forsooth) approue them selues to bee led with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Loue, and which are rather a cloke to couer their hatred against vs, then any wholesome fruite of vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loue: their loue is so lame, that it cannot steppe a foote out of their owne doores. And as we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to trust to in this title, so they in vaunting them selues of it, doe but glorie in their owne shame. For I can as well affoord it them, to the discouerie of their owne fylth, as the name of Iesuites vnto the Papistes, which pride themselues therein. For as they leauing the title of Christiās cōmended to vs in the holy scripture,<note place="margin">Actes. 17.</note> and coyning a new of their owne braine, carrie the note of their intollerable arrogancie in their forehead, red of all which vnderstand anie thing of Christian mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie: euen so also is it in this vermin. For besides their pride, whereby they haue sought them selues a title a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from others: what an intollerable arrogancie is it, to leaue the titles of the scripture,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> for a liking they haue to those of their owne forge? For if they would needes single themselues by a seuerall name: why tooke they not the name of the householde of fayth mencioned in
<pb facs="15"/>
the Scripture, rather then the name of the householde of Loue, wherof there is no such mention.</p>
   <p>The same or not vnlike iudgement, of their strange phrases, wherewith they apparell and set foorth their straūge opinions &amp; deuises: that to those which haue their sences wel inured to discerne of doctrines, it will be as easy thereby to discry their new learning, as it is to know an outlandish man by his toung or speach. For they are so swelling, as if they had feared least they should not haue beene sufficiently knowen, to bee of those deceiuers,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 18. Iude. 16.</note> which the Apostles Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Iude</hi> haue marked out: vnlesse they had shewed vs this brande, which the holie Apostles did set vpon their tounges. Albeit to say the trueth, in this manner of handeling, there is not more pride, then crafte and deceite. For therefore, no doubt, doe they so farre passe and exceede the measure of the common speach: that the ruder sorte not able to vnderstand them, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing astonied, might be as it were hanged in an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. Whereof if I should giue you a paterne, I could not doe it more aptely then in sending you to the gibberish of our Rogues, or of the counterfait sort of Egyptians: which were woonte to haue a speciall chat: wherewithall they amazed the simple men, whilest they drewe them into their nettes. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it is, it is most vnlike the language of the holie spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. For in steede that it doeth vtter graue and high matters, in a lowe and familiar stile: they set forth their trifling and halfepeny doctrines, with loftie and high phrases of speech.</p>
   <p>Nowe it remayneth, that for the glory of God so shamefully defaced, for the trueth so slaunderously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, for the Church so grieuously stricken, for the common wealth presently wounded, &amp; further hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
<pb facs="15"/>
that all those to whome the Lord hath giuen any meanes of stopping this gap, where at his wrath hath thus broken in vpon vs, make hast to the rescue of the trueth, and resistance of the euill.</p>
   <p>First of all therefore we must all humble our selues vnder the reuenging hand of GOD, in prayer and fasting, in sackcloth and ashes: that if by standing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iudge, and confessing our giltinesse of crime, wee doe put the halter as it were aboute our owne necks, hee may peraduenture haue compassion on vs, and repente him bothe of this, and other the euils which hee threateneth against vs. The exercise where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ought (without all controuersie) to bee publike: to the end, that the Church with all hir Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lying prostrate before his Maiestie, all their cryes &amp; complaints at once sent vp, may so ring in his eares, as that he may be the rather moued to pittie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes her. But if it be holden out, from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like assemblyes: then the Lorde casteth this charge of sanctifying a fast vppon priuate and common hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And if the priuate houses bee sparred against it, through their carelesse Maisters: yet let euery faithfull person, who trembleth and quaketh when the Lorde roareth, take him to his Chamber for the humbling and submitting of himselfe before his GOD.</p>
   <p>Then her Maiestie is heere moste humbly to bee desired, that that God which hath preserued her roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all person vnto the crowne, and in the crowne, from all the treasons intended against her: may haue her sword (or rather his owne swoorde committed vnto her) drawne vppon these horrible treasons, which are in a high hand committed directly against his own person: to the launchinge of such as are curable, and to the
<pb facs="16"/>
quite cutting off of those that are desperate, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines especially. Her moste honourable Councel, is likewise most humbly to be desired, that they would so croude vp other their weightie and graue consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that this also which in weightinesse, giueth place but vnto few, may haue the rowme that it deserueth. Namely how her Maiesties Swoorde, may be most co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly and rightly handeled, for the speediest and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuallest riddaunce heereof. Her worshipfull Iustices and other inferiour Magistrates, that they would so diligently waite vppon the execution: as that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the greater hast they make against them, the greater stay the Lorde will make in his iudgement against vs. The carefull ministers of the land, that they would not onely labour to kepe their flockes from the contagion of this pestilence: but seek also to pull such out of the fire, as through simple ignorance haue fallen into it. The godly people, that they would remember dayly so to commend the good successe of both the ministeries, of the worde and of the sworde, vnto the Lord: that the prospering in the subduing of this dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable heresy, it may (by continuance of a godly peace) go well with them and theirs after them. So shall not onely the euill it selfe, but also the slaunderous charges against the Gospel, be cleane wiped away: whilest the heresies which sprang without the fault of the Gospel, shall be remooued by the power of the Gospel: &amp; whilst the euils which rose through the sleepinesse of some of the professors, shall be put downe through the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of them all: whilest finally this heresie being of some confuted, of other some punished, prayed against of all: the Gospell may haue a greater triumph in the conquest of this heresie, then if it had neuer beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded by it.</p>
