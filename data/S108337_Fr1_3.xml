   <head>TO THE WORSHIPFVL M. IOHN GREAVES, <hi>Professor</hi> of <hi>Geometry</hi> in <hi>Gresham Colledge</hi> London; All happinesse.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>SIR,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>YOur acquaintance with the Author before his death was not long, which I have oft heard you say, you coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your great unhappinesse, but within a short time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you knew not well whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to count your selfe more happie in that you once knew him, or unhappy in that upon your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance you so suddenly lost him. This his worke then being to come forth to the censorious eye of the
<pb facs="4"/>
world, and as the manner usually is to have some Patronage. I have thought good to dedicate it to your selfe; and that for these two reasons especially.</p>
   <p>First, in respect of the sympathy betwixt it, and your studies; Laboures of this nature being usually offered to such persons whose profession is that way setled</p>
   <p>Secondly, for the great love and respect you alwayes shewed to the Author, being indeed a man that would deserve no lesse, humble, void of pride, ever ready to impart his knowledge to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in what kind soever, loving and affecting those that affected learning.</p>
   <p>For these respects then, I offer to you this Worke of your so much honoured friend. I my selfe also (as it is no lesse my duty) for his sake stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to make you hereby some part of a requitall, least I should be found guilty of ingratitude, which is a solecisme in manners, if having so fit an opportunity, I should not expresse to the world some Testimonie of love to you, who so much loved him. I desire then (good Sir) your kind acceptance of it, you knowing so well the ability of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and being also able to judge of a Worke of this
<pb facs="4"/>
nature, and in that respect the better able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it from the furie of envious Detractours, of which there are not few. Thus with my best wishes to you, as to my much respected friend, I rest.</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Yours to be commanded in any thing that he is able. <hi>IOHN CLERKE.</hi>
