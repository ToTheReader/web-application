         <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>RIENDLY</hi> Reader, Thy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Zeale to common good, may somewhat stead, but not secure me: For, if thou beest but a temperate man in this age, wherein the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets themselues are so extreamly distempered, the Ayre is sicke of their disease, and the lower bodies doe all complaine, and are shaken with the same feauer; Thy calme and plyable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution:</p>
   <p>Vnlesse thou be superlatiue &amp; superstitious in the faith and profession of Publique Weale, thou shalt be
<pb facs="4"/>
too too innerued to meete the priuie malice of those who are only studious of priuate profit; Or to make vp me and my good meaning to the generall aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
   <p>Thou maist easily conceiue, that my a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>n this: To which, the pitie of my poore Country-men did impresse and send mee foorth in the first ranke, to be exposed vnto the most danger: Which, with all other difficulties in the Attempt, I haue receiued with the one hand, and cast away with the other: I haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

   </p>
   <list>
      <item>1. Indeed, I must confesse, That myselfe was the most vnworthy and vnable of many to vndergo this Taske:</item>
      <item>2. That I haue waded thus farre, without calling of those of the Mysterie to my guidance:</item>
      <item>3. It may be, that I haue stept besides the common Causway, and trespassed <hi>pedibus ambulando</hi> vppon some mens Inclosure:</item>
      <item>4. Perhaps I haue sometimes erred, and mis set the Needle of my Compasse:</item>
      <item>5. And admit I haue not trauelled so far as the Seas offered Passage and Passe port vnto me.</item>
   </list>
   <list>
      <item>1 All this is easily answered: For you must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, That the necessitie of the Voyage did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke

me, when in all this age past before vs, no one (how able s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap>se of the present.</item>
      <item>2. I knew not whom to trust or call to Guide, lest I should betray the whole Voyage.</item>
      <item>3. Beyond the Pole of Property, I care not in what Streame my Keele leaues her dinted impression.</item>
      <item>4. Beyond the Line, the old Compasse is to be laid by, and the new one is to be vsed.</item>
      <item>5. I haue trauelled as farre as the Victuall and Tackle, which I was able to prouide with my ready flocke, would beare me. And it shall be held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all well-affected English Seafarers, worthy the hazard, charge, and time bestowed vpon it, In regard that I haue in this leading discouery set forth where the way lyes for farther Nauigation, to driue a Trade euen to the vtmost confines of those parts, and to make perfect and perpetuall commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and them.</item>

   <p>The like are my endeauours for the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>tling and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishing of a certaine course of compliance betwen the Officers and Ministers of our Lawes and their Clients, which would distinguish and set apart the vnlearned and vnconscionable crue, from those whose endowments of acquision, and indeerements of conscience, and innated composition speakes them farre more worthy.</p>
   <p>For my faults of deficience, I am not ashamed to inuite the supply of those who haue the aduantage of
<pb facs="5"/>
breeding in their particular Offices on their sides, if▪ they will afford it.</p>
   <p>For my faults of Insufficiency, I doe not blush at them: <hi>Barnardus non videt omnia:</hi> Hee that knowes most in the practice of the Lawes, knowes most how impossible it is with the single qualitie of any one man liuing, to reduce the infinite differing parcels of this Account, into a perfect and certaine Summe at the first collation or calculation thereof.</p>
   <p>For my Printers faults of all kindes, I giue him kindly to your mercy.</p>
   <p>Would you haue me now to leaue all vndone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some part cannot bee done to perfection at the first?</p>
   <p>Will you blame me for those few imperfect <hi>quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libets,</hi> without whose company and fellowship, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vsefull <hi>quodlibets</hi> with which the ensuing Trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate is forced, had neuer beene able to hold out so teadious a Iourney.</p>
   <p>Surely, whatsoeuer you bee that shall doe it, I must tell you, that the Million Multitude will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and report you for a second <hi>Alexander,</hi> not the Conquerour, but the Copper-Smith; not famous for triumph, but for Trade, Not <hi>Alexander</hi> who in his greatnesse would be worshiped as a God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; but <hi>Alexander</hi> who in his leather Apron would haue the very Puppits which his hand rough-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, drawe an adoration and reuerence amongst the people.</p>

      <l>Good <hi>Alexander,</hi> do not feare thy trading,</l>
