   <head>¶The Preface to the
Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Lutarche</hi> a noble Philosopher, &amp;
a diligent Historician, writeth
in the life of <hi>Demetrius</hi> a king
of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> that when an
olde woman came to him, beséeching him
to heare her speake, and he made aunswer
that he had no leasure, the woman looking
vpon him, sayd to him agayne with a loude
voyce: why, haue you no leasure to rule, as
a king shoulde? Which wordes so pearced
the kinges heart, and so greatly preuayled
in him, that he forthwith gaue her audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and from that day, none came to him
for any matter, but gently, and with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
he did heare them, &amp; discusse their
causes. Boysteouslye were these wordes
spoken of a subiect, and not with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
that was méete to be geuen to a
king. Notwithstanding, as <hi>Cicero</hi> witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in the second of his Tusculanes: <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis
res est dolor, sine dubio, aspera, amara,
inimica naturae, ad patiendum tolerandum{que}
difficilis:</hi> Sorow is a gréeuous thing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt sharpe, bitter, and an enemye to
nature, harde to suffer and forbeare. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
<pb facs="2"/>
(as I suppose) constreyned the séelye
woman to speake as she did, <hi>&amp; veras expri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere
voces,</hi> and to vtter the truth. On the
other side consider, not only the gentle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this noble prince, but also his great
wisedome, in considering nothing to be
more séemely for a gouernour, then to hear
mens causes indifferentlye, and to sée all
wronges redressed. <hi>Nihil</hi> (sayeth the same
<hi>Plutarche) tam egregium tam{que} proprium
Regis esse videtur, quàm iusticiae opus,</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is so excellent &amp; so properlye pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to him that is a magistrate, as iustice.
I haue read that the Tribunes, which wer
officers chosen for the defence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of Rome, had their gates or dores
neuer shut, neither by day, nor by night, in
token that thither might be the recourse of
al them that had néede of succour. So ought
euery gouernoure, whether he be spiritual
or temporall, to be a succour, and as it wer
a castle and a fortresse to them that be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his tuition. <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> in his bookes
that he wrote <hi>de principe,</hi> amongst other
preceptes, willeth chiefely and aboue all
thinges, that whosoeuer be the head of the
people, be a diligent worshipper &amp; folower
of God: next, that he be louing to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,
<pb facs="2"/>
if he will haue them to be faythfull
to him, and loue him as subiectes shoulde
their prince. For it is not of likelyhood, said
<hi>Dion,</hi> neither doth nature permit, but that
he that loueth, should be loued, when we
sée dogges to fawne, and horses to neye to
them, of whom they be cherished. Again, he
would haue such rulers to call themselues
shepherdes and féeders of men, rather then
otherwise. So <hi>Homer</hi> calleth a king <hi>pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
populi,</hi> a shepherde and féeder of the
people. And <hi>Plato</hi> in his Dialogue called
<hi>Minos,</hi> writeth, that <hi>Minos</hi> and <hi>Radaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi>
which gaue lawes to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> men of <hi>Crete,</hi>
were the true shepherdes of men, whiche
was not spoken of so noble a Philosopher
without a iust cause: for nothing doth more
nourish, mainteine and vpholde a common
wealth then lawe, which, as <hi>Tullie in secū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
de natura deorum</hi> sayth, <hi>est recti praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,
praui{que} depulsio,</hi> a commaunder of that
which is good and honest, and an expulser
of all that is noughte and vnhonest. Now,
as a shepherdes care is to sée his shéepe
fedde in wholsome pastures, and to be
kepte safe from wolues, &amp; al other beastes
that would wery and destroy them: and if
<pb facs="3"/>
any in the flocke be infected with any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
scabbe, or inward maladie, to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
it betime: or if the contagion admit no
helpe, but is incurable, to haue suche a one
away from the flocke, that he hurt none of
them that be whole: Euen so must he that
will be a shepherde of men, studye for the
good ordering and quietnes of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
ouer whom he hath charge, and that
all enormities that might disturbe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth, whether it be spirituall or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
be expelled, and that all faultes be
redressed with due correction, vsing lenitie
and seueritie, after as hope or dispaire of
amendment shall appeare. Neither hath the
name of a shepherde lacked his prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
at any time. That good Abell, <hi>ad cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius
munera deus respexit,</hi> to whose giftes &amp;
sacrifice God had respect, was a shepherde:
Abraham, in whose séede God promised,
that all nations shoulde be blessed, was a
shepherde: so was Isaac his sonne, and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
his nephewe, and his sonnes also. Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
that noble captayne, and deliuerer of
God his people, was a shepherde in the
lande of Madian. Dauid, of whom S. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
sayde, that God gaue this testimonye:
<hi>Inueni Dauid filium lesse, virum secundùm
<pb facs="3"/>
cor meum, qui faciet omnes voluntates meas:</hi>
I haue founde Dauid the sonne of Iesse, a
man after mine owne heart and minde,
which shall do all my will. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
king Dauid was a shepherde. These I
suppose almightie God woulde haue to be
ensamples to all them that be in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
for as Paule sayth: <hi>Quaecun{que} scripta
sunt, ad nostram eruditionem scripta sunt,</hi>
All thinges that are written, are written
for our instruction, that as they fedde that
séely innocent cattell, so shoulde all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
that professe his sons name, learne
to gouerne the people in the obedience of
his doctrine, that they might be <hi>innocentes
manibus, &amp; puro corde: nec iurantes in dolo
proximo suo,</hi> Innocents of their handes,
and of a pure heart, which vse no deceipt
towardes their neighbours, but in al their
doinges shewe themselues to be <hi>veras oues
pascuae Christi,</hi> the true shéepe of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of Iesus Christe, who sayeth: <hi>Bonus
pastor animam suàm dat pro ouibus suis,</hi> A
good shepherd geueth his life for his shéepe.
Fewe wordes, but full of pith: And neuer
could mo thinges be spoken more compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouslye.
For what will he refuse to doo?
what labour, what trauayle, what payne
<pb facs="4"/>
will he forsake, which for y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> perfourmance
of that he goeth about, will not spare his
owne life? If a good shepherde setteth so
great store by his shéepe, if he loue them so
tenderly, that he will rather lose his lyfe
then to sée thē in any danger, what will he
not doo els for them? Howe can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
but that he will sée his flocke fedde in
wholsome pastures? howe can it be thoght,
that he will not tarye with them to kéepe
them from wolues, from dogges that fall
to byting of them, and from other like ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenous
beasts? Who would imagine him
to be so negligent, that he will not in the
euening bring them home to the cote or
folde? Will he not, trowe you, if any be
strayed, go séeke him out, and bring him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
to his felowes? If any be sicke, will
he not sée him holpen with all diligence?
Sée therfore what a great matter our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior
did comprehend &amp; folde vp, as it were,
&amp; knit together in a bundell, al that can be
desired in a good herdesman. O that gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
whō god hath put in authoritie, <hi>per
quem reges regnant,</hi> by whom kinges doo
reigne, who had Peter, if he loued him, to
féede his shéepe, who hath also constitute
vnder him féeders vpon the earth, some spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
some temporall, O, I say, that they
<pb facs="4"/>
would diligently looke vpon these wordes:
<hi>A good shepherde geueth his life for the
sheepe,</hi> &amp; seriouslye ponder in their minde
what a charge is hid in this short sentēce,
how many thinges <hi>princeps pastorum,</hi> the
prince of shepherdes, as Peter calleth him,
doth require of them whom he hath made
herdsmen vnder him, whose duetie is to be
good pastours and faythfull féeders like to
their master. O that they wold call to their
mind, that they must at length depart hēce,
&amp; come where it shalbe said to euery one of
thē: <hi>Redde rationem villicationis tuae,</hi> Geue
accompt of thy bayliwike, Come forth and
shew how thou hast fed my flock that I cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to thy handes: Thou Bishop, howe
haste thou visited thy diocesse, what Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
what Vicares haste thou admitted?
Thou Archedeacon, howe often haste thou
visited &amp; séene euery curate to do his duty?
how hast thou redressed al enormities and
slaunders within thy iurisdictiō? Thou par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>son,
thou vicare, thou curate, how hast thou
fed thy flock with good ensamples of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
&amp; vertuous liuing, with kéeping of hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality
to thy power, by preching holsome
doctrine, in reuerently ministring my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes?
Thou king, howe haste thou
ruled thy Realme? What lawes
<pb facs="5"/>
lawes haste thou made for the setting forth
of my glorye, for the extirpation of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syes,
for maintenaunce of equitie, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of wronge, for prouision, that
thinges may be solde at a competent price,
that couetous men make no dearth to
their condemnation, when I geue plentie?
Thou Lorde, howe haste thou gouerned
vnder thy prince? Thou man of woorship,
howe haste thou indeuoured to haue qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes
kepte, and the princes lawes to be
obeyed? Thou Iustice, how haste thou mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
right indifferently to all persons?
Thou Maior or head officer in anye Citie
or Towne, howe haste thou kept thy selfe
cléere from periurie? howe haste thou séene
good order obserued, and al ydlenes &amp; disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
maners to be banished? Finally, thou,
whatsoeuer officer or Magistrate thou be,
howe haste thou regarded the common
wealth, and preferred it afore thy priuate
lucre or commoditie? O that these thinges
were considered: for as sure as God liueth,
these accomptes will he call vpon straytly.
None shall escape, <hi>Cui multum datur</hi> (as
S. Gregorie sayeth) <hi>multum ab eo quaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
He that hath muche geuen him, shall
make a great accompt thereof, and muche
<pb facs="5"/>
shall be of him required: And at that daye
percase he shall recken him selfe moste for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
and happie, that had leaste in this
worlde, and least to doo. And he peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
moste infortunate, that hath moste to
doo in this worlde, vnlesse he order it well,
vnlesse he order it righteously, iustly, and
ordinately.</p>
   <p>Nowe, good Reader, thou haste hearde,
that Christe sayeth: <hi>Bonus pastor animam
suam dat pro ouibus suis,</hi> And to put thée
out of doubt who is this good shepherde, he
sayeth: <hi>Ego sum pastor bonus, &amp; cognosco
oues meas, &amp; cognoscunt me meae.</hi> I am the
good shepherde, which will geue my lyfe
for my shéepe, by my death to purchase thē
lyfe, that as I will rise, and dye no more,
so shall they after their bodily death arise
at the last day, neuer to dye any more, but
to liue alwayes with my father and me. I
knowe my shéepe, not all onely that they
be mine, but I so knowe them for mine,
that I wilbe their succour in their tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
I will strengthen them in their
persecutions, I will receaue them into my
ioye and glorie, I knowe them, and they
knowe me. This is then required of the
shéepe, that they knowe their shepherde.
<pb facs="6"/>
Thrée properties must be in euery man or
woman that shall haue this worthy name
to be called a shéepe of Christe. The firste
propertie is, that our Sauiour sayeth, that
his shéepe doo know him. This knowledge
haue Christes shéepe of him, that by his
godhead he is their father, by his manhood
he is their brother, and by his benefites he
is their louing lorde and master. They
knowe it is he, and none other, that hath
made their peace with God his father: <hi>Ipse
enim est pax nostra,</hi> for he is our peace (<hi>Ad
Ephesios secundo</hi>) he hath gotten vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes
of our sinnes, he hath deliuered
vs out of the bondage of the deuill, he hath
purchased heauen for vs, he is to vs <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
fortitudinis,</hi> the Tower of our strength.
The seconde propertie of Christes shéepe
is, to heare their shepherdes voyce, and to
geue no eare to the voyce of any straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
You will aske me peraduenture, how
you shoulde heare him, which although he
be verily and bodily héere with vs in the
Sacrament of the Aultare, yet in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
forme he is ascended vp into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and sitteth on the right hande of his
father? Wherevnto I aunswere, that we
<pb facs="6"/>
must heare his voyce sounding by the
mouth of his Churche, which is the verye
true spouse of Iesus Christe, <hi>Quam sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficauit,
mundans eam lauacro aquae in verbo
vitae,</hi> whom he hath sanctified and purified
with the bath of water in the worde of
life, <hi>vt exhiberet ipse sibi gloriosam ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
non habentem maculam aut rugam,</hi> to
make it a glorious Churche to himselfe
without spot or wrinkle (<hi>Ad Ephesios.</hi> 5.)
If we heare the church, we heare Christe:
for as the holy Bishop and Martyr <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
writeth in the fortie Chapter of his thirde
booke, <hi>Vbi ecclesia, ibi &amp; spiritus, &amp; vbi spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus
dei, illic ecclesia &amp; omnis gratia, spiritus
autem veritas,</hi> where the Churche is, there
is the spirite of God, and where the spirite
of God is, there is the Churche and all
grace, and the spirite is truth. Wherefore
as the same godly father writeth in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> forty
and thrée Chapiter of his fourth booke, we
be bounde to be obedient to the Prelates
of the Churche, <hi>his qui successionem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
ab Apostolis,</hi> to them that haue their
successiō from the Apostles. <hi>Reliquos verò</hi>
(sayth he) <hi>qui absistunt a principali successi-,
<pb facs="7"/>
&amp; quocun{que} loco colliguntur, suspectos ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere
quasi haereticos oportet,</hi> As for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that go away from the principall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
we ought to suspect them as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.
These are Ireneus wordes in the
place nowe alleaged. And Christ sayth him
selfe: <hi>Qui vos audit, me audit,</hi> He that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
you, heareth me. Wherfore, if we wil
heare Christ, as his father hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vs, <hi>Ipsum audite,</hi> Heare him, <hi>Math.</hi> 17.
then must we heare the Churche. The
Churche is our moste holy Mother, whom
we ought to haue in great reuerence, and
to commit our selues wholly vnto her, to
heare her, and, like obedient children, to do
what she biddeth vs. What the Churche
holdeth in matters of religion, that must
we holde: what the Churche prescribeth, it
is our duetie to folowe: what the Churche
forbiddeth, that are we bound, vnder paine
of damnation to auoyde in any wise. S.
Iohn in the fourth Chapter of his firste E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
biddeth vs be ware, that we beléeue
not euery spirite, but to trye the spirites,
whether they be of God or not. Then, how
can they be of God, whiche go from the
Churche? S. Augustine in the exposition
of this Epistle of S. Iohn, <hi>tractatu primo,</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
writeth thus: <hi>Qui ecclesiam relinquit, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo
est in Christo, qui in membris Christi
non est? Quomodo est in Christo, qui in
corpore Christi non est?</hi> He that leaueth
the Churche, howe is he in Christe, that is
not in the members of Christe? howe is he
in Christ, that is not in the body of Christ?
By the which S. Augustine affirmeth, that
the Churche, which is the spouse of Christ,
is also the misticall bodye of Christe, and
Christe is the heade of the Churche. As
many therefore, as be Christe his shéepe,
they heare their shepherdes voyce in the
Churche. They will not heare the voyce of
straungers, as of <hi>Luther, Oecolampadius,
Zuinglius, Caluine,</hi> &amp; like heretikes, which
for all their gaye wordes, and crying still,
Christe and the Gospell, maye haue euerye
one of them, these verses of <hi>Persius</hi> in his
fifte Satyre worthely spoken to him:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Pelliculam veterem retines, &amp; fronte politus
Astutam vapido seruas sub pectore vulpem.</hi>
Thou kéepest still thine olde hyde vppon
thée, and bearing a fayre face, thou wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
a wylye foxe vnder thy vaporous
brest. These be they, of whom S. Peter
speaketh in the seconde Chapter of his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Epistle: <hi>Magistri mendaces, qui intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducunt
<pb facs="8"/>
sectas perditionis,</hi> Lying masters,
bringing in sectes of perdition, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the God that bought them. Howebeit,
sithen it is so, as Paule sayeth, There will
be alwayes rauening wolues,<note place="margin">Act. 20.</note>
      <hi>non parcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
gregi,</hi> not sparing the flock, And among
our owne selues will men arise, speaking
peruerse thinges, And suche is our frayle
nature, that as the wittie <hi>Horace</hi> sayeth:
<q>
         <l>Decipimur specie recti,</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>We be soone deceaued vnder the colour of
truth. It behoueth vs to folowe the counsel
of our head and principall master Iesus
Christe, whiche teacheth vs an excellent
document of heauenly philosophie, saying:
<hi>Attendite vobis à falsis Prophetis,</hi> Take yée
héede to your selues, and beware of false
Prophetes, which come vnto you, <hi>in vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis
ouium,</hi> in shéepes cloathing, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
they are <hi>Lupi rapaces,</hi> Rauening
wolues: We must, I say, beware, that we
be not deluded, and vnder colour of Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
veritie, be made to receaue perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and damnable heresyes, as alas the
more pitie, hath miserably chaunced to our
noble Realme of Englande, vnder colour
of bringing vs to truth, leading vs awaye
from the truth, to the vtter decaye of all
<pb facs="8"/>
godlines, and setting vp of counterfaite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
The wéede hath nowe ouer growen
the corne, euill, hurtfull, and soulequelling
wéedes of heresie haue ouergrowen, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
pulled downe to the grounde, and
vtterly choked the good corne of christen
religion, and all ecclesiasticall constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
All you therefore that haue bene sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and taken wéedes for wholsome flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
beware least with the stenche of suche
rotten wéedes, yée infecte your soule to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
damnation. The infallible truth
is dayly opened vnto you, The falshood is
mightily conuinced, as shall plainelye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the Discourse héere folowing.
Stande no more in the defence of that,
which you may easily knowe and sée with
your eyes, if ye will not be wilfullye and
obstinately blinde, to be nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt:
What doo I call it, deceipt? naye, I
cal it a most venimous poison to the soule,
yea, and an hellishe draught of endlesse
death. Playe not the parte of a mad man,
of whom <hi>Horace</hi> writeth in the seconde
booke of his Epistles, that he was angrye
with his frendes, for that they had caused
him to be healed of his phrenesie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to his wittes agayne: Be not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye,
<pb facs="9"/>
that you may (if you will) be brought
out of the fowle miste, into the cléere ayre,
from darkenes to light, from an horrible
phrenesie to godly wisedome. Folowe the
wholsome counsell of Saint Paule in the
fourth to the <hi>Ephesians, Vt non simus am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plius
pueri, qui fluctuemus, &amp; circumfera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
quouis vento doctrinae, per versutiam
hominum, per astutiam qua nos adoriuntur,
vt imponant nobis,</hi> That we be no longer
children, and fléete too and fro, caried hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and thither with euerye blast of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
by the wilines and craftines of men,
wherwith they set vpon vs to deceiue vs.
There haue béene a great manye suche
sprongen vp in our Realme of late, which
haue taught vs wronge Lessons: <hi>Emende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
ergò in melius,</hi> Let vs amend therfore.
The thirde propertie is, that the shéepe doo
folowe their Shepherde: This propertie
is of so great importance, that without it
the other two cannot auayle. It is not y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to knowe Christe to be our refuge,
our helpe and succoure: It is not ynoughe
with that also to heare Christe speaking to
vs in his Churche, except we folow Christ
and his Churche, and shewe our selues
willingly to doo that which the Churche
<pb facs="9"/>
commaundeth vs. We must fast, when the
Churche commaundeth vs, and as it bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs: We must pray as the Churche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth
vs, We must doo those good woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
that the Churche teacheth vs to doo. In
obeying the Churche, we obey God: if we
be disobedient to the Churche, we disobeye
God. For as <hi>Chrisostome</hi> sayeth vpon the
firste Epistle to the Corinthians, <hi>vt corpus
&amp; caput vnus est homo, ita vnum est eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia
&amp; Christus,</hi> As the body and the head is
but one man, so is Christe and his Church
one thing. Doo therefore as the wise man
biddeth thée, <hi>Audi disciplinam patris tui, &amp;
ne dimittas legem matris tuae,</hi> Heare the
discipline of thy father, and forsake not
the lawe of thy mother: I meane, thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the holye Churche, whom as manye
as forsake, they forsake God also. For as
holy <hi>Ciprian</hi> writeth <hi>de simplicate prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorum:
Habere non potest deum patrem,
qui ecclesiam non habet matrem,</hi> He can
not haue God to be his father, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the Churche for his mother. Yée
may sée here euidentlye, that this holye
man would haue vs to be obedient vnto,
and diligently to kéepe, the ordinaunces
<pb facs="10"/>
of our fathers, &amp; not to institute euery day
newe fashions, as men moste vnconstant,
and full of newe fangles. The Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
are praysed, that they suffered no
straunge ware to be brought into their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
whereby the Citizens might be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
and corrupted in their maners,
and for the same cause they extoll greatlye
<hi>Licurgus,</hi> which made the same law. Now,
if the Lacedemonians were so serious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruers
of their olde lawes and customes,
what a shame shall this be to vs Christian
men (which were not taught of <hi>Licurgus,</hi>
but of Christe himselfe) dayly to alter and
chaunge, not content with those rites and
Ceremonyes that were ordeyned of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
time out of memorie? <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
in his thirde booke against the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syes
of <hi>Valentine,</hi> and suche other: whose
wordes taken out of his fourth Chapter of
the sayde booke, I will briefely rehearse:
<hi>Si quae de aliqua modica quaestione discepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
esset, nonnè oporteret in antiquissimas
recurrere ecclesias, in quibus Apostoli con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersati
sunt, &amp; ab eis de praesenti quaestione
sumere quod certum &amp; re liquidum est?</hi> If
any controuersie shoulde be of any questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were it neuer so litle, must it not be
<pb facs="10"/>
méete to haue our recourse vnto the moste
auncient Churches, in the which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were conuersant, and of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
the playne certaintie thereof? It fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
<hi>Quid autem si ne{que} Apostoli qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
Scripturas reliquissent nobis, nonnè o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portebat
ordinem sequi traditionis, quam
tradiderunt his quibus committebant eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias?</hi>
But what if the Apostles left nothing
written of that matter, must we not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the tradition of them, to whose gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
they committed the Churches?
Here haue you the minde of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who
was néere vnto Christ his time: for as S.
Hierome testifyeth in an Epistle to one
<hi>Theodora,</hi> he was Disciple to <hi>Papias,</hi> who
was S. Iohn the Euangelists scholler. He
woulde haue men to be taught of Christe,
of his Apostles and their successours, and
not of euery one, which rashelye and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
lawfull authoritie taketh vpon him to
be a teacher. Christen men should be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to christen ordinaunces, and folowe
that doctrine that is alowed by them that
are lawfully called, and haue the censure
of doctrine committed to them. Such were
the Apostles, called and put in authoritie
by Christe. Suche were they, to whom
<pb facs="11"/>
these agayne gaue the charge ouer anye
faythfull congregation. Suche are all they
which haue so from time to time béene
lawfully called by them that haue power
to put others in authoritie, and so succée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in due order, els, <hi>Quomodò praedicabūt
nisi mittantur,</hi> Howe shall they preache,
except they be sent, as it is written in the
tenth to the Romanes, and sent by them
which haue authoritie to sende. Did not
S. Paule for that purpose leaue <hi>Titus</hi> in
<hi>Crete?</hi> Did he not also geue Timothie
charge to laye handes to quickelye on no
man? To these that be thus lawfullye or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
and called to haue cure and charge
of soules, ye are bounde to geue an eare: by
these ye must be ruled in matters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as obedient children to their spiriritual
fathers. And this biddeth S. Hierome, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to <hi>Nepotian: Esto subiectus pontifici
tuo, &amp; quasi animae parentem suspice,</hi> Be
subiect to thy Bishop, &amp; reuerence him as
thy soules father. The same lesson teacheth
Chrisostome in an Homilye, <hi>De recipiendo
Seueriano,</hi> where he beginneth thus: <hi>Sicuti
capiti corpus cohaerere necessarium est, ita
ecclesiam sacerdoti, &amp; principi populum,</hi>
As it is of necessitie, that the body cleaue
<pb facs="11"/>
to the head, so it is likewise of necessitie,
that the congregation cleaue to their
Priest and spirituall ruler, and the people
to their prince. And within a fewe wordes
after he alleageth for the confirmation of
this matter the Apostle writing thus to
the Hebrewes, in the thirtenth Chapter:
<hi>Obedite praepositis vestris &amp; obtemperate
eis, quia ipsi peruigilant pro vobis, quasi pro
animabus vestris rationem reddituri,</hi> Obeye
them that haue the ouersight of you, and
doo as they would haue you, for they watch
for your sakes, as they which shall geue
accoumptes for your soules. This obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
doth our Sauiour require of all men,
saying: <hi>Qui vos audit, me audit,</hi> He that
heareth you, heareth me. This obedience
to Christes Churche hath continued
throughout all Christendome time out
of minde. And if the authoritie of the
learned and holye fathers ought to beare
swaye and preuayle, as of right it ought
to doo in déede. <hi>Arrogantium enim
hominum est, maiorum suorum authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
aspernari, &amp; se illis ingenio vel sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
anteponere:</hi> For it is the maner and
propertie of proude arrogant persons to
contemne the authoritie of their elders,
<pb facs="12"/>
and to preferre themselues before themin
wit or learning. If the consent of all
christen Regions should be regarded, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilia</hi>
(sayth <hi>Aristotle</hi> in the first Chapter
of the firste booke of his Topikes) <hi>quae vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur
omnibus vel plurimis,</hi> Those things
are probable, which all men, or at the least,
the most part doo iudge to be so. If the long
continuaunce of time must be of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<hi>In his enim</hi> (as witnesseth S. Hilarie
vpon the hundred and eyghtéene psalme)
<hi>tanquàm in coelo verbum dei permanet, in
quibus hoc verbum non offenditur,</hi> In thē
doth the word of God abide, among whom
that worde is not offended. If these thrée,
I saye, The authoritie of the learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
The common consent of christian
Regions, The long continuaunce of time,
may be a sufficient testimonie for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
we haue the true Gospell, and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> true
sense of it: Our religion is the very chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
religion, The order of Ceremonyes
that the Catholike Churche doth vse, is the
right order, Our fasting and praying is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Scriptures, Our Church is
the true and lawfull spouse of Christ, from
the which as many as seperate them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
they are no shéepe of Christes folde,
<pb facs="12"/>
they are reprobate persons, they are the
children of Beliall, they are ympes of hell.
You know what order your fathers kept,
howe they liued, and howe they beléeued:
You are not ignoraunt, howe you haue
béene brought vp, instructed and trained in
the lawes of Christe. Whosoeuer goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to infringe or breake any part of that
godly order, of that auncient custome and
laudable vsage, he is an heretike, an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye
to God, a murtherer to mannes soule,
a disturber of the common wealth, a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerter
of all honest discipline, and therfore
moste vnwoorthy to liue among men.</p>
   <p>I haue hearde, read, and séene manye
thinges, yet can I not reade, heare, or sée
any worlde more contaminate and proue
to all kinde of vices then this our age is.
And howbeit afore our dayes haue béene
in all times and ages men and women ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
vitious and monstrous in their liuing,
yet then vertue was vertue, and vice was
vice: But nowe in our corrupt time, we
haue lost the true names and vse of all
thinges, and vertue with vs is taken for
vice, and contrarily, vice is coumpted for
vertue. They that be studious of modestie,
obseruers of temperancie, and louers of
<pb facs="13"/>
sobrietie, they be nowe a dayes called
Pinchepennyes, and suche that hunger
droppeth out of their noses. If any be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
&amp; folowers of the Catholike, which
is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> true religion, they be called Phariseys
&amp; Papists: The discrete mā, he is called an
hipocrite, &amp; the small talker a foole and an
ignorant person. On the other side, they
that leade their liues in all kinde of ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ote,
they be called hansome men, men of
the right making, and suche as can tell
howe to kéepe honest mennes companye.
Agayne, the statelyer that one goeth, the
higher that he looketh, and the stouter and
malapertlier that he speaketh, the more is
he praysed among y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worldlings for a wise
man, who will not suffer himselfe to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertroden
and made a laughing stocke to
euery Rascall. With such vayne glorious
prayses be suche proude <hi>Thrasoes</hi> extolled
and magnifyed of the more parte, and no
small number are geuen to flatterie, and
enhausing of Clawbacks, that neuer could
that saying of <hi>Terence</hi> be better verifyed
then it is nowe: <hi>Obsequium amicos, veritas
odium parit,</hi> To holde vp mennes yea and
their naye, in holding with the hare, and
running with the hounde, getteth a man
<pb facs="13"/>
frendes, but he that will lay flattery aside,
and tell the playne truth, shall get nothing
but hatred. Thus in these dayes vice is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled,
and vertue contemned: Ill rule is
made of, and good rule neglected.</p>
   <p>O heart dissimuled, which vnder coloure
to be iust and true, canst cloke vnto vs hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
for deuotion, ambition for gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
couetousnes for competencie, crueltie
for zeale, bolde babling without learning
for eloquence, florishing, Rhetorike with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fruite or reason, follye for grauitie, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
without wit, and fleshly wanton li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
for libertie of the Gospell. This is
nothing els but the deuils drifte, alway co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
his poyson vnder some taste of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:
<hi>Fallit enim vitium specie virtutis &amp; vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra:</hi>
For the summe and ende of all their
false doctrine, is nothing els but malice
with murther, to the ouerthrowe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
religion, and the true ministers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
This is their shéepes clothing, for an
vnhappie reformation: <hi>Nam impia sub dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci
melle venena latent,</hi> Vnder swéete honye
is deadly venome hid. O blinde ignorance,
and ignorant blindnes, O cruell &amp; damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mischiefe comming frō y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bottomles pit
<pb facs="14"/>
of hell. O intolerable furiousnes and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
more detestable then it may any longer
be suffered: The great displeasure, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
vengeaunce, the cruell plagues of
God hange ouer our heades, if this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
heresie be not shortly remoued from
mens mindes. O good God, howe long wilt
thou suffer this intolerable abhomination?
It shameth me, it abhorreth me to thinke,
that these shamelesse beastes are not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to speake of the moste belssed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of Christes Churche: who is able
to expresse eyther by tonge or penne their
wicked abhomination? whye haue we a
pleasure to forsake the true vnderstanding
of Gods moste sacred worde, and become
folowers and bondslaues of the deuils coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeite▪
and deceiptfull expositions, and
carnall reasons set out by his ministers,
who in religion are so deuided, that nowe
they dreame one thing, and now another:
this day they like, to morowe they mislike,
and one is against another of them, euen
in the highest misterie of Christe his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And no meruaile, for the deuill is
their chiefe head, whom they serue, and he
is full of lyes, variaunce, diuision, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde:
and vnder him their Schoolemasters
<pb facs="14"/>
were <hi>Hus, Luther, Zuinglius, Oecolampa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,
Bucer, Melancthon,</hi> and the Archehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike
<hi>Caluine,</hi> whose heresies are confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Discourse hereafter ensuing.
These with the rest of that rable did neuer
agrée one with another, in their doinges
there is no vnitie, no certaintie at all: and
therfore such masters, such scollers come of
them. And this diuision, this vnconstancie
of doctrine was a manifest tokē, that they
were not the children of our true mother
the catholike Churche, nor ministers of
of Christe, but the children of the deuill,
and ministers of Antichriste, yea, very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristes.
For whosoeuer (sayth S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine)
is gone from the vnitie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Churche, he is become an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christe.
These Antichristes haue borne a
great stroke nowe too longe time in our
Realm of England, in whō is no constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
no stedfastnes of religion and doctrine:
These are they that haue damnably dece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
you, &amp; haue with their damnable prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinges
intised you from Churche to
Churche, from an heauenly Churche, to a
malignant Church: from a louing mother,
to a flattering harlot: from the condition
of grace, to the state of perdition: from
<pb facs="15"/>
truth to falshood, from faythfull beléeuing
to carnall reasoning, from sauing Christe
to deceauing Antichriste. But (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
beware, be not deceaued, and be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to arise, that haste so shamefullye
fallen, be not ashamed to come home to
your mother the Churche, sith she is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to receaue you: Let not follye lose
the thing that grace hath so preciously of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
&amp; purchased: Let not wilfulnes and
blindnes put out so great light as is nowe
shewed vnto thée, but embrace moste hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the doctrine of our Mother the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Church, so shall you sit in the lappe of
so tender a mother, which will
cherish you into life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.
