   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne of the diseases of this age, is the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Books, that doth so ouercharge
the worlde, that it is not able to disgest
the abundance of idle matter that is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day hatched and brought into the
world, that are as diuers in their formes, as their Authors
be in their faces.</p>
   <p>It is but a thriftlesse, and a thankelesse occupation, this
writing of Bookes, a man were better to sit singing in a
<hi>Coblers shop,</hi> for his pay is certaine, a penny a patch: but a
Booke-writer, if hee get sometimes a few commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Iudicious,</hi> he shall be sure to reape a thousande
reproaches of the <hi>Malicious.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Bookes are like Cheese, that is neuer well seasoned to
euery mans tast; for one will say it is too salt, another wil
say it is too fresh, a thirde will say it is to tart, another
thinkes it to be too milde; one will haue it too hard, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
too soft, another too tough, another too brittle,
it neuer pleaseth euery mans tast; no more do Bookes.</p>
   <p>I am censured for writing of a Book, to be a malicious
enemy to <hi>Ireland,</hi> to poore <hi>Ireland,</hi> that (God knoweth)
is rather to be pittied, then spighted.</p>
   <p>I confesse, I haue made my selfe known in print, to be
an enemy to Popery, but not to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Aristotle</hi> being vpbraided by some of his friends, that
he had beene ouer mercifull to a wicked man: I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
(saide <hi>Aristotle</hi>) bin mercifull towardes the man,
but not towards his wickednesse.</p>
   <p>So say I by <hi>Ireland,</hi> though I finde fault with the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
that is committed in the Country, yet I find no fault
<pb facs="5"/>
with the Countrey it selfe, nor with a great number of
good people that are of the <hi>Irish</hi> birth, that I neuer ment
to reproue, neither am I able to detect.</p>
   <p>But for those that haue found, so many faults with my
book, that I so honestly meant for the good of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
I forgiue them from my heart, for I durst sweare for
them, they did it more for want of wit, then for any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
they beare to my person.</p>
   <p>I haue liued in <hi>Ireland</hi> of a poore pay, the full recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of 47. yeares, spent in my Prince and Countreyes
seruice, I haue not begged nor purchased any man lāds,
rents, or reuennewes; I haue not heaped to my selfe, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Offices or Church-liuinges: yet something I haue
noted of the Countrey by obseruation. I see a number of
good people, that are both capable of obedience &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
if they were not misled: but their minds (alas)
are still poysoned with Popery, and what is he that it not
touched with a kinde of compassion, to see the poore &amp;
silly people so seduced &amp; carried away by these iuggling
<hi>Iesuites?</hi> What monstrous miracles are there daily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
and how many lying woonders are there to bee
witnessed, testified by men scarce worth to bee credited,
and yet with what confidence are they receiued and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued?</p>
   <p>I haue yet once againe betaken me to my penne, and I
haue writ something. I know not what my selfe: he that
would vnderstand it, let him read a Gods name, he shall
finde I haue dealt plainly, without welt or gard.</p>
   <p>I woulde not haue it thought, that I make any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Irish,</hi> in respect of their
birth, for I know there be as woorthy men in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as
any are in <hi>England,</hi> though not in such generality, nor so
many in number: neyther is that to be wondered at, for
there are many reasons to enduce it: So I know, there are
too many of the <hi>English,</hi> that are planted in all the parts
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that are no lesse superstitious, no lesse Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
nor no lesse contentious both to God and the K.
<pb facs="5"/>
then the most wilde or sauage Irish man, that neuer came
in place where to learne good or bad.</p>
   <p>It is not therefore either the Countrey or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman,
that maketh me either to loue or hate, it is their
manners and conditions that maketh mee both to prayse
or dispraise.</p>
   <p>As M. <hi>Stanihurst</hi> therefore in his description of Ireland,
in the 8. Chapter, discoursing of the manners and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of the <hi>Meere Irish</hi> (for so hee tearmeth them) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he entereth into the matter, fore-warneth his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
not to impute any barbarous custome, that he shold
there speake of to the Cittizens, Townes-men, or to the
Inhabitants of the English pale, for that he reputeth thē
to be men of another spirit, better trained vp in science,
knowledge, ciuility, in curtesie, and such other like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
of humanity. Let mee intreat the like fauour,
that hauing now occasion to speake of the manners and
customes of the Irish, do not thinke me yet to be so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
but that I doe make a great difference, betweene
those that are rude, vnciuill, vnreuerent, vncleanly, and
vntaught, and those other againe that are milde, modest,
mercifull, kinde, curteous, and that are euery way indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with wit, reason, and vnderstanding. And I do make
the like exceptions betweene those that are irreligious,
superstitious, Idolatrous, seditious, rebellious; that doe
retaine Iesuites, Seminaries, and other Traiterous priests,
then of those, that contrariwise are professors of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
that do embrace the holy Scriptures, and do inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
themselues in the seruice of their God, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to their Prince.</p>
   <p>Now, for these men of little wit, and lesse vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that because by the Text of the holy scriptures, I
haue hunted their Pope from Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, to the
seat of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> would therefore conclude, that I were
an enemy to Ireland; let them vnderstand, that I loue
Ireland, and that I thinke there is as neere a high way to
go to Heauen from out of Ireland, as there is from any
<pb facs="6"/>
part of England, or else my selfe would neuer haue stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so long in the Countrey. Now, for the people, they
are in Ireland, as in all other places, some good, some
bad, yet more rude &amp; vnciuil in Ireland, then they be in
any part of the worlde that is known: but for Poperie (I
protest) they are more foolish-superstitious in Irelande,
then they be in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe. But I do therefore, rather
pitty, then malice them; there be a great many of known
Papists in <hi>Dublyne,</hi> that I doe loue, and wish well vnto:
for, may not a man loue a papist, as hee loueth a friend
that is diseased? Admit I had a Brother that were visited
with <hi>Morbus Galicus</hi> it selfe, might I not loue him, and
hate his sicknesse both at once? Euen so I loue a papist,
I loue the party, when I defie his Religion. But Popery
is a malady not easie to be cured, and I thinke these lines
of mine will sooner moue Choller, then giue content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or produce amendment. And yet as I meane not
in this my <hi>Description of Ireland,</hi> to busie my selfe about
any matters of State, so I will not meddle with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery
of any hidden secrets, that may bee brought into
any question of doubt, for the truth and certainty: for, as
I haue vsed no other helpe then mine owne experience,
so my best method shall be, to speake nothing but what
is true, and so to be approoued. If there be any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
taken by Fooles that be ignorant, I hope the wise &amp;
learned will make no worse construction then the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth import: for the rest that bee of a wrangling dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
let them do as they haue done, fret and fume at
that which they are not able to contradict: let them ioyn
impudencie to their ignorance, and because they cannot
comprehend the sincerity of true religion, let them carpe
and cauill against it, and let them neuer spare.</p>
