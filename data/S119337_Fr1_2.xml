                 <title>A testimonie of the true Church of God : confirmed as well by the doctrine as liues of sundry holy men, both patriarkes, and prophetes, and also by the Apostles and their true successours. Wherein is manifestly shewed how that God hath in all ages raysed vp some, yea euen in most horrible darkenesse, which haue beene faithfull stewards, and true dispencers of his will, with a catalogue of their names.

      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F that Philosophie, which is but an obscure and vnperfect knowledge of things naturall and morall, hath beene so highly esteemed amongest the Paganes, not onely with those nations which were holden for ciuil and best gouerned, but also with those of the barbarous sorte, like as witnesseth Diogenes Laertius writing of the liues and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Philosophers: that the Persians had their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi, the Babylonians &amp; Assyrians their Chaldaei, the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans their Gymnosophistae, the Gaules their Druidae, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che were also called <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, &amp;c. whome these nations honoured and held for their knowledge in great price, why shoulde not we much rather, who liue not onely vnder a verie temperate Climate, and are a nation, not onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted amongest those which are called ciuill, but whereas Philosophie (I meane not that of thinges natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or morall, such as was vsed and esteemed among the heathen) but whereas the Christian and verie true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie is professed all abroade, and of some (I doubt not) imbraced, reuerently esteeme the memorie of such as bee or haue beene wise philosophers and profounde expositours and instructers of the true deuine, and right spirituall and heauenly knowledge? which doctrine we ought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all earnest diligence to seke, and with most ioyfull heartes to imbrace, chiefely for the excellencie there of, which is exceeding all humane science as far as the heauen is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the earth: and also in respecte of our owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, because it maketh vs partakers of the verie diuine and spirituall knowledge of Gods omnipotent goodnesse, shewing vs the way to eternall felicitie, for which doctrine &amp; spiritual philosophie, &amp; our profit receiued thereby, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ought to attribute the whole and chiefest glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="3"/>and thankes vnto God alone, the onely author thereof, yet it will be profitable to register imperpetuall memorie the names of some godly setters foorth of the saide trueth, whose memoriall may serue to incite others to follow the like zeale &amp; godly vertues, not that they shuld be estemed Gods, &amp; to haue won heauen with their merites, after the iudgement of heathen infidels, nor yet to be prayed vnto, for as (Caluin truely reporteth) God alone will haue the seignieure, and will be exalted in his people, as indeed of right he is most worthie, in asmuch as he is the Lorde of all, and our onely benefactor and patrone. In considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof I haue demed it not amisse (right worthie and worshipfull) to be cause of publishing this present discourse, partly to the end that such as haue not either monie at wil to buy it, or not sufficient laysure to reade ouer M. Foxe his booke of Martyres, &amp; would willingly seek for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie of the same faith and religion that true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans nowe holde and imbrace, may haue for a small price wherein to find the same somewhat effectually, and partly for that men may see howe that in other realmes, whereas great persecution and tyrannies haue beene begonne and cruelly executed, and especially in the countries of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne &amp; France, yet vnto this day many do resist against (as their forefathers haue some in all ages done) &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the rage of Antichrist and his hirelings, &amp; that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the vprors caused in France of late yeares with the great effusion of bloud moued by Sathan against the flocke of Christ, besids the innumerable multitude of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther valiant souldiars and professours of Christes trueth, some haue (maugre the heard of Gods enemies) published the worthie gestes of Gods true seruants through al ages, to the encouraging of their godly successours, &amp; to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrie &amp; condemnation of the wicked: as may appeare by Iohn Crespin &amp; others mētroned in this present discours. Which discourse I haue thought good to offer vnto your worship, as to a true patron of godlines &amp; vertue, beseching you to accept herein of my simple good will.</p>
