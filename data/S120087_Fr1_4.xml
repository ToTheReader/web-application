   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>IVE me leaue (good Reader) to informe thee, by way of Preface,
of three points The first concernes <hi>D. Potters Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were to Charity
Mistaken.</hi> The second relates to this <hi>Reply</hi> of mine. And the
third containes some <hi>Premonitions,</hi> or <hi>Prescriptions</hi> in
case <hi>D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or any in his behalfe thinke fit to reioyne.</p>
   <p n="2">2. For the first point concerning <hi>D. Potters
Answere,</hi> I say in generall,<note place="margin">A generall
considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of D. Potters Answere.</note> reseruing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to
their prroper places, that in his whole Booke he hath not so much as once
truly and really fallen vpon the point in question, which was, Whether both
Catholiques and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants can be saued in their seuerall
professions. And therefore <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> iudiciously
pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <pb n="2" facs="6"/>those particulars, wherein the difficultie
doth precisely consist, proues in generall, that there is but one true
Church; that all Christiās are obliged to hearken to her; that she must
be euer visible, and infallible; that to separate ones selfe from her
Communion is Schisme, and to dissent from her doctrine is Heresie,
though it be in points neuer so few, or neuer so small in their own
nature; and therefore that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of points fundamentall, and not
fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall is wholy vaine, as it is applied by Protestants. These (I
say) and some other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall grounds <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> handles,
and out of them doth cleerely euince, that any least difference in faith
cannot stand with saluation on both sides: and therefore since it is
apparent, that Catholiques and Protestants disagree in very many points of
Faith, they both cannot hope to be saued without repentance: and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, as we hold, that Protestancy vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented <hi>destroies
Saluation;</hi> so must they also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that we cānot be saued, if
they iudge their own Religion to be true, and ours to be false. And
whosoeuer disguizeth this truth, is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to soules, which he
deceiues with vngroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded false hopes of saluation, indifferent Faiths, and
Religions. And this, <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed exactly, according to
that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to haue been his designe, which was not to descend to
particuler disputes, as <hi>D. Potter</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly does, namely, Whether
or no the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mā <pb n="2" facs="6"/>Church be the only true Church of Christ;
and much lesse whether Generall Councels be infallible; whether the Pope
may erre in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees common to the whole Church; whether he be aboue a
Generall Councell; whether all points of fayth be contained in Scripture;
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fayth be resolued into the authority of the Church, as into his
last <hi>formall Obiect,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue;</hi> and least of all did he
discourse of Images, Communion vnder both kinds, publique Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in an
vnknowne Tongue, Seauen Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Sacrifice of the Masse, Indulgences,
and Index Expurgatorius: all which and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther articles <hi>D.
Potter</hi> (as I said) drawes by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence into his Booke. &amp; he might as
well haue brought in Pope <hi>loane,</hi> or Antichrist, or the Iewes who are
permitted to liue in Rome, which are common Themes for men that want better
matter, as <hi>D. Potter</hi> was forced to fetch in the aforsayd
Controuersies, that so he might dazle the eyes, &amp; distract the mynd
of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and hinder him from perceiuing that in his whole Answere he
vttered nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, &amp; point in question: which if he had
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed closely, I dare well say, he might haue dispatched his whole
Booke in two or three sheetes of paper. But the truth is, he was loath to
affirme plainely, that generally both Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and Protestants may be
saued: and yet seeing it to be most euident that Protestants cannot
pretend to haue any true Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="4" facs="7"/>
      <hi>Luther</hi> except the Roman, and such as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with her, and
consequently that they cannot hope for saluation, if they deny it to vs; he
thought best to auoid this difficulty by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of language, &amp; to
fill vp his Booke with points which make nothing to the purpose. Wherein he
is lesse excusable, because he must graunt, that those very
particulers to which he digresseth, are not fundamentall errors, though it
should be granted that they be errors, which indeed are Catholique verities.
For since they be not fundamentall, nor destructiue of saluation, what
imports it whether we hold them or no, for as much as concernes our
possibility to be saued?</p>
   <p n="3">3. In one thing only he will perhaps seeme to haue touched
the point in question, to wit, in his distinction of points fundamentall,
and not fundamentall: because some may thinke, that a difference in points
which are not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall breakes not the Vnity of Faith, and hinders not the
hope of saluation in persons so disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And yet in this very
distinction, he neuer speakes to the purpose indeed, but only sayes,
that there are some points so fundamentall, as that all are obliged to know
and <hi>belieue</hi> them explicitely, but neuer tells vs, whether there be any
other points of faith, which a man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or <hi>disbelieue,</hi> though
they be sufficiently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to his vnderstanding, as truths reuealed,
or testified by almighty God; w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> was the only <pb n="5" facs="7"/>thing in
questiō. For if it be dānable, as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is, to deny, or disbelieue
any one truth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed by almighty God, thogh the thing be not in it
self of any great consequence, or moment; &amp; since of two
disagreeing in matters of faith, one must necessarily deny some
such truth; it cleerly followes that amongst men of different Faiths, or
Religions, one onely can be saued, though their difference consist of
diuers, or but euen one point, which is not in his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fundamentall,
as I declare at large in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of my <hi>first Part.</hi> So that it
is cleere, <hi>D. Potter</hi> euen in this his last refuge and
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, neuer comes to the point in question: to say nothing that
he himselfe doth quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, and plainly contradict his whole
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, as I shew in the third Chapter of my <hi>first Part.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="4">4. And as for <hi>D. Potters</hi> manner of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
those very points, which are vtterly beside the purpose, it consists,
only in bringing vulgar meane obiections, which haue been answered a
thousand tymes, yea, and some of them are cleerely answered euen in
<hi>Charity Mistaken;</hi> but he takes no knowledge at all of any such
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, and much lesse doth he apply himselfe to confute them. He
alledgeth also Authors with so great corruption and fraude, as I would not
haue belieued, if I had not found it by cleere, and frequent experience. In his
second <hi>Edition,</hi> he hath indeed left out one or two grosse
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, <pb n="6" facs="8"/>amongst many others no lesse noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
hauing as it seemes been warned by some friends, that they could not
stand with his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: but euen in this his second <hi>Edition</hi> he
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts them not at all, nor declares that he was mistaken in the
<hi>First,</hi> and so his Reader of the first <hi>Edition</hi> shall
euer be deceiued by him, thogh withall he reade the <hi>Second.</hi> For
preuenting of which inconuenience, I haue thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to take
notice of them, and to discouer them in my <hi>Reply.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="5">5. And for conclusion of this point I will only say,
that <hi>D. Potter</hi> might well haue spared his paines if he had
ingenuously acknowledged, where the whole substance, yea and sometime
the very words &amp; phrases of his booke may be found in farre briefer
manner, namely, in a <hi>Sermon</hi> of <hi>D. Vshers</hi> preached before our
late so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Lord <hi>King Iames</hi> the 20. of Iune. 1624. at
<hi>Wansted,</hi> containing <hi>A Declaration of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersality of the
Church of Christ, and the Vnity of Fayth, professed therein,</hi> which
Sermon hauing been roundly and wittily confuted by a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Diuine, vnder
the name of <hi>Paulus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridicus,</hi> within the compasse of about 4.
sheetes of Paper, <hi>D. Potters Answere to Charity Mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> was in
effect confuted before it appeared. And this may suffice for a generall
Censure of his Answere to <hi>Charity Mistaken.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="6">6. For the second, touching my <hi>Reply:</hi> if you
wonder at the Bulke thereof, compared <pb n="7" facs="8"/>eyther with <hi>Charity
Mistaken,</hi> or <hi>D. Potters An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
my Reply.</note> I desire you to consider well of what now I am about to
say, and then I hope you will see, that I was cast vpon a meere
necessity of not being so short, as otherwise might peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be
desired. <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> is short I grant, and yet very full, and
large for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned his designe, which you see was not to
treate of particuler Controuersies in Religion, no not so much as to
debate, whether or no the Roman Church be the onely true Church of Christ,
which indeed would haue required a larger Volume, as I haue vnderstood there
was one then coming forth, if it had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented by the Treatise of
<hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> which seemed to make the other intēded worke a
little lesse seasonable at that tyme. But <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Mistaken</hi>

      </gap>nely
without repentance can be saued; which ayme exacted no great bulke. And as
for <hi>D. Potters Answere,</hi> euen that also is not so short as it
may seeme. For if his marginall notes prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a small letter were
transfered into the Text, the Booke would appeare to be of some bulke: though
indeed it might haue been very short, if he had kept himself to the point
treated by <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> as shall be declared anon. But
contrarily, because the question debated <pb n="8" facs="9"/>betwixt
<hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> &amp; <hi>D. Potter,</hi> is a point of the highest
consequence that can be imagined, &amp; in regard that there is not a more
pernicious Heresy, or rather indeed ground of Atheisme, then a
persuasion that men of different Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be saued, if otherwise
forsooth they lead a kind of ciuill and morall life: I concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that my
chiefe endeauour was not to be employed in answering <hi>D. Potter,</hi> but
that it was necessary to handle the Question it selfe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what at
large, and not only to proue in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that both Protestants and
Catholikes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be saued; but to shew also, that Saluation cannot be
hoped for out of the Catholique Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church; and yet withall, not to omit to
answere all the particules of <hi>D Potters</hi> Booke which may any way
import. To this end I thought it fit, to deuide my <hi>Reply</hi> into <hi>two
Parts:</hi> in the former whereof, the maine question is handled by a
continued discourse without ste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping aside to confute the particulers of <hi>D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Answere,</hi> though yet so, as that euen in this first <hi>Part,</hi> I
omit not to answere such passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his, as I find directly in my
way, and naturally belong to the points wherof I treat: &amp; in the second
<hi>Part</hi> I answere <hi>D. Potters</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, <hi>Section</hi> by
<hi>Section,</hi> as they lie in order I heer therefore intreate the Reader,
that if hartily he desire satisfaction in this so important que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
he do not content himselfe with that which I say to <hi>Doctour Potter</hi>
in my second <pb n="9" facs="9"/>
      <hi>Part,</hi> but that he take the
<hi>First</hi> before him, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all, or at least so much as may serue
most to his purpose of being satisfied in those doubts which presse
him most. For which purpose I haue caused a Table of the Chapters of the
first <hi>Part,</hi> together with their Titles &amp; Arguments, to be
prefixed before my Reply.</p>
   <p n="7">7. This was then a chiefe reason why I could not be very
short. But yet there wanted not also diuers other causes of the same
effect. For there are so seuerall kinds of Protestants, through the
difference of Tenets which they hold, as that if a man conuince but one kind of
them, the rest will conceiue themselues to be as truly vnsatisfyed and
euen vnspoken to, as if nothing had been said therein at all. As for
example, some hold a necessity of a perpetuall visible Church, and
some hold no such necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Some of them hold it necessary to be
able to proue it distinct from ours; &amp; others, that their businesse
is dispatched when they haue proued ours to haue beene alwayes visible: for
then they will conceiue that theirs hath been so: and the like may be truly
said of very many other particulers. Besides, it is <hi>D. Potters</hi>
fashion, (wherein as he is very far from being the first, so I pray God
he proue the last of that humour) to touch in a word many triuiall old
obiectiōs, which if they be not all answered, it will, and must serue
the turne, to make the more ignorant sort of men belieue, and brag, as if
some maine <pb n="10" facs="10"/>vnanswerable matter had been subtily &amp;
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely omitted; and euery body knowes that some obiection may be very
plausibly made in few words the cleere and solid answere where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will
require more leaues of paper then one. And in particuler <hi>D. Potter</hi>
doth couch his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Authors within the compasse of so few
lines, and with so great confuseones and fraude, that it requires much
time, paines, and paper to open them so distinctly, as that they may
appeare to euery mans eye. It was also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to shew, what <hi>D.
Potter</hi> omits in <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> and the importance of what is
omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and sometimes to set downe the very words themselues that are
omitted, all which could not but add to the quantity of my <hi>Reply.</hi> And
as for the <hi>quality</hi> thereof, I desire thee (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to belieue,
that whereas nothing is more necessary thē Bookes for answering of
Bookes: yet I was so ill furnished in this kind, that I was forced to omit
the examination of diuers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors cited by <hi>D. Potter,</hi> meerely vpon
necessity; though I did very well perceaue by most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
circumstances, that I must probably haue been sure inough to find them
plainely misal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, and much wronged: and for the few which are examined,
there hath not wanted some difficulties to do it. For the times are not for
all men alike; and <hi>D. Potter</hi> hath much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage therein. But Truth
is Truth, and will euer be able to iustify it selfe in the midst of all 
<pb n="11" facs="10"/>difficulties which may occurre. As for me, when I alledge
Protestant Writers as well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall, as forraine, I willingly and
thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge my selfe obliged for diuers of them to the Author of
the Booke entituled, <hi>The Protestants Apology for the Roman Church,</hi> who
calls himselfe <hi>Iohn Brereley,</hi> whose care, exactnes, and fidelity
is so extraordinary great, as that he doth not only cite the Bookes, but the
Editions also, with the place and time of their printing, yea and often the
very page, and line where the words are to be had. And if you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen not to
find what he cites, yet suspend your iudgment, till you haue read the
corrections placed at the end of his booke; though it be also true, that
after all diligence and faithfulnes on his behalfe, it was not in his power to
amend all the faults of the print: in which prints we haue difficulty inough
for many euident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which must needs occur to any prudent man.</p>
   <p n="8">8. And for asmuch as concernes the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my
<hi>Reply,</hi> I haue procured to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all bitternes, or gall of
inuectiue words, both for as much as may import either Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in
generall, or <hi>D. Potters</hi> person in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer; vnles, for example,
he will call it bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for me to terme a grosse impertinency, a
<hi>sleight,</hi> or a <hi>corruption,</hi> by those very names, without
which I do not know how to expresse the things: and yet wherein I can truly
affirme <pb n="12" facs="11"/>that I haue studied how to deliuer them in the
most moderate way, to the end I might giue as little offence as possibly
I could, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the Cause. And if any vnfit phrase may
peraduenture haue escaped my pen (as I hope none hath) it was beside, and
against my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though I must needs professe, that <hi>D.
Potter</hi> giues so many and so iust occasions of being round with
him, as that perhaps some will iudge me to haue been rather remisse, then
moderate. But since in the very Title of my <hi>Reply</hi> I professe to
<hi>maintaine Charity,</hi> I conceiue that the excesse will be more
excusable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all kinds of men, if it fall to be in mildnes, then if
it had appeared in too much zeale. And if <hi>D. Potter</hi> haue a mind to
charge me with ignorance or any thing of that nature, I can, and will ease
him of that labour, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging in my selfe as many &amp; more
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall defects, then he can heape vpon me. Truth only and sincerity I
so much valew and professe, as that he shall neuer be able to proue the
contrary in any one least passage or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle against me.</p>

which may tend to his owne reputation, the sauing of my vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
paines, and especially to the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of truth. I wish then that
he would be <pb n="13" facs="11"/>carefull to consider, wherein the point of
eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficulty consists, and not impertinently to shoote at Rouers,
and affectedly mistake one thing for another. As for example, to what
purpose (for as much as cōcernes the question betweene <hi>D. Potter</hi>
and <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi>) doth he so often and seriously labour to
proue, that fayth is not resolued into the Authority of the Church, as into
the formall <hi>Obiect</hi> and <hi>Motiue</hi> thereof? Or that all points of
Fayth are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture? Or that the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make new Articles
of fayth? Or that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it signifies that
particuler Church or diocesse, is not all one with the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
Church? Or that the Pope as a priuate Doctour may erre? With many other such
points as will easily appeare in their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It wil also be
necessary for him not to put certaine Doctrines vpon vs, from which he
knowes we disclaime as much as himselfe.</p>
   <p n="10">10. I must in like manner intreate him not to recite my
reasons &amp; discourses by halfes, but to set thē down faythfully
&amp; entirely, for as much as in very deed concernes the whole substance
of the thing in questiō; because the want som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of one word may
chance to make voyd, or lessen the force of the whole argumēt. And I am
the more solicitous about giuing this particuler caueat, because I find how
ill he hath complied with the promise which he made in his Preface to the
Reader, not to omit <hi>without answere any <pb n="14" facs="12"/>one thing of
moment in all the discourse of Charity Mistaken.</hi> Neither will this
course be a cause that his <hi>Reioynder</hi> grow too large, but it will
be occasion of breuity to him, and free me also from the paines of
setting downe all the words which he omits, and himself of demonstrating
that what he omitted was not materiall. Nay I will assure him, that if he
keep himselfe to the point of euery difficulty, and not weary the Reader, and
ouercharge his margent, with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary quotations of Authors in Greeke
and Latin, and sometime also in Italian and French, togeather with
prouerbs, sentences of Poets, and such grammaticall stuffe, nor affect to
cite a multitude of our Catholique Schoole deuines to no purpose at all; his
Booke will not exceed a competent size, nor will any man in reason be
offended with that length which is regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by necessity. Agayne before
he come to set downe his answere, or propose his Arguments, let him
consider very wel what may be replied, and whether his owne obiections may
not be retorted against himselfe, as the Reader will perceiue to haue
hapned often to his disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in my <hi>Reply</hi> against him But
especially I expect, and Truth it selfe exacts at his hand, that he
speake cleerly and distinctly, and not seeke to walke in darknes, so to
delude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his Reader, now saying, and then deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and alwayes
speaking with such ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as that his greatest care may seeme to
consist <pb n="15" facs="12"/>in a certaine art to find a shift, as his
occasions might chance, eyther now, or heereafter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and as he
might fall out to be vrged by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernty of seuerall arguments. And to the end
it may appeare, that I deale plainely, as I would haue him also do, I
desire that he declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe concerning these points.</p>
   <p n="11">11. First, whether our Sauiour Christ haue not alwayes
had, and be not euer to haue a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble true Church on earth: &amp; whether
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary doctrine be not a damnable Heresy.</p>
   <p n="12">12. Secondly, what visible Church there was before
<hi>Luther,</hi> disagreeing from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and agreeing
with the pretended Church of Protestants.</p>
   <p n="13">13. Thirdly, Since he will be forced to grant that there
cā be assigned no visible true Church of Christ, distinct from the
Church of Rome, and such Churches as agreed with her when <hi>Luther</hi>
first appeared, whether it do not follow, that she hath not erred
fundamentally; because euery such errour destroies the nature and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Church, and so our Sauiour Christ should haue had no visible
Church on earth.</p>
   <p n="14">14. Fourthly, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did not fall
into any fundamentall errour, let him tell vs how it can be <hi>damnable</hi>
to liue in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or to maintaine errours, which are knowne &amp;
confessed, not to be fundamentall, or <hi>damnable.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="15">15. Fiftly, if her Errours were not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, 
<pb n="16" facs="13"/>nor did exclude saluation, how can they be excused from
<hi>Schisme,</hi> who forsooke her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion vpon pretence of errours,
which were not damnable?</p>
   <p n="16">16. Sixtly, if <hi>D. Potter</hi> haue a mind to say,
that her Errours are damnable, or fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, let him do vs so much
charity, as to tell vs in particuler what those fundamentall errours be. But
he must still remember (and my selfe must be excused, for repeating
it) that if he say the Roman Church e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ed fundamentally, he will not be able to shew, that Christ our
Lord had any visible Church on earth, when <hi>Luther</hi> appeared: &amp;
let him tel vs how Protestants had, or can haue any Church which was
vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, and extended herselfe to all ages, if once he grant, that the
Roman Church ceased to be the true Church of Christ; and consequenly how
they can hope for Saluation, if they deny it to vs.</p>
   <p n="17">17. Seauenthly, whether any one Errour maintayned against
any one Truth though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so small in it selfe, yet sufficiently
propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as testified or reuealed by almighty God, do not destroy the
Nature and Vnity of Faith, or at least is not a grieuous offence excluding
Saluation.</p>
   <p n="18">18. Eightly, if this be so, how can <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,
Caluinists, Zuinglians,</hi> and all the rest of disagreeing Protestāts,
hope for saluation, since it is manifest that some of them must needs
erre <pb n="17" facs="13"/>against some such truth as is testified by
almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, either fundamentall, or at least not fundamentall.</p>
   <p n="19">19. Ninthly, we constantly vrge, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to haue a
particuler Catalogue of such points as he calls fundamentall. A catalogue, I
say, in <hi>particuler,</hi> and not only some <hi>generall</hi>
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, or description, wherein Protestants may perhaps agree, though
we see that they differ when they come to assigne what points in
particuler be fundamentall; and yet vpon such a particuler Catalogue much
depends: as for example in particuler, whether or no a mā do not erre in
some point fundamentall or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to saluation; and whether or no
<hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, Caluinists,</hi> and the rest do disagree in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,
which if they do, the same Heauen cannot receiue them all.</p>
   <p n="20">20. Tenthly, and lastly I desire that in ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering
to these points, he would let vs know distinctly, what is the doctrine of
the Prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>stant English
Church concerning them, and what he vtters only as his owne priuate
opinion.</p>
   <p n="21">21. These are the questions which for the present I
find it fit and necessary for me to aske of <hi>D. Potter,</hi> or any
other who will defend his cause, or impugne ours. And it will be in vaine to
speake vainely, and to tell me, that a Foole may aske more questions in an
houre, then a wiseman can answere in a yeare; with such idle Prouerbs as
that. For I aske but such questions <pb n="18" facs="14"/>as for which he
giues occasion in his Booke, and where he declares not himselfe but after
so ambiguous and confused a manner, as that Truth it selfe can scarce
tell how to conuince him so, but that with ignorant and ill-iudging men he
will seeme to haue somewhat left to say for himselfe, though Papists
(as he calls them) and Puritans should presse him contrary wayes at the
same tyme: and these questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne things also of high
importance, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the knowledge of Gods Church, &amp; true Religion,
and consequently Saluation of the soule depends. And now because he
shall not taxe me with being like those men in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell whom our
blessed Lord and Sauiour char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with laying heauy burdens vpon other mens
shoulders, who yet would not touch them with their finger: I oblige my
selfe to answere vpon any demaund of his, both to all these Questions,
if he find that I haue not done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and to any other concerning matter
of faith that he shall aske. And I will tell him very plainly, what is
Catholique doctrine, and what is not, that is, what is defined or what is not
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and rests but in discussion among De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines.</p>
   <p n="22">22. And it will be heere expected, that he performe these
things, as a man who profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth learning should doe, not flying from
que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions which concerne things as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in their owne
nature, to accidentall, or <pb n="19" facs="14"/>rare circumstances of
ignorance, incapacity, want of meanes to be instructed, erroneous
cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and the like, which being very vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and different, cannot be
well comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder any generall Rule. But in deliuering generall
doctrines we must consider things as they be <hi>ex naturarei,</hi> or
<hi>per se loquendo</hi> (as Deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes speake) that is, according to their
natures, if all circumstances concurre proportionable thereunto. As for
example some may for a time haue inuincible ignorance, euen of some
fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall article of fayth, through want of capacity, instruction, or the
like, and so not offend eyther in such ignorance or errour; and yet we
must absolutely say, that errour in any one fundamentall point is
damnable, because so it is, if we consider things in themselues,
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from accidentall circumstances in particuler persons: as
contrarily if some man iudge some act of vertue, or some indifferent
action to be a sinne, in him it is a sinne indeed, by reason of his
erroneous conscience; and yet we ought not to say absolutely, that
vertuous, or indifferent actions are sinnes: and in all sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences we must
distinguish the generall Rules from their particuler Exceptions. And
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when, for example, he answers to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whether he hold that
Catholiques may be saued, or whether their pretended errours be fundamentall
and damnable, he is not to change the state of the question, and haue
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <pb n="20" facs="15"/>to Ignorance, and the like, but to ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were
concerning the errours being considered what they are apt to be in
themselues, and as they are neyther increased nor diminished, by
accidentall circumstances.</p>
   <p n="23">23. And the like I say of all the other points, to which
I once againe desire an answere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of these, or the like
ambiguous termes, <hi>in some sort, in some sease, in some
degree,</hi> which may be explicated afterward as strictly or lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely as may
best serue his turne; but let him tell vs roundly and particulerly, in what
sort, in what sense, in what degree he vnderstands those, &amp; the
like obscure mincing phrases. If he proceed solidly after this manner,
and not by way of meere words, more like a Preacher to a vulgar Auditour, then
like a learned man with a pen in his hand, thy patience shall be the
lesse abused, and truth will also receiue more right. And since we
haue already layed the grounds of the question, much may be sayd heereafter
in few words, if (as I sayd) he keep close to the reall point of euery
difficulty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wandring into impertinent disputes, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying vulgar
and threed-bare obiections and arguments, or labouring to proue what no mā
denies, or making a vaine ostentation by citing a number of Schoolemen, which
euery Puny brought vp in Schooles is able to doe; and if he cite his Authours
with such sincerity, as no time need be spent in opening his
corruptions▪ <pb n="21" facs="15"/>and finally if he set himselfe a
worke with this consideration, that we are to giue a most strict accompt
to a most iust, and vnpartiall Iudge, of euery period, line, and word that
passeth vnder our pen. For if at the later day we shall be arraigned for
euery idle word which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, so much more will that be done for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
idle word which is written, as the delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherwith it passeth makes
a man guilty of more malice, and as the importance of the matter which is
treated of in bookes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning true fayth and religion, without which no
Soule can be saued, makes a mans Errours more materiall, then they would be,
if question were but of toyes.</p>
