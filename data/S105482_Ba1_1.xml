   <p>LOncernyng lendyng, here maye any man easelye see, who, what, to whō and to what ende Chryste hath taughte and commaūded to lend. First he that hath receyued any ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lent at the Lordes hands, he him selfe must put it forth. Math .25. Luke .19. For if he doe not occupy it, then shal it be taken from hym and he be cōdemned for not vsing of it. Also he that hath, must dys<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose of that, whych he hath, vnto hym that lacketh. Luke
.3. And the ende of doyng good and lendyng vnto hym, that lacketh &amp; nedeth,
<pb facs="39"/>must not be to hope or looke for glory, gayne or any thing thereof vnto hym selfe. Luke .6. So he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hath but onli to find his wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drē &amp; family, or but only a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent stocke for his own trade in his own vocacion: he must, as the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer lendeth his sede vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> good groūde, so w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> diligēce lay forthe &amp; lend, he himselfe hys owne stocke to hys own occupying. And he, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> besydes suche a stocke hath any more he must reserue and kepe y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> residew to be in a readynes to bee geuen in almes, or sent to releue o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> be nedy. And thys beyng done to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ende y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> god may be glori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied, &amp; the nedye releued, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>out a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny lokynge for of glorye or gayne worldly to himself, he shal be sure to fynde thys a verye profitable and godly vsury: but if any man for worldly police, priuate profet <pb facs="40"/>or vayne glory, do pull from the finding of his familie, from the maintenaunce of his own exercise in hys own trade, or from the cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritable relief of the nedy, to lend vnto the riche and welthy, that is vncharitable, vnlawfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. I doe not thynke that by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sellyng, lendynge or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, or any indifferente bargey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge amongest welthy rich men is euill: but as concerning vsurye I aduertise al them, that be wise and wel learned in other matters &amp; yet cannot, or wil not see their owne daunger in this case, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they wolde call too remembraunce the example of coueteous Balam, whiche beinge so wise a Prophet, that he could se many thinges lōg before to come vnto others yet bi loue and lokinge for the rewarde of wickednes, became much more <pb facs="40"/>dulle and blind than a veri Asse, to see in his own wayes hys own daūger. Nu .22. And I also aduer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyse thē, which geue coūfel cōcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng vsury vnto suche others, as wold haue an easy lyuing vpon o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther mens labours, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they make no cushens to lay vnder their elbows Eze .13. And that they be wel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised afore they answere such, as by the idol of couetous gaynes in their hartes do prouoke y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lord, to make thē answere so agreable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the filthi meaning of their own myndes, as is appertaynyng vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vtter perdicion of both the asker &amp; the answerer. Ez 14. And finally I aduertise euery pryuate persō, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thei learne of Achā y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sōne of Carmy not by vngodli gaines to polute y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whole finding of their familie, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hole stoke of their trade any y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hole abūdāce of gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidēce in their handes, yea I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise <pb facs="41"/>euery Christē congregaciō as they desyer to stād in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessiō of Christē religiō agaynste their enemyes afore god, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thei re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>member the word of god, my
