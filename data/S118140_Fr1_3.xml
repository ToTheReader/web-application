   <head>THE PREFACE OF THE AVTHOR VNTO THE CRHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIAN READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous, and ingenuous Reader; Since no man can enter well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the roomes of any <hi>Treatise,</hi> but by the doore of a <hi>Preface,</hi> therefore I commend these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Obseruations vnto thee, to prepare thee, the better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, vnto the reading of this Discourse.</p>
   <p>First; though sundry Expositions are extant vpon this part of Scripture (as likewise vpon the whole Booke of the sacred <hi>Reuelation</hi>) and certain Sermons haue beene preached vpon it, and then commended vnto the Presse, yet I confesse, that (opening my heart vnto God by prayer, to illustrate my vnderstanding with a true, and sufficient knowledge thereof) I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed chiefly such generall notions touching the same, as were layd vp formerly in my mind; and willingly sequestred from mee the helpe of other mens labours in this kind (excepting such as I shall presently name) <hi>least I should build vpon another mans
<pb facs="6"/>
foundation,</hi> and so drowne the discourse of my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in the conceits of other learned men, with whom I had a resolution not to consult, before I had finished the impression of this Treatise. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake not my meaning, and purpose, good Reader; for I doe not intend hereby to arrogate any thing vnto my selfe aboue other men (since I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of mine owne infirmities) but to preuent their exceptions, who may suppose, or pretend, that I haue framed a collection, onely, in this Treatise, out of the Sermons, or Bookes of other men.</p>
   <p>Secondly; whatsoeuer I may seeme to owe vnto any Author of our side, I confesse it to bee due, principally, vnto the learned, and indicious Pen of our gracious Souereigne Lord, King <hi>IAMES,</hi> in his <hi>Paraphrase</hi> vpon this Booke, as thou wilt easily obserue (gentle Reader) in certaine passages of my Discourse. As for Authors on the Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries part, I had no small aduantage, and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of the writings of two learned Iesuites, <hi>Ribera,</hi> and <hi>Viegas,</hi> of whom therefore I make frequent mention, as seruing, in many things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly for my purpose.</p>
   <p>Thirdly; if any acerbitie of stile appeare in this Discourse, know that it is drawne from me, rather by the necessitie of the matter it selfe (which could not be well expressed otherwise) then that it came out of the disposition of my mind; which, hating the errours of <hi>Babylon,</hi> doth yet pittie, and loue the persons of all (and specially of some) that are insnared with the same; wishing, and desiring, their saluation from my heart, in Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>Fourthly; I enter vpon this disputation, not out of contention, but out of conscience, with a secure, and certaine perswasion of truth, and soliditie therein; whereof because I make some larger mention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, I will say the lesse in this place.</p>
   <p>Fifthly; though this Booke, in all the pages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, beareth the title of a <hi>first,</hi> and of a <hi>second Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> yet vnderstand, that, after I had preached two Sermons, at <hi>Maidstone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> to this purpose, and had recollected my meditations, I framed them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward more copiously into the body of a <hi>Treatise,</hi> which therefore I present vnto thee, rather vnder this name; as exceeding the proportion, and, in some things, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering (perhaps) from the qualitie of <hi>Sermons.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Sixthly, and lastly; if it shall please any of the <hi>Romane</hi> side, to stand against me, in the defence of his Mother-Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to make answere vnto my Discourse (vnto which businesse, as I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no man, so I feare not the performance of any man in this kind) he must follow me in his answere, as I haue gone before him in this <hi>Treatise;</hi> not flying vp, and downe without order, nor concealing my proofes, and reasons; but, from point to point, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a cleere, and a substantiall refutation thereof. As for bitter words, and calumnious writing, though I can steepe my Pen in Vineger, and Worme-wood, as well as they, yet I resolue not to follow any aduersarie in this course: but, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith in his disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against <hi>Hermogenes, Viderit Persona; cum Doctrina mihi quaestio est;</hi> so I will leaue the person, and come vnto the matter it selfe.</p>
