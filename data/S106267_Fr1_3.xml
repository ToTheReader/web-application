      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y kind gentle <hi>Reader,</hi> wee say in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises terprises and preuailings of <hi>Armes,</hi> such a Captaine did such a seruice, where not the commander, hut the Souldiers did the atchieue. I now in this booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre <hi>Adams</hi> returne, by a contrarie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert; where not <hi>Adams</hi> progenie but <hi>Adam</hi> alone made the breach, by open offence; yet the penaltie sorteth vpon all his attainted posteritie by propagation and line of blood: and as his guilt is theirs, so his returne descendeth vnto them, as the souldiers bee sharers in the Captaines preuail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. This exercise therefore I call <hi>Adams Garden,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it proceedeth from the restored Armie of his peculiar quarter, by the happie <hi>second Adam,</hi> euen by his renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affordings, who is the <hi>Creator, Restorer,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairer of the whole attaindor.</hi> It is not needlesse, but (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las) verie needfull, that men should dwell in deepe cogitation thereof, and still exercise their thoughts in the wonderfull dispersed storme of such a penaltie, to the end the Crowne of so bountifull receiued enlargement, might more sensiblie settle in their hard and vnprepared faculties. Oh that same Censure of a Father, touching fruition of our perishing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: Oh, I say, that it might bee as trulie verified vpon our often meditation of <hi>Adams</hi> happie returne, by dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the gardens of our open acknowledgements for the Lords exceeding patience, to pardon, call, and enforce our
<pb facs="4"/>fathers happie repaire! His words be these: <hi>Facilè enim cor humanum, omnibus quae frequentat, adhaeret ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>, vt vix aut nunquam sine amore valcant possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deri.</hi> So I wish that our frequent dwelling in thankefull care and obedience might once beget the setled zeale and stable wrestling strife of loue and admiration in vs, for so high shrined a state and prerogatiue, by restoring and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning. But wofull, and strong, and resisting, is that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued nature, and combat from our first stirpe, for vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things; and too too sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2+ letters">
         <desc>••…</desc>
      </gap> to subscribe the sighings of the spirite and gronings of grace in vs, to enioy the birth of a more holie renewment. Our desires bee called the birth of the soule, and the creations of God, which shall not perish. But how should wee assure our selues heereof? being still dull, dead, and so slow, to striue for our crowne: wee haue all the encouragement that a gracelesse froward creature can require: wee haue God to prepare our hearts and heare vs: <hi>Psal. 10. ver. 17.</hi> wee haue Iesus Christ to receiue and embrace vs: <hi>Matt. 11. ver. 28.</hi> wee haue the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter to lead vs aright: <hi>Ioh. 14.</hi> to aske and present our desines, from his owne vnspeakable sighings and gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; because wee know not what to aske as wee ought: Whereupon another Father calleth our praiers, <hi>Arma cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>s bee not ours, but the vehement desires of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. As for vs; <hi>Quod postulamus, idem ipse donat, qui dat vt postulemus.</hi> Alacke, that wee haue no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to hold fast and enioy the Lords gentlenesse and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie with vs. What are we, if he please to depart from vs, and leaue vs to an accusing conscience? nay, what is the greatest Menarch in the world? Oh heauy state well known
<pb facs="5"/>vnto manie! and in mercie something vnto the author heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. If the Lord doe set vp but one of our sinnes to pursue vs, nay but one of our cogitations to accuse vs, and depart from vs; wee shall find such a flame of burning, vnrest, &amp; torment in our thoughts, as to beseech him returne againe and helpe vs, and take from vs all those worldlie priorities and shrined vanities of our abundance,, which haue seduced and snared our faculties, in verie eminent and high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of consuming torments: But men bee secure, and by fulnesse and immunities, their disease is growne so remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, as hardlie to beleeue there can bee any such miserie in mortalitie. But I choose rather to lament their estate, then conuince their presumptuous opinions; and therefore will cut off, and leaue all redresse vnto him that is both able and willing, to worke for his owne; and will call in his time those that bee appointed, by what motion, change, or crosse soeuer may please him best. To this gentle mercifull Lord, I doe recommend thee patient <hi>Reader,</hi> and this my poore labour, as a seruice to superionrs; my loue to equals and familiars; and a compassionate well wishing vnto all that loue the comming of the Lamb, euen the Lord Iesus.</p>
