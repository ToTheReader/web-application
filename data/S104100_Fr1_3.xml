   <head>THE AVTHOVRS
Prayer, before his
Lecture.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hy Word (O Lord) is holy and pure,
as is thine owne Majesty, and being
sincerely preached, worketh either to
the salvation or condemnation of the
hearers. And we all that are heere assembled before
thee at this time, are of uncircumcised hearts and
eares: utterly unworthy by reason of that sinne,
wherein we were conceived and borne; and of those
actuall transgressions that wee have multiplyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thy Majesty, in thought, word and deed, from
our first being, untill this present houre; once to set
foot into thy Temple or to heare thy Word at all▪ Vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unfit and unable by reason of our custome in
sinne, and the hardnesse of our hearts to profit by it,
when as we heare it. So that (Lord) we are at this
time in danger, to be unprofitable hearers of thy holy
<pb facs="6"/>
Word, and by being unprofitable bearers of the same,
we are in danger of thy heavy displeasure. Yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as it hath pleased thee in mercy to command
us this exercise, to appoint it to be the onely ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
meanes, whereby thou wilt worke Faith and
repentance in thy children, and the principall meanes
whereby thou wilt increase them, to promise also
graciously that thou wilt accompany the outward
ministery of thy Word, with the inward grace and
blessing of thy Spirit, in the hearts of them that shall
be reverently and faithfully exercised in the same:
We therefore in humble obedience, to this thy holy
commandement, and in full affiance and confidence
in this thy gracious promise, are bold to present
our selves before thee at this time: Beseeching thee
in thy sonnes blood to wash away all our si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>es, so as
they may never bee laid to our charge againe, either
in the world to come to our condemnation, or at this
time to bring a curse upon this our exercise. Good
Lord so sprinckle that blood of thy Sonne upon our
consciences, that we may be assured of thy love and
favour towards us in him. By it sanctify us at this
time, and thy word to our uses, opening and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our understanding so as we may be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
and conceave of thy word aright, strenghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
our memories so as we may bee able to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="7"/>
it, softning our hard and stony hearts, so as wee
may be able to beleeve it, to yeeld unto it, to apply it
to our owne soules, to meditate and conferre there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
to practise it in our lives, and conversations,
to stirre up one another to the obedience thereof.
That this our exercise may tend to the increase of
our knowledge, and of our obedience, of our Faith,
and of repentance, the glory of thy blessed name, and
the everlasting comfort of our owne soules: Heare
us (O Lord) in these our requests, in what else
soever thou knowest good for us, or any of thy
Church: for Iesus Christ his sake our Lord and only
Saviour. In whose name wee continue our prayers
unto thee, as he himselfe hath taught us, Saying,</p>
   <p>Our Father which art in Heaven, &amp;c.</p>
