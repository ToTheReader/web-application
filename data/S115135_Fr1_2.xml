      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing lately (right Honorable) tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated out of French this most learned and fruitfull Treatise of <hi>Monsieur du Plessis,</hi> touching the Institution and Doctrine of the holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, and how and when, and by what degrees the Masse hath beene brought into the Church in place thereof: J haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to present these my poore paines to your most fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance, and honourable patronage of the same. Thus haue I thought good to do, not so much in any perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall respect of my owne priuate paines, as in regard both of the Authour, and of the matter of this Treatise. For tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Author, who may bee iudged so worthy to take vpon them the protecting of the labours of a Gentleman so learned &amp; honorable, as <hi>Monsieur du Plessis</hi> is, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a Councellor of State to the most Christian King, as they who are likewise learned, honourable, and of Councell to a most religious &amp; Christian Queene? As for the matter of the booke, what is it els, but an ample and singular Apologie
<pb facs="3"/>of that most ancient, and truly Catholike religion, which her Highnes in the begining of her renowned raigne, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of many most reuerend &amp; learned Diuines, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse warrant of the word of God, by the gracious direction of his holy spirit, with the free consent of all the States assē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Parliament, did most Christianly establish, &amp; euer since for the space of fortie two yeares (a goodly, blessed, &amp; golden time, the like whereunto all things well weighed, no nation vnder heauen, euer enioyed) by the most singular prouidence of God, and her princely prudence, &amp; your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors assistance, hath most constantly maintained, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding comfort of all her louing and loyall subiects, and the great astonishment of all her enemies. Embrace therefore (right Honor.) the excellent learning of the Author: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the trauel of the translator, &amp; chiefly vouchsafe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and defence to the cause it selfe, which is the cause of the true Catholike Church, or rather of Christ: from whom in most hartie humility I wish to you all the increase of all true honour here on earth, and euerlasting happines hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the heauens.</p>
