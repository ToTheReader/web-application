The second thing which he did after this choise made, was to preuent them with certaine presupposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cleare and true, which should not be wide from his conclusion: for the speeches and sentences which vnlooked for are deliuered against that which the vulgar beleeueth, at the beginning serue for nought else, (such preuention not being made) than to put in a confusion him that listeneth, and to breed such a loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in mens minds, as it causeth them to loose their

good affection, and to abhorre and detest this doctrin. This manner of proceeding would I, that I might obserue with thee, (curious Reader) if meanes could be vsed, that I might first treate with thee, and discouer betweene thee and me the disposition of thy wit. For if it be such as is requisite for this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and estranged from the ordinarie capacities, I would in secret tell thee such new and speciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites, as thou wouldest neuer haue thought could fall within the compasse of a mans imagination But inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this will not be, and this worke must issue in publicke for all sortes, I could not but set thy braines somewhat a worke: for if thy wit be of the common and vulgar alloy, I know right well thou art alreadie persuaded, that the number of the sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and their perfection, hath been accomplished many daies agoe. And heereto thou art mooued by a vaine reason, that they hauing found out no more what to ad, it is a token, that now there is in nothing, any more nouelties. Now if by hap thou art possessed of such an opinion, go no further, nor read thou anie longer on, for thou wilt be much agreeued, to see how miserable a difference of wit possesseth thee. But if thou be discreet, well compounded, and sufferent, I will
<pb facs="7"/>
deliuer vnto thee 3 conclusions very true, albeit for their noueltie they are worthie of great maruell.</p>
   <p>The first is, that of many differēces of wit, which are in mankind, one only with preheminence can fall to thy lot, if alreadie, nature, as verie mighty, at such time as she framed it for thee, did not bestow all her ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, in vniting two onely, or three, or (in that she could not effect the same) left thee a dolt, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of them all.</p>
   <p>The second, that to euery difference of wit there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth in preheminence, but one only science, and no more of that condition. So as if thou diuine not to chuse that which answereth thy naturall ability, thou shalt be very remisse in the rest, though thou ply them night and day.</p>
   <p>The third, that after thou hast knowen which the science is, that most answereth thy wit, there resteth yet (that thou mayst not be deceiued) another greater difficultie, which is, whether thine abilitie be more appliable to the practick than the theorick, for these <hi>2</hi> parts (be it what science it wil) are so opposit betwixt themselues, &amp; require wits so different, that they may be placed one against the other, as if they were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Hard are these sentēces, but yet they haue greater
<pb facs="8"/>
difficultie and hardnesse, <hi>vz.</hi> that we cannot appeale from them, nor pretend that we haue receiued wrong. For God being the author of nature, and seeing that she gaue not to each man more than one difference of wit, (as I haue sayd before) through the opposition or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie which combreth vs in vniting them, he applied himselfe to her, and of the Sciences which are distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongst men by grace, it is a miracle, if in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent degree, he giue more than one. But there are (sayth S. <hi>Paule)</hi> diuisions of graces, and the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; there are diuisions of ministeries, and the same Lord; there are diuisions of operations, but the same God, who worketh all things in all persons. To euery one is giuen the ministerie of the spirit for profit: and to one is giuen by the spirit the word of wisedome, to another that of knowledge, after the same spirit, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother fayth, in the same spirit, and to another the grace of healing, in the same spirit, to another the working of vertues, to another prophecieng, and the description of spirits, to others the varietie of toungs, to another the interpretation of words: but one selfe spirit, which diuideth to euery one as him pleaseth, worketh all these things.</p>
   <p>This bestowing of sciences (I doubt not) God vseth,
<pb facs="8"/>
hauing regard to the wit and naturall disposition of euery person. For the Talents which he distributed, in S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> the same Euangelist sayth, that he gaue them vnto euery one according to his proper vertue.</p>
   <p>And to thinke that these supernaturall Sciences require not some dispositions in the subiect, before they be infused, is an errour very great: for when God formed <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> it is certaine that before he filled them with wisedome, he instrumentalized their braine in such sort, as they might receiue it with ease, and serue as a commodious instrument, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be able to discourse, and to forme reasons. And therefore the diuine scripture sayth; God gaue them an heart to thinke, and filled them with the discipline of vnderstanding, and that according to the difference of which euery one partaketh, one science is infused, and not another, or more or lesse of each of them, is a thing which may be vnderstood by this example of our first parents, for God filling them both with wisedome, it is a verifyed conclusion, that he infused the lesser portion into her, for which reason the Diuines say, that the diuell tooke hardinesse to beguile her, and durst not tempt the man, as fearing his much
<pb facs="9"/>
wisedome The reason hereof (as hereafter we will proue) is, that the naturall composition which the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had in her braine, is not capable of much wit, nor much wisedome. In the Angelicall substances, we shall find also the like count and reason: for God, to giue an angell more degrees of glorie and higher gifts, first giueth him a more delicat nature; and if you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the Diuines whereto this delicat nature ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, they answer, that the Angell who hath the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest vnderstanding, and the best nature, with most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie conuerteth himselfe vnto God, and vseth his gift with the more efficacie; and that the like beti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in men. Hence we cleerely inferre, that there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an election of wit for sciences supernaturall, and that, not whatsoeuer difference of abilitie, is their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious instrument, humane learning (with more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) requireth the same, because it is to be learned by men, with the force of their wit.</p>
   <p>To be able then to distinguish and discerne these naturall differences of mans wit, and to applie to each by art, that science wherein he may profit, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of this my worke. If I bring the same to end (as I haue purposed) we will yeeld the glorie to God, seeing from his hand proceedeth whatsoeuer is good
<pb facs="9"/>
and certaine: and if not, thou knowest well (discreet Reader) that it is impossible both to deuise an art, and to reduce the same to perfection. For so long and large are humane sciences, that a mans life sufficeth not to find them out, and to giue them that perfection which is requisit.</p>
   <p>The first inuenter performeth very much, if he discouer some notable principles, to the end that such as come after, may with this seed take an occasion to amplifie the art, and to bring it into that estimation and account which is due thereunto. <hi>Aristotle</hi> allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereunto, sayth: that the errors of those who first began to handle matters of Philosophie, are to be held in great reuerence, for it proouing a matter so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, to deuise new things, and so easie to ad vnto that which hath bene alreadie spoken and treated of; the defects of the first deserue not (by this reason) to be much reprooued, neither he who addeth ought, meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth any great commendation. I confesse that this my worke cannot be excused from some errors, seeing the matter is so delicat, and no way fore-opened to entreat thereof. But if the same be in a matter where the vnderstanding hath place to thinke, in this case I pray thee (wittie Reader) that before thou giue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb facs="10"/>
thou read ouer the whole worke, and assure thy selfe what the difference of thine owne wit is, and if in the worke thou find ought which in thine opinion is not well sayd, consider well of the reasons which sway the most against it, and if thou canst not resolue, then turne to read the eleuenth chapter, for in that shalt thou find the answer which they may receiue.</p>
