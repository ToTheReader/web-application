   <p>I Hope thou meanest to be a learner to, else thou wilt not read much of me; for I professe profit to thee, though perhaps thy end bee pleasure. Thou wilt not here find tearmes only to make thee able to talke, but things fit to do; and those told thee that true and reasonable way, that as thou hast a will to proue them, thou wilt both praise and thanke me. The practice and experience of manie yeeres is here giuen thee in a few leaues (not drawen from traditions in print or otherwise taken vp, on trust; but out of certain and approued conclusions) if thou please to vse it: if not, thou art left to thine owne liberty. <hi>I</hi> will offer to instruct no man against his will, nor goe about to deserue well of such as vnderstand me not. Euery booke hath his Fortune to the Capacity of his Reader; and I haue mine in thee. Farewell, I could haue vsed a more mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banque preface. But that which iudges trueth, labours least with shew.</p>
