      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Othing can so much concern a man to seeke for, as life eternall; the onely meanes to finde this eternall life, is the knowledge of God; there is no meanes to know God, (to purpose,) but by his Word; this word, though plaine, and cleare in the maine truthes, yet wants not some difficulties, in other expressions; the explication of these difficulties, is (for a great part) the occasion, and matter of our Sermons, Lectures, Commentaries; every man holding it both an high honour, and an happy service to be Gods trucheman to
<pb facs="6"/> the world; the clearest and shortest way of explication, is by Paraphrase: many learned Interpreters, both of our Church, and the Roman, have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken this taske by parcels, the use and benefit whereof, is, and should no lesse, be universall: My meannesse hath therefore boldly endeavoured this great worke; which, as I durst not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, without the aide of the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters, both ancient and moderne; so I do in all humility subject it to the grave and holy judgement of this renowned Church: it is so farre from my thoughts, peremptorily to prescribe senses unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as that I am ready upon better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, to amend my owne errours: Onely my desire, and ambition is, to give some light to weaker apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; wherein I hope to do a service, not utterly unbeseeming your Majesties gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Patronage; and unspeakably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to many thousands of soules; who shall blesse God for the least glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pses of illumination in these divine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
   <p>The worke, such as it is, I most humbly cast downe, with my selfe, at your Majesties feet; for who but Gods Vice-gerent upon earth could seeme
<pb facs="6"/> proper to challenge the protection of a businesse, so highly importing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the God of heaven; and amongst Kings, (besides the relation of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Master) who but the Defender of that true faith, which is infallibly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon these holy Scriptures: eminent no lesse in goodnesse and piety, then in greatnesse and power; the great patterne of devotion, twice every day (even in publique view) constantly busied in this booke of God: In so many names, I have presumed through your Majesties roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hands, to tender it unto Gods Church; not without the vowes of my most fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers to God for the inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his blessings upon your sacred person, family, government, as who am ever justly obliged to be</p>
