      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>EADER, meruaile not that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Worke puts not to his name:
it may iustly be imputed to the iniquitie
of the times, in which it is hard to vtter
the truth, and not thereby to procure
enemies: notwithstanding, if there be any
that will vndertake the answering of it from point to
point (which I hold impossible, such is the cleere euidence
of truth) the Author promiseth to reioyne vpon the
same subiect, and withall to discouer his name: for hee
hath both courage and countenance enough to maintaine
himselfe, and his cause against the malice of his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and the troublers of the publike peace.</p>
