   <p>THE holy writers haue a perfect consent,<note place="margin">The summe of the Scripture. Iohn. 17.</note> in their doctrine of

grace, in all Countries and Ages. Some speciall the holy Writers
do mention,<note place="margin">The olde vvorlde, &amp; the vvorlde novv.</note> for the olde worlde, and the worlde now. Ten of the fyrst are
Fathers, not onely to our <hi>LORD,</hi> but to all Nations. They were al fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and shoulde mooue their Chyldren to beare in their brestes <hi>VRIM</hi>
and <hi>THVMMIM, Fayth and Loue.</hi> They had <hi>Abel</hi> an ensample of being
faythful vnto death for Christ, to fynde an eternall crowne of life. <hi>Cain</hi> and
his house warned them of their corruption, taken from Parentes, that they
shoulde looke for regeneration.<note place="margin">Iob. 22, 16. 1. Pet. 3, 19.</note> The destruction of the men that delyted

teach the same. Their places are lytle mentioned: but<note n="§" place="margin">Our Fathers ages. The beginning of <hi>Genesis</hi> is fitted to the capacitie of chyldren.</note> our Fathers ages
are wonderfully layde downe by the heauenly Father, teachyng vs as babes
be taught. Thrise they are reckoned: how olde they were when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
their sonne: how long they lyued after: and how much those two
numbers make. This sheweth that the Story is penned for the simple and
chyldren. The sundry comparisons wyll occupy the wysest. The olde Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of the worlde now, are set foorth sufficiently.<note n="‡" place="margin">

a Shame. Their tongues became seauentie of one: their dwellynges were

kept styll a memory of these fyrst poyntes, but full of fables. <hi>Coeum</hi>
and <hi>Iapet,</hi> they beare in mynde, whom they call the sonnes of the earth:
<hi>Sem</hi> they forgate, and all aboue. The Families scattered from <hi>Babel,</hi> left
their names vpon their Countries, which yet abyde in Greke writers.
Their Warres generall agaynst the faythfull, <hi>Moses</hi> prophecyed, vnder
<hi>Assur,</hi> and <hi>Cittim.</hi> The Prophetes and Apostles recorde what fell out.
Cities here, chiefly two for name are to be marked: the low <hi>IERVSALEM,</hi>
(which the faythfull styl helde, or looked to holde, vntyl the LORD came)
and the high <hi>IERVSALEM</hi> buylt by the GOSPEL euery where,
which <hi>Cittim</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> that destroyed the low, shoulde labour alwayes to
besiege, tyll GOD sendes his enemies a finall destruction. The course of
times with the Lord his nation was truely kept of the faythfull and fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.
From the creation to <hi>Abrahams</hi> promise: thence to the comming from
<hi>Egypt,</hi> to the foundation of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, to the Captiuitie &amp; burning
of the Temple, to the returne to buylde it:<note n="‖" place="margin">The genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is in <hi>Math, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

         </gap>.</note> and thence to the death of our
Lord. For euery partition of these tymes, auncient consent of <hi>Hebrevves</hi> and
<hi>Grekes</hi> may be brought. I wyll labour to set foorth all these poyntes brefly,
from the beginning, folowing the order of tyme measured by Stories of our
Lord his kinred. The places of auncient dwellinges shalbe ioyned in one
Map, of the north part, when <hi>Chams</hi> house, <hi>Sems,</hi> and <hi>Iapheths,</hi> all three in
<hi>Daniel</hi> fight with the auncient kingdomes agaynst the blessed of <hi>Sem</hi> and
<pb facs="6"/>
kingdome of <hi>Christ.</hi> That Mappe was to be larger in breadeth then the
quantitie of this Booke.<note place="margin">One Mappe vvas to be made of the oldest names: &amp; an other vvith later names of dvve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

kingdomes that <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh of, who are consumed by the byrth of our
Lord, whereof the <hi>Romanes</hi> are no part. For all the Image, and fourth Beast
was to perish before the incarnation of Christ. <hi>Ievves</hi> do conclude agaynst
vs, against trueth, and their owne saluation vpon that our errour. Doubtles
<hi>Rome</hi> in the ende reuiueth their impietie, folowyng their manners very
neare: wherby many haue thought <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophecy to blame the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
For playnnes and distinction herein, I wyll in a Mappe of an other quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
set downe <hi>Rome,</hi> and some other later names of Countries, with some
ancient, as the story shal require: and compare also by most liuely Pictures
out of Scripture, the <hi>Romans</hi> with <hi>Daniels</hi> Kingdomes. This whole Vew
I call A <hi>CONCENT OF SCRIPTVRE,</hi> because it would shewe
that. Through the booke are other Titles touching time &amp; person, for the
present matter. And wheras I often compare briefly, later writers with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
to shew the Reader how he him selfe may do that more at large: I lay
downe fyrst in this Preface a table of the <hi>Ievves,</hi> shewing how they read
the Prophetes. <hi>Pharisees</hi> they are at this day, who keepe a recorde of this:
and of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of olde,<note place="margin">Math. 23, 2.</note> for this much the Lord gaue a testimonie that
they sate in the Chayre of <hi>Moses. Elias</hi> in <hi>Thishi</hi> in the worde <hi>PETARAH,</hi>
recordeth this occasion, to haue been the beginning of <hi>Petaroth:</hi> that
when <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> forbade to reade <hi>MOSES</hi> law (<note n="*" place="margin">Isaac ben Arama. fol 2 b</note> which was the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into so many<note n="‖" place="margin">Those sections they call <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roth</hi> expositions. Directions for the Reader.</note> Sections, as be Sabbothes in an yeere.) In steade of <hi>Moses</hi>
they chose a part of some Prophet lyke vnto it: which custome of readyng
they kept styll, after their libertie restored to vse <hi>Moses</hi> and his ceremonies
freely. Before you come to that Table, I wyll here geue direction for the
reading of this Booke, touching the two Tables conteynyng the Fathers
ages, and certayne other poyntes. The number vnder the Father sheweth
what his age was when the Sonne set in that lyne was borne. The other
numbers shew his age at the Nephewes byrth ouer agaynst it: or at the
issue of the matter, noted in that lyne. Afterwardes you haue sundry tytles
of their tymes parted: as Promise, Egypt, Temple, Diuision, Captiuitie,
Seauens, whereupon the chiefe knottes stande. Also the tymes are noted
by our Lordes byrth,<note place="margin">Manifest faultes as <hi>Luke</hi> for <hi>Mat. Asa</hi> for <hi>Achaz,</hi> and such, many the Readers gentlens must amende.</note> by the age of the Worlde, and sundry perticuler men,
which the Reader may know in markyng what man famous in Story is
agaynst the fyrst number. Moreouer, touchyng the Columne, vnderstande
that you shalbe often to marke by the matter, that the sayinges depend not
vpon the next aboue them, but vpon those that be on the other Columne
oueragaynst them. A marke you haue to note an vncertaynetie in the
tyme of some Stories, that touch not Chronicle: this is the forme of it. ‡ as in <hi>Hezron:</hi> but there the Corrector was deceyued, who placed his byrth
neare <hi>Iosephes</hi> death, though he was borne before <hi>Iacob</hi> came to <hi>Egypt.</hi>
Other notes touchyng tymes, two of one kynde shewe, eyther that the
Narration is dryuen from the due tyme: and shoulde looke to the marke
of the same forme: or compareth one Kinges reigne with an others, as you
oft shall fynde in <hi>Iudah</hi> &amp; <hi>Israel.</hi> Testimonies I cite short: and in one clause
drawen from sundry, I name but one Author, when about that place I had
named some other, for most of the matter there layde downe. The common
Latine translation, whose soeuer it is, I named it as the Title goeth, <hi>Ierom.</hi>
Abbreuiations chiefly be these. b. for borne, d. for dyeth, y. for yeeres.
Once faulty C. for Ch. Christes. For other names, <hi>Antiochus Epimanes,</hi>
and <hi>Epiphanes, Appian Archelaus, Artaxact, Athenaeus, Carthusianus, Clemens
Alexandrinus</hi> in <hi>Stromatibus, Cedrenus, Dio. for Dionisius, Hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

Iliades Horace, Ierome, Iosephus, Ireneus, Iustin</hi> the historiographer, <hi>Iuuenal,
<pb facs="6"/>
Massecheth,</hi> once faulty for <hi>Halacoth</hi> in <hi>Maymony, Nazianzenus, Pausanias, Plato,
Plutarch, Polybius, Ptolomy</hi> in <hi>Almagesto, Rabbi Abraham, Sadaias, Strabo, Thuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides,
Tully, Valerius maximus, Virgil,</hi> these be the most names, noted by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breuiations:
other wordes shortly named, by the matter may be gessed at,
or be so common, that euery one knoweth them.</p>
   <p>Now I wyll returne to speake of the ancient maner of readyng <hi>Moses</hi>
and the <hi>Prophetes.</hi> S. <hi>Iames</hi> sheweth <hi>Actes</hi> 15, 21. that <hi>Moses</hi> was of olde
tyme reade in the Synagogue in euery Citie euery Sabbath, <hi>Maymony</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of that in Volume I. <hi>Birchath Cohenim</hi> from Cha. 12. that <hi>Moses</hi> ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that custome: and that <hi>Ezra</hi> renued it after the returne: and that in his
tyme,<note place="margin">The <hi>Rabbines</hi> cōmonly make <hi>Ezra</hi> the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the <hi>Petarothes</hi> distinctions: not agreeing vvith <hi>Elias Leuita.</hi>
      </note> (long before <hi>Antioch Epiphanes</hi>) Lectiones of the Prophetes were by
him chosen out, agreeable in number and matter to the Lectiones in <hi>Moses.</hi>
They beganin the Feast of Tabernacles, and in a yeere finished all. After
the readyng of the Law and the Prophetes, they that woulde, hauing leaue
of the ruler of the Synagoge, spake vpon those Scriptures. That we see was
reteyned Act. 13, 15. I haue set downe their Sectiones, and Lectiones, as
they part <hi>Moses,</hi> and haue put forth their <hi>Petaroth</hi> at Venice by <hi>Bombergius</hi>
in one Booke.</p>

sayth and stablisheth: so that no one worde fayleth. Then he prayeth for <hi>ELIAS</hi>

   <p>SEAVENTIE SEAVENS (of yeeres) are cut out, for thy people, &amp; for thy holy
Citie: to consume wickednes, and to abolysh sinnes, and to make reconciliation for
