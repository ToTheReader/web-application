   <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE COVRTEOVS READER, <hi>wisheth all Saving health in Iesus Christ.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>WIse Politicians <hi>(favourable Reader)</hi> in their <hi>Jnstitutions,</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> do hold for an infallible maxime, that to reforme Corruptions and abuses in <hi>States,</hi> better course cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, then often to reduce things to their primitive Originall; Because Lawes at first enacted with good and profitable intention, in the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of few yeeres, by mens instability and inconstancie of minde, or the peculiar interest of Avarice by Injustice, are abrogated and neglected.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>The Venetians beeing a people at this day celebrous, and famous for their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, have a supreame Magistracie, which they call</hi> A Syndicate, <hi>that once in a few yeeres, survey all the</hi> Offices <hi>and</hi> Dignities <hi>in their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the</hi> Duke <hi>himselfe not there excepted, to looke in the abuses, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent their deepe roote and plantation; that so all things may continue and stand entire, according to the rules and precepts of their first Constitutions and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Also a <hi>Garden-plot,</hi> though never so curiously drawne or distinguished into borders, and set with all manner of odoriferous flowers, and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some herbes, yet every showre of raine brings foorth new weedes, the which if they be not carefully, and dayly supplanted, will soone over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow the good plants, and bring the same to a wilde and savage plot of ground. And though the inevitable depravation and corruption of mans nature carry so strong a hand in things transitory and mutable, yet one would thinke they should be more stable and provident in those courses tending to eternall salvation, and soules reprobation, in observing those Lawes and Cōmandments, uttered by GOD himselfe, &amp; commanded to all Posteries for a square Rule, whereby to measure our faith &amp; actions.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding men are more prone to Declination &amp; Corruption, in that from the very beginning, and first institution of the Law <hi>Mosaicall,</hi> till the present times, that for many ages have received the cleere and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Truth, and doctrine Euangelicall; <hi>Heresies</hi> have ever crept in and caried too powerfull a hand, as Verity it selfe, like gold in the bowels
<pb facs="5"/>and entralls of the earth, is encombred with a wonderfull deale of oare &amp; drosse, which is not like to be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>parated till the last sire of tryall, which shall prove every mans worke, and cast out the drosse to be trampled &amp; troden under foote; Wherefore <hi>(Christian Reader)</hi> for the better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and generall good of all Gods Church, I have laboured to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate this curious and admirable Master peece, most worthy and necessary to be observed and read: for thou mayest, as in a <hi>Mirror,</hi> cleerely see and discover the <hi>Birth</hi> and the <hi>Originall</hi> of this foule Monster <hi>Heresie,</hi> in the Church, even from the first ages before the written Law, as also during the force and efficacie of the <hi>Mosaicall Sacrifices,</hi> and now in these later times more pertinent under the Law and precepts of Christs holy Gospel, wherein are deduced the Authors and Founders of the <hi>Romane Masse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And what conformity it holds with the <hi>Ethnicke-Rites</hi> and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> and how farr a digression it hath made from the doctrine, life, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> and the ages of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, wherein the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ever hath abandoned all passion and partiality, and in full proofes, cited none but either approved and authentike Authors, as the ancient Doctors and Writers of the Church, that lived before the present Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of superstitions Traditions.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Bring them to the Text of Gods Word, compare them with the example of the Prophets and Apostles, observe the customes of the Primitive churches, &amp; thus, by reducing thē to their beginnings it will be easie to judge whether they stand still in that unspotted integritie, or have not adulterously prophaned the sincere worship of</hi> GOD, <hi>with many, and meere humane inventions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If thou doest but vouchsafe the diligent and carefull reading hereof, I make no doubt but it will yeeld great comfort to thy Conscience, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation to thy Faith, as that which will cleerely delucidate many hidden passages, that have not hitherto been revealed: and if it may take this happy effect, I shall thinke my paines sufficiently requited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed in all things, ayming at <hi>Gods</hi> glory, and not mine owne. And thus I rest.</p>
