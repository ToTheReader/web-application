      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE reasons that moved mee (good Christian Reader) to preach this short Sermon vpon shorter warning then gladlie I would, haue prevailed with me to set it downe in writing also at more leasure, and to publish it. For both the godly subiects may be stirred vp thereby to greater thankefulnes for the manifolde blessings, that God by her <hi>Maiesties</hi> meanes, and in her safety, hath bestowed vpon vs: and the discontented may be put in minde to content thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with <note n="a" place="margin">Esai. 8, 6.</note>

In the latter, I hope, I shall not altogither. Vnlesse with Religion both wit and reason haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken them: that they care as little for honestly, as for piety; for profit, as for honesty. For what can they looke for at the hands of foreiners, though knit in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so strait confederacie with them, &amp; ioined in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the same faith, or perfidiousnes rather, of the falsly named <hi>Catholike</hi> religiō, more then the <hi>Iews</hi> had of the <hi>Assyrians?</hi> By whom, for all their <note n="b" place="margin">2 King. 16. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
