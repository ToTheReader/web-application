   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Oore people, your manner is to sooth vp your selues, as though ye wer in a most happy state: but of the matter come to a iust trial, it will fall out farr otherwise▪ For yee lead your liues in great ignorance, as may appeare by these your common opinions which follow.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="1">1 That faith is a mans good meaning &amp; his good seruing of God.</p>
   <p n="2">2 That God is serued by the rehearsing of the ten commaundements, the Lords praier, and the Creede.</p>
   <p n="3">3 That yee haue beleeued in Christ euer since you could remember.</p>
   <p n="4">4 That it is pitie that he should liue which dooth any whit doubt of his saluation.</p>
   <p n="5">5 That none can tell whether hee shall bee saued or not certainly: but that all men must be of a good beliefe.</p>
   <p n="6">6 That howsoeuer a man liue, yet if hee call vpon God on his death bedde, and say, <hi>Lord haue mercy on me,</hi> &amp; so goe away like a Lambe, he is certainly saued.</p>
   <p n="7">7 That, if ani<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> be strangely visited, hee is either taken with a Planet, or bewitched.</p>
   <p n="8">8 That a man may lawfully sweare when hee speakes nothing but the truth: &amp; sweares by nothing but that which is good, as by his faith or troth.</p>
   <p n="9">
      <pb facs="5"/>9 That a Preacher is a good man no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he is in the pulpet. <hi>They thinke all like themselues.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="10">10 That a man may repent when hee will, because the Scripture saith, <hi>At what time so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer a sinner doth repent him of his sinne, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="11">11 That it is an easier thing to please God than to please our neighbour.</p>
   <p n="12">12 That yee can keepe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as God will giue you leaue.</p>
   <p n="13">13 That it is the safest, to doo in Religion as most doo.</p>
   <p n="14">14 That merry ballads &amp; bookes, as <hi>Scog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, Beuis of Southampton, &amp;c.</hi> are good to driue away time, &amp; to remoue hart quames.</p>
   <p n="15">15 That yee can serue God with all your hearts: and that yee would be sorie else.</p>
   <p n="16">16 That a man neede not heare so many Sermōs, except he could follow them better.</p>
   <p n="17">17 That a man which cōmeth at no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, may as wel beleeue, as he which heares all the sermons in the world.</p>
   <p n="18">18 That yee know al the Preacher can tell you: For he can say nothing, but that euery man is a sinner, that we must loue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as our selues, that euery man must bee saued by Christ: and all this ye can tell as well as he.</p>
   <p n="19">19 That it was a good world when the old Religion was, because all things were cheap.</p>
   <p n="20">20 That drinking and bezeling in the ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house or tauerne is good fellowship, &amp; shews a good kinde nature.</p>
   <p n="21">
      <pb facs="5"/>21 That a man may sweare by the Masse, because it is nothing now: and byr Ladie, because she is gone out of the country.</p>
   <p n="22">22 That euery man must be for himselfe, and God for vs all.</p>
   <p n="23">23 That a man may make of his owne whatsoeuer he can.</p>
   <p n="24">24 That if a man remember to say his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the morning (thogh he neuer vnderstād them) he hath blessed himselfe for all the day following.</p>
   <p n="25">25 That a man prayeth when hee saith the ten Commaundements.</p>
   <p n="26">26 That a man eats his maker in the Sacra.</p>
   <p n="27">27 That if a man be no adulterer, no theef, nor murderer, and do no man harme, he is a right honest man.</p>
   <p n="28">28 That a man need not haue any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of religiō, because he is not book learnd.</p>
   <p n="29">29 That one may haue a good meaning, when he saith and dooth that which is euill.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>These and such like sayings, what argue they but your grosse ignorance? Now, where igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance raigneth, there raignes sinne: &amp; where sinne raignes, there the deuil rules: and where he rules, men are in a damnable case.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Ye will reply vnto me thus, that yee are not so bad as I would make you: if need be you can say the Creede, the Lords prayer, &amp; the</hi> 10. <hi>cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: and therefore ye will be of Gods beleefe say all men what they will, and you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the deuill from your hearts.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
      <hi>I answere againe, that it is not sufficient to say all these without booke, vnlesse ye can vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the meaning of the words, and bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make a right vse of the Cōmandements, of the Creede, of the Lords prayer, by applying them inwardly to your hearts and consciences, and outwardly to your liues &amp; conuersations. This is the very point in which ye faile.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>And for an helpe in this your ignorance, to bring you to true knowledge, vnfained faith, and sound repentance: here I haue set downe the principall points of Christian Religion in sixe plaine &amp; easie rules, euen such as the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest may easily learne: and hereunto is adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an exposition of them word by word. If ye do want other good directions, then vse this my labour for your instruction:</hi>
      <note place="margin">A direction for the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</note>
      <hi>In reading of it first learne the six principles, &amp; when ye haue them without booke, &amp; the meaning of them withall, then learne the exposition also: which being well conceaued, &amp; in some measure felt in the heart, ye shall be able to profite by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, whereas now ye cannot: and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie parts of the Catechisme, namely, the ten Commandements, the Creede, the Lords prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the institution of the two Sacraments, shall more easily be vnderstoode.</hi>
