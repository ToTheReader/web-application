   <head>To the Christian Reader, <hi>Iohn Bradford</hi> wisheth the true knowledge and peace of Iesus Christ, our alone and sufficient Sauiour.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Reat and heauy is Gods</hi> anger against vs, as the most grieuous plague of the death of our late King (a Prince of all that euer was sithen Christs assension into heauen in any Region peerelesse) now fallen vpon vs, doeth prognosticate. For when Gods iudgement hath begunne with his Childe, this our deare darling, let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men thinke as they can, I surely can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee perswaded otherwise, but that a grieuous and bitter cuppe of Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is ready to bee powred out for vs English men to drinke of. The whelpe God hath beaten, to fray the bandogge. Iudgement is begunne at Gods house. In Gods mercie to him-wards, he is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that his eyes should not see the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which we shall feele.</p>

I will not goe about to paynt vs out in our colours: All the world which neuer sawe England, by hearesay seeth England: God by his plagues and vengeance, I feare me, will paynt vs out, &amp; point vs out▪ We haue so mocked with him and his Gospell, that we shall feele it is no bourding with him.</p>
   <p>Of long time we haue couered our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse and carnality vnder the cloake of his Gospell; so that all men shall see vs to our shame, when he shall take his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell away, and giue it to a people that will bring foorth the fruites of it: then shall we appeare as we be. To let his Gospell tarry with vs, he cannot; for we despise it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it, are glutted with it: We disdaine his Manna: it is but a vile meate, thinke we: We would be agayne in Egypt, and sit by the greasie fleshpottes, to eate agayne our garlike, onyons, and leekes. Sithens Gods Gospell came amongst vs, we say nowe, we had neuer plentie; therefore againe let vs goe and worship the Queene of heauen.

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hem: Gods wrath waxed hotte against

them. Then was weale away, mourning and woe: then was crying out, wringing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> handes, renting of clothes, sobbing and sighing for the miseries fallen; out of the which they could not scape. But, Oh ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> mourners &amp; criers out, ye renters of clothes, why mourne ye? what is the cause of your miserie? The Gospell is gone; Gods word is little preached, you are not disquieted with it; Noe troubleth you not; Lot is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; the Apostles are gone. What now is the cause of these your miseries? Will you at the length confesse, it is your sinnes? Nay, nowe it is too late; God called vpon you, and you would not heare him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yell and crye out nowe; for he will not heare you. You bowed your eares from hearing of Gods law: therefore your praier is execrable.</p>
   <p>But to come againe to vs English men: I feare me (I say) for our vnthankfulnes sake, for our impietie and wickednesse, as God hath taken away our King, so will he take away his Gospell: yea, so we would haue it, then should all be well, thinke many. Well, if he take that away, for a time, perchaunce, we shal be quiet, but at length we shall feele
<pb facs="24"/>
the want to our woe, at length he will haue at vs, as at Sodome, at Ierusalem, and other places. And now hee beginneth to brew such a brewing, wherein one of vs is like to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>amest to destroy the woorkes of Sathan, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>estroy his furours now smoaking, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most set on fire in this Realme. Wee haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nned, we haue sinned, and therefore art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hou angrie: O be not angrie for euer. Giue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s peace, peace, peace in the Lord: set vs to worke against sinne, against Sathan, against our carnall desires, and giue vs the victorie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>his way. This victorie we obtaine by faith. This faith is not without repentaunce, as her Gentleman Vsher before her. Before her I say, in discerning true faith, from false faith, lip-faith, Englishmens faith: for else
<pb facs="25"/>
it springs out of true faith.</p>
   <p>This Vsher then, Repentance, if we true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly possessed, we should bee certaine of true faith, and so assured of the victorie ouer death, hell, and Sathan. His woorkes then which hee hath stirred vp, would quaile, God would restore vs politique peace, right should be right, &amp; haue right: Gods Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell should tarrie with vs, Religion should be cherished, Superstition suppressed: and so we yet something happie, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the great losse of our most gratious Liege soueraigne Lord. All these would come to passe you see, if the Gentleman Vsher I speake of, I meane, Repentance, were at Inne with vs. As if he be absent, we may be certaine, that Ladie Faith is absent. Wherefore, we can not but be vanquished of the world, the flesh, and the deuill, and so will Sathans woorkes prosper, though not in all thinges to bleare our eyes, yet in that thing which hee most of all desireth. Therefore, to Repentance, for our selues priuately, and for the Realme and Church publiquely, euerie one shall labour to stirre vp both ourselues and others. This, to the ende that for my part I might helpe, I haue
<pb facs="25"/>
presently put foorth a Sermon of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which had lyen by me halfe a yeere at the least, for the most parte of it. For the last Summer, as I was abroade prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in the Countrey, my chaunce was to make a Sermon of Repentaunce, the which was earnestly of diuers desired of mee, that I should giue it them written, or else put it foorth in Print. The which thing to graunt, as I could not (for I had not written it) so I tolde them, that had so earnestly desired it.</p>
   <p>But when no nay would serue, but I must promise them to write it as I could: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to their request, that they should haue it at my leisure. This leysure I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed so long, that as (I weene) I offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them: so did I please my selfe, as one more glad to reade other mens writings, then in such sort to publish mine owne, for other men to reade: not that I would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not to profite by mee, but that I, knowing how slender my store is, would be loth, for the enemies to haue iust occasion of euill speaking, and wresting that which simply is spoken.</p>
   <p>But when I considered this present time,
<pb facs="26"/>
to occasion men nowe to looke vpon all thinges, in such sort as might mooue them to godlinesse, rather then to any curious questioning: I, for the satisfying of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and profiting of the simple, ignorant, and rude, haue now caused this Sermon to be printed: the which I beseeche God for his Christes sake, to vse as a meane, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of his mercie, it may please him to worke in me, and many others, true hearty repentance for our sinnes, to the glory of his name.</p>
