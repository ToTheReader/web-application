   <head>To his brethren of the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and the beloued Readers,</hi> Grace and peace.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Preaching of Gods word, (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Lord &amp; beloued) an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding therof to the peoples capacity, with words of exhortation applied to the conscience, both to enforme, and reform, and where they be wel, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, as it is most necessarie, so is it indeed a very hard worke to be performed, though to the vnskilfull it seeme easie: and thereupon, not a few vnaduisedly take it in hand, speaking without iudgement rashly, without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der preposterously, tatching matter together without dependancie, little to the peoples edification, and lesse to the honour of this holy ordinance, which by these is made odious with many, and held rather a talke of the toong from a disordered affection, without knowledge, than a godly instruction rightly disposed by setled iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It may be they are <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, and of a good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on attempt this worke, but withall they must be <gap reason="foreign">

      </gap> hauing abilitie in wisedome aptly to teach. Discreet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding must goe with zeale, and grauitie with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie: affection is headi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> without wisedome: this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, as the other pricks forward: they must be linked inseparablie. Knowledge alone deliuereth coldly, and zeale alone, not respectiuely: knowledge without zeale permitteth of more than is meet, by distinction: and zeale not according to knowledge breedeth but dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is requisite therefore the Ministers be neither <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> (whom pride may puffe vp, not yet hauing in a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb facs="4"/> course, learned to moderate the lusts of youth) nor <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, as yet not apt to teach, and vnfit to be ouerseers in a Congregation: for we must know what to teach for the matter, and how for the maner; and so to diuide the word aright to the hearers; which is required in all that preach vnto the people. And therefore to further both these, vpon these considerations duly weighed, I was encouraged to proceed and to vndergoe the maleuolous censure of this enuious age. First, for that I see many do obserue this order in part, though not so exactly as were to be wished, and as it is here by precepts briefly and plainly set downe, whose good approbation I hope to finde as maintenance against the rest. Secondly, for that I haue found by my owne experience in teaching, both the easinesse thereof to be atteined soone vnto, as also that it is a very sound &amp; profitable way, as I haue iudged hearing other, and they me, neither disliked of any that I haue heard of, who list to speake faithfully and with profit. Thirdly, for that I hauing vpon an occasion stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the 11. of the first of the Corinthians, from the 23. verse to the end, I finde plainly this method set downe by the Apostle, and so hath it a diuine and Apostolicall approbation, for supposing the 23. 24. 25. verses to be as his text out of Matth. 26. 26. 27. 28. the 26. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the scope, the 27. is a doctrine, 28. an vse, 29. a reason to enforce it, 30. and 31. the application of that which went before, to the present state of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians. 32. a preuention of an obiection which must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low application, as I haue declared in this treatise. 33. 34. a louing exhortation for the conclusion, with a briefe repetition of somewhat before reprehended, with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed remedie for the same. This place gaue me the
<pb facs="4"/> first and chiefest occasion to write this treatise of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and method therein. Fourthly and lastly, for that I hauing laboured for all such both old and new which haue writen of this matter, to further me, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded my selfe that this my labour would not be vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to my brethren, as it hath beene to me a paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worke, wherein I haue endeuoured to set downe much matter in very few words; and to illustrate the manifold precepts by euident examples briefly. If in all this I attaine to my desire in any measure, I content my selfe: my will was to perfect, though thorow disabilitie I leaue the worke imperfect. Nothing can bee so well done, but a want may be espied by some, or at least suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be seene in the cunningest deuice of man; and all know, it is easier to find a fault, than either to begin well a cunning worke or rightly to finish an imperfect labour, or to amend perfectly what is amisse. I looke for carpers and such as would find euen <hi>nodum in scirpo</hi> by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious eie in my labours. But if some profit, those that be my friends, I blesse God, though other do not benefit: for as <hi>amici omnia amicè interpretantur &amp; in meliorem partem dubia accipiunt,</hi> so <hi>inimici &amp; inuidi malè omnia, &amp; peiorem in partem vel optima torquere student.</hi> I presume not to make a rule to any, nor to tie all to one method, but as men shall find which is the best, that let them in iudgement approue without partiall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I desire that mens persons may not at any time be preiudiciall to their labors. Wise men in such cases doe weigh in iudgement the substance, and are not with partiall affection misled by circumstance. So reade and iudge, as if you that reade were your selues the Authors. In a word, do as you would be done vnto.</p>
