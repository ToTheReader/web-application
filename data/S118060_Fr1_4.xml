      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any and sundrie cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessiōs and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Faith haue béene here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tē, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in this our age set foorthe in Printe by Kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Nations and Cities, wherby in these our latter daies, in so vnhappie increase of pernicious Heresies, (which euery where sprynge vp) they shewe and testifie, that they thinke, beleue,

and teache, purely, plainely, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vnfallible truthe, all &amp; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Article of the Christian faithe and Religiō: to be short, that thei are farre from Heresies, or erronious opinions. Albeit therefore we haue done the like alreadie in our writinges, whiche we haue published, yet bicause they are now, perhaps, out of minde, scattered in diuers places, &amp; intreate of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more at large, then that euery man can haue leasure to peruse and reade them through: we beinge incoraged by other faithfull mens good example, doo our indeuour in this briefe declaratiō, to comprehende and set foorth to al that beleue in Christe, the doctrine &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Churches, whiche they frō the beginninge of their reformation these many yeares, wadinge through sundrie perils haue taught, euen to this daie, and now also doo retaine with one full cōsent. Hereby also we witnesse to all men our generall agrement (which the Lord hath wrought emong vs) that
<pb n="2" facs="44"/>
in our Churches, wherein God hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vs Ministers, we al speake one thinge, not disagreynge amonge our selues, but are a perfecte bodie of one minde, &amp; of one iudgement. Moreouer we declare by this our woorke, that we sowe not such séede of corrupte doctrine in our Churches, as many of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries falsely, and vndeseruedly goe about to laie to our charge, &amp; to thrust violently vpō vs, specially in their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe, to whome our writinges come not, and before suche as know not our Doctrine. Indifferent Readers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall most manifestly perceiue by this our writinge, that we doo in no wise allow any Heresies, whiche here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies (that it might the better appeare, how greatly we deteste) we haue made mention of them almost in euery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, briefly recitinge, &amp; reiecting them. Men shall easely gather this also, that we doo not by any wicked Schisme se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer or cut of our selues from Christ his holie Churches of Germany, France,
<pb facs="45"/>
Englande, and other Christian Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but that we well agrée with all and euery one of them in the truthe of Christe, whiche here we haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. For albeit there is some va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie in diuers Churches, aboute the vtteringe and settinge foorthe of their doctrine, and aboute rites or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <note place="margin">Varietie of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and dissent in trifels.</note> whiche they receaue as a meane to edifie their Churches, yet that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie neuer seemed to minister cause of dissention and Schisme in the Church: For in suche matters the Churches of Christe haue alwaies vsed their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as we may Reade in the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Historie. The Godly in time past thought it sufficient, if they agreed <note place="margin">Agrement.</note> in the chiefe pointes of their faith, in the true meaninge thereof, and in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue: wherefore we truste, that Christes Churches (when they shall perceaue and finde that we consente in all Articles of our holy and eternall Gods doctrine, in the true vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge thereof, &amp; in brotherly loue with
<pb n="3" facs="45"/>
theim, and chiefely with the auncient Apostolike Churche) will likewise wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly agree with vs in those matters: for the chiefest cause, whiche moued vs to publish this Cōfession, was to séeke, obtaine, and once obtayned, to keepe peace, concorde, and mutuall loue with the Churche of Germany and other fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Countries: who be, as we throughly perswade our selues, so kind, so sincere and perfect, that if any of our doinges haue, perhaps, not bene well vnderstoode hetherto of diuers, they will herafter, (hearing this our plaine Cōfession) not count vs Heretikes, nor condemne our Churches (whiche are true Christian Churches) as impious. But in especiall we professe, that we are alwaies readie, (if any man require it) more at large to declare all and eche particular thinge, that here we haue proposed, yea and to yeelde, and giue them most hartie thankes, and to obey them in the Lorde, which can teach vs better doctrine, by the woorde of God,
