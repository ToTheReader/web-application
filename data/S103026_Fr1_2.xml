   <head>¶ TO THE SVPPOSED GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
of the Church of England,
the Archbyshops, lord Byshops, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons
and the rest of
that order.</head>
   <p>MAnie and most euident haue
our declarations bin concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the truth of that gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which Christ hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in his word for the ruling of
the Church; which we haue manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
vnto you, both by our writinges
&amp; speches, as occasion hath bin offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
neuer hath any one of you ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in hand to saye any thing against
it, but it hath made his eyes to daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle,
as the clearest sun-shining; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he hath beene driuen to wander
hyther and thyther, groping for eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and yet coulde not escape, but
hath fallen into infinite most mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
absurdities, and blasphemous
assertions, (as by their writinges yet
extant it may appeare) so forcible is
the trueth, to amaze the gainesayers
thereof, and so pregnant is falsehood
to beget and bring forth thousands
of absurdities, and euery one worse
<pb facs="4"/>
then other. And will you still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in your damnable, and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellish
course? Haue you solde your
selues vnto Sathan, to fight for him
vntill you be dampned in Hell with
him? Haue you morgaged the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your soules &amp; bodies, for the
present fruition of your pompe and
plesure, is it because you see not what
you should do? It may be so, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are so blinde, that they grope e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
at noone day; but me thinkes it
can hardly be so, vnlesse you be they
that haue eyes and see not, for the
cause hath bene (by the blessing of
God) so managed, that many plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
artificers, and children do see it,
and know it, &amp; are able by the worde
of God to iustifie it, and condemne
you to bee aduersaries vnto the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
in resisting it. But you think that
gouernment not so needfull, &amp; your
fault but small (if it be any) in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
your course begon. The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of the thing is many wayes appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
both in that it hath so plentiful
warrant from Gods owne worde, (as
<pb facs="4"/>
the course of this booke doeth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
declare,) and also in that the
gospell can take no roote, nor haue
any free passage, for want of it: and
the greatnes of your fault appeareth
by this, that in so doing, you are the
cause, of all the ignorance, Atheisme,
schismes, treasons, poperie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines,
that is to be founde in this
land, which we challenge to prooue
to your faces, if we may indifferently
be heard, and whereof in the meane
while we will giue you a taste: for the
first it is cleere, that you are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of that damnable ignoraunce,
wherein the people are so generally
wrapped, for that you haue from time
to time stopped the streams of know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge,
in those places where the Lord
in mercie bestowed the same, and in
stead of able and painefull ministers,
haue pestered the Churche, eyther
with presumptuous proude persons,
that are esteemed learned and take
no paines to bring the people vnto
the knowledge of Iesus Christe, or
(which is the greatest nomber) such
<pb facs="5"/>
ignorant asses, and filthy swine, as are
not worthy to liue in a well ordered
common-wealth: and that you are
the cause of all atheisme, it is plaine,
for one may (as in deede many doe)
professe it, and you saye nothing to
him for it. If the most filthy liuer will
fawne vpon you, and bribe your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
you will not onely fauor him,
but assiste him against any godly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
or other: but if any that feare
God, refuse to come vnder the leaste
of your popish ceremonies, he shalbe
molested, till his pursse be empty, or
else by your tyrannous dealing, hee
haue made shipwrack of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
And are not you the cause of
all schismes, that make a hotch-pot
of true religion and poperye, and so
giue some an occasion to fal into this
course, and others into that? And it
is as cleare, that you are so farre the
cause of all treasons, as without you
they had not bin: for if euery Church
had had hir gouernement according
to Christs institution; our yong gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and studentes, had not bene
<pb facs="5"/>
(for want of teaching and carefull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersight)
made a prey vnto the sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
and consequently to those pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
which haue broght the bodies
of so manie vnto Tyborne, and their
soules into hell; and who but you be
the cause of poperye, whilest you vse
them so well, let them doe what they
list, yea, and keepe them in office and
authoritie vnder you, yea (whiche
more is) giue them such offices as
none that is not popish can execute:
I speake not of the ignorance which
by your means raigneth euery wher,
which (as they confes) is the mother
of their deuotion, and you are the
wretched fathers of that filthye mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whereby you muste needes bee
grandfathers (at the least) to al kinde
of popery. And who can (without blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing)
denie you to be the cause of al
vngodlines, seeing your gouernment
is that which giueth leaue to a man
to be any thing,<note place="margin">Omnia cum si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceant, non lice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> esse bonum.</note> sauing a sound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.
For certainly it is more free in
these dayes, to be a papist, anabaptist,
of the family of loue, yea anye moste
<pb facs="6"/>
wicked one whatsoeuer, then that
which we should be, and I could liue
these twentie years, any such in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
(yea in a Byshopps house it may
be) and neuer be much molested for
it; so true is that which you are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with, in a <hi>Dialogue</hi> lately come
forth against you, and since burned
by you, that you care for nothinge
but the maintenaunce of your digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
be it to the damnation of your
owne soules, and infinit millions mo:
Enter therefore nowe at the last, into
the serious consideration of these
things: remember that one day, you
must be presented before the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
seat of Iesus Christ, to be arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for all the soules that haue gone
to hell (seeing you will needes be the
rulers of the Church) since the gospel
first appeared in this land, then shall
you not bee excused with this; the
Queene and Councell wil haue it so:
nor with that; our state cannot beare
it. For it shalbe sayde vnto you, why
do you not infourme them better of
my will, why taught you them not to
<pb facs="6"/>
worship with trembling and feare, &amp;
to kisse the sonne least he bee angry;
why did you not tell them, that all
states must be ruled by my worde, &amp;
not my word by them and their pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies.
When these things shalbe laid
to your charge, your consciences shal
aunswere; that if you had done so,
you should haue lost your dignityes,
whiche you loued and sought for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially:
then shall you wishe, that
the mountains would fall vpon you,
and the hills couer you from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the lambe, and from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of him that sitteth vppon the
throne. And I am perswaded, that
you are in league with hell, and haue
made a couenaunt with death; yea,
you doe perswade your selues, that
there is no God, neyther shall there
be any such day of account; or it were
vnpossible, that you should giue your
eyes anye sleepe, or take anye rest in
your bedds, vntill you had vnto the
Lord by repentance, and the Church
by confession vnburdned your souls
of these hellishe wayes, wherein you
<pb facs="7"/>
haue so long walked Repent, repent,
be not ashamed to amend, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
haue founde you out the way,
iudge your selues whyle you haue
time, least you be made fyrebrandes
of hell beyond all time. Let our chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
that wee haue made in the
name of the Lord, be hearkened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
Let vs bee disputed with before
indifferent iudges, let the holy word
of God bee the touch-stone to trye
our di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ntations by, and then shall it
easily appeare, who hath the Lord on
his side, and who not. The trueth wil
preuaile in spite of your teeth, and al
other aduersaries vnto it, (for God
disdaineth to be crossed, by dust and
ashes;) Therefore be not obstinate so
long, as vntill you be found fighters
with God; but preuent his wrath, lest
it breake foorth against you like fyre
that none can quench, because of the
wickednes of your inuentions. Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
your byshopprickes vpon a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and wee will venture our
liues, take the challenge if you dare:
if the truth be on your side, you may
<pb facs="7"/>
hereby, be restored to your dignities,
and be no more troubled by vs: but
if the trueth be against you, what shal
it profit you to win the whole world,
and afterward loose your own souls.
If you refuse still our offer, then must
you needes be guiltie eyther of this,
that you know your cause will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
the tryal, or of this, that you wil
take no pains to confute vs that keep
such a sturre in the Church: do not
think that because you haue humane
authority on your side, therfore you
are safe, for he whose authoritie is on
our side, is the greatest, to whose
voice all the deuils in hell shall stoup;
much more the sillie arme of sinfull
fleshe. We haue sought to aduaunce
this cause of God, by humble suit to
the parliamente, by supplication to
your Conuocation house, by writing
in defence of it, and by challenging
to dispute for it, seeing none of these
means vsed by vs haue preuailed; If
it come in by that meanes, which wil
make all your heartes to ake, blame
your selues; for it must preuail, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
<pb facs="8"/>
the mallice of all that stande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, or such a iudgement must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertake
this lande, as shall cause the
cares that heare thereof to tingle, &amp;
make vs be a by-word to all that pas
by vs. The Lord open your eyes, that
you may see the confusions whereof
you are the cause, and giue you true
repentance, or confounde you in all
your purposes, that bee against him
and the regiment of his sonne Iesus
Christ. The same Lord, for the loue he
beareth to his poore people; open
the eyes of her Maiestie, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Councellers, that they may
see your godlesse practises, and in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to Gods people, rid vs from you,
and turne awaye his iudgementes,
which the reiecting of his holy yoke
hath deserued, not punnishing them
that mourne for the desolation of
Sion, with those that spoile and
make hauock of the Lords
inheritaunce.</p>
