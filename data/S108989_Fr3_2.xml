   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which the Apostle hath seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
deliuered in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Discourses, dedicated to
your most Royall Parents, hee
now in this last Treatise collects
and conioynes in one, which ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of right can appertaine to
none more then to you Sir, who
being by them both the happy fruite of heauenly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and decrest pledge of their mutuall loue, and ioy,
may iustly challenge interest in the smallest good ouer
which their names are named. Sir, here is the way to
that <hi>Crowne of Triumph,</hi> which the more you know,
the more (I hope) shall you place your glory in it. Crownes
<pb facs="160"/>
of earthly Kingdomes are indeede the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

such as bring not so much Honour as they breed vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<hi>O nobilem magis quam foelicem pannum</hi> (said
<hi>Antigonus.</hi>) If the cares which dwell in the Diadem
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>re knowne, no man would stoope to the ground to
take it vp (said <hi>Seleucus.</hi>) And albeit, it be not giuen to
all to know this in their entrie to Honour, yet are they
all compelled to acknowledge it in the end. <hi>Seuerus</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

I haue (said hee) beene all things, and it profiteth mee
nothing. Not onely the teares of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> but the laments
of <hi>Salomon</hi> may witnesse to all the world, that the end
of the worme-eaten pleasures of this life, is heauie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure:
yea, the golden head of Babell had at length
worms spread vnder him, &amp; worms to couer him. <hi>Esa. 14
For all flesh is grasse, and the glory thereof as the
flowre of the field:</hi> Onely, <hi>The word of the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
for euer.</hi> By which that same God who hath called
you to be an apparant Heyre of the most famous King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
on earth, doth also call your Grace to a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
inheritance of a better Kingdome in heauen, <hi>which
cannot be shaken:</hi> whereby aboue other Princes, and
Rulers of the earth yee are blessed, if so be yee answere
your Calling, endeauouring to be no lesse than you are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
<hi>Principem te agnosce neseruias affectibus.</hi> It is
vnseemely in any, but most of all in a Prince, to become
as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ruant, eyther to the corrupt humours of men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, who creeping in into the Courts of Kings, like
wormes into the bosome of excellent trees, doe nothing
<pb facs="160"/>
but consume them: whom Godly <hi>Constantine</hi> properly
called <hi>Tineas &amp; Sorices palatij,</hi> subtile peruerters of
the good inclination of Princes in manners and Religion,
where they can preuaile: or yet to the disordered affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his owne heart, which if they be not restrained
doe quickly turne the glory of a man into shame. What
did it profit <hi>Cham</hi> that hee was the Sonne of <hi>Noah,</hi>
the Monarch of the world, and Patriarch of the Church
in his time; or that hee was the Heyre of the third part
of the world?<note place="margin">Chrisost.</note>
      <hi>vitia siquidem voluntatis vicerunt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelegia
naturae,</hi> his owne vndantoned will bursting out
in contempt of his Father, brought vpon him that curse,
and shamefull name, <hi>A Seruant of Seruants,</hi> which was
neuer taken from him. Seeing God (as saith the Apostle)
is the glory of man, what honour can make that man glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
who caryes not the Image of God, consisting in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and true holinesse? but especially a King, whom
the very Ethnicks called <hi>Animata Dei imago in terris,</hi>
should carefully keepe that Image which keeps his glory.
Naturally <hi>facilius alijs, quam nobis imperamus,</hi> but
in very deed he shall neuer be a skilfull Ruler of others,
who is not first taught of God to rule himselfe,<note place="margin">Basil.</note>
      <hi>decet
eum qui alijs praefectus est interiora sua decenter
adornare.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The best remedie against both these euils, is to embrace
that wholesome counsell giuen by God to the Gouernors
of his people, <hi>Let not the booke of the Law depart from
thee, but meditate in it day and night, that thou
maist do according to all that is written therein: turne
not away from it to the right hand nor to the left, so
<pb facs="161"/>
shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and shalt haue
good successe.</hi> Beware of those <hi>Lucifugae,</hi> haters of the
light, because it discouers the darknesse of their errours,
<hi>Qui cum a Scripturis redarguuntur,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Tertull.</note>
      <hi>in accusationem
Scripturarum se conuertunt.</hi> As the wise men follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Starre, were at length led by it to Christ, so if
according to <hi>Peters</hi> counsell, <hi>yee take heed to the light
that shineth in darkenesse,</hi> not onely shall the day star
arise in your heart, but that cleare shining <hi>Sunne of
Righteousnesse</hi> (so named by <hi>Malachie</hi>) euer rising and
neuer going downe, shall illuminate you with his bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
And herewithall take to you the domestique exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of your Royall Father, who stands before you as a
paterne of pietie, <hi>viuum omnis virtutis examplar:</hi> it
shall be no small proofe of your progresse in vertue, and
greatest praise among your godly Subiects, that yee be a
follower of him. And so praying Almightie God that your
happie deeds may exceed all that great hope which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
of you, I humbly take my leaue.</p>
