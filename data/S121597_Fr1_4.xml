   <p>WHereas in this great corruption of Faith and good life, there is also great want of good instruction for the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt of both the same: &amp; wheras yet the blindnes or malice of some mē is so great, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same meanes leaft by Christe and his Apostles in the Church for that end, they make so smal account of, that they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, and condemne the same, &amp; without al reason raise therat with full vncomely termes: it hath semed to many good and vertuous men right necessary, to set forth some such Treatise, wherein briefly is conteined bothe the right vse and ende of Shrift or Confession and also the due order that eche Christian man ought to kepe and obserue
<pb n="3" facs="6"/>
in the same. Whiche whoso shal duly peruse and examine, shall soone see, how litle reason or cause ther is, to make Confessiō a cloke or colour of any vice and lewednes, sith it is purposely ordeined for a meane and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Remedie against all vice and sinne.</p>
   <p>There is no time nor place now, to entre into farther dispi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions with suche kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, namely the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being already handled by diuers excellent great Clerkes, bothe in Latin, and in English also.</p>
   <p>Only this I had further to warne the Reader, that hauing trāslated this Treatise into our owne Language, and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to set foorth the same for the better information of all sortes in this point: it seemed also very expediente, to adde therevnto certaine other godly
<pb facs="7"/>
Instructions, Meditations, &amp; Praiers seruing all to the same purpose: that is, for the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of sinne, and purchasing of vertue, in the exercise whereof doth consist the whole life of the true beleeuer and folower of Christ. And this to be, and euer to haue bene the Doctrine and practise of the knowen Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Churche, not onely these present times, but al times and ages euen from Christe and his Apostles all along, haue &amp; do most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly testifie &amp; shew.</p>
