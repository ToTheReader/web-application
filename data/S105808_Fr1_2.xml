                 <title>Menaphon : Camillas alarum to slumbering Euphues, in his melancholie cell at Silexedra. VVherein are deciphered the variable effects of fortune, the wonders of loue, the triumphes of inconstant time. Displaying in sundrie conceipted passions (figured in a continuate historie the trophees that vertue carrieth triumphant, maugre the wrath of enuie, or the resolution of fortune. A worke worthie the youngest eares for pleasure, or the grauest censures for principles. Robertus Greene in Artibus Magister)</title>
