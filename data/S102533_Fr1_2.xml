   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Eyther sea particion nor distans of plase cann be anye lawfull excuse to be so silent here / as absent there / but rather the bonde of love considered / wth remembrans of your gentle favour / I dare no longer refrayne my penn / but as to sum I wrote the last Septēber / so thus printed to you and the rest of my freynds this December. Whervnto as I am sturred by dent of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian dutie / and the fullfillinge of the oulde proverbe: Better to late then never: so I trust your approved curtesies wyl requite that sayenge wth a nother as auncient: foone ynoughe yf well ynoughe. Knowinge that you accept aswell the playne and wel meaninge as of eyther gloriouse words / or eloquent wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge. Otherwise I conceyve not / how this small valure to yours over valuynge / can eyther be soone ynoughe or well ynoughe. By whose acceptation / God grant bothe the many wryters / and the few readers of this age / no less to abhor the ticklinge and erringe pēne / the ytchinge eare / and flatteringe tounge for glori or gayne / then to be only gladd vnder assurans the searcher of thoughts dothe se so clerely the depthe and intent of harts: whether guyded by devyne grace or moved by corrupted nature. Wherfore seinge every good gyft as / preachinge writinge / edifying speches / or the woreks of charptie procedinge from learned or vnlearned cōmes from the Lorde: I wyshe suche good instrumēts possessing honest lyfe wth there rare gyfts / to reioyce and be gratefull for beinge the mowthe or hand of God / so mercifully chusinge theme to be vessells for his glorie / furtherouse to his churche and profitable membres for the commune welthe. And greate reason they should do so: seinge good teachers and famouse writers on the one
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>syde / labor to wynn Disciples to Iesus Christ / and not to theme selves / vndergoinge there greate paynes throw love and good conscyens to beneficte many / and not for the expect of any vayne glorye. And on the other syde / the godly rytche to reioyce for that by the visible word and invisible grace they be taught to add St. Iames worcks wth St. Pauls faythe / cōcording theme to gethers by there words and practys as vnseperable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions / in steade the greater forte by there cowld charitie and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reles lyves seme to rent theme a sunder / the wch in dede ys more vnpossible then to devyde heate from the sonne or shaddow from the bodie. For as the one iustifiethe before men here on yerthe / so dothe the other before Gods trybunall seate in heaven: the wch worcks of Gods children of what qualitie or quātitie soever / are to be considered as the effects from the cause: whether the hand in gevinge / the toung in speakyng / the pēn in writinge / or the hart in longinge to do more or better / all wch as obedyent daughters do wayte and attend in there degrees on there mother faythe / the very apprehēdinge instrumēt of Iesus Christ God and man / and the hyddē roote gevinge ioyce and sapp to the manifould brā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the lords trees farr or nere / or whether more or less / as the provident God hathe appoynted. And yet the least portion of this faythe / dyscearned by her effects ys ynouhe to attaine to the endless crowne of glory. So graciouse ys our God / in acceptinge the readines of willinge / where wantethe the habilitie of doinge. My worsipfull bretherne / you know there be many goodlye trees now a dayes in the wyde orchard of this worlde / eyther out / or but only in / and not of Christ his lyttle garden / who beare grene leaves and fayre blossomes / but alack eyther smale fruict or none at all / and that by a wronge vnderstandinge of the compfortable article of iustification of faythe / presuminge there by to be that they are not / to have that they want / and to obtayne that they shall not / vnlest they do better reconsyle St. Paules faythe and St. Iames worcks to gether / wherby to reiect there sauls hope for to be saved vp there naked and bare faythe / wch the Apostle compares to a deade corps wthout the spirit / more fytt for the low grave / then for the vpper grownd. But blessed ys that tree planted by the watersyde of Gods spirit and word / wch bringeth for the her fructe in due season. As though fruicts out of season / be rather vnsavery / then pleasāt or sauery / as they are in dede / not only the worcks of our present Papists and Aunabaptists / the
<pb n="5" facs="4"/>one wthout faythe / and the other as voyde of the true Christ: but suche persons as be neyther of bothe: that is neglecters of the worde / absenters from the Sermons / followers of there plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures / prorogers of charitable and compassionat duties vntill there death when they are de prived of the vse of there goods. And yet I grant to sum yt ys a seasonable tyme by suche as were so exercised in there life / and wthout superstitiouse meanyng at there decease. Otherwise question leff it ys out of season. For now ys the tyme vnder lyfe to help one another by praper / cown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell / gevinge / or lendinge / but when soule or breathe ys gon / ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther angells nor Apostles can geve any help or remidie. The poore may say to sum ritche in these dayes / aswell as in former tymes by funerall aulmes / gathamercy deathe: as the hostes rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konyng wth her gest less willinge to lodge in her hows / then his tyred horse / made low curtesy in the mornynge to the beaste / and seyde gathamercy horse: foryf thow haddest not bene tyred / thy M<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. had not brought me this money. Luke as these proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of wel doinge having wherwth / are here iustly reproved / so the right vsers of Gods blessinghs in tyme oportune are to be cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended / and God for there liberall hand to be praysed and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. Wherfore fyrst let Stuards of larger portions make proufe to theme selves / ād to others of there savinge faythe worc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge by charitie and that in due tyme / whether yt be in gevinge therefully / or by lendinge to the godly poore in the pinche of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremetie / or by doore aulmes to the commune miserable and hungerie / without this coulde and vsuall forewell: God help you. Next let men of meaner degre spare sum excess and vn necessarie expences for to follow the good example of there betters. And lastly the meanest of all wantinge corporall habilitie / let theme lykewyse approve there faythe to be moving and justifieng by the works of the spirit: as true love and zeale to Gods glorie / earnest affectiō to Gods worde and veritie / pitifull and mercifull harts / the thyrst and hunger of well doinge / there hatred to herysie and Hypocrisie / or by gevinge of sownd and good cowncell: and by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinge a religiouse and vertuouse conversation to the magnifieng of God and there holy profession. These also be acceptable worcks to the lorde / who in mercy will crowne theme as his owne gyfts and not as theres. The regard of wch promised crowne / sette before the eyes of your mynds / will no less mitigate your greifes eyther in ward or ontwarde / then kyndle spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="6" facs="5"/>ioye / wth the longinge of your libertie from this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restiall tabernacle / wherby your noble soules to enioy the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritans wth the invisible and tryumphant churche now singinge as the Isralitishe Virgins sang the song of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses for there delyverans out of Egipt and Pharo his bondage: evenso the soules in Heaven do sing to the Lord everlastinge prayses for delyveringe them from the boude of sathan and there worldlie miseries: and lykewyse do singe the songe of the Lambe wherby the vertue of Christ and his redemption ys continuallie magnified. For as the oulde fathers eatinge the paschal Lambe made a iubilie and gave the Lord thancks: so those enfranchised spirits / felinge the light and libertie of Gods kingdom / geve thancks to Christ the Lambe / to the sytter on the throne / and to the spirit procedinge from bothe. Opraye for a fore tasie and sum sippinge of this greate supper where wth a farr of to be sum what acquaynted / for the better certificate of a more fullnes to ensue / by wch to increase your earnest longinge upwards and to decrease all overlyking here beneathe: that so the more felingly you may saye wth David / I shalve satisffied when thy glorie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth / wch wilbe a greater sight to behowld / then that wch Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Iohn saw at Christ his trāsfiguration on mowne Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor / even the fullnes of the incōprehensible dietie the essens of the gloriouse persons inscrutablie one God. Let vs then be mynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to saye wth the Prophett / my soule ys a thirst for God o when shall I appere before his presons. Iff you Mr. A. do still move and scur / love and lyve to the Lorde / then I mosie har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie salute you / and the rest so affected: but if otherwise / the spirit in heavē and the bodie in the grave ere this be aryved: then God grant vs behynd in the battell to geve glory and thancks to hym for his contynuing grace and finall mercies here beneathe to his / and for his everlastinge compforthes a bove to the soules of his servants restinge wth hym in peace and iope. That so the Lorde havinge his spirit / I may the bowlder to that coniecture set that oulde father as a glass for Lōdon professors to looke in: not alone in his zeale to the gospell / wth his frequent presens at Sermons / and wth good further ans to suche instruments / but to the poore presoners in and abowt London presons he was knowen to be bowntiful and mercifull. Agayne how ofte and willingly hathe be Imployed his money for commune profict as well as for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat? what paynes and travell hathe he takē to make peace and to
<pb n="7" facs="5"/>end controversies? how many men of worship and members of the lower hows in most parlamēt tymes haue bene worshipfullie entertayned at his table for there zeale to religion? how many poore schollers and students in the arts hath he no less perely thē liberally geven vnto? besydes his large distributions to Godly and desolate widdowes. And wch ys more / how manie in the contrey of worr are bownd to prayse God for his outstretched hand so farr from London? wherein he procured the knowlege of God for greate ignorans: beinge suche a shew tokē to patrons of benefices / as whē he franckly gave so good a lyvinge to a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned preacher / he reserved neither legg nor arme of that lyvinge to hym self / as all covetous patrons do. God grant yt be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly perfourmed by labor and life as it was of hym first and last intended. For as gyfts blynde the eyes of sum Iudges: so fatt lyvings coole the fyrst zeale of manie persons and vicars. For inward alterations do ofte follow the stayne of strange ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. Now whether this was a tree bringing forthe fructe in due season or out of season / iudge you besydes the erection of a schole as I remember in worr. And there fore as St. Paul would hym self to be imitated non otherwise then he did Christ: even so I wishe the Lords Stewards of better degre in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change / to follow this theire fellow mēver as he followed Christ and the worthier examples of his predecessors. Trustinge you will thinck this report to procede more for desire of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion / then of anie intent to tyckle hym wth adulation / being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure gon or at least of suche distans a sunder. To conclude / bothe hearing and seinge suche evident practys of good worcks in this towne of Harlem so farr short of our monarchall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by sownde professors and others of erroniouse opinious: I was drivē the rather to this presumptiō / as one sory to behoulde suche blynd opiniates so farr to outrun very many professors in my natyve contrey in the outward worcks of charitie and by hearinge that the ignorants are so affected vnto theme for yt / wher by the rather there might be a quycknyng wth a godly emulation on our syde / ere the axe come to the roote of the tree. <hi>1597.</hi>
