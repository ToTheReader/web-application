      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, before thou enter vpon this Discourse, either to read or to censure, I haue to admonish thee of two things. First, for the manner of writing, thou maist easily see it, to bee fitted for the Pulpit. And indeed, so it was, that hauing diuerse yeeres since deliuered some few out of this text, to mine Auditory: I did lately (vpon warning giuen) take it once againe in hand, and alter, change, correct, and enlarge it, till I brought it to this quantitie in which it is▪ so preparing it for a more noble Audience. Then finding it be ouerlong to be rehearsed at once, I was constrained againe to Epitomize it. Here therefore hast thou (and that is the second thing whereof I aduertise thee) at large the whole body of that Discourse, whose
<pb facs="6"/>
Epitome was rehearsed in publique. So that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, seemed to them that heard mee eyther obscure, or too slightly passed ouer in the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, here may they helpe themselues to vnderstand my meaning. For the matter I shall not neede to tell thee, that it is needfull in respect of the times, wherein the words of our Sauiour are seene fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>For because iniquitie doth abound, the loue of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waxeth cold.</hi> And how many are there daily, who either fall backe to Popery, and Aegyptian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable superstition, or else turne open rebels by Atheisme? And well may we thinke that when the Sonne of man commeth, he will scarce finde faith vpon earth. Who is there, therefore, except that vnprofitable seruant that hid his Talent in a Napkin, but will be willing to set to his helping hand, if not to stay all, yet to preserue some from Apostasie? Hence commeth it, that now lately there haue beene more Sermons and Tractates publisht concerning this sinne of Apostasie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these few yeeres, than were in many ages here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. So that now it might seeme as superfluous for an after-commer, to deale in this subiect, as to take in hand new Arguments for Popery: All which haue bin so often vrged by Schoole-men, alledged by Catholikes, re-assumed by Popish Priests, painted ouer by Iesuits, that a man might sooner hope for holesome meate to be made of Cole-worts, twise or thrise sodden, than to find a new, and not here-to fore answered Argument. So here: Yet since the gifts of men are diuers (albeit they proceed from the same spirit) what hindreth
<pb facs="6"/>
but that still men may bee doing, and doe well, since the end of their Action, is the glory of God?</p>
   <p>Concerning this present Tractate, what it hath, not to be found in the former, thou thy selfe (good Reader) vpon tryall wilt easily perceiue. In reading of which, if thou be such a one who knowest me not, It is well, goe on and try the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: If such who doest know mee, yet doe me the curtesie, to withdraw thy selfe from considering my meane-nesse, and looke onely vpon the cause. Consider the waight of Reason, which I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. For if thou shouldest either like the worse of this, in respect of mee, or esteeme better of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in respect of his person, not regarding what force of Argument we doe either of vs alledge: thou maist easily erre, as who indeed doest pinne the truth of God vpon the sleeue of man.</p>
   <p>To conclude then, if thou be judicious, reade, censure, and correct, I giue thee free libertie For I will not my selfe, be tyed to this that I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, if I see better reason to evince it, than is brought to confirme it. But if thou be one, who either doest, or justly maist suspect thy iudgement, reade, but leaue censuring to others. Howsoeuer it bee, whosoeuer thou art, conceiue thus of mee, that my desire was to haue deliuered the Truth, and nothing but the Truth. So wilt thou, I hope, commend me and my labours to the blessing of God in thy prayers: And cause mee to rest</p>
