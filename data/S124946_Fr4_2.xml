But since it hath pleased God unexpectedly (to our great losse and griefe, though, no doubt, his<note n="a" place="margin">

I shall not need to adde, what inducements and encouragements I might further receive to addresse these my poore endevours that way,
<pb n="58" facs="34"/> from those pregnant prints as well of pietie as other good parts evidently discovering themselves in your owne person, observed by others as well as my selfe, and the rather observed, because so rare ordinarily in others of your yeares, and of your ranke. The consideration whereof, as<note n="*" place="margin">

It was the speech of one for a naturall man notably qualified, though but meanly bred, to a dissolute person well borne, upbraiding him with his birth,<note n="f" place="margin">Ego primus illustravi domum meam; tu dedecorasti tuam.

<pb n="59" facs="34"/>
      <hi>Achab,</hi> than descending (as he did) immediatly from an <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi> to prove in conditions and course of life a second <hi>Achaz</hi> or an other <hi>Achab.</hi> This consideration may well be a strong engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to godlinesse, where but either parent onely hath beene reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. For if<note n="h" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14.</note> either partie beleeving, though the other be an infidell, be of force sufficient to bring the Children bred betweene them within compasse of Gods Covenant: surely the godlinesse of either, though the other were prophane, must needs be no small ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to oblige their issue the more straitly to that course, which they stood bound to have taken, though their parents had beene both of them utterly irreligious. But in this kinde hath God to you beene more abundantly gratious, in blessing and honouring you on both sides with two such worthie Parents, whose memorie as it is and will ever be deservedly honoured with all those that here knew them; so it is justly expected that it be revived in you es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, and the residue of their issue, as<note n="i" place="margin">

For, to omit that God hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished you with some abilities of learning that hee had not, that he hath called you sooner and entred you earlier, you have the more day before you: Your worthy Father hath broken the ice to you, he hath laid you to your hand a good foundation of religious courses in that Familie that you are to be Head unto hereafter; hee hath setled neere you and obliged unto you<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>T. Baily</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Fellow of Maud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins in Oxford.</note> a man of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts, who as he was sometime your Tutor and Governour, so will not cease now to be a Counsellor and Coadjutor unto you, by whose advice and assistance you may have plentifull meanes of furtherance in that godly course that by Gods gratious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse you have already made entrance into. Sir, you see what a taske is exacted of you, what a necessitie of well-doing and of proceeding in good courses is every way imposed upon you. Let all laid together prevaile with you to make you as the more carefull to affect and embrace all good meanes of helpe and furtherance therein; so the more forward and diligent from time to time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly and incessantly to crave further grace at his hands, by
<pb facs="35"/> whose strength wee all stand; who as hee hath begun this his gratious worke in you, so is alone able to finish it (and I doubt not but hee will so doe) to his owne glory in you, and your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory with him. And to this purpose may this loose discourse afford you any the least helpe, I shall esteeme it a sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of my labour in the publishing of it, what ever the issue be otherwise: If any other beside shall reape benefit thereby, I desire but that God may have the praise of it, and my selfe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their prayers. Howsoever it prove, it shall remaine a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the sincere love and respect that hee beareth and oweth to you and the house you come of, who both is and shall by Gods grace alwayes continue,</p>
