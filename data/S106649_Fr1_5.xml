   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or those who would read this
book with comfort, and reape the
blessing desired by it, in obtaining
mercie and favour from the Lord
for themselves and the whole
land, my humble request is, that they would
first correct these faults noted after; then read
and weigh these Contents in the beginning
both generall and particular; whereby they
may see the summe and drift of all; and have
as it were a plaine view of the whole in their
heads: afterwards to read the praier in the end
which is according to the same, that they may
better conceive and make a right use thereof;
and then to read the whole in order, if their lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and opportunitie serve, or at least such parts
of it, as they shall thinke most necessarie; and
especially the last chapter, which most neerely
concerneth every soule. That considering all,
<pb facs="7"/>
as before Christs judgement seat, like as I have
endevoured to doe, and so striving joyntly in
faith and love for our selves and all other the
poore afflicted Churches of Christ; the Lord
may fulfill all our holy desires, turne away all
evills from us and them, and make us to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
a flourishing Church and a happie Nation
to the comming of the Lord Iesus in the clouds.</p>
   <p>Remember,<list>
         <item>1. The danger we stand in, because of the Lords displeasure for our sin.</item>
         <item>2. The meanes how we may yet pacifie and prevent the same, if we be
not wanting to our selues.</item>
         <item>3. That we are all to be helpers hereunto.</item>
         <item>4. The comfort and happinesse of the true helpers, whatsoeuer come
to passe: with the misery of the rest.</item>
      </list>are the
briefe and
scope of all.</p>
