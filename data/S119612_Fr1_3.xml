   <head>To the right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
LUDOVICK, Duke of
Lenox his Grace, &amp;c. Henry,
Earle of North-hampton, &amp;c. and
Charles, Earle of Notingham, &amp;c.
Lords Admiralls of England and
Ireland, of Scotland and the Iles,
and of the Cinque Ports.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving intended a
painefull &amp; new
labour, upon a
rare and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
argument, as
for al Sea-farers,
so also properly pertaining to
your Honours, my most noble
Lords; I could not but of due sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
your Honours, as the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb facs="4"/>
of Sea-lawes, for a refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
remembrance, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
consideration of that most
honourable estate and high of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
presently, and (I hope) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
allotted unto you: I meane,
the Admiraltie of his M. domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
a charge both ancient
from many hundreth yeeres in
this Ile, and most honourable by
the personages your predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
bearing the same: as being
all, either sonnes, brothers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
or cousins to Princes, or (at
least) for action most famous.
With all the which, that your
Honours may the better ranke
and match, surely, as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these daies craves, so the
best disposed wish, that as you be
every other way Noble, your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
may be crownd with a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
attention to the speciall parts
of the Admiraltie requiring the
<pb facs="4"/>
same, to a memoriall surpassing
all ancesters: I meane the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servacy,
jurisdiction and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
thereof. The jurisdiction,
albeit it bee most faithfully and
diligently exercised, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>England</hi> by Sir <hi>Daniel
Dunn,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Trevor,</hi> most
learned, sincere, and worthy col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues,
Iudges in the high court
there: yet the daily thwarting
and curbing of the processe of
the Iudicature, urges a clearing
or designing of the limits and
marches, to a better distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
thereof from all other ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions
ordinary; without
which, due justice can neither be
administred, concerning the sea
customes (of which no court else
can take knowledge) for stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
traffiquing here (importing
no small staine to the King his
justice) nor yet for his M. lieges
<pb facs="5"/>
traffiquers on sea, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
and charter-parties ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
beare the clause of ruling
by law of <hi>Olero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>;</hi> a forraine law,
as all the other lawes of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall
court commonly are,
whereof no other Iudicature
here can take cognissance.</p>
   <p>To end this point; Beside that
which God in the heavens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of the ministers of justice,
please you to remember, that
here below amongst men, <hi>Nihil
justitia popularius.</hi> Consequently
therefore, the priviledges due
for the maintenance of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie
and jurisdiction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
would be vindicat from all
sort of encroching and usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.
But above all, the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacie
(as the chiefe point of that
office) requires security and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in common for all loyall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
traders on Sea: specially,
<pb facs="5"/>
for Fishers and others, happily
disposed to adventure and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
the trade of fishing, to the
end, that not onely a peaceable,
but also a full and plentifull fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
may bee enjoyed by the
inhabitants of his M. kingdomes,
even according to that which
God so freely and bountifully
offers into their very doors. For
which cause, the barbarity of the
Ilanders would be repressed, and
strangers stayed from scarring,
scattring, and breaking the shoals
of our fishes; namely, upon our
coasts of <hi>Scotland.</hi> There could
be no better employment for
some (at least) of his M. shippes
and companies, <hi>Ne vel illi usqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
turbent, aut isti intercipiant, quod
nos capere oportet.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But, I breake from this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
remitting the same to the
27 Title of this booke; hoping
<pb facs="6"/>
for a comfortable out-bearing
and maintaining of that necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and great dignity of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty
by your LL. according
to all the occasions of these quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relsome
times. And so I rest, by
this present token, devote to
serve your Honours in my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
