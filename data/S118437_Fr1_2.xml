         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>. Iames 3.1. cap. 4.11.</note> as our <hi>masterly-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious</hi> hearers expect, who <hi>make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb facs="3"/> Iudges</hi> of that, which should teach them to <hi>iudge themselues,</hi> and shall one day <hi>iudge them:</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.31. Rom. 2.16. Heb. 4.12. Iude 11. Psal. 91.4. 2. Thes. 2 10.</note> nor to craue your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage or protection of it: for it is <hi>the Word of God, mighty in operation, and sharper then a two edged sword,</hi> to cut off all that <hi>gainsay it,</hi> and so, able to defend it selfe; yea, it is the <hi>truth</hi> of God, <hi>a shield and Buckler</hi> to those that <hi>receiue the loue of it,</hi> and so, able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them. For my selfe; who am I, that I should hope to be exempted from the common condition of <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Writers,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ier. 18.18.</note> that is, to <hi>bee smitten with the tongues</hi> of those, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count nothing worthy acceptance, but the fruite of their owne braine? There are principally, three sorts of men,<note place="margin">Luke 22.50.</note> that (like <hi>Malchus,</hi> hauing <hi>his right eare cut off</hi>) heare all things sinisterly. First, Ambitious persons. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">3. sorts of persons iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in their censur s of Preache s &amp; Sermons.</note> Malicious persons. Thirdly, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious persons: if this Sermon come into any of these persons hands, I must
<pb facs="3"/> expect, that (as men looking vpon any thing through a coloured glasse, iudge that thing to be of the same colour with the glasse, through which they looke so) their opinions of the <hi>Preacher,</hi> and of the <hi>Sermon,</hi> will be conformed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>distemper</hi> of their owne hearts. First,<note place="margin">Maleuoli, velut Momi aruedut nos magis ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi morbo, quā iudicio. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanth. Gul. Epis. Hausmano. <hi>4<seg rend="sup">to</seg>. 1. Ambitious persons.</hi> Nihil est quod Ecclesiam ita diuellere qucat at{que} ambitio dominandi. Chryst. Hom <hi>11.</hi> in cap. <hi>4.</hi> ad Eph. <hi>3.</hi> Ioh. <hi>9. Iames 4.6.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>the Ambitious</hi> person seekes to raise himselfe in the fall, and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour himselfe in the disgrace of those who seeme to outshine him in true worth. Thus <hi>Corah,</hi> out of a desire of esteeme, resisted <hi>Moses; Diotrephes,</hi> out of a <hi>Loue</hi> of <hi>Preeminence,</hi> withstood <hi>Iohn the Diuine;</hi> and those <hi>false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> that they might exault themselues, vilified, and traduced Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Those wee haue more cause to pitty (because <hi>God resisteth them</hi>) and to pray for them, that God would make them more humble, and lowly-minded, then to bee disquieted at their insolencies, which is a sure signe of their folly, and
<pb facs="4"/> emptinesse. For wee see, the boughs, the more laden with fruite, they are the more lowly, but in a fanne, we see, the chaffe is aboue the Corne, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause its better, but because its lighter. Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Malicious persons.</note> the <hi>Malicious</hi> person, out of an inward hatred against the person of another, misiudgeth all his actions and intentions. This you may see in the carriage of the Priests and Prophets against <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ier 26.11. Amos 7.10.</note> of <hi>Amaziah</hi> against <hi>Amos,</hi> and of those <hi>cruell,</hi> and <hi>scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men,</hi> concerning whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Isay</hi> speaketh, that would <hi>make a man an offendour for a word.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Isa. 29.21.</note> For these my prayer is, that the Lord would destroy the workes of Satan, that enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man in their hearts, and fill them with the fruites of the spirit, especially, <hi>loue,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gal. 5.22. 3. Vicious persons. Isa. 5.29.</note>
      <hi>peace, gentlenesse, goodnesse, faith.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Vicious</hi> persons, <hi>speake good of euill, and euill of good, these put darkenesse for light, and light for
<pb facs="4"/> darkenesse, these put bitter for sweet, and sweet for sowre. Dauid</hi> out of much experience of such, sayth, <hi>They are licentious, and speake wickedly: they talke presumptuously: they set their mouth against Heauen,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal. 73.8, 9.</hi> Male de me lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qūtur, sed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li. Mouerer, si de me <hi>M. Cato.</hi> Si Lelius sapiēs, si duo Sci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>and their tongue walketh thorow the earth.</hi> To be dispraysed of such, is a prayse; as when an Enemy reuiles a Generall, or Captaine, or common Souldier for his faithfulnes to his King, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: But J must not make a Booke of an Epistle.</p>
