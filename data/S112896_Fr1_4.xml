   <head>The Preface to the
Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the ordinarie matter of Prefaces, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
first of all the apparant profit, or rather ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
that mooueth them to vndertake anie
worke. But I to my great griefe, doo thinke my
selfe discharged of that paine, in this cace. For he
that shall but read the title of this booke, <hi>Of the Trewnesse of
the Christian Religion,</hi> if he list to call to remembrance how
maine blasphemies he heareth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> howerly against God and his
word; how manie despisers of Religion he meeteth with at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
step; and how great either coldnesse in the things which
they ought to follow most wholie, or doubting in the things
which they ought to be leeue most stedfastlie, he findeth euen
in those which professe the Christian godlinesse: shall by and
by answer and yeeld the reason of himselfe, why I haue taken
this worke in hand, more needfull now adaies (yea euen (which
I am ashamed, to saie) among those which beare the name of
Christians) than euer it was among the verie Heathen and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.
Some busie themselues so much about their pleasures,
that they can neuer find anie leisure, not to mount vp vnto
God, but onelie so much as to enter into themselues: in somuch
that they be more strangers to their owne nature, to their owne
Soules, and to the things which concerne them most neerelie
and peculiarlie, than they bin either to the deserts of Inde, or
to the Seas that are worst to be haunted &amp; least knowen. That
is the verie welspring of the Atheists, who (to speake rightlie
of them) offend not through reasoning, but for want of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
nor by abusing of reason, but by drowning of reason, or
rather by bemiring it in the filthie and beastlie pleasures of
the world. Othersome match their pleasures with malice, and
to make short waie to the atteinement of goods or honour, doo
ouerreach and betraie othermen, selling their freends, their
kinsfolke, yea and their owne soules, &amp; not sticking to do anie
euill, that may serue their turne, neuer alledging or pretending
honestie or conscience, but to their owne profit. Of such kind
of stuffe are the Epicures made, who bicause they feele their
<pb facs="9"/>
minds guiltie of so many crimes, do thinke themselues to haue
escaped the Iustice and prouidence of GOD by denying it.
And of these we may say, that their reason is caried away and
oueimaistered by the course of the world, wherevnto it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
tied, so as they can haue none other course or discourse than
his.</p>
   <p>Some go yet a litle further, both in respect of God, and of
themselues. They thinke there is a God, and that of him man
hath receiued an immortall soule: that God gouerneth all
things, and that man ought to serue him. But forasmuch as
they see both Gentiles and Iewes, Turkes and Christians in
the world, and in diuerse nations diuerse Religions, whereof
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uery one thinketh he serueth God, and that he shall find sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
in his owne Religion: These (like men at a stoppe
where many waies meet,) in steed of choosing the right way
by the iudgement of reason, do stand still amazed, and in that
amazement conclude that all comes to one, as who would say,
that South and North lead both to one place. But foothly if
they applied their wit as aduisedly to iudge betweene truth
and falshood, godlinesse and worldlinesse, as euery man in his
trade doth to iudge betweene profit and losse: they should
foorthwith by principles bred within themselues, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
following vpon the same, discerne the true Religion
from the false: and the way which GOD hath ordeined to
welfare, from the deceitfull bywaies and from the crosse and
crooked inuentions of men. What shall I say of the most part
of vs? Of vs I meane which beleeue the Gospell and professe
the Christian Religion, and yet liue as though we beleeued it
not? Which preach the kingdome of heauen, and haue our
groynes cuer wrooting in the ground? Which will needes
seeme and bee taken to be Gods children and coheires with
Christ, children of so rich a father and heires of so goodly an
inheritance, and yet doo scarsly thinke earnestly vpon it once
in a whole yeare, but are readie to forsake it euery howre,
for lesse than a messe of grewell and a bit of bread? Surely
wee may well say then, that if euer it were needefull, it is
needefull at this time to waken such as are asleepe, to bring
backe such as are gone astraie, to lift vp such as are sunke
downe, and to chafe them a heat which are waxed cold. And
<pb facs="9"/>
that is to bee done by painting out the true Religion liuely
before their eyes, with the ioy, happines, and glorie which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
therevpon, to the intent that the voluptuous may seeke
their ioy, the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>etous their gaine, and the ambitious their
glorie there, bending themselues with their whole hearts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that alone, which all onely can fill their harts, and satisfie
their desires.</p>
   <p>That is the thing which I indeuor to doo in this worke,
and GOD of his gratious goodnesse vouchsafe to guide my
hand, to his owne glorie and to the welfare of those that are
his. But afore I enter into the matter, I haue to answere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
two sortes of people. The one are such as say that Religion
cannot bee declared vnto Infidels or vnbeleeuers by
reason. The other sorte are those whiche vphold, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
reason doo somewhat inlighten it, yet it is neyther
lawfull nor expedient to doo it. But let vs see what reason
they can haue, to exclude reason from this discourse. The
first sort say, It is to no purpose to dispute against such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
grounded principles. And by this meanes, because one
grounded principle is denied them, they breake of quite and
cleane, as though all meane of conference were taken awaie.
Surelie this principle of theirs is very true, but yet (in my
iudgement) it is very ill vnderstood. I graunt it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to dispute against such as denie grounded principles,
by the same principles which they denie: That is very true.
But there may be some other principles common to both
sides, by the which a man may profitably dispute with them,
and by those common principles oftentimes prooue and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
his owne principles. And that is the thing which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to doo in this worke. As for example; The Christian
groundeth himselfe vpon the Gospell; the Iew denieth it:
and therefore it were to no purpose to alledge it vnto him.
But both the Iew and the Christian haue one common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and ground, which is the old Testament: By this may the
Christian profitably dispute against the Iew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>yea euē to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
of the gospel, as if ye should make one to call some mā
to his knowledge, by the draughts or descriptions of his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture.
Likewise the Iew is grounded vpon the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt,
which the Gentile would mocke at if he should alledge it
<pb facs="10"/>
vnto him. But both the Gentile and the Iew haue one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
nature, which furnisheth them both with one common
Philosophie, and with one common sort of principles; as that
there is one God which gouerneth all things; that he is good,
and no author of euill; That he is wise, and doth not anie thing
in vaine. Also that man is borne to be immortall; that to be
happie he ought to serue God and continew in his fauour.
And therewithall, that he is subiect to passions, inclined to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
weake vnto good and so forth. Of these common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
the Iew maie draw necessarie conclusions, which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
shall not perceiue at the first, like as when a man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
a proposition, but conceiueth not yet the drift and
consequence thereof. He that marketh that the Adamant or
Loadstone pointeth to the North, perceiueth not foorthwith
that by the same a man maie goe about the world, although he
was of capacitie to cenceiue it. After the same maner, by this
principle:<note place="margin">Euclid. lib. 1. prop. 45.</note> He <hi>that from equall things taketh equall things, leaueth
the remainder equall;</hi> and by a few other propositions which
children learne in playing; the Mathematician leadeth vs gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
(and ere we be aware of anie mounting) vnto this so greatlie
renowmed proposition and experiment of Pythagoras, <hi>that in
a Triangle, the side that beareth vp the right Angle, yeeldeth a
square equall to the other twaine,</hi> which at the first sight see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vnpossible, and yet by degrees is found to be so of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie.
Thus shall the Iew by common principles and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
verifie his owne ground which is the old Testament.
For he shall proue vnto the Gentiles by their owne Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
that vnto God alone, things to come are present, and that
vnto Spirits they be knowen but onelie by coniecture, and so
farre forth as they can read them in the starres. And he shall
proue by their Astrologers, that the names of men and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of their doings cannot be betokened nor red in
the starres. And he shall proue by their Historiographers,
that the bookes of the old Testament, which containe so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
and so perticular prophesies, were written manie hundred
yeares afore the things came to passe. Now what will reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
insue hereof, but the proofe of the principle which is in
controuersie, by the principles which are agreed vpo betweene
them both: namel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e that the old Testament is of God, seing it
<pb facs="10"/>
cannot be from anie other. And what else is all this, than that
which is commonlie done in Geometric and Logicke, which
by two lines or by two propositions that are cōmonlie knowen
&amp; certeine, do gather a third proportion that was vnknowen, or
a third proposition (that is to saie a conclusion) that was erst ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doubted of or hidden, and by meanes of the other two is
euidentlie found out, and necessarilie prooued. Such are these
proofes against the Atheists: nothing hath mouing of it selfe.
It is nature that saieth so. The world turneth about, and the
heauenlie bodies haue a mouing: and that doth man himselfe
see. Therefore they must needs be moued by some other power
and that is the Godhead; which our eie seeth not, and yet by
means of the eie, our reason conceiueth and perceiueth it in all
things. Against them which denie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hristes Godhead, [we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
this principle of their owne.] That naturally of nothing
nothing is made. It is the saying of Aristotle, and the schooles
would haue him by the eares that should denie it. Iesus Christ
hath of nothing made verie great things, yea euen contraries
by contraries. The Heathen wonder at it, all ages crie it out,
our eies do still behold it. He that will denie this; must denie
the world, he must denie all things, he must denie himselfe.
It followeth then that Christ wrought by a powre, that is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
of Nature. Aristotle himselfe saw it not, and yet Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle
maketh vs to see it. The writers of Histories tooke no
heed of it; and yet they themselues make vs to beleeue it.
The Philosopher thought but onelie vpon nature, and the
Histographer but onelie vpon his owne writing. And yet
from both twaine of them, wee drawe both the Godhead of
Christ, and the truth of our Scriptures: Certesse in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as by Arithmetike, out of two and sixe wee draw out one
continuall proportionable line hidden after a sort in either
of them, and yet greater than both of them togither, which is
Eighteene: &amp; as out of two sticks chafed one against another,
we draw out fire which is not seene in the two, the consuming
of thē both out of hand. To be short, the marke that our faith
looketh at, is the Author of Nature &amp; principle of all princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
The rules therefore &amp; the principles of Nature which he
hath made cannot be contrarie vnto himselfe. And he is also
the verie reason and truth it selfe. All other reason then, &amp; all
<pb facs="11"/>
other truth dependeth vpon him, &amp; relieth vpon him, neither
is there, or can there be any reason or truth but in him: So far
off is it, that the thing which is trewe and reasonable in nature,
is or can be false in Diuinitie, which (to speake properly) is not
against nature, but against the corruption of nature, and in verie
deede about nature.</p>
   <p>Nowe come I consequently to the other sort,<note place="margin">How farre matters of faith are to bee dealt with by reason.</note> which say that
although it bee possible in some sorte; yet the faith (that is to
say, the Christian doctrine) ought not to be proued or declared
by reason: And their reason is, because it consisteth in manie
things which exceed the capacitie of man, &amp; therefore that he
which should measure them by reason, shoulde diminish the
dignitie and greatnes of them. Surely I will say more for them
than they require: namely, that mans reason is so farre off from
being the measurer of far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n, which very far exceedeth nature,
that it is not so much as the measurer of nature, &amp; of the least
creatures which lie farre vnderneath man; because of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and vntowardnes which is in vs and raigneth in vs. But in
this they deceiue themselues, that they imagine vs to vpholde,
that wee should beleeue no further than reason can measure &amp;
comprehend. For what a great way doth the truth of thinges
excend further than mans reason? But we say that mans reason
is able to lead vs to that point; namely, that we ought to beleue
euen beyond reason, I meane the things whereunto all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie
of man cannot attaine. And like wise, that when things
are reuealed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nto vs, which reason could neuer haue entered
into nor once imagined, no not euen when it was at the soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest;
the same reason (which neuer could haue found them out)
maketh vs to allow of them: the reason I say (whereunto those
mysteries were insuisible afore) maketh them credible vnto vs:
surely euen after the same maner that our eye maketh vs to see
that in the visible things, which we ought to beleue of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
without the which the visible could haue no beeing:
that is to wit, the inuisible God, by the visible Sonne, &amp; also to
see many things when the Sun is vp, which were hidden afore
in darknesse: not that the eie-sight was of lesse force, or the
thing it selfe lesse visible afore: but because the Sonne is now
vp, which lighteneth the aire with his brightnes, which is the
meane both wherby the eie seeth, &amp; wherby the thing is seen.
<pb facs="11"/>
As for example, we beleeue that there is one God, the Father,
the Son, &amp; the holy Ghost. This is the article which they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
against vs, &amp; therfore doe I take the very same. This arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
cānot in any wise fal within the cōpasse of vnderstāding, &amp;
much lesse be cōprehended by mans reason. But yet doth reasō
lead vs to the said point, that there is a God: that he hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
man to liue for euer: that whereas man hath stepped out
of the way, to followe his owne sway, he reformeth him again
by his word: That this word (as I haue said already heretofore)
is the olde and new Testament, which conteine thinges that
cannot proceed from creatures. Heere Reason stayeth, &amp; hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
it selfe contented. For seeing that God speaketh, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
man to holde his peace: and seeing that hee vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth
to teache vs, it becommeth vs to belecue. Nowe wee
reade this doctrine in Gods foresaid bookes, yea oftentimes
repeated. Lo how Reason teacheth vs that which she her selfe
neither knewe nor beleeued, namely by leading vs to the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
whom we ought to heare and beleeue; and to the booke
wherein he vouchsafeth to open himselfe vnto vs, in giuing vs
infallible markes and tokens, whereby to discerne what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
of God, and what commeth not of him. But when Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
commeth to the reading of the doctrine, and is perswaded
thereof; then she awaketh, and if the Gentile refuse it as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
and repugnant to reason and truth, then steppeth she
forth stoutly, and marketh the likenesse thereof in nature, the
images thereof in her selfe to set it foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>th, and the Recordes
of the Gentiles themselues to incounter them withall.</p>
   <p>Also she findeth out solutions of their arguments, and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to their absurdities. For surely all truth cannot be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proued by reason, considering that many thinges ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
reason and nature. But yet cannot any vntruth pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ayle
by reason against truth; nor any truth bee vanquished by the
iudgement of reason. For vntruth is contrary to nature, nature
helpeth reason, reason is seruaunt to truth; and one truth is not
contrary to another, that is to say, to it selfe. For truth cannot
be but truth, and Reason, reason.</p>
   <p>The like may wee say of the incarnation of the Sonne of
God; that no man could of himselfe haue imagined it, nor as
now also conceiue it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and yet not withstanding, that reason <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="12"/>
able both to teach it vs, and to defende it. What will she say
then to vs in this behalfe? That the workes which IESVS
wrought could not proceede, neither from a man, nor from a
deuil, nor from an Angell considered in their seuerall kindes,
but onely from God the maker of heauen and earth. And this
will she proue vnto vs, both in the respect of the history, and
in respect of the kindes of his workes, as well by the Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers
and Philosophers who were enemies to Christ and
his doctrine, as by conclusions of necessitie conueyed from the
principles which remaine in the natures of euery of them.
And what will ensue thereof, but that Iesus woorking by the
power of God, was sent of God, and therefore ought to bee
heard and beleeued? Beleeued (say I) to bee God the sonne of
God, because hee sayth it; and to bee man borne of woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the world sawe him to be so; &amp; that otherwise he should
be an enemie to God, and God an enemie to mankind; God (I
say) too good to assist him with his power to our ouerthrowe,
and too wise to lend him his spirit, to the defacing of his owne
glory? But if vngodlines stirre coales; Reason will open her
mouth and shewe, that it was agreable to Gods Iustice, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for mans welfare; possible to the power of the creator,
and agreeable to his wil and promises; behooffull for our base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and beseeming his glorie. And euen in vngodlines it selfe
she will find wherewith to put vngodlines to silence, howbeit
that euen in all godlines, she findeth not wherewith to speake
thereof sufficiently. The same is to bee vnderstood of other
like misteries, which shalbe treated of in their due places. And
this bringeth vs backe againe to the saide point, that the truth
beeing reuealed, enlighteneth reason; and that reason rowseth
vp her selfe to rest vpon truth. And so farre off is Reason from
abasing fayth, to make vs attaine thereto, that contrariwise she
lifteth vs vp as it were vpon her shoulders, to make vs to see it,
and to take it for our guide, as the onely thing that can bring
vs to God; and the onely schoolemistresse of whome we ought
to learne our saluation. To bee short, we say not that because.
Reason comprehendeth not this or that, therefore lette vs
not beleeue it: for that were a measuring of Fayth by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as they say. But wee say that Reason and Nature haue
such a Rule, and that that is the common way, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
<pb facs="12"/>
that this thing or that thing is done or spoken
beyond reason and beyond nature. I say then that the worke
and word of God are an extraordinarie case, &amp; that forasmuch
as they are of God, it behoueth vs to beleeue them; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
is to submit our reason and vnderstanding to him. And
so it is a making of reason seruant to faith by reason, and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of reason to stoope to the highnesse of faith: and not an
abasing of faith to the measure of reason.</p>
   <p>Now forasmuch as we take reason to our helpe against the
Infidels, the proofes which she shall yeeld vnto vs to guide
vs to the doctrine and schoole of faith, shalbe chiefly of two
sorts; namely, Arguments &amp; Records. The Arguments which
we will vse against the Iewes, we will take out of the grounds
of the Iewish Religion, the maiestie of God, the nature and
state of man, and the most euident and best authorised prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
or conclusions among them. Against the Gentiles, wee
will take them out of their substantiallest Rules, out of the
most renowmed Authors of Philosophie, and out of the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of their owne most approued Interpreters; one while
abiding vpon their principles, &amp; another while standing vpō
the conclusions which they themselues do gather of them, &amp;
sometimes drawing such necessarie consequents and sequeales
out of them my selfe, as they oftentimes perceiued not, as
though they had not vnderstood what they themselues spake.
Also against either of them, wee will iudge of the cause by
his effects, and of the effects by their cause; of the end, by the
instrument or moouer thereto, and of the mouer, by the end,
&amp; so forth of other things: which are the strongest arguments
that can be, as which are either demonstratiue, or very neere
demonstratiue. At a word, we will not alledge any argument
which shall not be substantiall, or at leastwise which we shall
not thinke to be so, neither will wee vrge any thing whereof
we be not throughly perswaded in our selues: choosing alway
the euidentest &amp; easiest that we can, to apply our selues to all
mens capacities. Notwithstanding, let not any man looke here
for arguments that may bee felt, as that I should proue fire
to be hotte by touching it, or the mysteries of GOD and
Religion by the outward sence: but let it suffise him that
mine argumentes shal bee fully as apparant, and commonly
<pb facs="13"/>
more apparant, than the argumentes which the Philosophers
alledge in naturall things: Howbeit that <hi>Aristotle</hi> would haue
men to looke for argumentes of lesse sorce at his hande in his
first Philosophie, then in his discourses of naturall thinges; and
for reasons of lesse force in his morals (so they be likely,) than
in his first &amp; highest Philosophie: which thing we may with
much better right require in the thinges that surmount both
nature and man, that is to witte, in Diuinitie. Moreouer, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
heere shall bee questions propounded to vnfold, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections
made to bee confuted, which might trouble the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if he were not satisfied in them, or else breake off the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of our proofes. And in them I shal be compelled now
and then to be obscure, either by reason that the nature of the
thing depending in controuersie, may perchaunce bee of some
old forworne opinion, or els in respect of the tearmes peculiar
to the case, which may hap to be lesse vnderstood of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sorte, and more diffuze, and lesse pithie in our language,
wherein such things haue not hitherto bene treated of. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
I hope to take such paines in the opening of them
that the Reader whosoeuer he be, if he take any heede at all,
shall easily attaine to the vnderstanding of them.</p>
   <p>As touching the Records, they shalbe (in my iudgement)
of the worthiest sort, and such as are least to be suspected or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
as neere as I can choose. We be to declare our doctrine
vnto men, &amp; men themselues are a part of the doctrine which
we set foorth. And what more clearenesse can there bee, than
to make themselues parties in the proofe, Iudges in their own
case, and witnesses against themselues? Vnto men therefore we
will bring the witnessings of men, euen the things that euerie
man readeth in his owne nature, and in his owne heart, from
whence hee vttereth them either wittingly or vnwittingly, as
things that are so written there, that he cannot wype them out
though he would neuer so faine. These are common insightes,
or inse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s (as a man may tearme them) namely the perswasion
of the Godhead, the conscience of euill, the desire of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
the longing for felicitie, and such other thinges, which in
this neather world are incident vnto man alone, and in al men,
without the which a man is no more a man; insomuch that hee
cannot deny them except he be out of his wittes, nor cal them
<pb facs="13"/>
in question without beiying of himself wrongfully. And here
of proceedeth the agreeable consent of all mankind in certain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
beleefes which depend immediatly vpon the said Principles;
which consent we ought to hold for certaine and vndoubted.
For the vniuersalnesse of this consent she weth that it is nature,
and not instruction, imitation, or bringing vp, that speaketh, &amp;
the voice or nature is the voice of truth. As for lying or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,
it is a fondling, and not a thing bred; a meere corruption,
and not a fruit of nature. Neuerthelesse, whether it were tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
ignorance which hath as good as choked the, or through
frowardnesse which hath turned reason a wrong way &amp; made
man as a stranger to himselfe: those common and generall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets
haue remained ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ren in the most part of men. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
some men in sundrie nations haue mounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the common rate, and indeuored to cherish and aduaunce
the said Insights, and drawen some small sparkes of truth and
wisedome out of them, as out of some little fire raked vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a great heape of ashes; the which they haue afterward
taught vnto others; and for so doing haue bene called Sophies
and Philosophers, that is to say, Wise men and louers of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
These also doo we take for witnesses of our doctrine;
and amongst them, the notablest and such as the world hath
esteemed to be wisest. And wheresoeuer they shall disagree,
either one with another, or with themselues; there shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reason be Iudge. And like as they haue caught some
sparkes from the fire, so will we kindle a fire of their sparkes:
how be it (in verie deed) not to lead vs to saluation the hauen of
our life; for in that behalfe we haue neede of God himselfe to
be our Pilote: but to shew vs as it were from a Tower; which
way it standeth in the darke wherin we now be, to the end we
may call to God for helpe, and euer after make thither ward
with all our whole hart. Particularly against the Atheists and
Epicures, we will bring themselues, the world, &amp; the creatures
therein for witnesses. For those are the Recordes which they
best loue and most beleeue, &amp; from the which they be lothest
to depart. Against the false naturalists [that is to say professors
of the knowledge of nature and naturall things] I will alledge
nature it selfe, the Sectes that haue sought out nature, &amp; such
writers in euery Sect, as they hold for chiefe Disciples, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
<pb facs="14"/>
and Anatomists or Decipherets of nature; as <hi>Pyt hago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,
Plato, Aristotle,</hi> the <hi>Academikes</hi> and <hi>peripatetikes</hi> both old and
new, and speciallie such as haue most stoutly defended their
owne Philosophie, and impugned our doctrine; as <hi>Iamblich,
Plotin, Porphirie, Procle, Simplice,</hi> and such others: whose depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
or rather oppositions against vs, I thinke men will
wonder at.</p>
   <p>Against the Iewes I will produce the old Testament, for
that is the Scripture where to their fathers trusted, and for the
which they haue suffered death, &amp; whereby they assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
of life. And for the interpreting thereof, I will alledge
their Paraphrasts, &amp; those which translated it into the Greeke
and Chaldey tongues afore the comming of our Lord Iesus
Christ. For they were Iewes borne, of the notablest men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, chosen by publike authoritie to translate it, and at
that time reason was not so intangled with passions, as it hath
bene since. Also I will alledge their ancient doctors, dispersed
as well in their Cabales as in their Talmud, which are their
bookes of greatest authoritie and most credit. And diuerse
times I will interlace the Commentaries of their late writers,
which generally haue bene most contrarie to the Christen do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
whom (notwithstanding) the truth hath compelled se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally
to agree, in expounding the Texts whereon the same
is chiefly grounded.</p>
   <p>Now in these allegations I shall sometimes be long, and
peraduenture tedious to the Reader, whome manifest reason
shall haue satisfied alreadie, so as (to his seeming) there needed
not so manie testimonies. But I pray him to beleeue, that in
this longnesse of mine, I straine my nature to apply myselfe
to all men; knowing that some like better of Reasons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersome
of Testimonies; and that all men (notwithstanding
that they make more account of the one than of the other) are
best satisfied by both, when they see, both reason authorised
by witnesses, (for that is as much to say, as that many men had
one selfe same reason) and also Recordes declared by reason;
for that is as much to say, as that credit is not giuen to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
person, but to the diuine thing which the person hath
within him, that is to wit, to Reason. Herewithall I thought
also, that all men haue not either the meane to come by all
<pb facs="14"/>
bookes, or the leysure to read them; whose labour I haue by
that meane eased. And oftentimes I am driuen to doo that in
one Chapter; whereof others haue made whole volumes.</p>
   <p>To conclude, I pray the Reader, first to read this booke
throughout, for without mounting by degrees, a man cannot
attaine to high things; and the breaking of a ladders steale ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
a man backe, &amp; maketh the thing wearisome which was
easie. Secondly I desire him to bring his wit rather than his
will, to the reading thereof. For foredeemings and foresetled
opinions doo bring in bondage the reason of them that haue
best wits; wheras notwithstanding, it belongeth not to the will
to ouerrule the wit, but to the wit to guide the will. Thirdly
and most of all I beseech him to beare alwaie in mind that I
am a man, and among men, one of the least; that is to say, that
if I satisfie him not in all points, my reason attaineth not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riewhere
so far as truth doth; to the end that mine ignorance
and weakenesse preiudice not the case, mine vndertaking
whereof, in good sooth is not vpon trust of mine owne wit, or
of mine owne abilitie; but vpon assured trust of the cleernesse,
soundnesse, substantialnesse, and soothnesse thereof.</p>
   <p>Now God vouchsafe to shead out his blessing vpon this
worke, and by the furtherance thereof to glad them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
to confirme them that wauer, &amp; to confute them which
go about to shake downe his doctrine. This is the onely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that I desire, the onely fruit which I seeke of my labour.
And (to say the truth) I feele alreadie some effect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
thereof in my hart. But lette vs praie him also to
vouchsafe in our daies, to touch our stonie harts with the force<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
of his spirit, and with his owne finger to plant his doctrine
so deeply in them, as it may take roote and bring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
foorth fruit. For certesse it is Gods worke to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
and win men, albeit that to counsell
them, yea and to mooue them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in some sort to lie
in man.</p>
