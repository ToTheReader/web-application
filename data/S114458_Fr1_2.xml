   <p>there are at this day foure seuerall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the order of Gods predestination. The first is, of the olde and new Pelagians; who place the cause of Gods predestination in man; in that they hold, that God did ordaine mē either to life or death, according as he did foresee, that they would by their natural free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, either reiect or receiue grace offered. The second of them, who (of some) are tearmed Lutherans; which teach, that God foreseeing, howe all mankinde beeing shutte vp vnder vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, would therefore reiect grace offered, did hereupon, purpose to choose some to saluation of his meere mercie, without any respect of their faith or good workes, and the rest to reiect, beeing mooued to doe this, because hee did eternally foresee that they would reiect his grace offered them in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell. The third Semipelagian Papists, which ascribe Gods predestination, partly to mercie, and partly to mens foreseene preparations and meritorious workes. The fourth, of such as teach, that the cause of the execution of Gods predestination, is his mercie in Christ, in them which are saued; and in them which perish, the fall and corruption of man: yet so, as that the decree and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall counsell of God, concerning them both, hath not any cause beside his will and pleasure. Of these foure opinions, the three former I labour to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne, as erronious, and to maintaine the last, as beeing trueth, which will beare waight in the ballance of the Sanctuarie.</p>
   <p>A further discourse whereof, here I make bold to offer to thy godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration: in reading whereof, regard not so much the thing it selfe, penned very slenderly, as mine intent &amp; affection: who desire among the rest, to cast my mite into the treasurie of the Church of England, and for want of gold, pearle, and pretions stone, to bring a rammes skinne or twaine, and a little Goates haire, to the building of the Lords tabernacle. Exod. 35.23.</p>
   <p>The Father of our Lord Iesus Christ grant that according to the riches of his glorie, thou maiest bee strengthened by his spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in thy heart by faith; to the end that thou being rooted and grounded in loue, maiest bee able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height thereof; &amp; to knowe the loue of Christ which passeth knowledge, that thou maiest be filled with all fulnes of God. Amen.</p>
   <closer>Farewell.
