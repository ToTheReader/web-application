do it for policie (they say) that their Priestes
may be knowen and magnified of men. Did
not the Pharisees vse the same policie, to doe
al their workes and make all their garmentes
both Philacteries vpon their heads, and their
wyde and syde robes and borders, that they
might be more expectable &amp; notorious to the
people? but their wo is threatened aboue al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sinners. To such hypocrites, as being
voyde of all true holines, delite in all outward
shewes, their curse is most inculcate, their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
is that the Priestes shall weare white in
the churches to signifie their vertue, their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes
and holines: and when they go foorth of
the Church they must weare blacke gownes
and blacke hornes for contrarie policies &amp; for
diuers significations. Our master Christes
policie was expressed in one word, fede, feede,
feede: and the Prophetes before, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
afterwarde: if Christe be the wisdome
of the Father, the true Ministers shalbe well

for shame, that they seke Gods glory, Christes
will, or the edification of his Church by their
policie. Whyles they threaten and stoppe the

Antichriste, the most earnest ouerthrowers of

for your pryde towardes your brethren, and
your cowardlines in Goddes cause, that for
