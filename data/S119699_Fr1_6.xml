      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
   </p>
   <p>VVhiche stoute bragge as some of hys likes (I suppose)
myslyked, and manye good catholique men (I knowe) thought yt arrogant: So I
thynking the same, like litle Dauid, not in faith, might, and powre: not in
vertue and syngular fauour of God: but as the least and yongest of my
breatheren, in the house of my ffather, not bearyng thys vyle reproche so
arrogantlie, and shameleslie made against the hoste of God, of a good
zeale hauyng sure trust in my lord God (whose cause for my powre, I
wolde gladlie defende) hanyng some stones gathered together in my
sheperdes bagge, I come in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the name of God against thys
Goliath, and for thys tyme putting thys stone oute of my bagge into my
slyng, I cast yt at hym, whiche, I trust, shall so hytte hym in the
forehead, wher ys the seat of shamefastnesse, yf anye be in the man,
that he shall be ashamed so to reuyle the wholl churche of God agayn. I
saie the wholl Churche, for theise, hys lucyferouse woordes, be not
spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken onelie against soche as were or be of the catholique Churche in
Englō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de: but to the contumelye of all the wholl catholique Churche of
Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, whersoeuer ys or hath ben professed, and taught the
reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of Chrystes blessed bodie and blood
in the holie Sacrament.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="8"/>And for that hys cheif force ys bent agaynst that
Sacrament, whyche ys <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> our comforte, foode, and nutryment to
euerlasting life: I haue also bent my self therin cheiflie to
withstande hym, not medling moche with anye other matter.</p>
   <p>Wherunto yet when I prepared my self, and consydered one of
the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of hys proclamaciō, wher in effect he saieth, that neuer mā
was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as an herytyke, for saynge that the Sacrament was a fygure, a
pledge, a tokē, or a remēbrance of Chrystes bodie: I began to be
abasshed, First at his craft ād subletie vsed in so weightie
matter of faith, wher all symplycitie and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> playn dealing
shoud be vsed. for if he referre theise his woordes to the syxe
hondreth yeares next after Chryst, that in those ther was neuer man
cōdem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ā heretike, that saied that the Sacramēt was a figure, a
pledge, a tokē a remēbrāce. yt ys true. for in all that tyme neuer was ther
heretike that so saied in that sense that this proclamer ād his likes
doo saye yt. wherfor that ys but a craftie toye to bleer the eye of the
hearer to make him beleue that mē in tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se daies were not for so saing
cōdemned, wher in dede none did so saye, and where none did so saie
none coulde be condemned for yt. Moche like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> might a
felō make for hym self in these daies saing that Chryste, in whō
after his resurrectiō, was the fullnesse of auctoritie and power, as he
hym self wittnesseth, dyd neuer cōdemne anye of his Apostles or
dysciples to deathe for felonye. wherfore he being a chrystian man aught
not be condemned for felonye. This argument hath a trueth, for Chryste
cōdemned none of them. for none of them were felons: but yt lacketh force, for
though they not so offending were not condemned: yet thys felon so
offending maye iustly be condemned. Likewise though none with in those
syxe hondreth years, for as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> muche as they so saied not,
were not condemned: yet this proclamer so sainge maye wel be condemned And
here I will ioyn issue with hym that if he can bring one within those
sixe hondereth yeares that saied, as he saieth &amp; was not condemned, I
will subscrybe. Secundly I abasshed at hys impudencye. for if the man be
so impudent as to saie, that neuer man was yet hitherto indged and
condemned for an heretyke, that saied the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a figure in that
sense that he, and hys complyces do take yt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be a figure
withoute the verie presence of the bodie of Christ, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> whereof ys knowen to all the worlde, and therfor not vnknowen
to hym: what shall yt awaill me to buckle with so impudent a man?</p>
   <p>For soche saiers haue ben condēned by eight Coūcells all
readie, as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retykes, and theyr heresie so detested, hated, and abhorred
of all christians, 
<note place="margin">Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned hy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eight
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.</note> that the catholique learned men, yf they had but a
suspicion, of anye that dyd in anie one title swarue from the verytie of
Chrystes bodie in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramēt, they furth with addressed them selues
to their pennes, and with the swoorde of Gods trueth, vanquyshed, and
ouerthrewe yt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/>
   </p>
   <p>Thys (as yt ys thought) moued <hi>Paschasius</hi> towryte in
the matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. for that <hi>Bertramus</hi> had in the tyme of
kyng Charles wrytten therof 
<note place="margin">Paschasi'. Bertramus wrote obs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curclie and
suspiciously of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> suspycyouslie, and yet in
suche sorte, as no mā coulde be certē what he assure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlie ment. Nowe
that the treuth of the matter of the Sacramēt, shoulde not be obscured
with soche doubtfull wryting, <hi>Paschasius</hi> wrotte a booke of the
presence of the verie bodie of Chryst in the Sacrament, in soche
expresse and playn woordes, as the symple man maye preceaue what was the
faith of the Chruche in that tymeof that matter.</p>
   <p>And for that, he was so playn, <hi>Gastius,</hi> one of thys
proclamers faction, ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyng <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> gotten an olde exemplar of that
worke (as yt ys appertynent to the<pb facs="8"/>syncerytie of soche men) he
raced yt, he blotted yt, yea, he cutte oute wholl chapiters of yt. and that
doen (that yt might to the woorlde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that
<hi>Paschasius,</hi> who wrotte so long agone, wrotte yet nothing
against the Sacramentaries) he sett yt furthe, so mutylated, so torn
and so defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to be prynted.</p>
   <p>But to return to speake of thys proclamer, consydering, as I
saied, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tycle wherin he saieth neuer man was condemned for an
heretike, that affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Sacramēte to be a figure, sign &amp;c. I was
so abasshed at hys impude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye, that I was partelye mynded not to haue
ioyned with hym. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
   </p>
   <p>But remembryng that yt was more impudencye to denye Chrystes
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in the Sacrament, whiche ys taught by Chrystes owne woordes
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered by saincte Paule, beleued in the primytiue Churche, so receaued
of holie men, wrytten by an infynyte nombre of learned wryters, confyrmed by
Councells, and embraced and staied vpon, by all chrystyan nacions; I
cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rected my self, sayng that yf I wolde not spare to ioyn with hym in
thys wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked assertyon, moche lesse shoulde I spare to ioyn with
hym in that other.</p>
   <p>Wherfore resumynge my former pourpose, I wyll in thys also
ioyn with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hym. and shewyng from the begynnyng of the
fyrst Aucthour of thys here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie euē vnto thys Proclamer, that they were
all iudged for heretikes, whiche affyrmed and taught that the Sacrament ys a
figure, (as thys Aduersarie and hys complyces do) I shall with all open the
vanytie of hys bragge, wherin he saieth, that the catholique Churche▪
haith not one scrypture, not one do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, &amp;c. for the mayntenance of
their faith.</p>
   <p>For the playn openyng of whiche mattter, yt ys certen, by
testymonye of manie learned mē, that though some dyd so cōfusedlie
wryte in thys matter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that they might be suspected, or
dyd secretlie (as men fearyng the goodnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seof their cause) whisper
in corners, whiche were very fewe: yet amonge all that rightlie beleued in
Chryst, as God and man, <hi>Berengarius</hi> was the fyrst, that dyd openly
wryte and teache, denyeng (as thys proclamer doth) the 
<note place="margin">Berēgarius first openlie impugned the
sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> reall presence of Chrystes bodie and bloode in the
Sacrament.</p>
   <p>Whiche <hi>Berengarius</hi> was about the yeare of our lorde a
thousande ād three score, and So by computacion fyue hondreth yeares agon,
&amp; more, a man, as sundrye wryters testyfie) neither excellent in
learnyng, nor commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
      <note place="margin">Berēgarius neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in learning nor
cōmēda<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble in life. Leo nonus Platina</note> in life: who publyshing thys
doctryne by poure scholers, to whome he gaue stypende for that pourpose,
he spredde yt abroad in corners.</p>
   <p>Whiche when yt came to the knowledge of <hi>Leo</hi> then Pope, a
man (as <hi>Platina</hi> saieth) of syngular sanctymonye, and
holynesse of life: he condemned <hi>Berengarius</hi> in a Councell.</p>
   <p>The woordes of <hi>Platina,</hi> for the certen declaracion of the
matter, I shall not refuse to reporte. Thus he wryteth: <hi>Ad Leonem redeo
virū certè pietate, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia, benignitate, gratia, hospitalitate,
adeô insignem, vt eius Domus peregrinis, &amp;</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
      <hi>pauperibus semper patuerit. Nam cum semel ante fores suas leprosum
pauperem inuenisset, cun{que} prae miscricordia collocari in lecto
suo mādasset, apertis mane foribus à ianitore, nusquā pauper
inuentus est. Christum pauperis nomine, eo loci recubuisse creditum. In
rebus praeterea ad religionem pertinentibus, tanta diligentia. &amp; solertia
vsus est, vt &amp; in Concilio Vercel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensi Berengarium hereseos
autorem damnauerit.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I come agayn to Leo, a man trulie in godlynesse, in
innocēcye, benygnytie, grace, and hospytalytie so notable excellent, that
to straūgers, and poure peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple hys house was allways open. For when vpon
a tyme he fownde a poure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> man, a leapre, lyeng before hys
gate, and through mercye had godlie comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unded hym to be layed in hys bedde,
in the mornyng when the gates were<pb facs="9"/>opened of the porter, the poor
man was in no place fownde. And so yt was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> thought that
Chryste in the maner of a poor man was layed ther.</p>
   <p>Besydes thys in matters apperteynyng to religyon he vsed so
moche dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and wyse cyrcumspection, that in the Councell at
<hi>Vercells</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned 
<note place="margin">Berēgarius condemned in the Coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of
Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, at Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me, ād two other Coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.</note>
      <hi>Berengarius</hi> the
Author of an heresye. Thus farr Platina. This condē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion
notwithstandyng, the wicked man persysted in hys impyetie, wherfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re an
other Councell was holden at Towres, wher by dyuerse learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he was
conuynced, and so abiured hys heresie.</p>
   <p>And in à Councell holden at Rome, wher were cxiij.
Byshops (as <hi>Lanfrācus</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> who then lyued
testyfieth) he recanted also hys heresyes. 
<note place="margin">Berēgarius recanteth and abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</note>
   </p>
   <p>And yet all thys notwistāding, though thys cākre of heresie
semed in the outwarde parte to be cured: yet yt fretted inwardlie, and grewe
to an newe sore, that wher before he had taught that the Sacrament was but
onelye a figure of the bodie of Chryst (as thys proclamer also tracheth)
nowe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gā a newe doctryne, affyrmyng that in the Sacrament was the verye
bodie of Christ: but that ther was also the Substāce of bread, with the
Substāce of the bodie of Chryst. Wherupon ther was an other councell
called vnder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Gregorye the vij, in the whiche the said.
<hi>Berengarius</hi> beyng conuinced, dyd 
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Gregorius.</hi> 7.</note> acknowledge hys
errour, and by expresse woordes recanted the same.</p>
   <p>Not onelie these foure Councells condemned the heresye of
<hi>Berengarius</hi> against the Sacrament but also the learned men that
were in that tyme, pey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them selues to wryte wholl bookes to the
confutacion of the said <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius,</hi> and hys heresies.</p>
   <p>For against hym wrote <hi>Lanfrancus</hi> somtyme

   <p>After all these commeth the famouse heretike Ihon Wycleff oure

      <hi>Luther</hi> and
<hi>Oecolampadius</hi> the newe furbushers and skourers of the same: Ye
perceaue that from time to time, they were euer condemned by Councells as
heretikes, that taught the blessed Sacrament to be but a figure or token of
Christes bodie, and not the bodie yt self: ye haue seen that learned mē
ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue written against them, and with learning beaten them downe, for that
they reputed, esteemed, and iudged them as heretikes, and the enemies of gods

   <p>Maye I not therfore well saie, that this proclamer ys an

manyfest an vntrueth, as to saie in effecte, that neuer man was iudged an
heretike, that denied the presence of Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the Sacrament,
when they were neuer yet otherwise iudged? But to ende this parte of the
matter, this dare I saie (for that I knowe I shall speake yt trulie) that
to this daie ther was neuer man iudged or condemned by any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/>
generall Councell that euer was, to be an heretike that saied, that
Christes bodie ys reallie and substanciallie in the Sacrament. Nowe yf

   <p>To come to this our time, beside the condemnacion of the

<hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon Iohn in the fiuetene chapter saieth, that Chryst ys
corporallie deliuered vnto vs in the Supper. Thus he saieth: We do not denie
that we be spirituallie ioyned vnto Chryst by faith and syncere charitie.
But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that we haue no maner of cōiunctiō with him after the
flesh, that we verilie, denie, and that we saie, ys altogether against
the scriptures. Doth he thinke the power of the mystical benediction to be
vnknowen vnto vs? which whē 
<note place="margin">Chryst dw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elleth in vs corporallie not onlie
spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rituallie The recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in all the Church ys, that Chryst ys
verily, and substā<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiallie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Sacramēt.</note> yt ys doen
in vs, doth yt not also by the communication of Chrystes flesh, make
Chryst corporallie to dwell in vs? And a litle after he saieth: Wherfor yt
ys to be consydered, that not by inward disposition onelie, wihiche ys
vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstand by charitie, Chryst dwelleth in vs: but also by naturall
participaciō, &amp;c. These thinges haue we recited, that what soeuer they
be that shall read thys, they shoulde the more clearly perceaue, that we
defende the doctrine receaued in all the Churche, whiche ys, that in the
supper of our Lorde are verilie and substanciallie present the bodie
and bloode of Chryst. Thus mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the Germans in their Apologie. I
suppose this proclamer will nowe take a better minde with him, and
somwhat contracte and drawe in the large sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of his great bragge, so
vehementlie puffed vppe with a mightie vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouse winde, when he seeth
the learned of Germanie so franklie and plainly publishing their faith,
whiche, though yt be not in euery point sownde, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> auouche
they the contrarie to the doctrine of this proclamer, and encoūter with him in
this chalenge.</p>
   <p>For first they cōfesse the very substāciall presence
of the bodie and blood<pb facs="12"/>of Chryst in the Sacrament. Secondarely
they confirme the same by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of all the
Christian churche, as well the latin, as the greke church, for that in them
both, not nowe onely, but of olde time also, yt hath ben so taught,
receaued, and beleued. Thirdly they alleadge a clere and most plain place
oute of Cyrill, whiche by their iudgement, as yt dothe appeare, doth
manifestly and inuinciblie proue the corporall presence of Chryst in the
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And as yt so doth by their iudgement: so doth yt by the
iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all catholike men, not onelie withstand this prowde Goliath,
But yt plainly ouerthroweth hym. Of the force of whiche sentence, more
shall be saied hereafter. Fourthlie earnestly acknowledging this trueth,
and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling yt to be knowen to all the worlde, they declare that the cause
of their thus writing ys, that all men might knowe, that they do defende the
trueth receaued of all the Churche, which ys (saie they (that the bodie and
blood of Chryst be verilie and substanciallie in the Sacrament.</p>
   <p>This then being a treuth, that ys and hath ben receaued of all the
wholl Church of Chryste, as besides these mens confession, all
catholique people through oute all christendome do acknowlege yt so to be,
I praie thee (good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Reader) what parte doth this mā take to
defende, who with might and main dothe maintein the cōtrarie: And impugneth
that, that the wholl Churche re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaueth, reuileth that, that the whol Church
reuerenceth: blasphemeth that, that the wholl Churche honoureth? and that
so arrogantlie and impudētlie?</p>
   <p>Yt ys pittie that ther ys so moche impudencie, and so moche
arrogancie 
<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamer ys to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied.</note> mixed
with vntrueth in him. I saie pittie for that he ys Gods creature, and in
Baptisme once professed Christes name, in this respecte charitie
moueth me to pittie him, and the more for that he receauing the plentifull
giftes of God, doth so wickedlie to the more encrease of his damnacion
abuse them, and forsaking God and his trueth, becometh enemie to them
bothe, which he well declareth in that with soche violence he impugneth, and
blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them both.</p>
   <p>In this parte and respecte as I cā not ioin with him: so for
my masters cause, and the defence of my Mother the catholique Churche, in
whose house I desire to cōtinewe, I cōtende with him, and contēne him,
yea and hate him, not the substance that God hath created in him, but the
wicked heresie that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the Deuell hath breathed into him, by
which as he ys become enemie to God: so must all the people of God become
enemies to him, as of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet 
<note place="margin">

he) hate them, that hate thee? And am not I greiued with those that ryse
vppe against thee? Yea, I hate them right sore, euen as though they were my
enemies. And yet as I moue my penne against him: So shall I moue my tounge
to praye for him. Possible yt ys that he being in the highest of his
mischief, maye be stry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe as Paule was in the hyghest of his rage

   <p>Saincte Augustine when he walked in heresie, and did most
stowtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempne the catholique professiō of Christes name: yt
pleased God, sodenlie as yt were, to geue him a newe minde, and caused
him to reuerence that, that before he despiced.</p>
   <p>The like happie chaunce I wishe this mā, against whom yf I
haue ben, or in this boke shall seme to be sharpe, let yt be referred to
the euel cause wich the man defendeth, and not the person himself. The
doctrine ys so wicked, so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against Gods holie woord, so
discrepant from the holie Councells, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> dissonant
from the auncient Fathers, so dissenting frō the common consent of
Christian people, so iniuriouse, and contumeliouse to the wholl Churche
<pb facs="12"/>that hath ben from Christ vntill this daie, that yt ys by no
means tollerable. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
   </p>
   <p>Nowe Reader, I trust thowe seist, that as moche as this
iolie Chalenger required, ys nowe perfourmed to him, let him therfor perfourme
his promes<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se, and subscribe to the catholique faith, and confesse
Christes reall presence in the Sacrament. Yf he will yet maliciouslie
persist, and saie; ther ys no scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor doctour, nor Councell
brought furth, that plainly proueth yt, thē we must prouoke to iudges. Yf he
will not beleue the Germanes being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes, not <hi>Erasmus,</hi> who
ys accompted of them an vppright man, not the Catholiques of our owne contrie,
and of other contries, not the Councells, which be alleaged, not Cyrills plain
and manifest sentēce, not the cōmon re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaued faith of the wholl Churche,
as well of that of the olde time, as that, that ys nowe, bothe of the latines,
and of the grekes, not the plain woordes of Christ, who plainlie saith:
<hi>This ys my bodie:</hi> Whiche woordes Erasmus saieth be owre sure and
vmmoueable fundacion: I praie thee, Reader, whome will he beleue besides
himself? Who shal bringe furth that one scripture, doctour, or Councell,
that he will accept, as plainlie prouing the matter? None but he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> himself, or his likes, moche like to the Felon that
pleadeth not giltie, and stoutlie crieth to be tried by God, and the contrie.
And when by verdict of the iurie and sentence of the iudge he ys cōdēned,
he defieth thē all callinge bothe iudge and q̄st false harlotts, ad
saieth, that true mē wolde neuer haue cōdēned him. But the true mē that
he meeneth be soche as heys himself. So<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che true mē they be nowe also,
that this mā wil creditte in this matter, euē so<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che as he ys himself, yf
he doe refuse all these kindes of mē aboue produced.</p>
   <p>But howesoeuer he shall take this, and the rest of my booke
in outwarde countenance, I trust yt shal touche his conscience. And then
(as Chrysostom 
<note place="margin">Smalle con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forte wher conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ys

when the consciences of men perceaue them selues confownded.</p>
   <p>God of his mercie reduce him and all, that be gone astraie, home

before him and all his Angells.</p>

that wher the enemie of Gods trueth, hath in his saied ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mō made his
boast, that he ys sure, that not one sentēce cā be brought by the
catholiq̄s to proue the Articles, ther by him rehersed, amōge the which,
besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de the reall and substāciall presence of Christ in the
Sacramēt, he addeth ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie other thinges apperteininge to the same, which he
ioineth together vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one predicamēt, that ys, that we haue no proof for
them: that he maye be perceaued to be a vain and false man, I will proue yt
by scriptures, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and Councells. And incidentlie diuerse other of
his rehersed matters, to this principal apperteining, Whiche, allthough I
ouerpasse them not in so<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che maner as he doth, onelie to saie, and
nothing to proue or improue thē, as they be of him vttered: yet ye shall
finde thē answered, wher occasion ys ministred to speake of soche
matter.</p>
   <p>And although manie profownde, and excellent learned men, whose
lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chettes of their shoes I am not woorthie to loose, haue woorthlie
written in this matter: yet for that none of them, to my knowledge, hathe after
this ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner proceaded orderlie to expownde the scriptures, that treact of the
Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> whiche methinke to the confutacion of this man ys
necessarie, I will, by the helpe of God, that waie proceade, and not by
mine owne phantasie, but by the verie mindes of the doctours, truely seke
oute the true vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding<pb facs="13"/>of them. And for that these
scriptures be in three sundrie bookes of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Bible, that
ys, in the olde Testament, in the Gospells, and in the epistles: ther 
<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, and ordre of this work.</note> for
the matter beinge lōg, I haue diuided this rude worke into three bookes. In
the first booke are opened soche promisses, figures, and prophecies of
the olde Testament, as appertein to the Sacrament. The seconde booke geueth
yow vnderstanding of the scriptures apperteininge to the same, conteined
in the vj. of sainct Ihon his Gospell, the xxvj of sainct Matthew, and in
the xxiiij. of saincte Luke. The thirde booke expowndeth so moche of the
tenth, and the eleuenth chapiter of the first epistle to the Corinthians,
as toucheth that matter, and also one sentence of the epistle to the
Ephesians, and one other to the Hebrues.</p>
   <p>In this exposition, to the more confutacion of the Aduersaire,
and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macion of the catholique, I, for the most part, bringinge
sundrie, and diuerse doctours vpon euerie text, doe ioin a greke doctour
and a latine together, that the concord and agreement of bothe churches maye
well appeare, and fullie be seen. So haue I also ioined the doctours that
haue written within <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the compasse of these nine hondreth
yeares, to them that haue written befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that yt maie be iudged, whether that
these of the later time doo differ, or dissent from them of the auncient
time in the substanciall poinctes of our faith, as the aduersarie
saieth they doo.</p>
   <p>By which processe, gētle Reader, thow shalt, I trust,
perceaue, that where the arrogante Philistine both blasphemouslie, and
vntruelie hathe said of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tholique Church of the liuing God, that yt
hathe not one scripture, one doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tour, nor one Councell: yt hathe
vndoubredly, as touching the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mēt, and other articles
apperteining to the same, not onelie al the holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures that treact of
that holie mysteric, but also the holie Fathers, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, that
speake of the same, both Grekes and latines, and them aswel of the
auncient time before a thousand yeares, as thē, that were of the later time,
within the cōpasse of a thousand yeares. So that the scriptures being
thus ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plained by the common consent of so manie doctours, and all the
same also conspiring vpon this one trueth (as yt shall be perceaued,
not by a vain brag<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge, withoute proofe, but by euident and plain testimonie)
we maic as truelie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> as boldlie, returning his bragge into his

maintenance of their heresie against the presence of Christ in the

Coūcel to make for thē. Which thīge, I dare saie, the indifferēt Rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der,
