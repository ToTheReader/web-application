   <head>The Translator to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader (for so I hope to finde thee) so nefande and execrable, I confesse, haue beene the practises of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> in this exorbitant age of the world, as late barbarous attempts at home, &amp; a later bloudy deed abroad can well testifie: that no man I thinke hath a toung so Satirically invectiue, that hee can any waye make the bitternes of his speech correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the cruelty of their actions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these Apologues long since fitted to their follies, in comparison with it, may seeme vnto thee like <hi>Domitions</hi> pricking of flies, in regard of managing the astaires of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: yet good vse may be made of them in these our dayes. For as in former time among the Romans (who were neuer almost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warres) there were <hi>Ludi Circences,</hi> and <hi>Naumachiae,</hi> plaies as they accounted them,
<pb facs="3"/>
but in nature consonant to their present im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; for they did both yeeld recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the present, and also excercise them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any future ocasion; so in these our daies of warfare against the trecheries of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, after thy wiriting against their errors, or reading of graue controuersies, or at least more serious consideration of their irreligious practices against vs; these Apologues may serue vnto thee as a recreation, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they wil afford thee a manifest declaration of some of their sortish superstitions, &amp; good arguments against them: for vnder a fabulous <hi>superficies,</hi> thou shalt find true substance, and in a seeming tale manifesteth truth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>Virgil</hi> on a time hauing some of old <hi>Ennius</hi> his workes in his hands, said to one asking him what hee did, <hi>Ex Ennis stercoro aurum colligo:</hi> so maist thou, reading in this booke answeare any demaunding what thou dost, that thou gatherest gold out of the dust of Apologues. But (that I may come to my selfe) if the plainenes of the translation bee not pleasing to curious eares, I Apologize for my selfe two waies; first, that mine Author shall excuse mee, whom I so followed as one intending to translate, and not to make a new. Secondly, (wherein also I excuse mine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor)
<pb facs="3"/>
that the forme of the Apologues is such, namely, a relation of Dialogues, where <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam</hi> and <hi>inquit</hi> is oft inferred, that it could not bee otherwise. Yet as gold is not to bee refused, because it is digged out of the earth, nor pearles, because they are found in the sands: so I hope these witty conceites, will not bee distastfull to any, although they bee not related in curious tearmes; and that I shall not deserue dispraise in immitating him in words, of whom I borrowed the subiect of my speech. And so committing my selfe &amp; my translation to thy censure, I commit thee and my selfe to him that will censure vs both: wishing thee as thou likest this first booke, so to expect more of me hereafter.</p>
