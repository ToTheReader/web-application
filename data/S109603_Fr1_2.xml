   <head>❧ The Coblers Epistle, to the Gentlemen Readers.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Hall a Hall (Gentlemen) roome for a Cobler, here comes the quaintest squire in all Kent; The Cobler of <hi>Caunterburie,</hi> armde with his Aul, his Lingel, and his Last, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents himselfe a Iudiciall Censor of other mens writinges: but mee thinkes, for my saucinesse, I heare <hi>Apelles</hi> boy crying, <hi>Ne sutor vltra crepidam.</hi> If I doe see his Maister mend the fault in the legge, Ile abide his frumpes, and when hee hath done, Ile say this had not been corrected but for the Cobler. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not many a Tinker a tall Pratler? &amp; haue not men of my Trade waded so deepe in the secretes of Theology, that they haue sought to correct <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat?</hi> &amp; then by your leaue gentlemen, may not the Cobler of Kent who hath been the Patron of many good companions, and tost ouer a paire of cards at
<pb facs="3"/> Trumpe from morning till night, not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so farre as to finde fault with <hi>Richard Tarltons news out of Purgatorie?</hi> Yes, &amp; if he that writ it wil not amend the latchet, Ile on with my night-cap and my spectacles, and make him shape the leg righter ere I haue done. I confesse tis a booke, and so is the Colliers Iade of Croyden a Horse as well as the Courtiers Courser: yet by my faith it hath a faire Title: but if <hi>Diogenes</hi> saw it, hee would cry out as hee did against <hi>Minda,</hi> stop your Citty that it runne not out of the gates; and inferre a like Inuectiue against the Booke, for that the Title conteines more then the whole Pamphlet: but yet in faith there is pretty stuffe in it, but vnworthy Dicke Tarltons humour: some where too low for Iestes, somewhere too hie for stile, If I distinguish like a Scholler, Gentlemen, thinke that I was borne when the Popes butterflies were abroad, and it may be, some Friar was my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the rather I gesse it, for that nature hath wrought that vpon my crowne, that he had on his by Art: for before I was twenty, I had a bald pate. Well howsoeuer, I haue found fault, and therefore haue I attempted to amende it, not in the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of his worke, but in setting out one more pleasant, and more full of delightfull tales for all mens humours: except those which are so humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that they count nothing gracious, but that is too graue. What? a Dogge hath a day: <hi>Semel in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no ridet Apollo.</hi> Longer liues a merry man then a sad; a Cobler hath lesse cares then a King: and an
<pb facs="3"/> hower past in honest myrth, is worth a tunne full of melancholy. Why were Tauernes inuented, but to ripen mens wits? And why were tales deuised, but to make men pleasant? Tush when <hi>Redde ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi> comes, I feare me there will be lesse account to be giuen for honest recreation, then either for the enuious practises that solemne Saturnistes rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: or for the sundry schismes the melancholy michers doe publish. If my Principles bee false, let no man take exceptions, but passe it ouer with a smile: for tis but Coblers Philosophie. But I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, and therefore to my booke, wherein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the tales that were tolde in the Barge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Billinsgate and Grauesend: Imitating here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in old Father Chaucer, who with the like Methode set out his Caunterbury tales: but as there must be admitted no compare between a cup of Darby ale, and a dish of durty water: So syr Ieffrey Chaucer is so hie aboue my reach, that I take <hi>Noli altum sapere,</hi> for a warning, and onely looke at him with honour and reuerence. Here is a gallimaufre of all sorts, the Gentlemen may finde <hi>Salem,</hi> to sauour their eares with Iestes: and Clownes plaine dunstable dogrell to make them laugh, while their leather buttons flie off. When the Farmer is set in his Chaire turning (in a winters euening) the crabbe in the fier, heere may hee heare how his sonne can reade, and when he hath done laugh while his belly akes. The olde wiues that wedded themselues to the profound histories of Robin hood, Clim of the
<pb facs="4"/> Clough, and worthy syr Isenbras: may here learne a tale to tell amongst their Gossippes. Thus haue I sought to feed all mens Fancies: which if I doe, was it not well done of a Cobler? If I offend, and they think there is in it neither rime, nor reason, why? a Cobler did it, and theres an end.</p>
