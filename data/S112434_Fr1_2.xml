   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, whereas
heretofore my slender wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
published to the world,
and my Sermons in that Royall Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
have been in part <hi>polemical,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
with some controversies of
these times; it pleased God this last
year so to inflict upon me that tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
paine which is incident to students,
and doth commonly accompany a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary
life, that I did interpret is as
an Angel sent from God to put me in
minde of my mortality. Whereupon I
resolved to divert my course from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to devotion, from controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
to conscience, and from henceforth
to labour to worke in my selfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="3"/>
true mortification, and sanctified
affections; and accordingly to temper
both my study and my stile.</p>
   <p>Wherfore, being called by my ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
course of attendance to preach in
that eminent place; first of all, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
what sins are likely to be found
in Princes Courts. And among sundry
other, two especially did offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to my cogitation; carnall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence,
and politick Practices. For,
where there is pomp in apparell, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
in diet, and beautifull obiects, all
concurring many times with idlenesse
and ease▪ there a man walketh in the
midst of snares, and is in danger to be
set in combustion with the fiery darts
of the Divell. Againe, Kings houses
being not onely places of pleasure, but
also ever-flowing fountaines of profit
and preferment: no marvaile if nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wits doe there set themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke,
to attaine their owne endes, and
politickly to supplant all those that
<pb facs="3"/>
stand in their way, or hinder their
proiects. For, that they doe so, will be
evident, as I suppose, by the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of all Kingdomes and Countries.</p>
   <p>Now, though the English Court,
guided by so godly and gracious a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne,
bee of all other most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable
for learned preaching, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
prayers, and angelicall lauding
and praising of God with spirituall
Hymns, and ravishing straines of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious
musick: though it be beautified
and adorned with a most worthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of sage Senatours, Nobles and
Gentlemen: Yet I dare not altogether
exempt it from such sinnes as have
alwaies beene incident, more or lesse,
to the Palaces of Princes. Therefore
in the second place, I sought such a
Text as might lead mee by the hand to
reproove those vices: and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
I laid hould upon the story of
King <hi>David.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But though <hi>David</hi> were a King,
<pb facs="4"/>
yet I did not therefore single him out
because hee was a King: neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
I, preaching before a King, to
take occasion by King <hi>David</hi> to glanse
in any wise at the sacred persons of
Princes: God forbid. For our King
(God be thanked) though in the highest
pitch of worldly prosperitie, is for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
another <hi>Ioseph.</hi> And though hee
be for wisedome like an Angel of God,
and can dive into the depth of humane
policies: yet hee loveth and practiseth
sincerity in all his dealings; like to
<hi>Nathanael</hi> the true Israelite, in whō
was no guile. But, I proposed <hi>David,</hi>
as a generall glasse of humane frailty,
wherein all men may behold their own
imbecillity.</p>
   <p>Neither had I any purpose when I
preached these Sermons to publish them
to the world: but it pleased the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
to vouchsafe a blessing beyond
expectation. For hee that caused the
hearts of the Disciples to burne within<note place="margin">Luk. 24 32</note>
      <pb facs="4"/>
them while hee opened the Scriptures
unto thē as they went to Emmaus, did
in the riches of his mercy kindle some
such sparkles in the hearts of my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
Which I perceiving by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of those which desired copies,
did at last yeeld to let them passe to the
Presse; being mindfull of that of the
Apostle,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10</note>
      <hi>As wee have oportunity
let us doe good to all men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to those who are of the
household of faith.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Moreover: wheras thou, gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
hast long expected my booke of the
cōsecratiō of Bishops, which by cōmand
of authoritie was to bee translated into
Latin; I certifie thee, that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
finished the translation; and, by
occasion of the opposition of my many
Antagonists who have written against
mee, much inlarged the Worke, and
prepared it for the Presse, under this
title; <hi>De ministerio Anglicano.</hi>
But, the childe being brought to the
<pb facs="5"/>
birth, as yet there wanteth strength to
be delivered. Yet I hope, that our good
God in his due time will give it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
issue. In the meane while, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
these my poore labours, and giue
them leave to worke upon thine affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And so I commend both thee &amp;
them to the blessing of God.</p>

      <signed>Thine in the Lord,
