   <p>YOV are to haue the booke called <hi>Posselij Colloquia,</hi> and to conferre this booke therewith. And in this booke you shall see euery <hi>Latine</hi> word therof englished, and also the <hi>Latine</hi> words thereof so taken (or placed) one after another, as they are to be construed or englished. And you may at the first by helpe of this construing booke learne to english so many <hi>Latine</hi> words, as doe in <hi>Posselius</hi> reach to a full point. And then looking only on <hi>Posselius</hi> to endeauour to construe them according as this booke hath them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, and so to learne to construe all <hi>Posselius.</hi> In the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part whereof there are more <hi>Latine</hi> words than one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued togither; because some of the words there, are in the forepart of the booke with their english next after them; which you remembring, you will be able to discerne which
<pb n="73" facs="34"/>
words of the English are the English of such words, as you haue not read afore: and so notwithstanding you will know how to apply each <hi>English</hi> word unto each <hi>Latine</hi> word, and be able to english euery <hi>Latine</hi> word thereof seuerally. And hereby also you will bee exercised how for to vndetstand Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, whose translation is not word for word, as it is in the <hi>Latine.</hi> Vnto the true pronouncing of the words of <hi>Posselius,</hi> you are to remember that such syllables, as haue the note o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them, are to be vttered short: and such as haue the note are to be vttered long. Also a words last syllable sauing one, ending in a vowell, is short, if the next namely the last sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doth begin with a vowell: as <hi>familiarìum</hi> not <hi>familiaríum.</hi> But if a words last syllable sauing one doth end in a conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the last syllable thereof doth begin with a conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, then is the last syllable sauing one, long: as <hi>libéllus</hi> not <hi>libèllus.</hi> And remembring to obserue these rules in reading, you will rightly pronounce euen euery word of the booke. When as you are able to english readily any word or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Posselius,</hi> according as this construing booke shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, not looking then on this booke, you will bee able with helpe of an English Bible for to construe much in the Latine Bible of <hi>Ieromes</hi> translation. And therein you are first to learne to construe Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell and epistles, and then to reade all the rest of the new Testament, beginning where you will. And then to exercise in the old Testament, and to reade it through, and you being able readily to english all the latine Bible; you will be able then to english most Latine in most bookes at the first sight. But as you reade along in the new Testament or old, it is profitable for you to learne sometimes betweene while for to construe in the authorised Latine grammar, so much as the construing booke thereof hath construed to your hand; and also <hi>Figura</hi> of that gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, according as it is construed by M. <hi>Stockwood.</hi> And then</p>
