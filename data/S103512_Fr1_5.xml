   <head>THE PREFACE Vpon the Letters of <hi>Mounsieur de</hi> BALZAC: <hi>By Mounsieur de la</hi> Motte Aigron.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubt not, but among those who shall see these Works; some there are who will esteeme them worthy a more aduantagious Title then that of <hi>Letters,</hi> as well in regard of the greatnesse of those things therein frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, as in respect of the exactnesse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wherewith they seeme to haue beene composed: Butas I willingly excuse those, who with vnapt complements imagine they haue composed a good Letter; nor doe any more blame such as there in neuer digresse from their perticular affaires, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o must I likewise acknowledge, that such writings as these, hauidg not beene made with any intention to bee put in Print, the World might well haue passed
<pb facs="7"/>
without them: And that it is only allowed to the <hi>Germans</hi> to giue account to the age they liue in, and to posteritie forsooth, concerning the affaires and fortunes of their particular families, and of the silly acts of their Colleagues. Truely it is an errour to beleeue, that graue and solemne subiects are to bee banished out of all Letters, or that euen eloquence ought but slackly therein to appeare; and that the Maiestie of both these is only reserued for Pulpits and Panegyrick Orations; as though valour neuer appeared saue onely in pitcht Battells; and that in single Combats it were lawfull to run away, or that vertue therein were vtterly vnusefull, because it hath fewer witnesses, neither is so fully regarded: But besides that, wee are no longer in those times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the State gouernment was publiquely question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where the Oratours forced the Lieutenants ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of armies to render accompt of their seuerall charges, and that consequently, there is no more any meanes remaining to become eloquent in that kind: Yet are there reasons, whereby w̄ee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the merit of Letters to bee of no lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard then that of Orations. Howbeit, if there bee any necessitie to find some difference betweene these; this at least can neither be in regard of the dignitie of the Subiects, the force of Reasons, the gracefullnesse of Discourses, nor in the sublimitie of Conceits. To speake trueth, when I consider the Orations yet remaining among the ruines of former ages, some where of were publikely pronounced, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers onely penned; I am so farre from admiring
<pb facs="7"/>
any aduantage they haue ouer those Letters now extant among vs, both of the same Authors and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as I doe not so much as wonder at all, how the first hauing beene armed with discourse and voice, together with the gesture and motion of the body, haue produced such prodigious effects as wee all know, and haue so often, as it were by maine force, extorted the consents of all hearers; yet the second, though they had not the like arms and allurements, haue notwithstanding not beene any way <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>icient. Those smooth Exordiums whereby they prepare, and put themselues by easie accesses, as it were into possession of the Readers, those straites and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages whereby they conduct the spirits of men from pleasant to painefull, and from grieuous, to graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obiects, to the end, that hauing in a maner sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and cast them out of their former stations, they may afterwards force them to fall on what side they please. Surely all these aduantages are so peculiar to Orations, as I ingeniously confesse, Letters doe not so much as know what they meane. In these, we enter at the first dash vpon the matter, nor doe wee scarse at any time, quit the same; the reasons goe altogether alone without assistance, and all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament allowed them, is onely freedome of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the fecunditie of language, and that they passe not promiscuously. But as concerning the Subiects, they are common to both kinds of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and it is an errour to imagine, there are some so particular to the one, that the other cannot touch vpon the same withont iniurie thereunto. Vpon the
<pb facs="8"/>
matter, Panegyrick discourses, Apologies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fultations, Iudgements vpon morall actions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad opinions and censures vpon occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, of those which please, and those wee ought to detest, yea euen indifferent accidents▪ briefely what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer may fall into discourse, and vnder reason, are the obiects of Letters: So wee see, the greatest and most important misteries of our religion haue been left vnto vs in Letters. All the wisedome of the <hi>Pagan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> contained in those of <hi>Seneca,</hi> and wee owe to those <hi>Cicero</hi> wrot to his friends, the knowledge of the secrets, and certaine inducements which caused the greatest reuolutions the world hath euer known, to witt the shaking and subuersion of the <hi>Romane Reipublike,</hi> wee are therefore to confesse Oratoricall Treatises to haue no other subiect then Letters; and that if there bee any difference, it is none other then what is obserued betweene our ancient Seas, and those not discouered vnto vs till in our fathers times. The latter are no lesse deepe then the other, they are capable of the like shipping; their ebbes, and floods are neither more iust, nor lesse vncertaine; and all the difference discouered betweene them is onely this, that the windes tosse not those in like fort as it doth ours, and in that they are seldome or neuer subiect either to stormes, or tempests. In like manner it being within the power and capacitie of Letters to treate of the same things, how much more emenent and excellent soeuer one may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them to be then any other kind of writings, yet doe they not indeede receiue those extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="8"/>
motions which appeare in Orations, since neither the like high of excesse, nor the same Enthusias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes or Raptures are herein found; In a word, it is a more middle beauty, and a more calme elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. And surely, if the subiect wee make vse of be as illustrious as the person before whom wee are to handle it, were it not as much as to abuse both the one and the other, to come short in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions: Since the action ought neither to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, nor generall, if you intend to performe it negligently, and not to allow it all the ornaments whereof it is capable. And who can doubt that <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> being to make an Oration before <hi>Caesar,</hi> after the change of the Common-wealth, had not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apprehension, and prepared not himselfe with more studious care, then if he had onely spoken to that beast with an hundred heads, hee had so often led after his owne Phantasie, and whereof hee was in so full possession so long before, as to cause them to take the part best pleasing vnto him. In these last occasions, and in the presence of this man alone, he know with whom he had to doe: Now had he beene timerous, or fearefull to faile before his Master, yet impute not this apprehension of his to proceede ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of consideration hee had of his greatnesse, nor from the reflection vpon those things hee came to accomplish: But it was in that he considered him as a man no lesse versed in the art of well-speaking then himselfe, and who had heretofore contributed to the study of this science, so many rare gifts of spirit, and so many faire indowments of nature,
<pb facs="9"/>
that had he not afterward esteemed it more noble to conquer men by armes, then to conuince them by arguments, and if of the two most excellent exercises of this life, his fortune and the famous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his courage, had not caused him to make choyce of the former, hee might easily haue dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the glory of the latter with him. Or were it so that this excellent Oratour might at this day returne into the world, and were personally, or by his Penne to discourse with those two great Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls to whom the most part of these Letters are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest▪ is it not probable, comming to know them as wee doe, that he would imploy, and contribute a a more exact study and solicitude, then when hee was onely to please a multitude of ignorant <hi>Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and to speake to all that rable of ancient <hi>Rome.</hi> Wee shall yet againe bee amazed at the perfection of these Letters, some whereof are written to the King, and appointed to bee read (as in trueth they were) with admiration in full counsell, and a great part of the rest addressed to the most eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of our age. To speake trueth wee may iustly say, this is the first time any thing of perfection hath appeared in our language; so that if of all our ancient eloquence there bee ought worthy of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme in any equalitie with this, it may bee that with much labour you shall produce some one Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: For of all such who haue hitherto written wee may affirme, that the most fortunate among them, when they made choyce of subiects able to subsist of themselues, haue not beene absolutely condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb facs="9"/>
and that amidst their writings, the soliditie of learning, and the sauagenesse of language <hi>(to wit)</hi> the good and euill did equally appeare. But when at any time they fell vpon subiects where elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence onely swayed the Scepter, there truly it was where fortune forsooke them, and where the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their proper forces was manifestly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, if they were not some way assisted by strange tongues. Some of them (to say the trueth) haue doubted what way they were to take, and haue stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to shew it to others, though themselues were not in it. In a word, the greatest glory those gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned who haue written with most perfection and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, is only that which nature hath reserued for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to which sex eminent actions being denied, it seemeth they performe sufficient if they abstaine from euill doing. But to say that any hath ioyned Art to aboundance, and mingled mildnesse with Maiestie, or hath raised his stile without either loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himselfe, or straying from his subiect, that is it which in trueth we could not see till this present. And questionlesse these braue and generous formes of discourse, and those great and strange concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherewith these Letters are so curiously limed, and so plentifully grac'd, haue beene very slenderlie known in proceeding ages: This very order, and this number, whereof euery tongue is not capable, and wherein ours owes nothing to the Latine, and which appeares in all his words, though diuersely, and as their gender requires, do right haply appeare in this place, though the most part of writers before him
<pb facs="10"/>
haue esteemed these perfections of small impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; yet notwithstanding, without the helpe of these two great secrets, neither ornaments of Art, nor graces of Nature, can bee but in part pleasing; nor can all the reasons the World can alledge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade a Very woman resoluing to resist: And to speake seriously, they are no lesse necessary among excellent discourses, and conceits, then discipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Souldiers, without which, courage is of no effect, and valour most cōmonly proueth vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As for me who haue knowne the Author from both our infancies, and who better then all others, can depose in what fashion he effecteth his labours; besides, knowing the great aduantage hee hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all those who write at this day: I haue euer thought, that if any were able to raise our Language to the merit and reputation of such Eloquence, wherewith the Ancients were adorned, it should bee to him alone to whom our age oweth this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Nor doe I doubt, but the comparison comming in question at this present, betweene these his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and those of others; the difference will bee easily discouered, assuring my selfe, that all spirits will dispose themselues to be ranged herein to mine opinion, and voluntarily to giue way thereunto. As for my selfe, who read the Ancients with all respect due vnto them, and the Moderns without any preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate opinion, doe notwithstanding confesse, that all I can conceiue in others is so farre short of the merit of these Letters, that abstracting from the passion I am possessed with, both for them, and their
<pb facs="10"/>
Authour, hardly could I dispose my selfe to frame this Preface for them. And who is there will make any difficultie to giue them their due? Since hee whose very faults haue beene esteemed so faire, that they caused a Sect during his life, which yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues after his death; hauing (at Meats) seene certaine discourses this Author composed in those miserable times, and which stood in need of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther age to be gratefully regarded, was astonished at his beginnings, confessing it was with vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that the onely thing hee supposed to possesse by the generall consent of all, was rauished from him by one who as yet had liued but twenty yeeres. But surely, it was in this straine of writing which in that it is not restrayned within so strict limits as that of Letters, is capable of all the motions, and ornaments of Art; and of the same sort as was the other discourse he addresseth to the Pope who now is, vpon the like subiect, as that of Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> to <hi>Eugenius:</hi> And as God neuer chose among men any so accomplished with all perfections, as this person to command all others, so can I not conceiue any thing either more great, or extraordinary, then what appeareth in this worke, nor more sutable to the excellencie of the subiect, and to the Maiestie of him to whom he dedicated his discourse: But if (to returne to the particulars of these Letters) it were necessary for the deliuering an vnpartiall iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to consider those of the Ancients, I should seeme more respectfull then were requisite, if (put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them all together) I should vndertake to make
<pb facs="11"/>
them so much as enter into comparison with these; excepting onely those of <hi>Seneca,</hi> yea euen in those (which in trueth come not nere these) there is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite abundance of matter as can hardly bee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and since all things therein appeare so confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, that it seemes they were therein couched without choice, and to say trueth, as itwere at aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, some who will yet further tax his stile will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily say, they are rather matters then Workes. But for my part, if there bee any defects therein, I hold they ought well to be borne with, in regard of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rarities therein concurring; and when wee haue said all, what appearance is there to vnderualew any thing we receiue from a man who was worth seuen Millions of Gold? And who once in his life had the heart, and ambition to aspire to the Empire of the whole world? Let vs therefore esteeme all wee receiue from him, and from those times, yet suffer vs to commend our owne, wherein this science which medleth with the commanding of spirits, and which was but formerly in it's infancy, is now found to be in his full maturitie, and as it were of ripe yeeres. If therefore you acknowledge any obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due (as in trueth there is) to these excellent Letters, you shall in short time see so solid, and iust a iudgment proceed from this Author, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it selfe produceth not any more able; and his solitarines will be so satisfactorie vnto you, that you will make no more difference then I do, to prefer the fame before the magnificence of Princely Courts, and the Pompe of most statelyest Cities.</p>
