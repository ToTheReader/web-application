concerning this litle booke, as namely, first why I haue published it, considering the great number of bookes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the same, or verie like argument, extant in these dayes. Secondly, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue dedicated it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto you, then to anie other. For the first, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test before God, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the secrets of all hearts, I haue not published it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for vainglory, lucre, or

for the second, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered with myselfe, howe much b und I haue alwaies beene to your worship, euer since the time that I was first acquainted with you, for your good opinion you haue euer cōceiued of me, &amp; sundrie other your courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies shewed towards me, far beyond my deserts or expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: As also when I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to remembrance your feruent zeale <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

haue euer borne to the word of God, &amp; holy religion, your exquisite knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, your carefull indeuour to put the same in practise, and to frame your life therafter.

wherewith God hath beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified &amp; adorned your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship aboue manie others, I say, when I remembred these things, with many mo, I could do no lesse (hauing so fit an occasion giuen me, by reason of my friends im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunacie) then to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate these my labors to your worship, though not as a guerdon answerable to your deserts, yet as an infallible testimonie, pledge and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
