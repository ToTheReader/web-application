   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hinking of amends

for those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Favours You
have shown me, I could pitch on
no other more fit than this my
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Genius prompted</hi> me, it was well
thought on, if Yours give it the
like acceptance I am happy: for
<hi>Workes</hi> of this Nature, I dare
affirme, have beene acceptable
to most men, contemn'd by
few, unlesse it bee those of the
more <hi>Stoicall</hi> disposition, whose
rigid <hi>Fronts</hi> cry downe all things,
but what themselves approve
of. For this <hi>Worke</hi> of it selfe, I
may say thus much without
blushing, it received the rights
of a good Play, when it was
Acted, which were Applauses &amp;
Commendations, whether it
merited them or not, I leave to
your Judgement: the Nature of
the <hi>Worke,</hi> being <hi>History;</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
<pb facs="3"/>
of many parts, not walking
in one direct path, of <hi>Comedy,</hi> or
<hi>Tragedy,</hi> but having a larger field
to trace, which me thinks should
yeeld more pleasure to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Variety</hi> being
the only Objects these our <hi>Times</hi>
are taken with: the <hi>Tragedy</hi> may
be too dull and solid, the <hi>Comedy</hi>
too sharpe and bitter; but a well
mixt portion of either, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
would make the sweetest
<hi>harmony.</hi> But this <hi>Worke</hi> as it is,
and my wishes that all defects in
it, to my desires, and your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
were supplide, I commend
to your perusall, my selfe, it, and
resting, to bee commanded by
you in all friendly Offices,</p>
