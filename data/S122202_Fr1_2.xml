NOBLE AND
Religious Lady, the Lady
MARIE VERE, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of ioy and peace
in Beleeuing.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>MADAM,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was most
truely said by
the Apostle of
the Gentiles:
<hi>godlines is great
gaine;</hi> Importing thereby,
<pb facs="3"/>
that if man would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to the care to get any
thing, for the profit might
come thereby, it should be
godlinesse: No skill in the
world being c̄oparable to
that skill of being able to
leade a godly life, for the
sure, and speedy, &amp; match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
gain it will bring vnto
a man: for besides that it
onely hath the promise of
a better life, godlinesse
were to bee desired, and
with all possible diligence
to bee sought after, for the
very gaine of it in this life:
For to omit the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the fauor it breeds
with God, &amp; the vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="3"/>
treasures of the grace
of Christ, which alwayes
go with it, it were to bee
desired for the immediate
effects it workes vpon men
in it selfe. For if men loue
themselues, what should
they desire more then that
which tends to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
perfect? What
should it aduantage a man
to haue all things good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, if himselfe
bee ill and vile? If men,
that were onely guided by
the light of Nature, could
(some of them) see cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that nothing was so
good for a man as to liue
well (when yet they knew
<pb facs="4"/>
no other liuing well, then
what was prescribed in
their naked and naturall
Ethickes) then how much
more happy must it be for
a man to liue a religious
life, by which he is brought
more neerer to God, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and farre aboue the
condition of any naturall
man? Yea, if there were
no more to bee had by it,
but the peace and rest it
brings vnto a mans heart,
it were aboue all outward
things to bee desired: for
no man walkes safely, that
walkes not religiously, nor
can any actions of men
produce any sound tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
<pb facs="4"/>
and rest of heart,
but such actions as are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by true Religion.
What shall I say? If for
none of these, yet for it self
were a godly life to be had
in singular request: for if
men, with much expence
of outward things, seeke
but the skill of diuers, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
and artificiall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and thinke it worth
their cost but to bee able
to attaine these Skils? how
much more ought man to
be at the paines, yea and
cost too (if it were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
to get this admirable
skill to liue a religious life?
This most gainefull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
<pb facs="5"/>
is intreated of in this
little Volume; I may true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, that almost euery
sentence in this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
leads vs to much and
rich treasure, if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
belonging to each
duty were annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
and therefore no
Christian that loues his
owne soule, should thinke
much of the paines of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or practising these
Rules.</p>
   <p>I shall not need to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
your Ladiship to the
hearty care of those things
you haue beene taught of
God (long since) to profit,
and haue learned Iesus
<pb facs="5"/>
Christ as the truth is in
him: your sincere profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and practice hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Witnesses: and since
you beleeued the Gospell
of saluation, and were
sealed by the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
you haue a Witnesse
within your selfe, which
will not faile in life or
death to pleade your
aboundant consolation.
When I entreat of piety,
righteousnesse, mercy and
temperance, I entreate of
things you haue aboue
many profited in.</p>
   <p>I haue presumed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
these Directions to
your Ladiship, and not
<pb facs="6"/>
without reason: you haue
heard the preaching of
them with speciall atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and haue beene a
principall perswader to
haue them published for
the common good, being
many wayes bound to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
your Ladiship
amongst my best Hearers
and Friends. I cannot but
beseech your Ladiship to
accept of this small testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of my vnfeigned
obseruance of your many
prayses in the Gospel, and
as a pledge of my thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
for all your workes
of loue to me and mine.
The God of glory, and
<pb facs="6"/>
Father of our Lord Iesus
Christ, make you abound
yet more and more, in all
the riches of his grace in
this life, and fill you with
the comforts of the blessed
hope of the appearing of
Iesus Christ.</p>
