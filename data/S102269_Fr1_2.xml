   <head>THE PRINTER to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLE READER, Albeit the Authour of this Worke designed the same to be printed, and published togeather with his <hi>Supplement</hi> to Fa. <hi>Persons his Discussion of M. Barlowes Answere &amp;c.</hi> by reason of the relation that the one hath to the other (in which respect also this is intituled an <hi>Adioynder</hi>:) neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles for as much as afterwards, when this came to my hands, I vnderstood that <hi>M. Barlowes</hi> credit was already quyte crushed with the <hi>Disscussion</hi> of <hi>Fa. Persons,</hi> and euery where so decried, that most men were fully satisfyed, concerning his ignorance, absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
<pb facs="3"/>
and folly, and therefore might be more desirous to see this <hi>Adioynder</hi> in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of <hi>M. Doctour Andrews</hi> (as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his farre greater reputation, as for that he hath not yet byn answered by any in our tongue:) And considering also that this <hi>Adioynder</hi> is growne to a farre greater volume, then the Author at the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and that therefore many may desyre to haue it a part, both for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cōmodity of carryage, and also for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good respects; yea, and that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration thereof from the <hi>Supplement</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder, but that such as desyre to haue them both, may easely be satisfyed, and cause them to be bound eyther togeather, or a sunder, as they shall best lyke; I ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore resolued, with the good leaue of the Authour, to print, &amp; publish them both in seuerall volumes.</p>
   <p>For although this <hi>Adioynder,</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a great connexion with the <hi>Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and in some sort dependeth thereon, (as being written only to iustifie the same, and specially concerning matters incident thereto:) yet the points treated therein
<pb facs="3"/>
are so clearly handled, and discussed, that the truth of the Catholyke cause, and <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> his notable fraudes, and cauils, may sufficiently appeare thereby, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of the <hi>Supplement,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the frequent references thereto.</p>
   <p>I shall not need to say any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the intention, and drift of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, for that the same may fully be seene, partly by the titles of the Chapters which follow immediatly, and partly in the 3. first paragraphs of the first Chapter, and therefore all that I thinke good to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise thee, <hi>good Reader,</hi> is, that albeit this Authour hath not had eyther the occasion, or the intention to answere all <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> his Booke (but such points only, as are some way incidēt to the foresaid <hi>Supplement</hi>) neuertheles this <hi>Adioynder</hi> may serue for a sufficient answere to the whole, seeing it conteineth a confutation of at least an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Positions, Assertions, Paradoxes, Answeres, and Obiections of <hi>M. Andrewes</hi>; in all which he is proued to be eyther most Idle, and Impertinent, or egregiously fraudulent, and false, or els to argue dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
<pb facs="4"/>
for the Catholikes, against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doctrine of his owne fellows, whereby thou maist easily iudge of the rest of his Worke, and what a number of like frauds, and follies might be discouered therin, if the whole were as throughlie sifted, and examined as these points haue bene, which haue occurred to this Authour by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of his <hi>Supplement.</hi> And so vvishing thee aboundance of Gods grace for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery of Falshood, and knovvledge of the Truth, to the euerlasting good of thy ovvne soule, I take my leaue.</p>
