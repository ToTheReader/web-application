   <head>THE PRINTER to the Reader.</head>

      <p>This Letter following I haue taken leaue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, for your benefit and mine owne.</p>

   <p>I haue read your Booke, and learned by it, and shall doe, as oft as I reade it. The Author you tell mee is a Bishop, and by the Epistle I vnderstand it, meant to the King in stead of a piece of Plate, which other Bishops both giue and receiue, or
<pb facs="7"/> a New-yeares Gift. A custome (you tell me) of a long time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsed by his Predecessors. Wherein perchance some consideration was had by those, who at first begg'd away the lands from his Bishopricke; namely, after they had destroyed the Myne, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the Bishop from giuing the Plate. But what though his Church bee too poore to giue a Cup, is it therefore too poore to receiue one?</p>
   <p>The custome and reason of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Cups, are doubtlesse very ancient: For the good old Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, when they drunke to their absent friends, made a short prayer withall for their healths; To put them therefore in minde of praying for them, would men sometimes send a Cup: which part of the fashion continues still with vs. And herein may his
<pb facs="8"/> Maiestie obserue a Scholasticall Decorum, kept with those New-yeares Gifts of the other Bishops also. For this very Sermon (to those that taste it with an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,) will proue to bee <hi>poculum salutis, &amp; salutare suum,</hi> their sauing health, and a right Cup of Blessing. For very well may it bee compared to a Communion Cup; because the Sacrament is deliuered in it. I reade of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion cups made of seueral sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in the Primitiue Church,<note place="margin">Plat. in Zepher.</note> They were first of <hi>wood,</hi> which was giuen ouer, for that it drank vp the Wine: Then of <hi>Glasse,</hi> quickly found vnfit for the brittlenesse: After that, of <hi>Tinn, Pewter, Copper,</hi> &amp;c. All which proued offensiue, by by reason of the minerall quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the metall, which left an ill rellish in the Sacrament. And
<pb facs="8"/> here is a Chalice of <hi>Paper. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> tels that the custom of his<note place="margin">L de Pudic. c. 7. &amp;c. 10.</note> time was, to engraue vpon the Communion Cups, <hi>The Picture of Christ like a Shepheard with the lost sheepe vpon his shoulders:</hi> which is the very Character of this Booke; where is depainted out, The <hi>Birth</hi> and comming of that <hi>good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard</hi> into the world, <hi>to seeke and to saue that which was lost.</hi> Considering therefore the matter of this Booke, and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of presenting it, one of the Titles may (not vnfitly) be <hi>A Communion Cup.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The commendations due to the Worke I must not giue, lest I should seeme by it, to insinuate my selfe into the Authors know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But my well-wishes I will adde; That it may take so well with his Maiestie, and make him
<pb facs="9"/> so gracious; as by the next New-yeares tyde to inable the Author to present him with a Cup in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, reall and massie.</p>
