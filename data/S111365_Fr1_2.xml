In a word, all that is amisse in her, I pray you impute to my bad Tutorship, and her owne frailety; all that I hope of her, is, that she is a merry <hi>Whore,</hi> full of good words: A kinde <hi>Whore</hi> to bee had for money or loue any where; a true <hi>Whore</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
