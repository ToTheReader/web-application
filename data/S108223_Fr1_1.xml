   <p>I doubt not, but that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectie hath bin aduertised of a certaine Proscription, which the King of Spaine, hath appointed to be published againct me, because he hath caused the same to be spread abroade in all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and hath sent it also into diuers quarters of christendome. I and all my verie good freendes haue thought, that I could not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently defende myne honor (which I am aduised and purposed not to hazard or indaunger for anie thing) but by setting a iust defence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this vniust Proscription. In regard whereof, I haue presented vnto my Lords, the estates of these countries, my aunswere: which aunswere also (for the maintenaunce of myne honor and reputation, amongest the Princes &amp; Potentates of Europe, who in respect of their preheminences and dignities, are the succours of poore Princes and distressed noble men) I haue bin bolde to sende vnto them, and to you (Syr) particularlie, most humblie beseeching your Maiestie, that, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you haue seene it, you would yeelde like iudgement thereof, as it hath pleased my Lords the Estates, who haue bin most faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of all myne actions, to do, and to esteeme and iudge thereof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (as it shall please your Maiestie to take knowledge of it) by their aduise and counsell, which also is annexed to my said defence. And because (Sir) your Maiestie may thinke it straunge, that the King of Spaine, hauing heretofore violently taken from me all my goods, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that I had put my gouernementes into the hands of the Dutches of Parma, then the Gouernesse of this estate, and had withdrawen my selfe into the countrey of Germanie, the place of my natiuitie, where I kept my selfe peaceablie among my brethren, kinsfolkes &amp; freends, as also I had fully purposed so to continue: and that, hauing at the same time, conueyed or caried awaie from the scholes, my sonne the Countie of Bueren, and both contrarie to the priuiledges of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and against his owne othe, causing him to be caried prisoner into Spaine, wher he is as yet cruelly kept captiue: and besides, hauing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured me to be condemned to death, by the Duke of Alua his owne officer: because (I saie) your Maiestie may thinke it straunge, that for
<pb facs="2"/> all these reasons (which were neuerthelesse verie great and waightie) I haue not hitherto published anie defence, which was directed to the said King, or might directly concerne him, which thing notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I do at this present and declare thereby, that the faultes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the King of Spaine mindeth to charge me, belong vnto him selfe. I do therfore most hūblie beseche your Maiestie (Sir) that before you iudge of this my writing, you would cōsider the qualitie both of the crimes and faultes, wherewith I am charged by this Proscription, and also the qualitie of mine owne person. For, if the King of Spaine was content to withhold from me my sonne and my goods, which he hath in his possession, &amp; further to offer (as at this present he doth) fiue &amp; twē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thousand crownes for my head, and to promise to make such noble as should murther me, and to pardon them all the faultes whatsoeuer that they could haue committed before that time: no man should thinke it euill in me, that I haue attempted by all the meanes I could, (as in deede heretofore I haue done) to preserue my selfe and myne, and to inable my selfe what I could, to enter againe into that which is myne owne: and that I haue followed that order and course of life that I haue done. But further the King of Spaine, hauing al the world thorowe published, that I am <hi>a publike plague, an enemie of the world, vnthankfull, vnfaithfull, a traytor, and a wicked person:</hi> these are such iniuries (Sir) that no gentleman, no though he were of the basest of the king of Spaines naturall subiectes, can or ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: in so much (Sir) that though I were one of his simple and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute vassals, who oweth homage vnto him by honor, yet so it is, that by such a sentence, and so vniust in all and euerie part thereof: I also hauing bin by him, spoiled of my landes and Lordshippes, in respect of which, I should heretofore haue taken an othe vnto him, I might haue helde my selfe absolued and free from all my bandes towardes him, &amp; haue assaied also (which thing euen nature hath taught euerie one) by all the meanes I could to maintaine myne honor, which ought to be to me and to all noble men, more deare than life and goods. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, seeing it hath pleased God, to shewe me this great grace, that I am borne a free Lord, not holding of anie other but of the Empire, as do the Princes and other free Lordes of Germanie and Italie: and further seeing that I beare the title, and haue the name <hi>of an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and free Prince,</hi> though in deede my Princedome be not verie great: yea whatsoeuer it be, I not being his natural subiect, neither ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing helde anie thing of him, but by reason of my Seignuries &amp; Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippes,
<pb facs="2"/> of which notwithstanding he hath wholly dispossessed me: it hath seemed vnto me, that I could not defende myne honor, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or content my neare kinsfolkes, sundrie Princes (to whom this is my honor that I am lincked) and my whole posteritie, but in aunswering by publike writing to this accusation, which in the presence of all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, is published and set out against me. And though I haue not bin able to do it, without touching his honor, I hope notwithstanding (Sir) that your Maiestie will impute it, rather to the inforcement, that the qualitie and hainousnes of this Proscription hath laide vppon me, than to my nature or will. For as concerning this point, that some men maie thinke it straunge, that I do after this sorte defende my selfe, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I haue sometimes heretofore helde of him sundrie landes and Lordshippes, for aunswere thereto, I will most humblie beseeche your Maiestie, to consider the hainousnes of the iniurie, that is done me, which a right noble man will neuer in deede abide: also that I am not his naturall subiect, and, as concerning my fees and pensions, that he hath spoiled me of them. But suppose that I had alwaies enioyed them: yet so it is, that the same lawe which he vseth towardes others, should not be denied to me.<note place="margin">In the letter sent to the Frēch King, it is vvrittē: He holdeth of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie.</note> He holdeth of the French King in loyaultie and homage, and euen as the vassall doth of his Lord, the Countie or Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Charollois: and yet for all that he ceasseth not, to make warr against the crowne of Fraunce, yea he neuer leaueth of continuallie to practise and deuise, somewhat against the same. He taketh this as a sure foundation or rule, that, being a soueraigne gouernor in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, it is lawfull for him, to reuenge himselfe of the wrong, which he pretended was done vnto him, by the late French King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of most noble memorie. When he made warre against the Pope Caraffa, because as a vassall he helde of him the kingdomes of Sicilia and Naples, he published his defence, by which he mainteined, that he was absolued from his othe, because that the Pope kept not himselfe, within the termes or pointes that the Lord oweth to his vassall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the feodall lawes which are mutuall, and respect as well the one, as the other. Now (Sir) there is nothing so naturall or kindlie, as, that euerie one should in his owne cause, receaue the verie selfesame rule and order, that he would haue an other man to receaue or allow of. Wherefore he should not thinke it straunge, that I, being so manie wayes reuiled &amp; iniuried by him, and not being his subiect, that I, I say, do ayde my selfe, with the meanes that God hath giuen me, and with which he hath bin willing to helpe him selfe against his Lordes, who
<pb facs="3"/> haue not offended him in anie thing whatsoeuer, that draweth nigh to the wrong which I haue suffered at his hande: yea he should not thinke it straunge, that I vse against him that reprochefull note, hy which he assayeth to marke as it were in the forehead, both me and my race.</p>
   <p>And because my Lords the Estates, (who haue more nighly knowen the trueth of all that is contained in this my defence, and haue appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the same) haue yeelded vnto me sufficient testimonie inough tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching my life past: I do most humblie also beseeche your Maiestie (Sir) in approuing this same myne aunswere, to beleeue that I am not, either a traytour or wicked person, but that I am, (thankes be to God for it) a noble man, of a verie good and most auncient house, yea a good man and true in euerie thing that I promise, not vnthankeful, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, nor hauing committed anie thing, whereby a Lord or Knight of my state &amp; coūtenaunce, may receaue anie reproche or shame: most humblie beseeching you, to holde and account me, in the number of your most humble seruauntes. And thus hauing most humblie sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted my selfe vnto your Maiestie, I will pray God (Sir) to giue it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with perfect health, a most blessed and most long life. At Delft in Holland, the iiij. day of Februarie 1581.</p>
