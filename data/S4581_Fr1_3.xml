   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch as by their place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (but especially Preachers) as haue occasion to speake pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely before the ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are to bee admonished, that they neuer affect any strange inkhorne tearmes, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to speake so as is commonly receiued, and so as the most ignorant may well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them: neyther seeking to be ouer fine or curious, nor yet liuing ouer carelesse, vsing their speach as most men doe, and ordering their wits as the fewest haue done. Some men seek so far for outlandish English, that they forget altogether their mothers language, so that if some of their mothers were aliue, they were not able to tell or vnderstand what they say; and yet these fine English Clearkes will say they speake in their mother tongue; but one might well charge them for counterfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Kings English. Also, some far iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied gentlemen, at their returne home, like as they loue to goe in forraine apparrell, so they will pouder their talke with ouer-sea language. Hee that commeth lately out of France, will talke French English, and neuer
<pb facs="4"/> blush at the matter. Another chops in with English Italianated, and applyeth the Italian phrase to our English speaking, the which is as if an Orator, that professeth to vtter his minde in plaine Latine, would needs speake Poetrie, and far fetched colours of strange an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie. Doth any wise man thinke, that wit resteth in strange words, or else standeth it not in wholsome matter, and apt declaring of a mans minde? Doe wee not speake, because we would haue others to vnderstand vs? or is not the tongue giuen for this end, that one might know what another meaneth? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, either wee must make a difference of English, and say, some is learned English, and othersome is rude English, or the one is Court talke, the other is Country-speech, or else we must of necessitie banish all affected Rhetorique, and vse altogether one manner of language. Those therefore that will auoid this follie, and acquaint themselues with the plainest and best kinde of speach, must seeke from time to time such wordes as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly receiued, &amp; such as properly may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse in plaine manner, the whole conceit of their minde. And looke what words we best vnderstand, and know what they meane, the
<pb facs="4"/> same should soonest be spoken, and first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, to the vtterance of our purpose. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for this end, foure things would chiefly be obserued in the choyse of wordes. First, that such wordes as wee vse, should bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto the tongue wherein we speake. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that they be plaine for all men to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. Thirdly, that they bee apt and meete, most properly to set out the matter. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that wordes translated, from one signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to another, (called of the Grecians <hi>Tropes,)</hi> be vsed to beautifie the sentence, as precious stones are set in a ring, to commend the gold. Now such are thought apt wordes, that properly agree vnto that thing, which they signifie, and plainly expresse the nature of the same. Therefore, they that haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their estimation and credite, doe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily speake, &amp; with choise, vtter words most apt for their purpose. In waightie causes, graue wordes are thought most needfull, that the greatnesse of the matter, may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeare, in the vehemencie of their talke. So likewise of other, like order must be taken. Albeit some, not onely doe not obserue this kinde of aptnesse, but also they fall into much fondnes, by vsing words out
<pb facs="5"/> of place and applying them to diuers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, without all discretion.</p>
   <p>If thou be desirous (gentle Reader) right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and readily to vnderstand, and to profit by this Table, and such like, then thou must learne the Alphabet, to wit, the order of the Letters as they stand, perfectly without booke, and where euery Letter standeth: as (b) neere the beginning, (n) about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, and (t) toward the end. Now if the word, which thou art desirous to finde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with (a) then looke in the beginning of this Table, but if with (v) looke towards the end. Again, if thy word begin with (ca) looke in the beginning of the Letter (c) but if with (cu) then looke toward the end of that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And so of all the rest, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>And further vnderstand, that all such words as are deriued and drawne from the Greeke, are noted with this letter (g.) And the french are marked thus (ยง) but such words as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from the Latine and others, haue no marke at all.</p>
