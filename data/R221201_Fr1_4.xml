   <head>TO THE VVORSHIPFVLL THE MASTERS and GOVERNORS of the mystery of Barber Chirurgions of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, <hi>viz.</hi>

   <head type="sub">To <hi>William Clowes</hi> Esquire, Sergeant, Surgeon to his Majestie, and (at present) Master: M. <hi>William Lingham,</hi> Master <hi>George Dan,</hi> and Master <hi>Henry Watson,</hi> Wardens.</head>
   <head type="sub">To <hi>Richard Watson</hi> and <hi>Michael Andrewes,</hi> both Esquires▪ Surgeons in ordinarie to his Majestie, and ancient Masters; together with the rest of the Assistants, Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Surgeons, the Livery, and whole frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Surgeons of <hi>London.</hi>
   </head>
   <head type="sub">
      <hi>John Woodall,</hi> an ancient Master of that mystery, the Authour of the ensuing Treatises, sendeth greeting in our Lord God everlasting▪</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloved Brethren, publick and private salutations are Christian duties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon all men by the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the time or frequency thereof unlimited: Wherefore my self, even now upon the putting forth of these my ensuing works, by that precept am taught, and do hereby send you a salutation, greeting you in the name of the Almighty, giving you thanks for the loving society I have found and respectively en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed amongst you, for fourty years past and more, till this present.</p>
   <p>As also for your good likings and well approvings of
<pb facs="8"/>
my former works and editions yet extant with you; namely, my Surgeons Mate and <hi>Viaticum,</hi> which now revised, I have here (with my other works) again pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished; which were by me penned in my love to you, for the use of the younger sort of Surgeons, your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; who when they had received their first rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from you as Apprentices; yet neverthelesse (as might be conceived) were wanting of some further helps for their proficiencies in <hi>Art,</hi> to the leading them on in knowledge; as namely, first to know the office and duties of a Surgeons Mate, which my self first pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and published, for their instructions; and having therein proposed unto them the method of a Surgeons Chest, and also opened to their view the composure and order of the first methodical Surgeons Chest, for their further incouragement in way of <hi>Art,</hi> I then gave them a help to the said Surgeons Chest; namely, I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished for them a <hi>Viaticum</hi> (a book so called) in <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. for their journeying, after which (as followeth) I have explained unto them such other documents as may be presumed that by their diligent endeavours and careful putting them in practice, they may in short time become good proficients in military and domestick Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery; men fit and able for the service of his Majestie, and the Common-wealth, in their Science, upon all occasions,</p>
   <p>And moreover, for as much as that contagious and noysome disease of the Plague hath of late yeares spread it self into many parts of this Kingdome▪ which▪ though now ceased, may return at Gods pleasure▪ none knoweth how soon; my self, as some of you know, having in my younger daies lived in France, Germany, Polonia, and other forreign parts, for divers years together, where, for want of better and beneficial imployments. I was forced for my maintenance to follow the practice of the cure of the Plague: and having emboldened my self thereby, ever as in an assured hope, that God who had called me to professe the mysterie of healing, would
<pb facs="8"/>
surely protect me therein; I persisted in my endeavors, and having kept my Papers of receipts and experiments together, which I made in the cure of that dreadfull disease, at my return for England I begun and practised in London the cure thereof; first, in the year of the great Plague at the first entrance of King <hi>James</hi> of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed memorie, and left not the Citie when the disease was at the highest; neither then did I omit to visit and cure any that desired my help, and ever since in some sort I have been helpful to the curing thereof: neither will I desist from affording my medicine to the disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, whilest God spares me life and ability. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have here for future publick good, although by my own dear experience, searched into the supernatural and dreadful causes, symptomes, crisis, and cures there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; the particulars of all which I have in one of the following Treatises published, to the help of my youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brethren; nothing doubting but that some of them will by their better educations and further experiences therein, furnish the following Ages with better docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then my slendernesse can unfold: In the mean time, since that for this fourty years last past, no Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of our Nation hath published any book of the true practice of Surgery, to benefit the younger sort, these my mean Treatises onely excepted, I desire you to accept of my good will instead of good deeds, at the least not to reject it, till better comes in place by succession of time.</p>
   <p>And so not omitting the continuance of my good affection to all my brethren, the sons and successours of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> professed Surgeons, I commend you to the tuition of the most Highest, resting still yours in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection,</p>
