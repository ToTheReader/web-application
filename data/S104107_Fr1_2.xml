      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Lord-ships favourable acceptance of my weak endeavours puts life into them, which were even before their birth dead, in mine owne opinion of them, and had dyed as soone as they were borne, but that you was pleased to breathe upon them, so that having from you received a publike life, they humbly beg of your Lordship to foster them, in this hard censorious age. Your encouragements came to me, as Gods mercy came to Adam, and us in him in my text, in the needfull time of trouble, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are more gratefull to me, and with more grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

ought to bee, and are received. God knowes best which way to bring us to himselfe, and if our Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was sweet, we shold forget our Countrey, yet where God sends us comforts, not to kisse that hand, by which we receive them, is wretched unthankfulnesse. My poore Sermon, enriched by your Honours acceptance, flyes into your bosome for shelter, and may the comforts exhibited therein, remaine there, and in the hearts of all yours, and of all the pillars of this governement, whereof you are principall. It is published as neere as I could, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> as it was preached. I feared to adde any thing to it, lest that which was put to, might be displeasing to your Lordship, and so discarded of your protection, or to leave out any thing, lest some part of it (though never so meane) might have bin bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to one or other, and so an iniury done in the losse of it. It hath a great disadvantage, in that what lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle life there was in the delivery, is wholy lost, unlesse quickned by the Fancy and apprehension of the reader, whose eare might relish that which the eye will perhaps distaste, and for my selfe, though preaching bee my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull burden, yet the presse is a pressure more then ordinary to me, being no whit acquainted that way, nor having friends and acquaintance to direct mee in it. But I beseech you to cover all my weakenesses with your most favourable construction, and not onely to cover them your selfe, but to shelter them from the stormes of censure, which are likely to light on them. The Lord continue and encrease unto you the blessings of his right hand and of his left, and to those that are your right hand and right eye, in the Governement of this anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

corporation, the right Worspipfull, the Aldermen your Brethren, that you and they may see clearely into, and see strongly executed those things which belong to the safety and welfare of this renowned body, and that they, whose lips preserve knowledge, may still have a cheerefull portion of meat in due season. It is the Crowne of your honour and estates, and your poore Oratour will pray that it may ever flourish, and that the Oyle may abound in your cruses, and multiply in the effusion of it, as is the desire of him that is</p>
