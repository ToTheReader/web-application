   <p>
      <hi>THAT</hi> we may read this Euangelicall hystorie to our profite a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d commoditie,
it shall not be litle auaileable to vnderstand the sence of this word <hi>EVAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GELIVM,</hi>
which we call in English the <hi>GOSPEL:</hi> for thereby
we shall easily discerne what mooued these heauenly witnesses to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>mmit these
things to wryting, and to what ende all things that they haue wrytten, are to be
referred. For these hystories were not so named by other men, but that the authours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
did so intitle them, it is manifest by Marke: which sayeth in plaine woordes, that he
declareth the beginning of the Gospel of Iesus Christ. Moreouer, the perfecte and plaine
definition of the Gospell is gathered specially out of a certaine place in Paule, where he
sayeth that it was promised of GOD in the scriptures by the Prophets as concerning his
sonne which was borne of the seede of Dauid,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 2</note> and declared mightely to be the sonne of
God, through the spirit of sanctification, by the rising againe of the deade. First, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>th
that it is a testimonie of saluation offered, which was promised long agoe to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by continuall successe of ages, wherein doeth appeare a plaine difference betweene
those promises which did hold in doubt the mindes of the faithfull, and those glad tidinges
whereby God witnesseth that he hath now throughly perfourmed all things which before he
woulde haue them to hope for. Like a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> a little after the same Paule sayeth that the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God is sette foorth in the same Gospel, which before was signified by the lawe and
the prophets.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 20▪</note> And therefore in another place, the Apostle calleth it an ambassage, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is daily declared vnto men a reconciliation which is once for all concluded betweene
God &amp; the world, by the death of Christ. He signifieth also that Christ is not only a pledge
of all good things that euer were graunted vnto vs by God, but also that in him they are
fully and wholely offred vnto vs, according as he sayeth elsewhere, that all the promises of
God are fulfilled in Christ, euen so, and Amen. And doubtlesse, that free adoption whereby
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e are made the children of God, as it proceedeth from the euerlasting good wil of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
so is it opened vnto vs in that, that Christe (who is the onely natural sonne of God)
taking our flesh vpon him, did chuse vs to be his brethren. Neither ought we to seeke any
where else, but onely in the sacrifice of his death, for that exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ation or blessing, wherewith
our sinnes are blotted out: so that the cursse or sentence of death cannot fall vpon vs. Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
saluation, and perfect felicity haue a sure foundation in his resurrection. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Gospel may be defined to be a solemne publishinge or proclamation, wherein the
sonne of God is declared to haue beene offred vppe in the flesh, to the intent that be might
renew the wicked worlde, and restore menne that were dead, to life. Neither is it without
cause called good and glad tidings, since in it is comprehended the summe of our felicitye:
for the ende thereof i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, that it, hauing beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap> in vs the kingdome of God, and hauing aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
the corruption of our flesh, might bring vs, being renewed through the spirite, vnto the
celestial and heauenly glory. In which sense it is oft times called the kingdome of heauen,
and a reparation of a blisseful life, atchieued by Christ: and sometime it is called the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God.<note place="margin">Mar. 1. 534.</note> As when Marke sayeth that Ioseph looked for the kingdom of God, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb facs="24"/>
it is to be vnderstoode of the comminge of Messias: whereby it is manifest that the
name of the Gospel doeth properly pertaine to the Nowe Testament: and that those wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
speake very c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>susely, which thinke it to be like common to all ages, and that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
may at aptly be called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>asters of the Gospel, at the Apostles. Christes woordes
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>
till the comminge of Iohn, declareth that then the kingdome of God began to be preached.
And Marke (as before was mentioned) signifieth that the Gospell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> hystories, wherin is declared, that Christ toke vpon him the office &amp; function of ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.
For since that in the birth, death, &amp; resurrection of Christ, is comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>sed the sum of
our saluation, and they are the very matter whereof it doeth consiste, they may very well
and fitly be called Euangelists: that is to say, bringers of merrye newes, whiche portraite
out before our eyes Christ sent of his father, so that by faith we may ack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>wledge him to
be the only authour of our felicitie. The force and effecte of his comming is m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>re plainely
put downe in other bookes of the Newe Testament. And Iohn in this respect differeth farre
from the other three, who is wholely occupied in expressing the vertue of Christe, and the
frute that we reape thereby, where as the rest stand more vppon this poynt, that our Christe
is the sonne of God which was promised to be the redeemer of the world. In deede they doe
teache heere and there the doctrine of Christes office: that we may be certified of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
towarde vs, and to what ende he was giuen vnto vs: but this (as I sayde) is the chiefest
matter they handle, that Christe Iesus did fully finish all things in his owne person, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
was promised by God euer since the beginning of the worlde. For their purpose and
intent was not by their wrytings to abolishe and destroy the lawe and the Prephets, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
brainsicke persons doe vainly dreame, that the Olde Testament hath beene to none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte,
euer since the veritie of the heauenly wisedome hath been reuealed vnto vs by Christ
and his Apostles: Nay, they rather pointing out Christe vnto vs, as it were with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>inger,
put vs in minde to seeke at his handes what soeuer the law and the Prophets haue ascribed
vnto him. VVherfore then we shall frutefully and effectually read the Gospel, when we shal
lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>e to conferre it with the promises of the olde Testament. As concerning the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelists
which nowe I take in hand to interpreat, Mathewe is sufficiently knowen, and
some thinke Marke to haue liued familiarly with Peter as his scholler, and to haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Gospel, which he wrote woorde by woorde out of Peters mouth, so that he supplied
only the ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>me of a Scribe or Nota<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>te. But this matter needeth no curious disputation, for
it little appertaineth vnto vs to know more, then that he is a lawfull witnesse ordained of
God, and that he publisheth nothing in wryting, but that which was reuealed vnto him, and
putte into his head by the holy Ghost. But Ieromes opinion seemeth to haue smal grounde,
who thinketh his Gospel to be a briefe summe, drawne out of the Gospel of Mathewe. For
he differeth from him in handling his matter euen in the entrance: neither doeth he obserue
the same Methode that Mathew doeth, and he reck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>neth vppe liuers things, lefte vntou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
of the other: and some things mentioned in Mathewe, he declareth more at large. I
thinke it more probable, and so may I gather by the woorke it selfe, that he had neuer seene
Mathewes booke, when he wrote his owne, much lesse did he of purpose make an Epitome or
Abridgement of it. And the very same doe I iudge of Luke. For, as concerning the clauses
wherein they seeme to differ, I thinke not that they brought them in of sette purpose, but
when they all determined truely and faithfully to set foorth those thinges which they had
thorowly knowen and approoued, euery one of them followed what order hee thought best
him self. And like as this came to passe, not by blinde chance &amp; fortune, but by the diuine
prouidece of God: euen so, the holy ghost ministred vnto them a marueil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>us consent, vnder
a contrary stile and fourme of wryting. The which Harmonie it selfe, were sufficient to confirme
their credite, had they not elsewhere receiued greater, and more stedfast authoritie.
<pb facs="24"/>
Nowe, as for Luke, he credibly witnesseth of himselfe, that hee was a companion of Paule,
continually conuersant with him. But that which Eusebius reporteth, is very childish, that
Paule was the true authour of Luk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s Gospel, because in a certaine place, he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his owne Gospel. As though it were not manifest, by that whiche ensueth in the
text,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 8.</note> that Paule speaketh of his common preaching, and not of any one booke wrytten. For
he sayeth: <hi>For the which Gospell I suffer affliction, as an euill doer, euen
vnto bondes.</hi> And who knoweth n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t, that Paule was accused, not for any Booke he had
Compiled, but for that he was a Minister of the woorde, and preached openly the Gospel of
Christ: wherby it appeareth that Eusebius was a man very painful, but of small iudgement,
since without diligent hede, he heapeth vp togither so many senceles notes, wherof I thought
good to admonish the readers, least they chaunce to stumble at such like blockes, which lye
heere and there, scattered throughout all his woorkes. Moreeuer, because I haue chosen a
kinde of Interpretation, which may perhaps displease diuers at the first blush. I meane to
yeelde a reason of my doing, trusting thereby to satisfie the vnpartial and godly readers. This
first is without controuersie, that none of the three Euangelists, can be truely and rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreated,
vnlesse he be conferred with the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o other. VVherefore faithful and skilful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreaters,
heerein take moste paines, that all things may be reconciled, which are spoken
by the three Euangelists. But since that meane wittes cannot easily conferre the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
togither, whilest still they turne and returne from the one to the other, I thought this
briefe Methode would seeme pleasant and profitable, if by a continual processe or discours,
like as it were in one table, the three hystories were ioyned togither: wherein the readers
may see and discerne at once, what is dissonant and agreeable to them all. So I will ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slip
nothing which is wrytten by any one of the three: and I will declare in one discourse
what soeuer is handled by diuers. Nowe, whether my paines be wel bestowed (as I hope) or
no, let euery manne iudge according to the profite he taketh in reading. Truely it was so
farre from my thought to catche after praise and commendation by my newe inuention,
that I freely con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>esse (as becommeth euery good nature) that in this manner of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
I haue imitated other men. And most of all I followed Bucer, a man of holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
and a famous teacher in the churche of God, who (in my iudgement) hath trauailed
heerein to no smal purpose. And like as he hath had great furtherance by the disigelce of
ancient wryters, which haue taken paines in the same studie before him: so I pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>esse my
selfe to haue beene as much eased by his labour and industrie. But whereas I differ from
him in some places (the which libertye I graunted my selfe so ofte as seemed necessarye.) I
thinke that he himselfe, if he now liued on earth, would not be offended with is.</p>
