   <head>THE TRANSLATOR to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here offer to thy view and censure (gentle Reader) the Translation of <hi>Stephens</hi> Apologie, written in defence of <hi>Herodotus</hi> his (strongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, but falsly supposed fabulous) History▪ which I present vnto thee vnder the name of <hi>A World of Wonders.</hi> When I call it <hi>a World of Wonders,</hi> thinke not that I go about to gull thee with an <hi>happelourde</hi> some counterfait worke, hauing onely a glorious title, and performing nothing lesse then that which the title doth promise and pretend; like <hi>Lucians Verae historiae,</hi> or our pedling pamphlets, which haue <hi>plus salis quàm sumptûs, More conceit then cost,</hi> cosening the world with copper for gold, with glasse for pearle, and seeming for substance. And when I say <hi>Stephens Apologie,</hi> imagine not that thou hast either <hi>Palaephatus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> in hand, or <hi>Goularts Admiranda,</hi> or <hi>Wolfius</hi> his <hi>Memorabilia,</hi> or <hi>Torque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meda's Mandeuile of miracles;</hi> or any such rhapsodie of an indigested history, whose authors are at cost to print vs new Almanacks of the last yeare: but a learned, pithy, and pleasant Apologie, whose title doth neither bely the text, nor the text shame the title. For as it is called <hi>A World of Wonders:</hi> so it containeth a world of matter, and that beyond all maruel. So that if Poets do rightly call <hi>Iridē Thaumantis filiā,</hi> the rain-bow, the daughter of wonder; we may well call this Apologie <hi>A World of wonders,</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the raine-bow hath not halfe the varietie of colours, that this Apologie of strange and pleasant histories. And though a wonder last but nine daies, as the common saying is: yet a World of wonders wil last to all posteritie. And verily, if we may coniecture of future euents by former presidents, I see not but that it will remaine (more durable then the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen wonders of the world) euen to many generations: sith it hath already passed the presse (if I haue counted right) wel neare fourteene times within these fortie yeares. And now this Mart (if the Catalogue deceiue vs not) we are to receiue a new impression. So that if it haue but halfe that kind entertainment here, that it hath had, and stil hath, in it owne countrey, the Printer will be no loser by the bargaine.</p>
   <p>But it is not my purpose (gentle Reader) to detaine thee with impertinent discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout tearmes and titles, nor yet to abuse thy patience with a second Apologie for <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> (for that were but to defloure the time, and to write <hi>Iliada post Homerum,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it hath bene sufficiently performed by <hi>Manutius, Camerarius,</hi> and this our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.) Howbeit something of necessitie must be spoken in way of Apologie for this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, to cleare it of those many imputations and aspersions that are cast vpon it; as well vpon the matter of the book, as the manner of writing: the truth of the history, as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie of the historian. And first to begin with <hi>crimen falsi:</hi> Our good Catholicks abroade and corner-creepers at home, stick not to cast out such speeches as these; That it is an easie matter to make the tale run which way shal please the teller; that as vnder the fairest face lieth the foulest heart, so (oftē) in the smoothest tale the smallest truth. In a word, that <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> Apologie is nothing but a rhapsodie of fables of Friers, deuised of his fingers, and therefore the Translator had need to looke to his proofes. But what writer should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
<pb facs="5"/>
if such senslesse prating might passe for proofe? They are therefore to know, that the greatest sticklers are not alway the greatest strikers, nor the loudest barkers the sorest biters; We haue liued too long to be scared with such bugs. And I doubt not, but (for all these crackes and brauadoes) they wil take counsell of their pillow, and (perhaps) stroke their beards fiue times (as the Doctors of <hi>Sorbonne</hi> that disputed with <hi>Erasmus</hi> did, ere they could bring out one wise word) before they will disproue it. For had it bin so easie a pil to haue bene swallowed, we should haue heard of them long ere this, considering they haue had it lying by them full fortie yeares and more. But this is the matter: if <hi>Stephen</hi> or any other orthodoxe writer trip neuer so little, and mistake but the least circumstance, they cry out by and by that they do nothing but belie them, that they misreport their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and falsifie their positions, &amp;c. Wherein they deale like certaine theeues, who rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing a true man, and finding more money about him then he would be knowne of, cried out of the falshood of the world, that there was no truth to be found among men. They may do well to looke a little nearer home;<note place="margin">

   <p>Touching the Translation, I haue not much to say: for I do not professe my self a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator, neither do I arrogate any extraordinary skil in the French tongue. (I leaue both to the skilfull Linguists of our moderne languages, as stately <hi>Sauile,</hi> flourishing <hi>Florio,</hi> graue <hi>Grimeston,</hi> facile and painful <hi>Holland,</hi> &amp;c.) Yet this I hope I may truly say, that I haue expressed the meaning of my Author both truly and fully: and that I haue not lost either the life or the grace of any conceit, where it was possible to be kept. Which I speake not as doting vpon mine own doings: for I am not so in loue either with the work or work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, with the matter of the booke, or the manner of handling, nor the gay coate that I haue put vpon it, as <hi>Heliodorus</hi> was of his amorous discourse of <hi>Chariclea</hi> (called the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> history) who chose rather to leaue his Bishoprick, then to cal in his book. I am rather of <hi>Marcilius Ficinus</hi> his mind, who hauing translated <hi>Plato</hi> into Latin,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Niceph. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list. Eccle. hist. lib. 12. ca. 34.</hi>
      </note> came to his learned friend <hi>Musutus Candiot</hi> to know his opinion of it: where <hi>Candiot</hi> after he had perused some few leaues, perceiuing that it would not satisfie the expectation of the learned, considering it was but slubbered ouer, and that it resembled the originall (as <hi>Cicero</hi> the yonger did his father) in nothing but in name: takes a sponge, and hauing dipped it in an ink-pot, blots out the first page: then turning him to <hi>Ficinus;</hi> Thou seest (quoth he) how I haue corrected the first page: if thou wilt, I will correct the rest in like sort. To whom <hi>Ficinus</hi> very mildly answered: No reason that <hi>Plato</hi> should be disgraced through my default: and so refined it again. (Who notwithstanding hauing done the best he could, by his rusticall simplicitie resembles the maiesty of <hi>Plato's</hi> style (if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <hi>Scaliger</hi>) no otherwise then as if an Owle should represent an Eagle.) If therefore any candide <hi>Candiot</hi> (for I appeale onely to such as haue skill in the French tongue) shall shew me that I haue done the like in translating this Apologie, and that I haue not attained to the <hi>Venus</hi> of the French, the finenesse, fitnesse, and featnesse of the phrase; I refuse not the sponge: so that he will correct me, and not controll me. As for the rest, I shal desire them to spare their censure till they haue learned their <hi>Littleton.</hi> But lest any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping companion should brag that he had found a hole in my coate, and that he could shew where I haue missed the cushion: I do here correct my selfe and confesse a fault in the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, Chap. <hi>15. §. 1.</hi> which as (in my necessary absence) it passed the presse before I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware: so if it come to a second reuiew, shall haue his due correction.

As for the rigide censurer (who is <hi>crudelis in animaduertendo</hi>) I shall desire him but to make triall himselfe in translating of two or three paragraphs, and then I doubt not, <hi>Quin fuerit studijs aequior ille meis.</hi> Touching the phrase, I desire the lesse fauour: for albeit I am not ignorant that tailers and writers are now in like esteeme; that if they haue not new fashions, they are not fancied; and if the style be not of the new stampe, the author is but a simple fellow, and may put vp his pipes: yet I haue of purpose so tempered my style, as that it might content the iudicious: nothing respecting the iudgement or censure of our finical affecters, who are so humorous: leauing inkhorne phrases and tapsterlike termes for the tauerne; and affected straines of Oratory for the stage: and auoiding especially the French <hi>fripperie,</hi> because I would not haue it seeme to be a translation.</p>
   <p>Now before I conclude, I am to aduertise thee (courteous Reader) that of two editions of this Apologie, I haue here followed the latter, (viz. that of <hi>Rigauds</hi> Anno 1592.) the rather because I was giuen to vnderstand, that the Author himselfe not long before his death, did reuiew the former edition of <hi>Mareses,</hi> and left it corrected as here thou hast it. I haue also obserued the seueral sections in euery Chapter as they are in that Edition, &amp; haue added the figures, for thy ease, and for more distinct reference in the quotatiō of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: which notwithstanding through the Printers ouersight hath not bin obserued till the <hi>12.</hi> Chapter.
