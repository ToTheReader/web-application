      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His short discourse includes in it much substance, and layeth open the principal errors by which the trayterous Papists haue so long gouerned the common-wealth of France: shewing how their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are badly grounded, ill applyed, and worse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued for their purpose. Therefore I wish euery man would haue so much care of his soules health, as to imitate this new Conuert in the searching of Gods word: and doubtlesse, then many would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue true comfort, and discerne light from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and bee no more misse-led with that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable rule of Popery, viz. That it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for artificers, and trades-men, and those that bee ignorant people, to search into the Booke of God. By which meanes these Papists haue faire aduantage to muffle their scholers in any error, were it neuer so grosse: where hauing their faith
<pb facs="3"/>tied to another mans report, they must needs stand in danger of damnation. And that many more should not be seduced into the like opinion, here is (by an inspiration from God) an Apologie made by a French gentleman, trained vp all his time from his infancie in Poperie, now reduced to the true knowledge of God, reuealed in his holy word, by searching out his saluation in the diligent reading and meditation thereof.</p>
