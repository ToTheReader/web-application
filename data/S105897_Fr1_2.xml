                 <title>Ciceronis amor· Tullies loue : VVherein is discoursed the prime of Ciceroes youth, setting out in liuely portratures how young gentlemen that ayme at honour should leuell the end of their affections, holding the loue of countrie and friends in more esteeme then those fading blossomes of beautie, that onely feede the curious suruey of the eye. A worke full of pleasure as following Ciceroes vaine, who was as conceipted in his youth as graue in his age, profitable as conteining precepts worthie so famous an orator.
