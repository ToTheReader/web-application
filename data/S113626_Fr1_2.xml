      </gap>dded to him as great reputation and respect as any man living this day carrieth or can have of his degree and quality: A man of blessed memory, yea such a one, that they who knew him, could not sufficiently esteeme him, and they who
<pb facs="3"/> did not esteeme him, did never sufficiently know him; whom living I loved and admired, and being dead, I desire to follow. That as I do not envy and repine at other mens rich gifts with an evill eye, so to signifie and shew that I do not despise mine owne poore mite with a wayward and wicked heart, but do desire to get and gaine something with my small ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent unto my good and gracious Lord, blessed and bountifull Master: That I might a little unwinde my selfe out of that so intricate a labyrinth, in which my heart and best thoughts are and have beene a long time much intangled and inthralled, I having often exactly examined and throughly tried and pared my thoughts to the quick; how to testifie and tell abroad my humble and hearty, my true and unfained thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse for your Lordships redundant and reduplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted favours, munificently heaped upon mee, (I much abhorring their too bad disposition, which neither affoord love, nor requite it, which neither offer it with kindnesse, nor accept it with acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement) not onely in placing and planting me at <hi>Weekley,</hi> nor only in countenancing me and my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie being there seated and setled, whereby I was much animated and encouraged, and continually and copiously contributing to me so often and in such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, that I, my no little charge and great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily lived with comfort, contentment and plenty, even to admiration, if not astonishment of all such who did not advisedly consider Gods secret blessing, multiplying and making to abound a little meal sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and plentifully where and when himself pleaseth; and who were not acquainted with the ever-running
<pb facs="4"/> fountaine of your Lordships liberality flowing over not onely to our refreshing, but enriching: But also after foureteene yeares triall and experience of me, in transplanting mee to <hi>Brought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>n</hi> to succeed M. <hi>Bolton,</hi> of whom I may truly say as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> did of Saint <hi>Cyprian, Multi erat meriti, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti pectoris, multi oris, multae virtutis,</hi> He was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, wise, eloquent and religious. I have presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to publish this small Treatise, not expecting by thus doing to gaine either riches or preferment, I having of the former to content me, and of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by your Lordships favour to the utmost pitch (if not further) that I expected: nor hunting after or hoping hereby to have credit and applause (I usually<note place="margin">Iohn 7. 14.</note> living solitarily and retiredly at home) well knowing that reputation is but a weake and wavering foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that peoples affections oft raise mens hopes, and ruine their persons, and that wise men are not moved by rumours, since they grow by reports, and diminish by experience: and since that long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of a thing slakes the wonderment, and makes the wings of report to flag. But for the aforesaid causes and considerations, as also to do or attempt the doing of good in the Church and my native Countrey, well knowing that good intentions (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from selfe-perswasions against Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements which are meere impieties) have such a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with Gods own disposition, that he will both assist them for their better encouragement, and for others example; and well knowing that as a scout may upon an occasion heare and know what a whole host hath no present notice of; so I (who am no
<pb facs="4"/> more a stranger in diverse difficulties and distresses of Christianity, and in many miseries of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, than he who in a ship as a passenger, when it is in danger declares the same although no Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot) have assayed, what in me is, the good of others, desiring (and yet it is a folly to wish where there is no hope) that this which I have penned for publike profit might please all: But alas to have expected to please all men, I might rather have wished (as I do no more) than imagined any possibility. Neither shall I much regard the malevolent bitings of envious carpers of other mens Writings. May it please your Lordship to take in good part this unfained testimony of mine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious love, officious service, and humble thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse unto your Honour (which I hope you will doe, since noble hearts take more thankfully that which a man desires to give, than that he gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) as also to suffer this Treatise to passe under your Lordships noble protection and patrocinie. To whom I present with my humble service this small Treatise.</p>
   <p>First, Not onely because true Nobility grac'd with vertue and piety, are all combin'd in your Lordship Honours, Authoritie, and great places the top of the desires of ambitious men, except they light on a nature of singular moderation, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister matter to great and grievous vices: to whom it is as little benefit and true content to have such height of earthly happinesse, wanting the use of them, as for a purblinde man to have goodly pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and dimme eyes to behold them. In the midst of their plenty and redundance they wanting
<pb facs="5"/> the true comfort of conscience, and the right use of their honour and high places, they are in the height of misery. For, were they able to drinke up the pleasure of the world in as plentifull manner as <hi>Cleopatra</hi> (who drunk the value of 50000 pound) at a draught; yet it is but a draught, and quickly downe; themselves being like to greene and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boughs and branches, cut downe from trees to adorne mens houses for a time, and then throwne to the dunghill. For, if all the gravell in their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were turned into pearles, and every shower of raine from the clouds above were a shower of silver and gold into their houses: yet as the fresh rivers run into and end in the salt sea, so shall all their honour end in basenesse, all their pleasures in bitternesse, all their treasure in emptinesse, all their garments in nakednesse, and their viands and delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in loathsomnesse and rottennesse. Were they fastned to their greatnesse as are the stony moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to their foundations; yet are they not of power sufficient to withstand the power of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly IEHOVAH, who commandeth the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening and sendeth forth the wind, and is able to shake the world and rend in sunder the masse of the earth. Yea the fairest and goodliest in body being ungodly, stand in danger of grievous diseases, or of vile creatures to be consumed: the soundest of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to be tormented in mind: the richest in treasures to be spoiled in an houre: the best in health to be delivered to many and strong deaths, not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or suspected. And therefore as <hi>Damocles</hi> when he saw nothing but his golden pots, his princely and
<pb facs="5"/> magnificent entertainment, his royall attendants, thought himselfe most happy; but when he cast up his eyes and saw a naked sword hanging onely by a horse haire ready every minute to fall upon his head, then he began to tremble. Even so these great and gracelesse men of the world, when they onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect their pomp, they think there are none like them. But when they looke up to the great vault of heaven, and see the just God ready to powre downe his vials of vengeance on them, then they tremble. Whereas your Lordships humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment in such sublimities, digesting great felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without surfet (a rare vertue in great persons) the many radiant and resplendent gifts and graces, for which D. <hi>Hart,</hi> and M. <hi>Bolton,</hi> and others, in their Dedicatory Epistles, have spread your honour and renowne, yet report was lesse than verity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne farre short of desert: for truth doth out-strip fame, and many other I would name, were I not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to speake of them as they deserve, and in what I can unworthy; and did I not know how averse such praises are unto your Honour, accounting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall commendations of living great ones, in men of our sort, a verball simony, eternize your memory, and make you blessed to all eternity.</p>
   <p>Secondly, Not only because of your Lordships noble Patronage of all good learning, so far forth as to be a bountifull and perpetuall benefactour to the breeding and training up of schollers in good litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in a free and bountifull bestowing of Church-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings in your Lordships Patronage, but also in shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing singular regard and respect to the Ministers of the
<pb facs="6"/> Lord, especially to such who are most painfull and industrious in the Church of God.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, Not onely because of your Honours presence at the preaching of many of these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in our Lecture much countenanced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by your Lordships not onely often, but usuall and ordinary frequenting the same.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, Not onely because of your Lordships ingenuity, who will cover such slips and mistakings which may be in this as in other mens Bookes, your Honour well knowing that an errour at the presse is no calumniation in the Authour.</p>
   <p>Fiftly, But also because I owe my selfe and mine utmost abilities to do your Lordship honour and service, for what I have and do enjoy. Might I therefore be so happy as to honour and renowne your Lordship, or stirre up some of your farre more able Chaplaines (for not so much is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a little weake tree as of a great and strong) to do the same. If your Lordship be pleased to cast a favourable aspect upon these my poore, yet paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full endeavours: May I be an instrument to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, although but a few, and bring glory to God, which ought to be the end of all ends; I have the chiefest of my aimes and desires.</p>
   <p>Thus leaving the successe of these my labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous endeavours to the Almighty, with my hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est prayers to God the Giver of all good, That as your love towards God doth increase, so Gods love towards your Honour may increase also: So that the best blessings may ever rest upon your Honours Person, your honourable Lady, on your
<pb facs="6"/> noble Off-spring, whole family, and all your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, to your everlasting honour in this life, and eternall happinesse in the life to come, I humbly take my leave, and rest,</p>
