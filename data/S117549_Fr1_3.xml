   <head>THE PREFACE,
CONTAINING RVLES OF
direction, for the expounding of
the Commandements.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the holy Ghost testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that the Law of God,<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 7.</note>
(though propounded in ten
words) is so perfect, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
may be added to it, and
so large, that nothing may bee compared
therewith:<note place="margin">Ps. 119. 96.</note> It must therefore bee confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that the sence of the Commandements
is so to be inlarged, as that they may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
to bee the perfect Pandects (as it
were) of Christians; forbidding all vices
which the Lord condemneth in his Word;
and commanding all morall duties which
he requireth at our hands.</p>
   <p>And for as much as there are two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
vses of the Law; the one, to shew vs
our manifold sinnes, and the punishments
due for them, that being humbled in our
<pb facs="4"/>
selues, we might seeke to Christ: the other,
that it might be a perfect rule, whereby to
frame our liues and conuersation; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
redeemed by Christ, wee may also bee
renewed according to the image of God,
in true righteousnesse and holinesse: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is very expedient, that the speciall
duties commanded, and vices forbidden in
euery Commandement, should particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be laid forth. That in respect of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
vse, we might see those manifold both
duties which wee haue omitted, and also
vices which wee haue committed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
and in respect of the latter, that wee
might distinctly see and vnderstand those
particular duties which the Lord enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vs to obserue, and those particular vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which he chargeth vs to shunne for the
time to come.</p>
   <p>And for our direction in this behalfe, we
are to expound euery Commandement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to these fiue rules:</p>
   <p>1. Where any duty is commanded,
there the contrary vice is forbidden; and
where any vice is forbidden, there the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
duty is commanded.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>Euery Commandement
therefore containeth
two parts; the
<list>
         <item>Affirmatiue, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the duty.</item>
         <item>Negatiue, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> vice.</item>
      </list>
   </p>
   <p>Whence ariseth a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of sins, that
they are either sins of<list>
         <item>Omission.</item>
         <item>Commission.</item>
      </list>
   </p>
   <p>2. Vnder one particular vice mentioned
in the Commandement, all of the same
kind are forbidden; and vnder one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
commanded, all of the same kind are
commanded. For the Law of God is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14</note>
and therefore requireth not onely
outward obedience in word and deed, but
also inward in the mind and heart. Neither
doth it onely forbid the outward sinnes
committed in word and deed, but also all
the secret corruptions of the mind and
heart. And thus our Sauiour hath taught
vs to expound the Law of God, Math. 5. 21,
22, 27, 28. and 1. Epist. Ioh. 3. 15.</p>
   <p>Againe, the Law of God is perfect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
perfect obedience both inward and
outward, not onely in respect of the parts,
but also of the degrees. Wherefore, where
any duty is commanded, there the highest
<pb facs="5"/>
degree of it is commanded, as appeareth
by the summe of the Law, Math. 22. 37, 38.
and where any vice is forbidden, there the
least degree of it is forbidden, and beareth
the name of that grosse sinne which is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
that we might learne to esteeme no
sinne small.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 23.</note> For vnaduised anger is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and looking vpon a woman to lust
after her, is forbidden vnder the name of
adultery, as our Sauiour teacheth, Math.
5. 22, 28.</p>
   <p>3. Where any duty is commanded,
there the meanes which tend thereto are
enioyned; and where any vice is forbidden,
there the meanes, prouocations and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
tending thereto are also forbidden.
For such as is the end, such are the subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
meanes that in their owne nature
doe tend thereto. This teacheth, that good
intentions and desires will not serue, when
we are carelesse of the meanes.</p>
   <p>Now there are three meanes which are
common to all duties, and therefore in all
the Precepts are commanded; and the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of them, or the vse of the contrary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden:
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. Prayer: for of our selues
wee cannot so much as thinke a good
thought, 2. Cor. 3. 5. Psal. 119. 33, 34, 35, 36.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
2. Diligent hearing of the Word, Rom.
10. 14, 17.</p>
   <p>3. Good company, Prou. 13. 20. Hee
that toucheth pitch, shall be defiled, Ecclus.
13. 1. A little leauen sowreth the whole
lumpe, 1. Cor. 5. 6. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the wicked depart from him, that hee
might keepe the Commandements of his
God, Psal. 119. 115. and else-where profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
that he auoided their company, Psalm.
26. 4, 5.</p>
   <p>4. Where any duty is commanded, or
vice forbidden, there also the signes are
commanded, or forbidden. For first, as
touching vertues and duties; the graces of
God are not to bee smothered, as it were
candles vnder a bushell, but they must be
manifested to the glory of God, to the
good example of others; and for a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to our selues that wee are endued with
them, wee must bee carefull of honest
things, not onely before God, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, 2. Cor. 8. 21.</p>
   <p>And as touching vices, we are taught to
abstaine from all shew of euill, 1. Thes. 5. 22.
Haughty lookes, strange apparell, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as signes of pride: haunting of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
places,<note place="margin">Pro. 6. 17. Zeph. 1. 8.</note> as signes of incōtinency, &amp;c.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
5. Duties to be procured, and vices to
be auoided, not in our selues onely, but also
in others. First therefore in all the Precepts
is commanded the communion of Saints
to be exercised among the faithfull, in an
earnest desire shewne,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 15.</note> to win our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
vnto Christ, and in a tender care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
for the furthering of the saluation one
of another, by the duties of edification.</p>
   <p>As namely,<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.</note> 1. In
respect of duties,
by stirring vp one
another,<note place="margin">1. Thes. 5. 11, 14.</note> Heb. 10.

our brother in mind
of his duty.</item>
         <item>Exhortation vnto his
duty.</item>
         <item>Encouraging him in
well-doing.</item>
         <item>Comforting those
which are weake.</item>
         <item>Good<list>
               <item>Counsell.</item>
               <item>Example. Math.
5. 16. 1. Pet. 2.
12. Heb. 12. 13</item>
            </list>
         </item>
      </list>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>2. In respect of
things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,

         <item>Reclame the Erroneous.

         <item>Reprooue the offendour.
Leu. 19. 17. Eph. 5. 11.</item>
         <item>Disswade from vice.</item>
      </list>
   </p>
   <p>Secondly, in all the Precepts wee are
forbidden to haue any fellowship with the
vnfruitfull workes of darknesse, Eph. 5. 11.
or to be accessary to the offences of others,
1. Tim. 5. 22.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>Men may be accessary to the offences of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
