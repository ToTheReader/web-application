   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Might iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prefixe for a Preamble to this my Meditation, <hi>Ille ego qui quondam:</hi> as well as <hi>Virgil</hi> did in his Poëtike Preamble to his <hi>Aeneides,</hi> but to a cleane contrary end. For his <hi>Ille ego,</hi> was to shew
<pb facs="3"/> how high he was mounted in his new subiect, from writing of the plough, to write now of Princes and their Warres: whereas I now, cleane contrary, am come from wading in these high and profound Mysteries in the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, wherein an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant may swimme; to meditate vpō the plaine, smoothe and easie <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> that euery olde wife can either say or
<pb facs="3"/> mumble, and euery well bred child can interprete by his Catechisme: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing left so the solid meat that men feed vpon, for the milke fit for babes. But the<note n="*" place="margin">The Triall of Wits wisheth euery man to abstaine from writing any bookes, as soone as he is past fiftie, <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> reason is, I grow in yeeres, and old men are twice babes, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is; hauing imitated Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> herein, who of late yeeres hath giuen ouer his bicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in <hi>Polemikes</hi> and Controuersies, wherein he
<pb facs="4"/> was bred all his life, and betaken himselfe now to set out a short Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion euery yeere, only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellishing almost euery one of them with some two or three<note n="*" place="margin">Roijce ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les fabulas. 1. Tim.</note> fabulous miracles, wherein he shall goe alone for my part. But now when I bethinke my selfe, to whom I can most aptly dedicate this little labour of mine, most of it being stollen from the houres ordained for my sleepe:
<pb facs="4"/> and calling to minde, how carefull I haue euer bin to obserue a <hi>decorū</hi> in the dedicatiō of my bookes. As my <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> was dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to my Sonne <hi>HENRY,</hi> now with God, because it treated of the Office of a King, it now belonging to my only Son <hi>CHARLES,</hi> who succeds to it by right, as well as to all the rest of his brothers goods: and as I dedicated my <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
<pb facs="5"/> for the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance</hi> to all free Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes and States, because they had all of them an interest in that argument. other of my bookes which treated of matters belonging to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry qualitie of persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore indefinitely dedicated to the Reader in generall, I cannot sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde out a person, to whom I can more fitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this short Medita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="5"/> of mine, then to you, <hi>BVCKINGHAM.</hi> For it is made vpon a very short and plaine Prayer, and therefore the fitter for a Courtier: For Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, for the most part, are thought neither to haue list nor leisure to say long prayers, liking best <hi>courte Messe &amp; long disner.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Like S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher that neither could nor would fast nor pray for attayning to the seruice of Christ, and therefore was set to a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters worke by the Ermite.</note> But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the trueth now in earnest, it is the fitter for you that it is both short
<pb facs="6"/> and plaine. That it is short, because when J consider of your continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all attendance vpon my seruice, your dayly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the same, &amp; the vncessant swarme of suitors importunately hanging vpon you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discretion or distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of times, I can find but very litle time for you to spare vpon meditation: And that it is plaine, it is the fitter for you, since you
<pb facs="6"/> were not bred a scholler. You may likewise claime a iust interest in it for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other respects. First, from the ground of my writing it; for diuers times before J medled with it, I told you, and onely you, of some of my cōceptions vpon the Lords Prayer, and you often so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited me to put penne to paper: next, as the person to whom wee pray it, is our heauenly Father, so am J
<pb facs="7"/> that offer it vnto you, not onely your politike, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so your oeconomike Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that in a neerer degree then vnto others. Thirdly, that you may make good vse of it; for since J dayly take care to better your vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to enable you the more for my seruice in worldly affaires, reason would that Gods part should not be left out, for <hi>timor Domini,</hi> is, <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
<pb facs="7"/> sapientiae.</hi> And lastly, I must with ioy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue this gift of mee, in not onely giuing so good example to the rest of the Court, in frequent hearing the word of God: but in speciall, in so often receiuing the Sacrament, which is a notable demō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of your charitie in pardoning them that offend you, that being the thing I most labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
<pb facs="8"/> to the world, in this meditation of mine: and how godly and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous all my aduises haue euer been vnto you, I hope you will faithfully witnes to the world.<note place="margin">This paper-friend will not impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune you at vnseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble houres, come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, nor speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required, &amp; yet wil he neither flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lie, nor dissemble.</note> Receiue then this Newyeers gift from me, as a token of my loue, being begun vpon the Eue of our Sauiours Natiuitie, and ended farre within the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the yeere: pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, that as you are
<pb facs="8"/> regenerated and borne in him anew, so you may rise to him, and bee san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in him for euer.</p>
   <closer>Amen.</closer>
