   <p>Now, blessed be God,
<pb facs="3"/>
who hath not debarred vs of this hope (otherwise in and of our selues both helpelesse and hopelesse) but hath giuen vs both his <hi>Sonne</hi> with his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, to be a <hi>couering</hi> to our nakednesse, and a <hi>couert</hi> and shelter against his wrath; and also his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Gospell,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee might not onely bee made effectually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of these his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, but also bee certified and assured of so much.</p>

      <pb facs="3"/>
and <hi>Inabilitie, Selfe-loue</hi> and <hi>Selfe-pride,</hi> which raigneth in most men, that being dis-affected to this most necessarie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of gaining Christ, they either through <hi>Sloth will not,</hi> or through <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Inabilitie cannot</hi> vndertake it; Besides, such is their <hi>Selfe-loue</hi> &amp; <hi>Pride,</hi> and ouer-weening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of themselues, that they readily and vsually mistake their owne estate, and conceiue better of it then they haue cause; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting onely <hi>eyther</hi> in a bare
<pb facs="4"/>
profession of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and in the name of Christians, (as doe the profane sort:) or in a meere formall and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse practise of Christian duties, without any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of godlinesse imprinted in their hearts, or expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in their liues, (as doe the ordinary sort of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:) who, if to their outward conformities &amp; seeming holinesse they can, by plausible and faire carriage winne the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and applause of the most, then are <hi>they</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
the onely Christians; and all others (that labour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to bee what they would seeme to be) hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and dissemblers.</p>
   <p>Now, Right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for my part, as I, from my very soule, hate in my selfe, all hypocrisie, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Conscience, and in my Iudgement, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what also in my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and indeauours, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the gayning of Christ, and my being found in his righteousnesse, (as in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<pb facs="5"/>
before all worldly pompe, pride, pelfe, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and preferment: So is it, and so hath it been my chiefe care, in my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie, to preach Christ soundly to my hearers, and to plant in their hearts the true and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing knowledge of him, and that in all Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
   <p>To which end, I haue now lately (besides other Arguments in hand) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched this insuing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning <hi>The Christians Apparelling by
<pb facs="5"/>
Christ:</hi> wherein I haue indeauoured, first, by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,</hi> (after the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and true meaning of the words) to <hi>excite</hi> and stirre vp the <hi>Slothfull</hi> to put on Christ. Secondly, by laying downe <hi>Meanes,</hi> to <hi>direct,</hi> and (with Gods grace) the better to <hi>informe</hi> and <hi>inable</hi> the <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>weake</hi> Christian so to doe. Thirdly, and chiefely, by <hi>Markes,</hi> (because all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without sinceritie) to <hi>assure</hi> and <hi>certifie</hi> the godly Christian of his happy estate in Christ, by
<pb facs="6"/>
which <hi>trialls</hi> he may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bee assured that his paines and labour in so weightie a businesse, is not bestowed in vaine; as also the hypocrisie of the vnsound may bee disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</p>
   <p>These my paines, I doubt not, but with Gods blessing, they by the eye may adde to the profit of those who ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally were partakers of them by the eare; so they may bee vsefull also to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; which is the end why I make them so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>Now Sir, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixe your Name heerevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; you must giue mee leaue heereby to testifie, and publish to the whole world, first, what respect and thankefulnesse I owe you principally, on the behalfe of the Church of of God, and Gospell of Christ, for that good will and fauour you beare and shew therevnto; as also, and especially, to God for his good Prouidence in calling you, in these need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full times, to sit at the sterne of this our Ship,
<pb facs="7"/>
and litle Commonweale. The poore shal also blesse God for you, who stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp your heart to care for them, and so wisely and bountifully, with the Assistance and Allowance of your Right Worthie, and VVorshipfull Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to dispose of great part of that Treasure, wherewith (for many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther godly and necessarie vses) God hath blessed your Treasury.</p>
   <p>What interest you haue in mee particularly, and what, and how many are
<pb facs="7"/>
the Ingagements wherein I stand bound vnto you, in respect of priuate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and courtesies, I chuse rather thus general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, onely to intimate and acknowledge, then par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to relate to the world. Herein, (as also in your worthy deseruings, in regard of the publike, both Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth) I know you wil be better pleased with my silence, then with any larger mention of them, as desiring rather <hi>to be,</hi> then <hi>to be knowne to be</hi> worthy.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="8"/>The Lord blesse this insuing Treatise to your vse, and to the vse of his Church. <hi>Amen.</hi>
