   <p>IF <hi>peraduenture thou hast not knowne (good Reader) the booke which is inscribed,</hi> A sober and quiet Reckoning, <hi>wherein M.</hi> Parsons <hi>hath bespotted his Aduersary</hi> T.

      <note n="a" place="margin">Aug.</note> Qui volens detrahit famae meae, nolens addit mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedi. <hi>In the</hi> Reuiew <hi>of which</hi> Reckoning <hi>I called to minde a short</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">
         <hi>Lib.</hi> Verisimil. Theolog. &amp;c. ex Gilb. Cogn. lib. 1. Narrat.</note>
      <hi>History of</hi> a man, who farmed a custome and tallage, which was taken at a bridge of all such passengers as were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diseased, or else notoriously deformed: So it was that one, that passed ouer the bridge, who had <hi>distortum vultum,</hi> was called vpon to pay a peny; which the passenger refused to pay: The Toller caps the fellow, and with that perceiueth that he had an other disease on his head, called <hi>Alopecia,</hi> and therefore he demaundeth of the party an other peny; but the Trauailer resisteth, and struggleth with the Toller, yet being not able to make his part good, is laide along on the ground, where, by some disaduantage, he bewraied an other disease, which he called the <hi>Hernia,</hi> and thereupon was charged to pay a third peny: there was no remedy, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome must be paid.</p>
   <p>In some like sort shall my Reader (in the perusall of this <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter</hi>) finde the matter to fall forth betweene me and M. <hi>Parsons,</hi> wherein may be obserued, that the more he contendeth and struggleth, the more he intangleth himselfe, and bewrayeth
<pb facs="5"/>
his owne diuers kindes of defaults. As first, to inueigh against me, as a <hi>passionate and intemperate man,</hi> whome his owne <note n="c" place="margin">

      <hi>Apologists</hi> haue held to be <hi>a man not intemperate:</hi> and for him to giue that censure, whome his owne <note n="d" place="margin">Quodlib. pag. 236.</note> fellow noted to be a man of a <hi>very violent and vnquiet spirit;</hi> and who himselfe, confesseth as it were his own intemperancy, by wishing that in his <hi>Mitigation</hi> he <note n="e" place="margin">Reck pag. 669</note>
      <hi>had not vsed such asperity of speeches against me.</hi> This sheweth that he had some cause to betake himselfe to a more <hi>sober and quiet Reckoning:</hi> wherein, notwithstanding, he dealeth so violently with me, (as my Reader will easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue) that he often falsifieth the Title of his booke, not only by heaping vp more grieuous Acerbities, then formerly he had done, but also by setting against me <hi>Gretzerus</hi> to plow vpon my backe, who is a stranger and a Iesuit, and so profuse and professed a railer, that <note n="f" place="margin">Cùm vnum tā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm exemplum tuae defensionis (<hi>he speaketh vnto Gretzer</hi>) in Frisiam alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum esset, hoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>psum propter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fandam male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicentiam non inueniret empto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem. <hi>Lubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Replic. lib. 1. cap. 1.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>whereas but one of his bookes was to be sould in West-Friesland, no man would buy it, because of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible slanders and railings which are therein.</hi> In all which kinde of raging tempests, I haue learned to cast this Anchor; <hi>Non qui patitur, sed qui facit iniuriam, miser est:</hi> And so I leaue this default of <hi>M. Parsons</hi> to receiue that name, which our Reader shall thinke to be most properly agreeable therevnto.</p>
   <p>In further examining of him hee bewrayed an <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> both by absurdities in <hi>Syllogizing;</hi> as concluding of <hi>Are,</hi> in steade of <hi>Make;</hi> and being earnestly charged therewith, hath not yeelded so much as one of his <hi>bare-faced groates</hi> for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; And also by certaine Grammatical quiddites, whilest as he maketh <hi>Verè,</hi> being ioyned with <hi>Celsus</hi> (as it signifieth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name) to be no true Latine; and the translating of <hi>Praesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, Praeseruation,</hi> and not <hi>Defence,</hi> to be false English; and diuers other the like crotchets hath be inforced in this his new <hi>Reckoning.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, there appeared a far greater fault, euen that <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> whereby he chargeth me with no lesse then <hi>fifty wilfull fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods;</hi> as though he had learned of the <hi>Steward</hi> in the Gospell to <note n="g" place="margin">Luc. 16. v. 6.</note>
      <hi>Sit downe and write fiftie,</hi> whom for that cause his Lord termed <hi>wise,</hi> but yet <hi>vniust,</hi> vniust to his Master, and wise for himselfe. Such <hi>vniust wisedome</hi> haue I found to abound in M.
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Parsons,</hi> who both in his booke of <hi>Mitigation,</hi> and in his new <hi>Reckoning</hi> obiecteth <hi>wilfull falshoods</hi> so vnconscionably, that he himselfe (as is proued in this <note n="h" place="margin">The margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall notes will point almost at euery one.</note>
      <hi>Encounter</hi>) is intangled in farre more then <hi>fiftie witting</hi> (except some had rather I should say witlesse) <hi>vntruths.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Of this kinde of dealing I haue more cause to complaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, then some others, because I finde strange measures offered vnto me by my Aduersaries. For M. <hi>Parsons</hi> his bent to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me hath beene such, as sometime to condemne me for omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wordes, which were by me expresly set downe; being in one place so violently transported with passiont, as to lay to my charge the word <hi>Fortasse,</hi> for not translating it, <hi>perhaps,</hi> although in the very same place I translated and englished it twise, <hi>Peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> which he could not but see, because once in the same place he repeated it accordingly: But it seemeth that in leuelling at me, as at his marke, he was onely left-eyed.</p>
   <p>Also (which is a profound step of malignity) he diuers times obiecteth for wilfull falsities the <hi>Omissions</hi> of such clauses, which, if they had beene alleadged to the full, might haue made much more for the aduantage of my cause. This was no more honest dealing then was that of the wife of <hi>Putiphar</hi> against <hi>Ioseph;</hi> He, for fear to bedrawnby her pulling him by the cloak to her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaste bedde, hastened away, and left his Cloake, a pledge and token of his chastitie: she, vpon his flight, cryeth out, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth that he came to abuse her, and for proofe she saith, <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 9.</note>
      <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde his garment;</hi> turning the same Cloake contrarily into an argument of his villany, and a Cloake of her owne dishonesty.</p>
   <p>Againe, whereas vpon the finding out of mine owne Escapes, I gaue my Reader <hi>Aduertisments</hi> therof in the end of my books, and added <hi>Corrections</hi> thereunto; there my <note n="k" place="margin">The Romish Apologists in their second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their Protestants A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of <hi>Delri{us}</hi> And their Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Answerer in his late pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, about the legitimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Q. Mary</hi> and <hi>Q. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi>
      </note> Aduersaries (yet I cannot accuse M. <hi>Parsons</hi> of this guilt) being directed to my errour by mine owne Aduertisement, doe forthwith vpbraid mee with it, neuer giuing any notice that it hath beene corrected. So dealt the enemies of <hi>Sampson,</hi> who first <hi>plowed with his owne Heifer,</hi> then (which is spoken of the same men) <note n="l" place="margin">Iud. 10. 20.</note>
      <hi>The Philistimes are vpon thee</hi> Sampson. I pray God that they fall not vpon the imprecation, which was extended vnto the imprecation, which was extended vnto the enemies of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who not regarding his repentaence for his fault, and the amendment
<pb facs="6"/>
of his life, did point onely at his escape, saying, <hi>So, so would we haue it.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But yet M. <hi>Parsons</hi> is in another point no lesse inexcuseble, whilst (which is his common guise) when foure or sixe, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times nine testimonies of his owne Authours are obiected against him, for matter of a point in Controuersie, he singleth out some one alleg ation, wherin he laboureth by art to make at least some shew and colour of misprision, and then dismisseth all the other witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as dumbe men, and passeth ouer the whole cause it selfe without mention at all; and so diuers times <hi>Altercando res non dirimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, sed perimitur.</hi> Can this be a tollerable manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in the disquisition of any truth? This is not all, but (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of late times) when our Aduersaries are muzzelled, as it were with the confessions of their owne Doctors, obiected for the iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our cause, they (as the AEgyptian Dogges are said to lappe here and there of the riuer <hi>Nilus,</hi> and runne their way) doe catch and snatch onely at peeces, and carpe at some allegations, crying out (although neuer so falsly) against <hi>Falshood,</hi> and then beholde <hi>The Booke,</hi> forsooth, <hi>is answered.</hi> In all these procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings they are, I confesse, <hi>in their generation, wise,</hi> but still <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust Aduersaries:</hi> And all uniust wisedome (we know) is before God iust nothing else, but miserable and damnable folly.</p>
   <p>Fourthly and lastly, by much wrastling we haue discouered two other euils, the one is an <hi>Hernia,</hi> euen the disposition of disloyaltie in very extraordinary maner brusting out, and betraying diuers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where euident Symptomes thereof: And the other is his <hi>Mentall Equiuocation,</hi> which we may call <hi>Alopecia;</hi> the rather because M. <hi>Parsons</hi> himselfe doth take an argument, for iustification of it, from the <hi>Foxe, which, by instinct of nature, can turne and skip forward and backward, to secure himselfe.</hi> Vpon which occasion I haue in one place intreated my Reader to accompany me in the <hi>Hunting of</hi> this <hi>Foxe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Howbeit, thou maiest not imagine (good Reader) that this whole <hi>Encounter</hi> is spent in vying and reuying of imputed <hi>false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods,</hi> or in our wrastlings together, and laying one the other in the dust: but here are inserted many other points of better consequence; as first, An answere to their challenge, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> some Romanists to be <hi>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> which is performed by
<pb facs="6"/>
examples in their chiefest Writers, by the confessions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of their owne men; together with an acknowledgment of their art in corrupting of bookes. Secondly, an answere to the slaunders which <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> fasteneth vpon <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> by imputing sundry <hi>Heresies</hi> vnto them. Thirdly, an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to a <hi>Challenge</hi> made by <hi>Mr. Parsons,</hi> concerning the Romish abuses of the testimonies of <hi>Fathers,</hi> for proofe of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> and that by the confession of their owne Writers; which is amply discharged, both against the allegations of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> and of <hi>Iodocus Coccius.</hi> Fourthly, an answere to a late Pamphlet, intituled <hi>A patterne of a Protestant;</hi> wherein the Authour maketh himselfe the Patterne of an <hi>arrogant, ignorant, intemperate,</hi> and <hi>vnconscionable</hi> man. Fiftly, there are diuers large Tracts, in confutation of <hi>Mentall Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation;</hi> especially in the answere to his <hi>Appendix,</hi> wherein there is displayed the egregious forgery of an <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> in that memorable <hi>Yorke-shire case;</hi> together with a freeing of the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the Oracles of truth, from that prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he draweth vpon them, by pretending that they pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize this blacke art. Sixtly, and lastly (to omit many other important coincidents) their doctrine of <hi>Rebellion</hi> is handled; In consutation whereof (for this was the cause of all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy against me) I was contented to be condemned for a most false accuser of them, vpon condition that they by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents would not iustifie their former Assertions. But alas, still they set their <hi>Practizes</hi> as seales to their <hi>Positions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Yet as when Bees beginne to cast, men vse to throw vp dust in the aire, to hinder their sight, least they should flie from their homes, and set in some other place, so deale our Aduersaries; for whensoeuer by any not orious practise they become so obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to cause their people to suspect their doctrin, and to incl. ne to our Profession: then, for staying of their departure, they in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy cast abroad in the ayre some forged Reports of some strange <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought in the honour of their cause; thus the fame of <hi>Garncts Straw</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> to alley the smoak of the <hi>Powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treason;</hi> and late the noyse of <hi>Diuels</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> it is said) <hi>carrying English Ministers away in a Coach,</hi> hath been raised to hinder the last sbrill sound of that Royall blood.</p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p>I returne to my <hi>Encounter against Mr.</hi> Parsons <hi>his Recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> to let thee vnderstand (good Reader) that I haue vsed him more calmely then, (I will not say) my cause (for, alas, Who am I, that I may not be iniuried?) but peraduenture, then thou wilt thinke the <hi>Cause</hi> it selfe would permit: And especially in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry entrance into the Answere vnto his <hi>Appendix</hi> (when first I heard of any certainty of his death) the point of my Style did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, in a manner, to die with him; for so I thought it my duety, least I might seeme [<hi>Caeco scandalum</hi>] to deale too personally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, who could not answere for himselfe.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Secondly, to my owne selfe I say,</hi>
      <note n="m" place="margin">Aug.</note> Non est intuendum quàm amarum, sed qùam falsum quod audio, &amp; quàm verax pro cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus nomine audio.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, to my Aduersaries I say, that by their practises in carping at allegations, whilst they sought to put out the candles, they haue but topped them, and made them shine more clearely; as may euidently appeare by this <hi>Encounter.</hi> Notwithstanding, whosoeuer shall intend to <hi>Reply</hi> vnto this, or any other booke of mine, let him (if he expect to be answered) not carpe at peeces, but proceede soberly and orderly from point to point in the cause; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise I must say with the Apostle, <note n="n" place="margin">Galat. 6. 17.</note>
      <hi>Let none put mee from henceforth vnto businesse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Finally to thee (Christian Reader, if thou thinke thy selfe a Scholler) I say with S. <note n="o" place="margin">Hier. l. 3 Proëm in Epist.</note>
      <hi>Ierom; Figas ipse stylum; tria, (vt dicitur) verba cōiungas; sudes paululum, experiare temetipsū, &amp; ex la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore proprio discas ignoscere laborātib{us}.</hi> And although thou be of another cōditiō, yet for my iustificatiō, against <hi>M. Parsons</hi> (who called me a <hi>Falsificator</hi>) I say as <hi>S. Aug.</hi> did in answer to <hi>Petiliā;</hi>
      <note n="p" place="margin">Me Petilianus Manichaū esse dicit, loquens de me Conscientia, boc ego iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico me non esse, loquens de meâ Conscientiâ: eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gite cui credatis.</note>
      <hi>He saith</hi> (saith <hi>S. Aug.</hi>) <hi>that I am a Manichee, speaking of my cōsciēce, &amp; I say I am not so, speaking of mine own consciēce, &amp; now choose whō thou wilt beleeue.</hi> Or eis (because the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is put vnto thy proof) I rather say with S. <hi>Paul</hi>
      <note n="q" place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 21.</note>
      <hi>Try al things, &amp; keep that wch is good:</hi> Try this book, and my faithfulnes by it, wherin (least any may be suspected for my defects) I professe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage no testimony, that is noted in the margent, which I haue not perused &amp; examined with mane own eyes. Thus I end, beseeching our Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> to illuminate thee with the spirite of <hi>Truth,</hi> and to preserue us to the glory of his sauing <hi>Grace.</hi>
