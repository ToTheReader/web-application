   <head>TO MY FELLOVV BRETHREN the Ministers of Devon and Cornwall, whose exceptions made against subscription follow to be examined.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Elbeloved in the Lorde (for so I call you) as vvishing your loue to that Church, which hath nurtured you in the truth, &amp; from your infancie hath tendred al good meanes, that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught in the worde, may now a many of you teach others. Little whē you were in yeares, and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Gospel nestled your selues vnder her wings, a kinde mother shee was vnto you. Remember as you can doe nothing against truth but for truth, so least of al should you doe ought against her, whom God hath inabled to do much for you. Iniurie her not, because shee is alone, for shee is not alone. The guide of her youth is absent in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but communicateth vnto her the graces of his spirite. Al which so farre as they are spared her, shee spareth them you, and wil rather defrawd her owne bowels of life, then bee wanting vnto you in any thing shee can giue you suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour: if Christ be not her husband, nor shee his wife, plead with her on Gods name, plead with her and spare not. Time was when shee begat some of you to Christ in her peace, others of you in her bonds, al of you in the Gospel, and it is not long since. Shew the time, the cause, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>(O my brethren) what hath shee done vnto you, or wherein hath shee grieved you:<note place="margin">Mich 6.3.</note> testifie against her. Surely shee found favour in the eies of as gracious <hi>a Queene,</hi> as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the earth bare since Debora rose vp a mother in Jsrael:<note place="margin">Iudg. 5.7.</note> O my brethren remember the Raigne of her predecessor, what sorrow of heart possest those good soules, who desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to see the daies you see, but their life was taken from them in the flames, and in their blood may yee knowe the righteousnesse of the Lord. For he gaue you <hi>a Princesse</hi> so famous throughout al kingdomes, as the generations that come after wil cal vs blessed: since when in the fulnesse of her daies gathered to her fathers in peace, see the Church your mother, how the Lord loveth her, &amp; in the fal of that <hi>late Lady our Soveraigne</hi> hath not left you comfortlesse. For with infinite favours he hath looked vpon you, the sex bettred, age renued as the daies of youth, friendes multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, the kingdome inlarged, the Gospel of peace conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued with hopes ful of greater successe then heretofore. And shal shee thus graced by the highest in a kingdome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue wrongs at their hands, whose ministry, and wisdome might studdie her contentment? Be advised in your cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, &amp; know of a truth, god wil avendge iniuries that spring from headstrong disobedience. Is shee become your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, or you hers, because shee liketh not to bee ordered by everie one, loosing their time, and due praise, when better it were for them, &amp; her, they quieted their giddy thoughts with doctrines of faith, and repentance, &amp; not run a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding after every vnsetled, rash, abortiue fancie, platting that insteed of <hi>our commendable discipline,</hi> so long appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, fetching their feagaries vp and downe in a forrest of their wilde imaginations, like <hi>Saul</hi> in the desert when hee sought his fathers Asses?<note place="margin">8. Sam. 9.3.</note> Doth displeasure arise from you,
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>because God hath inlarged <hi>the kings Maiestie,</hi> his royall heart towards her in maintenance of vnity and godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord?

      <hi>Is not Optatus his complaint verified of these time? VVhat with it is lawfull say we, it is not lawful say ye, the people are in a mammering, and cannot tell what to say.</hi> But men red in histories resolue to say and (build vpon it) you may say what they resolue: <hi>as Constantine writing to the Bishop of Siracusa. This breach hath hitherto lasted by a certaine verie bad winching, and kicking against lawful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</hi> And it is more then high time, some way, or other it were wel made vp. The course <hi>Constantine</hi> tooke in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for learned men either way in the question affected, did <hi>our religious king</hi> follow, and <hi>at his honour of Hampton court</hi> before himselfe and the Lords of his privie Councell were assembled, many of the graue Bishops, and Prelates of this Realme, &amp; many other learned men, as wel of those that are conformable to the state of the Church establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as of those that dissented. Where what paines, what patience in hearing, and replying, and what the indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and vprightnesse of heart in determining, truth cannot but report, was singular and admirable. Yet that wee may see, there is no order in confusion, nor truth in falshoode, nor loue in preiudice, the principal men of learning, &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie resting contented, now others will needs to it a fresh, perswading themselues belike, they can say more, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their superiours, whose iudgment sometimes they did reverence, and now as little care for. These men (punies though they be in learning, and few of them but proselites in sound Divinitie) haue somewhat to say, and that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="20" facs="6"/>so much, as is able to tire out a man, should hee haue <hi>Iosua</hi> his strength,<note place="margin">Iosua 10 5.</note> when he fought against fiue kings in one battle. But in the end, though with some trouble God gaue victorie. So may our ende bee, if God see it good, though in reason, what end shoulde wee expect of endlesse contradiction.<note place="margin">Luke 5.5.</note> Yet <hi>Peters</hi> obedience hartneth vs not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, with whom it went wrong at one time a whole night togither, neverthelesse anon after he sped better, then hee thought for. Whither our God in mercie wil deale so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously with these poore labours, we must trie: and if not: we are not better then Kings and Princes, whose greatnesse in reason might commaunde somewhat, and yet sometimes prevaile not. Yea we haue learned that the Disciple is not aboue his Maister.<note place="margin">Math. 10.24.</note> Jf the worst come to the worst, wee can say but,<note place="margin">Isa 49.4.</note> what was prophecied of our Savior. We haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in vaine, we haue spent our strength in vaine, &amp; for nothing, but our iudgment is with the Lord, &amp; our worke with God. To him we referre the issue to whom wee giue glorie. <hi>Amen.</hi>
