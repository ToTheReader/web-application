These fragments of my conceites were going to print<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

receiue by vntrue Coppies, or by some garnishment, which it mought please any that should set them forth to bestow vpon them. Therefore I helde it best discreation to publish them my selfe as they passed long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe from my pen, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disgrace, then the weaknesse of the Author. And as I did euer hold, there mought be as great a vanitie in retiring and withdrawing mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites (except they bee of some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) from the world, as in obtruding them: So in these particulars I haue played my selfe the Inquisitor, and find nothing to my vnderstanding in them contrarie or infectious to the state of Religion, or manners, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as I suppose) medicinable. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I disliked now to put them out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will bee like the late new halfe-pence, which though the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were good, yet the peeces were

small. But since they would not stay with their Master, but would needes trauaile abroade, I haue preferred them to you that are next my selfe, Dedicating them, such as they are, to our loue, in the depth whereof (I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
