      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Rchimenedes,</hi> the great and famous philosopher, (to whom <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Marcellus</hi> for his knowledge sake graunted life, and after v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Nygromancie deserued death) being demaunded what time was, sayd: that time was the inuentor of al noueltyes, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestre certaine of antiquities, whiche seeth of it selfe the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the middest, and the ending of al things. And finally, time is he that endeth al. No man can deny but the diffinition of thys Philosopher is true: for if tyme could speake, he would certifye vs of sundry things wherin we doubt, and declare them as a wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of sight. Admyt al things perishe, and haue an ende: yet one thing is exempted, and neuer hath end, which is truth, that amongest al things is priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged in such wise, that she triumpheth of time, and not tyme of her. For accordyng to the dyuine sayeng it shal be more easy to se heauen, and earth to fal: then once truth to perish. There is nothing so entyer, but may be diminished: nothynge so healthful, but may be diseased: nothing so strong, but may be broken: neyther any thing so wel kept, but may be corrupted. And finally I say, there is nothing but by time is ruled and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, saue only truth, which is subiect to none The fruits of the spring time haue no force to giue sustenaunce, nor perfait swetenes to giue any sauour, but after that the sommer is past, and haruest commeth, they rype, and then all that we eate nourisheth more and gyueth a better tast, I meane by this, when the world beganne to haue wyse men, the more Philosophers were estemed for their good maners, the more they deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be reproued for their euyl vnderstandyng. <hi>Plato</hi> in his second booke of the comon wealthe sayd, that the auncient Phylosophers) aswell <hi>Grekes,</hi> as <hi>Egiptians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Caldees</hi>) which firste beganne to beholde the starres of heauen, and ascended to the toppe of the mount <hi>Olimpus,</hi> to vew the influences, and mocions of the planets on the earthe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued rather pardon of their ignoraunce, then prayse for their knowledge. <hi>Plato</hi> sayde further, that the Phylosophers which were before vs, were the first that gaue themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to searche out the truth of the Elements in the heauen, and the first whych sowed errors in things natural of the earth. <hi>Homere</hi> in his <hi>Iliade</hi> agreyng wyth <hi>Plato,</hi> saith. I condemne al that the auncient Phylosophers knew, but I greatly commend theym for that they desired to know. Certes <hi>Homere</hi> sayd wel, and <hi>Plato</hi> sayd not amysse: for if amongest the first Philosophers this ignoraunce had not raygned, there had not bene such contrary sectes in euery schoole. He that hath redde, not the bookes which are lost, but the opinions whych the auncient phylosophers had, wyl graunt me: thoughe the knowledge were one, yet their sectes were dyuers: that is to say. <hi>Cinici, Stoici, Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mici, Platonici,</hi> and <hi>Epicurei,</hi> whych were as variable the one from the other in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, as they were repugnaunt in their condicions. I wyll not, neyther reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that my penne should be so much dysmesured, as to reproue those whyche are dead, for to gyue the glory al onely to them that are alyue: for the one of them knew not al, neyther were the other ignoraunt of all. Yf he deserueth thankes that sheweth me the way, whereby I ought to go: no lesse then meriteth he, whiche warneth me of the place wherin we may erre, The ignoraunce of our forefathers, was but a gyde to kepe vs from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rryng: for the errour of them shewed vs the truth, to theyr much prayse, and to our great shame. Therfore I dare boldly say, if we y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> are now, had bene then, we had knowen lesse then they knew, And if those were nowe, whych were then, they would haue knowen more then we know. And that this is true it appeareth wel, for that the auncyent phylosophers, through the great desyre they had to know the trouth, of small
<pb facs="14"/>
and bypathes haue made brode and large wayes, the whych we now wil not sée, nor yet walke therin. Wherfore we haue not so muche cause to bewayle their ignoraunce, as they had reason to complayne of our negligence, For truth, whych is (as <hi>Aulus Gelius</hi> saith) the doughter of time, hath reueled vnto vs the errours which we ought to eschew: and the true doctrine which we ought to folow. What is ther to se, but hath bene sene? what to dyscouer, but hath ben discouered? what is there to reade, but hath bene red? what to write, but hath bene writen? what is ther to know, but hath ben knowen? now a dayes humaine malice is so expert, men so we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>able, and our wittes so subtyl, that we want nothyng to vnderstand, neither good, nor euyl, And we vndoe our selues by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng that vayne knowledge, which is not necessary for our life. No man vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ignoraunce can excuse his fault, since al men know, al men reade, and al men learne, the whych is euident in this case, as it shal appeare. Suppose the ploughe man, and the learned man do go to the law, and you shall perceyue the labourer (vnder that simple garment) to forge to his councellour halfe a dosen of malicious trickes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude his aduersary as fynely: as the other that is leerned shalbe able to expound. 2. or 3. chapters of this booke. If men would employ their knowledge to honesty, wisedome, pacience, and mercy, it were wel: but I am sory they know so much, only for that they subtilly disceiue, and by vsury abuse their neighbours, and kepe that they haue vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gotten, and dayly getting more inuenting new trades Finally I say if they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knowledge, it is not to amend their life: but rather to encrease their goods. If the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil could slepe, as men do, he might safely slepe: for wheras he waketh to deceiue vs, we wake to vndoe our selues, wel, suppose that al these heretofore I haue sayd is true: Let vs now leue aside craft, &amp; take in hand knowledge, The knowledge which we attaine to is smal, &amp; that whych we shold attaine to so great: that al y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we know, is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> least part of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we are ignoraunt Euen as in things natural, the elamentes haue their operacions, accordyng to the variety of time: so moral doctrines (as the aged haue succeded) and sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were discouered. Truly al fruites come not together, but when one faileth, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commeth in season. I meane, that neyther al the Doctours among the Christians, nor al the phylosophers among the gentyles were concurrant at one time, but after the death of one good, ther came another better. The chiefe wysedome, whych measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth al thyngs by iustyce: and disparseth them accordyng to his bounty, wyl not that at one time they should be al wyse men, and at an other time al simple. For it had not ben reason the one should haue had the fruite, and the other the leaues, The old world that ran in Saturnes dayes (otherwyse called the golden world) was of a truth muche este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them that saw it, and greatly commended of them that wrote of it. That is to say, it was not gilded by the Sages, whych did gilde it: but because there was no euyl men, whych dyd vngild it. For as thexperience of the meane estate &amp; nobility teacheth vs, of one only parson dependeth aswel the fame and renoume, as the infamy of a hole house, and parentage. That age was called golden, that is to saye of gold: and this our age is called yronne, that is to say of yron. This dyfference was not, for that gold then was found, &amp; now yron: nor for that in this our age ther is want of theym that be sage: but because the number of them surmounteth, that be at this day malicious. I confesse one thing, and suppose many wil fauour me in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same. <hi>Phauorin</hi> the philosopher (which was maister to <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> and his especial frend) sayde ofttimes, that the phyloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in old time were holden in reputacion, bycause ther were few teachers, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learners. We now a daies se the contrary, for infinite are they whych presume to be maysters: but few are they whych humble theym selues to be scholers. A man maye know how litle wise men are estemed at this houre, by the greate veneracion that the phylosophers had in the old tyme. What a matter is it to se <hi>Homere</hi> amongest the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cians Salomon</hi> amongest the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> Lycurgus amongest the <hi>Lacedomoniens:</hi> Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romeus also amongest the <hi>Grekes,</hi> Ptolomeus amongeste the <hi>Egiptians.</hi> Liui amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geste the Romaynes, and <hi>Cicero</hi> lykewyse amongeste the <hi>Latines?</hi> Appolonius a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Indians,</hi> and Secundus amongest the <hi>Assirians.</hi>

      <pb facs="15"/>How happy were those philosophers (to be as they were in those dayes) when the world was so ful of simple personnes, and so destitute of sage men: that there flocked greate nombers out of dyuers contries, and straung nacions, not only to here their doctrine: but also to se their persons. The glorious saint Hierome in the prologue to the bible sayth. When Rome was in her prosperitie, thenne wrote <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> his decades: yet notwithstāding, men came to Rome more to speake with <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> then to se Rome or the high capitol therof <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> writing to his frend <hi>Pulio,</hi> said these words. Thou shalt vnderstand my frend, I was not chosen Emperour for the noble bloude of my predecessours, nor for the fauoure I had amongest them now present: for ther were in Rome of greater bloud and riches then I, but the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> my maister set his eyes vpon me, and the emperour <hi>Anthony</hi> my father in law chose me for his sonne in law, for no other cause, but for that they saw me a frend of the sages, &amp; an enemy of the ignoraunt. Happie was Rome to chose so wise an emperoure, and no lesse happye was he to attaine to so great an empire. Not for that he was heire to his predecessoure, but for that he gaue his mynd to study. Truly, if that age then were happie to enioye hys person: no lesse happie shal ours be now at this present, to enioy his doctrine. <hi>Salust</hi> sayth, they deserued great glory, whych did worthy feates: and no lesser renowme me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited they, whych wrote them in high stile. What had Alexander the great ben, if <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Curtius</hi> had not writen of him? what of <hi>Vlisses,</hi> if Homere hadde not bene borne? what had <hi>Alcibiades</hi> bene, if <hi>Zenophon</hi> had not exalted him? what of <hi>Cirus,</hi> if the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher <hi>Chilo</hi> had not put his actes in memory? what had bene of <hi>Pirrus,</hi> kinge of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> if <hi>Hermicles</hi> cronicles were not? what had bene of <hi>Scipio</hi> the great <hi>Affricane,</hi> if it had not bene for the decades of <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>tus Liuius?</hi> what had ben of <hi>Traiane,</hi> if the renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Plutarche</hi> had not bene his frend? what of <hi>Nerua</hi> and <hi>Anthonius</hi> the meke, if <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> the Greke had not made mencion of them? how should we haue knowen the stout courage of <hi>Cesar,</hi> and the great prowesse of <hi>Pompeius,</hi> if <hi>Lucanus</hi> had not writen them? what of the twelue <hi>Cesars,</hi> if <hi>Suetonius tranquillus</hi> hadde not compiled a booke of their lyues? and how should we haue knowen the antiquityes of the Hebrues, if the vpright <hi>Iosephe</hi> had not ben? who could haue knowen the commyng of the <hi>Lombardes</hi> into I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, if <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> had not writ it? how could we haue knowen the comming in, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> going out, and end of the <hi>Gothes</hi> in Spayne, if the curious <hi>Rodericus</hi> had not shewed it vnto vs? By these things that we haue spoken of before, the readers may perceyue what is dew vnto the Historiographers: who in my opinion, haue left as great memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of theym for that they wrote with their pennes: as the prynces haue done for that they dyd with their swordes. I confesse I deserue not to be named amongest the sages, neyther for that I haue wryten and translated, nor yet for that I haue composed. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (the sacred and deuyne letters set a side) ther is nothing in the world so curiouslye wryten, but neadeth correction, &amp; as I say of the one, so wil I say of the other, and that is: as I wyth my wyl do renounce the glorye, which the good for my learning woulde gyue me: so in like maner euyl men shal not want, that agaynst my wil wil seke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame it, We other writers, smally esteme the labour and paynes we haue to wryte, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in dede we are not ignoraunt of a thousand enuyous tongues, that wyl back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite it, Many now a dayes are so euil taught, or to say better, so enuyous, that when the aucthour laboreth in his study, they playe in the streates: when he waketh, they slepe. When he fasteth, they eate: when he sitteth turninge the leaues of the booke they go huntyng after vices abrode: yet for al that, they wyl presume to iudge, depraue, and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deme an other mans doctrine, as if they had the aucthoritye that <hi>Plato</hi> had in grece, or the eloquence that <hi>Cicero</hi> had in Rome. When I find a man in the latyn tongue well sene, his vulgar tongue wel polished, in histories wel grounded, in Greke letters ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expert, and desirous to spend his tyme wyth good bookes: this so heroical and noble a parsonage, I would desire him to put my doctrine vnder his fete For it is no shame, for a vertuous and wise man, to be corrected of an other wyse man. Yet I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know what pacience can suffer, or hart dissemble, when two or thre be assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>githers at meate, and after (at the table, or otherwyse) one of them taketh a booke at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture

in his handes, against the whiche another will say it is to longe, and another wyll saye it speaketh not to the purpose: another it is obscure, and another the wordes are not well couched: another wyll say, all that that is spoken is fained, one will say he speaketh nothing of profite, another he is to curious, and the other he is to malicious. So that in speaking thus, the doctrine remaineth suspicious, and the authour scapeth not scotte fre. Suppose them to be therfore suche that speake it (as I haue spoken of) &amp; that at the table doe finde suche faultes, suer they deserue pardon: for they speake not according to the bookes whiche they haue redde, but accord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>nge to the cuppes of wyne whiche they haue drunke. For he that taketh not that in geste, whiche is spoken at the table, knoweth not what gesting meaneth. It is an olde custome to murmure at ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous dedes, and into this rule entreth not onely those that make them, but also those whiche wryt them afterwardes: Which thing semeth to be true, for that <hi>Socrates</hi> was reproued of <hi>Plato▪ Plato</hi> of <hi>Aristotle. Aristotle</hi> of <hi>Auerois, Sicilius</hi> of <hi>Vulpitius. Lelius</hi> of <hi>Varro, Marinus</hi> of <hi>Ptolomens, Ennius</hi> of <hi>Horace, Seneca</hi> of <hi>Aulus Gellius, Crastonestes</hi> of <hi>Strabo, Thessale</hi> of <hi>Gallian, Hermagoras</hi> of <hi>Cicero. Cicero</hi> of <hi>Salust, Origines</hi> of saint Hierome, Hierome of <hi>Rufinus, Rufinus</hi> of <hi>Donatus, Donatus</hi> of <hi>Prosper,</hi> and <hi>Prosper</hi> of <hi>Lupus.</hi> Then sithe that in these men, and in their workes hath bene suche neade of correction, whiche were men of great knowledge, and Lanternes of the worlde: it is no maruayle at all that I haue suche fortune, since I knowe so litle as I doe He may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely be counted vaine and light, whiche at the first sight, as for onely once reading, wil rashely iudge that, whiche a wyse man with muche diligence, and studie hath wrytten. The authours, and wryters are ofttimes reproued, not of them whiche can translate, and compile workes: but of those whiche can not reade, and yet lesse vnderstande them. to thintent simple folkes shold count them wise, &amp; take their partes in condemning this worke and esteme him for a great wyse man. I take God to witnes, who can iudge, whether my intention were good or ill to compile this worke, and also I say this my doctrine at the feete of wyse and vertuous men, to the ende they may be protectours, &amp; defendours of the same. For I truste in God, though some would come to blame (as dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers doe) the simple wordes whiche I spake: yet others would not faile to relate the good intention that I ment. And to declare further I say, that diuers haue wrytten of the tyme of the said <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> as <hi>Herodian</hi> wrote litle, <hi>Eutropius</hi> lesse, <hi>Lampri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> not so much, and <hi>Iulius capitolinus</hi> somewhat more. Likewyse ye ought to know, that the maisters whiche taught <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> sciences, were <hi>Iunius Rusticus, Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Catullus, Sextus Cheronensis,</hi> whiche was nephewe to the great <hi>Plutarque.</hi> These three were those, that principally as witnesses of sight, wrate the most parte of his life and doctrine. Many may marueile to heare tell of the doctrine of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it hath ben kept hid and secret a great whyle, and that of myne owne head I haue inuented it. And that there neuer was any <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> in the worlde. I know not what to saye nowe vnto them, for it is euident to all those whiche haue red any thyng, that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was husbande to <hi>Faustine,</hi> father to <hi>Comodus,</hi> brother to <hi>Annius Verus,</hi> and sonne in lawe to <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> the seuenth (of Rome) Emperour. Those which say I onely haue made this doctrine, truly I thanke them for so saying, but not for their so meaning For truly, the Romaines would haue set my Image in Rome for perpetuall renowne, if so graue sentences should haue proceaded from my head. We see that in our tyme, which was neuer sene before, and heare that we neuer heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We practise not in a newe worlde, and yet we marueyle that there is at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent a newe booke. Not for that I was curious to discouer <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> or studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to translate him. For truly it is worthy he be noted of wyse personnes, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of equious tongues. For it chaunceth oftentimes in hunting that the moste sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest man killeth the deare. The last thing which the Romaines conquered in Spaine, was <hi>Cantabria,</hi> whiche was a citie in <hi>Nauarra,</hi> ouer against <hi>Lagrogne,</hi> and situated in a highe countrey, where there is nowe a vaine of vynes. And the Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> whiche destroyed it, made tenne bookes <hi>De bello Cantabrico,</hi> where are thinges wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of notinge, and no lesse pleasaunt in reading, which happened vnto him in the same
<pb facs="16"/>
conquest. As <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was brought me from Florence, so was this other booke of the warres of <hi>Cantabrie</hi> brought me from Colleine. If perhappes I tooke paynes to translate this booke, as fewe haue done whyche haue sene it, they woulde speake the lyke of it, that they dyd of <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> Bycause menne are so long in speakyng, and so briefe in studienge, that without anye let or shame, they will a vowe no booke to be in the worlde this daye, but that they haue redde, or seen it. I haue as muche pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in this writynge, whyche is humaine: as other doctours haue done in matters, whyche are deuine. It is not translated worde for worde, but sentence for sentence. For we other interpreters are not bounde, to gyue wordes by measure: but it suffiseth vs, to gyue sentencis by wayghte. I began to studye this woorke in the yeare, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande, fiue hundred, and eyghtene, and vntill the yeare, a thousande, fiue hundred, twentie and foure, I coulde neyther vnderstand, nor knowe, wherein I was occupied. and albeit I kept it secreat .vi. yeres yet it was knowen abroade whervpon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour his maiestie being with the feauer diseased, sent to me for it to passe the tyme away And I (according to his commaundement) shewed him <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> that then was vncorrected, and humbly beseaching him sayde: that for recompence of all my trauaile, I desyred no other rewarde, but that no man in hys chamber myghte copye the booke. And I in the meane tyme proceded to accomplyshe the worke, Bycause I did not meane in suche maner to publyshe it: for otherwyse, I sayd hys maiestie shoulde be euil serued, and I also of my purpose preuented: but my synnes caused, that the booke was copyed, and conueyed from one to another. And by the handes of Pages sondrie tymes wryten▪ so that there encreased dayly in it errours, and faultes. And synce there was but one originall copye, they brought it vnto me to correct, whiche if it coulde haue spoken, woulde haue complained it selfe, more of them that dyd wryte it: then of those whyche dyd steale it. And thus when I hadde finyshed the woorke, and thought to haue publys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed it, I perceaued that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was now imprinted at Ciuile. And in thys case, I take the readers to be iudges, betwene me and the Imprinters, because they maye sée, whether it maye stande with lawe, and iustice, that a booke whyche was to his imperiall maiestye dedicated, the auctour thereof beyng but an infant, and the booke so vnparfecte and vncorrect, without my consent or knowledge shoulde be published.</p>
   <p>Notwithstandynge they ceased not, but printed it agayne in Portugall, and also in the kyngdome of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> And if the fyrste impression was faultye, truly the seconde and the thirde were no lesse. So that whyche was wryten for the wealthe of all men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye, eache man dyd applye to the profite of hym selfe particularlye. There chaunced another thynge of this booke called the golden booke of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> whyche I am ashamed to speake, but greater shame they shoulde haue, that so dishonestly haue done. That is, some made them selues to be auctours of the whole woorke, others saye that parte of it was made, and compyled of their owne heades: the whyche appeareth in a booke in print, wherein the auctour dyd lyke a man voyde of all honestye, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther booke, one vsed lykewyse the words whyche <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> spake to Faustine, when she asked him the key of hys studye. After these theues came to my knowledge, iudge you whether it were inoughe to proue my pacience. For I had rather they hadde robbed me of my goodes, then taken awaye my renowme. By this all men shal see, that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was not then corrected, nor in any place parfecte, wherby they myght perceaue, that it was not my minde to translate <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> but to make a dial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> for Prynces, whereby all christien people maye be gouerned and ruled. And as the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is shewed for the vse of many: so I woulde profite my selfe, with that whyche the wise men had spoken and wryten. And in this sorte proceadeth the worke, wherin I put one, or two Chapiters of mine, and after I put some epistles of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and other doctrine of some auncient men. Let not the reader be disceaued, to thynke that the one, and the other is of the auctor. For although the phrase of the languag be mine, yet I confesse the greatest part that I knew, was of another man, although the historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and doctours (with whome I was holpen) were manye: yet the doctrine whyche I
<pb facs="16"/>
wrote, was but one. I will not denye, but I haue left out some thinges whiche were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous: in whose steade I haue placed, thinges more swete, and profitable. So that it neadeth good wittes, to make that whyche semeth in one language grosse, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to giue it the apparaunce of golde. I haue deuided into three bookes this present diall of Princes. The first treateth, that the Prince ought to be a good christian. The secound, howe he ought to gouerne his wife, and children. The thirde teacheth, how he shoulde gouerne his person, and his commen wealthe. I had begon another booke, wherin was conteyned, howe a Prince shoulde behaue him selfe in his courte, and pallace, but the importunitie of my frendes, caused me to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe my pen, to the ende I might bringe this worke to lighte.</p>
