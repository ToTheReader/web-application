   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OT only novv, but also for the tyme to come, some in ENGLAND may be taken to be Learned vvho are not, and some may neither be Learned, nor yet taken so to be. Againe some may be Learned vvho are not so
<pb facs="3"/> taken, and some others may be both Learned and taken so to be; vvhereunto may be added a fift sort of such, as take themselues to be Learned, vvhen indeed they be not. And vnto this last sort of Men, for certaine reasons (not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heere to be related) this Worke is but reseruedly dedicated; I meane so far forth only, as they shall vouchsafe to regard it: but principally and directly it is presented vnto the first and second sortes of men aboue mentioned; that is to say, it is directed first vnto those vvho be neither Learned, nor yet taken to be so, to the end they may be able to knovv somevvhat; and next vnto those others vvho be indeed Learned, though they take not themselues so to be; vvho also may esteeme it as presented to them, to the end they may better their supposed Knovvledge: For vvhich respects I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> this Worke vvillbe gratefull to them both.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>And therfore if any of those others, vnto vvhome it is not directly dedicated should perhaps go about to calumniate the same, or any part therof; he may vvith more reason and reputation saue that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: because neither is the Worke dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated vnto him, nor yet composed by men of his rank, or degree in Learning, but by certaine curious Trauailers, as the follovving discourse vvill more plainly declare, vvho being indeed Courtiers, make no profession of any other Science but Humanity only: and therfore for a man of his skill to make any competence at all vvith these, or to controle or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish their Endeauours, this he ought not in reason to do, nor yet permit others to do it. And so much also the lesse, because in Dialogues it is not to be expected, that all vvhich is vvritten, is to be continuate doctrine, but that some Interlocutions are to enter betvvixt; the vvhich being passed ouer, then the matter of doctrine
<pb facs="4"/> returneth againe.</p>
   <p>This trace hath <hi>Count Baltazar Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi> in his <hi>Courtier,</hi> and <hi>Boetius</hi> in his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation</hi> directly follovved; and <hi>Plato</hi> in his Compositions more then any other. The vvhich Interlocutions though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they may not fall out still to be so pleasing as the doctrine it selfe; yet so long as they be not vnproportionable to the matter vvhich they concerne, they may be permitted to passe: because vvhen all is done, he vvho vvill haue good store of corne, must be content vvithall to take some chaffe. Yet I cannot vvell deny, but that some motions I haue had, to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish heere and there some discourses of the Interlocutors, had I not considered vvithall, that one thing it is to publish a Booke, and another thing to publish but a Pamphlet; and also a Booke or Bookes of such particuler titles, as vvithout some amplification made, some of them doe render of themselues but small discourse
<pb facs="4"/> of matter.</p>
   <p>And therfore I haue resolued to let the Bookes passe vvith all, and the very same speaches, vvhich the Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, haue vpon different occasions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed: because it vvill easily be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that Argumentations made by vvord of mouth, cannot so closely be compacted togeather, as may things more considerately set dovvne by pen; though I hope it vvill appeare vvithall, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably vnto other English Workes, no vvant of doctrine vvill heare be found. All vvhich is done for the instruction of those only, vvho albeit they do not aspire to be counted Learned, may yet haue a desire to knovv the scope of all Sciences, besides much Morality, &amp; some Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my also, vvhich they may find here. So as vvith a fevv dayes reading they may know much, and vvith the price of one only volume quit the cost of many. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, diuers questions no lesse ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="5 letters">

      <pb facs="5"/> then profitable, not handled in these tvvo Volumes (as namely touching Policy, and many other curious matters) are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued for the other Volumes ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to the end it may be seene in the meane vvhile, hovv grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully these first vvilbe accepted.</p>
