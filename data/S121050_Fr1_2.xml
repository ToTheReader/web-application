   <head>THE PREFACE TO the Catholikes of England.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD saue you Right HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOVRABLE, and most worthy Champions. Giue me leaue awhile to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt your patience. And if it be not troublesome vnto you, heare me a word or two. I will not hould you long. Two yeares agoe I wrote two little bookes, concerning the Kings Primacy: the one against the <hi>Apology,</hi> and <hi>Preface Monitory</hi> of the High and Mighty Prince, <hi>Iames</hi> King of <hi>Great-Brittaine:</hi> the other against the <hi>Torture of Tortus,</hi> or the Kings Chaplayne. This thing your Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickes
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
tooke heauily, and presētly waged warre against me in their Kings quarrell; especially <hi>M. VVilliam Tooker, M. Richard Tompson, M. Robert Burhill,</hi> and <hi>M. Henry Salclebridge.</hi> Yet for all this I do not fly or feare. Nay there be many reasons which make me more couragious. First the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Cause. Then your Faith and Constancy. And lastly the Iarres and deadly Discords of my Aduersaryes one against another.</p>
   <p>Concerning the right of the Cause, which I am to defend, what need I say any thing? I am to fight for the Church of Christ, for the honour and Obedience of Prelates, and for the example and custome of my Forefathers. And heerin, shall I feare any man? Hath not your faith and constancy which is testified to the whole world, by your daily imprisonments, fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, punishmēts, yea death it self suffered for Christ, already shakē off my drowsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? Whome would it not animate and spurre forwards: seing that in this case, I may with good reasō apply that saying of
<pb n="3" facs="3"/>
the Apostle vnto you, <hi>Spectaculum facti estis Deo, Angelis, &amp; Hominibus:</hi> you are made a spectacle to God, Angels, and Men? To God, who behouldeth your Combats, giueth you strengh to get the victory, and prepareth a Crowne for your Triumph. To Angells, who admire, that, liuing in this frayle flesh, you do not feare the mighty powers of Hell; and withall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, that so valiant Champions are cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge. You are made a spectacle to men, who throughout the whole world are wonderfully incensed and styrred vp by your example, vertue, and patience, to vndergoe the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats and conflicts for Christ.</p>
   <p>Besides this, the disagreements and iarrings of my Aduersaries amongst thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are so many, and their forces so scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered &amp; disordered, that I do not esteeme them to be greatly feared. If perhaps you know not these their discords; heere I offer and dedicate this little Booke vnto you, wherin it is particulerly shewed in what points they disagree. If your leasure

serue you, read it, and hope well of the issue. In the meane while, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my selfe to the Combat, and when it is tyme, I shall intreat you to be the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators. Fare ye well, and take in good part, I beseech you, this m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
