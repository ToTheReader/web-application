   <head>A PREFACE to <hi>the Reader.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Ivers men, diuersly affected (as we may see in the sundry exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all ages and persons) haue sought diuersly to solace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in this life. To passe ouer the manifolde delights where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a man is naturally recreated in the sundry changes and chances of his time: some have beene well pleased in the remembrance of their owne pristine adventures, whereof they haue made vse for the better Instruction of themselues: some, in the reading, hearing, or rehearsing of the Actes and Histories of Antiquitie: some in often conference and talke with other men touching the vsages, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, &amp; affayres of diuers persons, places, &amp; things: some, in the holy meditation of heauenly, and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all matters: some in the glorious crosse of Martyrdō: to be short, some in the timely agnizing of their owne sinnes and infirmities, in the declaration of mans va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, in helping the weake, in defending the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, in teaching the ignorant, in correcting the faulty,
<pb facs="10"/>
and performing the duties of Christianitie, to the praise of God and the benefit of men. Yea, and as times and seasons alter, and men (changed in those times) often vary opinions: so in the selfe-same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are not alwayes found the same delights: but that which hath beene highly requested, hath at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times beene all so much loathed: and that which was before abandoned, is afterward eagerly pursued. Among others, the valiant <hi>Troian,</hi> who was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times much delighted in the right princely prowesse and the remembrance of his martiall exploytes, did neuerthelesse, after his desperate aduentures on the wrathfull Seas, perswade, that this also should in the time future bee a profitable solace for him, and his Companions, saying vnto them, <hi>Haec olim memi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisse iuvabit.</hi> And that happie <hi>Fortunatus</hi> (whom the Poet bringeth in talking with his fellow <hi>Faustus)</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to recreate himselfe after some extraordinarie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, sayd:
<q>—Antiquos paulùm recitemus Amores.</q>
   </p>
   <p>But more worthily that holy <hi>Spowsesse</hi> whome King <hi>Solomon</hi> mentioneth, as one enamored on him whom her soule loued, is very much solaced, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the zealous meditation and condigne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of him and his soueraigne graces: but (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that she found and enioyed him) in the glad report and declaration of the manner and methode, how she fought him, how shee was hindred, how shee found and apprehended him, and whatsoeuer else betided her, in those her carefull and fearefull affaires. The sweete Psalmist could sometimes comfort himselfe
<pb facs="10"/>
with holy hymnes, godly psalmes and ghostly songs: sometimes in fighting the Lordes battailes, sometimes in the noble duties of his royall place: sometimes in the deepe consideration of his troubles and afflictions the which hee framed as documentes of godly disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and simboles of divine graces, whereof he glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confessed: <hi>Before I was troubled</hi> I <hi>went wrong:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 1 19.3.7.</note>
      <hi>but now have</hi> I <hi>kept thy worde.</hi> Againe. <hi>It is good for mee that</hi> I <hi>have beene in trouble: that</hi> I <hi>may learne thy statutes.</hi> Thus the Apostle was often solaced to tell not onely of the Lordes graces and mercies towardes him with thankefulnesse: but also to declare openly his owne former ignorances, infirmities and sinnes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee had beene before time delighted (as zealous for the law) and now to report of his travailes, his troubles, his afflictions, his persecutions, his cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses &amp;c. for his maisters cause, in the which he gloried and tooke no meane delight. There was a time when K. <hi>Solomon</hi> was wonderfully pleased in the exercises of holy princely vertues in the building of magnificent houses, especially that which hee dedicated to the L. his God. Againe, there was a time when the same <hi>Solomon</hi> (being carried away of his own concupiscēce and be sotted with the pernicious love of strange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) was delighted in the lewd lusts of men: But yet there was an other time, when as the same <hi>Solomon</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter the full experience of those delightes wherein hee had wearied himselfe vnder the Sunne and the sense of both the divine iudgements and mercies) thought that the house of mourning yeelded him a sweeter So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, then the banquetting house.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="11"/>Moreouer, after this, hee much eased his afflicted spirite not onely in declaring what a florishing and happy Common-wealth hee would haue establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in <hi>Israel,</hi> if all things had answered <hi>(ad amus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim)</hi> to his request and dayly endevor: but also by many heauenly doctrines, learned Orations, wise sentences, parables, and arguments, to display and set foorth the manifolde <hi>vanities</hi> of wordly-men: and there-withall (as the wise Preacher) to studie and endevor on the one side to disswade and hallow them from the same beeing replenished with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miseries: and on the other side, to allure and draw them on towardes the <hi>chiefe good</hi> and highest <hi>felicitie,</hi> where onely is found the true sacietie and best so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, after all the confused troubles of this life. Truely this is the very Argument, Summe, or chiefe matter of his Booke, entituled the <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> or the <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> from whence as from the head-spring of many both pleasant and profitable streames, this present Solace is chiefly derived: In the which (besides the viewe of <hi>Solomons</hi> Common-wealth, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters of right worthy request) is contained his <hi>true Repentance</hi> and <hi>Pardon</hi> after his sinnes, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in a certaine <hi>Dialogue</hi> or conference of his Princes, and chiefe Lordes. A worke both godly, pleasant, and profitable, aswell for <hi>Princes</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble personages, as for all others which have any desire to walke (in this life) towardes the highest obiect of our hope. But heere I thought it good to admonish thee (gentle Reader) that as the worke chiefely regardeth those matters of Antiquitie, and
<pb facs="11"/>
namely, such as were either heard of, scene, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, or in action within the compasse of that time, wherein that most famous <hi>King</hi> both raigned and lived, and of the which his Princes, Lordes, and servantes coulde (as <hi>auriti,</hi> or <hi>oculati testes</hi>) both take and giue true testimonies: or the which they could readily cite, gather, obserue, remember, consider and reason of, in and among themselues: so haue I therein (for the most part) taken, applyed, and vsed those testimonies, examples, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the which either that time, or the times then fore-past could happily affoord mee: for those persons from whose wordes, reportes and disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this <hi>Dialogue</hi> is deduced, could not possibly deliver vnto vs, the things which as yet were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in action, or motion among men, seeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues knew not (as they were men) what shoulde followe or come to passe after them vnder the Sunne:<note place="margin">Eccle. <hi>3.22.</hi>
      </note> but as they might conclude effects from the causes in naturall things. Therefore, I haue beene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that there-with I might intermixe any of those which succeeded in the ages, times and persons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the which neuerthelesse being extant may be neither reiected nor abandoned: but rather as they stand, to bee taken and collected, in and from the wordes, writings and workes of others, which though farre latter, have yet beene both godly, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, well learned, and of no lesse credite and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in the Church. Howbeit, because I would not; that any thing, which is either worthie thy knowledge, or heere in request with any of them
<pb facs="12"/>
that stand in doubt of the <hi>holynesse</hi> of <hi>King Solomon</hi> &amp; the authoritie of his <hi>wordes</hi> and <hi>Bookes,</hi> shoulde bee cowched in silence or buried in obscuritie, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (and God will, though very briefly) to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply even here, that which might seeme to bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there: that so, the latter compared with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and one thing considered rightly with another they may from either gather a meete harmony and consent to conclude both for the <hi>holynesse</hi> of th'one, &amp; for the <hi>sufficiency</hi> of th'other. But here I finde them that demaund, how the knowledge of this disputation and conference should be brought vnto mine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing? &amp; from whence this princely <hi>dialogue</hi> could be either gathered or presumed? To whome I might answere: that howsoever it be, that either this or the semblable matter may bee hidden from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderstanding of the simple, and ignoraunt or how hardly it may bee conceived of some wise and learned persons: yea, and howsoever this present dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue shalbe censured and esteemed in a great part, as prosopopoicall, or imagined, yet it is true and sure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (as it is hereafter declared and proved) that those godly, wise, well learned and noble personages which were and lived in the time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> heard of his wisedome and saw his glorie, never doubted of his <hi>holinesse</hi> and true <hi>repentance,</hi> and so neither of his <hi>remission</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> with the Lorde. And as in those thinges they were not doubtfull: so were they neither so negligent, nor carelesse of the Kinges health and prosperity, and of the Common-good of the
<pb facs="12"/>
Lordes people: but that they (as most noble Princes and wise and grave Counsailors) entered into a deepe consideration of the royal estate and of the common wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> reasoned and argued the case in and betweene themselves concerning the causes of the kinges great heavines and sorrow: and therein did not onely thinke honourably and constre charitably and reverently of the kinges dealinges and wordes (as it well became them): but also endevoured by their wisedom counsel &amp; authority to remove away all the causes, that the vnhappy effectes thereof might cease and to withstand the remedilesse inconveniences of such desperate mischiefs in time convenient, &amp; that in such sort in effect, as it is reported in this <hi>Solace.</hi> And to the end that no man might either make question of the <hi>holinesse</hi> of their soveraigne <hi>Lord,</hi> or doubt of his <hi>remission</hi> and <hi>salvation,</hi> they argue for him, and above all the rest of that most honourable society, the most reverend father in God, namely <hi>Zadok the Lordes high priest,</hi> to whose grave and learned iudgement they all most gladly condiscended, spake and proved first, that king <hi>Solomon</hi> was, by the providence of the <hi>highest,</hi> provided and made a lively figure of the most holy <hi>Messiah</hi> whom they faithfully expected to come into the world, and that it was necessary that the figure should answere to the thing figured. Therefore the <hi>Messiah</hi> beeing most holy, it must follow that King <hi>Solomon</hi> should bee also holy, alluding to those equall proportions in the law between the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman</hi> and the types, shadows and figures of the same.
<pb facs="13"/>
* Next to that, they argue his <hi>Pardon</hi> partly from Gods owne promise of mercy to him, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his divine Graces 2. Sam. 7.15. part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his <hi>Repentance,</hi> the which (besides other places) is worthily gathered of his Ecclesiastes or Preacher, beeing (as the Hebrewes say) the <hi>booke of his repentance.</hi> * Thirdly they argue his <hi>Salvation</hi> with the Lorde from the consideration of his pardon as that which necessarily followeth the same, after this and like Testimonies and examples: <hi>Blessed is that man whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sinnes are covered: blessed is he, to whom the Lord imputeth not sinne.</hi> And as they never doubted of the holinesse, pardon and salvation of the person: so neither called they into questiō any his books, proverbs, words, songs, sētences, but honoured, reverenced and esteemed them, as wise and grave sayings, divine prophesies, and matters right holy and profitable for the Lordes congregation and for the instruction of his people. Therfore they thought it good, and no lesse their duties, not onely to collect and preserve them; but to commit and commende them with the like authoritie to the holy Church. Now it remaineth, that we also heare and consider what hath beene else resolved, concluded and testified by the godly learned and wise men aswell hebrewes as others, succeeding them of that age and that not onely before, but also sithence the birth, death and ascention of the most holy <hi>Messiah</hi> concerning King <hi>Solomon</hi> and those his wordes. First the auncient hebrewes and Rabins of the
<pb facs="13"/>
Iewes have delivered that <hi>Solomon</hi> did so much dislike his lustfull delightes and chiefly that sinne of Idolatrie impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed to him,<note place="margin">Jn vita pat. lib. <hi>7.</hi> &amp; in prologo: &amp; in Cap. <hi>1.</hi>
      </note> in that hee tolerated and maintained his strange wives in their abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, that hee willingly exposed himselfe in person a publike example of repentance through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the streetes of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and woulde also have beene whipped with seaven roddes in that Temple which himselfe had builded, had not the learned doctors of the lawe withstood it, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it vnlawfull for them or any others to laye their handes on the Lordes Annointed as <hi>David</hi> had taught: esteeming him not onely their true King; but a divine Prophet and holy man of GOD, and at this time a person truly repentant for his sinnes, whereof they presumed of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and eternall health. Next wee finde it te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the Author of the latter booke of the Chronicles of the kinges of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> Chap. 11. verse 17. that after king <hi>Solomon</hi> was laide to his fathers, <hi>Iudah</hi> for the time of three yeeres following pleased GOD, walking in the waies of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>: not onely of <hi>David,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of <hi>Solomon</hi>: noting that although king <hi>Solomon</hi> walked not perfectly with the Lorde in the time of his trespasses as <hi>David</hi> walked when hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed GOD, yet neverthelesse in his latter time hee was reclaimed and walked againe with <hi>David</hi> as himselfe did in his youth, when they both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether pleased the Lorde GOD; and so in th'end
<pb facs="14"/>
resigned both himselfe repentant and holy vnto God,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> and the kingdom in the same estate wholy to his sonne <hi>Rehoboam</hi>: for neither was the kingdome as yet divided, nor the state of religion altered, during the daies of <hi>Solomōs</hi> governmēt, according as the L. had de creed &amp; promised 1. <hi>King.</hi> 11.12. saying: <hi>I wil not do it in thy daies.</hi> Therefore not onely <hi>Solomon</hi> is combined with good <hi>David</hi> touching the state of religion, &amp; the manner of his walking, but also it is testified that <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> his son followed the L. also together with thē of <hi>Iudah</hi> that scared the L. in the same way full 3. yeeres after <hi>Solomons</hi> death, within the which time it pleased God to fortify the kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> &amp; therin to make <hi>Rehoboam</hi> strong. After this, the wise <hi>Syracides</hi> chap. 47.12. (among others in his time) conceiving wel of this excellēt person (whō he esteemed an excellēt sainct of the L. &amp; from whose wise sayings his grādfather <hi>Iesus</hi> had collected many his sentences:) hath carefully and reverently named &amp; numbred him among those holy Patriarches &amp; fathers of the old testamēt, so worthy of praise: wherewithall, although (as a true histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographer in that parte) hee hath laide open his sins, which els were so apparant, as they coulde not be covered: yet he extolleth him with many admirable cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mēdations, &amp; in right consideratiō giveth not so much as the least aime to any doubtfulnes of either his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or salvation, yea rather, he omitted not to say and protest, that God forsooke not his mercy (meaning that which was promised to <hi>David</hi> concerning <hi>Solomō</hi> &amp; confirmed to <hi>Solomō</hi> accordingly as 1. <hi>King.</hi> 11.39.) Neither that he was vtterly destroyed, because of his works, that he should leaue him no posteritie. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="14"/>
Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> the Evangelist bringeth in King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in the genealogie of Christ our Saviour toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his mother among those holy fathers of the olde Testament, <hi>Matt.</hi> 1.6. But chiefly, the Lorde <hi>Iesus</hi> himselfe in his profound doctrines and sermons, hath not disdained this person: but vouchsafed to name him, and there-withall to remember not onely the wisdom of King <hi>Solomon:</hi> but also that <hi>holy House</hi> which he built to the Name of the Lord. And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how well he liked the same house, he daily taught the people therin &amp; shewed them the right vse therof: yea, hee much disliked, that the same should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned by vngodly &amp; sinful men, &amp; therfore assayed to reduce it to his pristin purity, when with a whip he drave out both the buyers and sellers, saying, <hi>My house, is the house of Prayer for all Nations:</hi> &amp; it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede all vnmeet that the thing which was ordayned for a figure of his Church, and prepared to so holy an vse, should be stayned with mens prophanitie, so long as the vse of the figure endured, which was vntill the time of the comming of the holy <hi>Ghost</hi> vnto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, after Christs ascension into the heavens. After this, that holy <hi>Protomartyr Steuen</hi> in his answere to the high Priest. <hi>Actes</hi> 7. speaketh right reverently both of <hi>Solomon</hi> and of his worke: and to testifie, that the same had yet a further aime, then to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary personage, or to the worke of other men, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: But <hi>hee that is the highest of all dwelleth not in the Temples made with mens hands</hi>: alluding to <hi>Solomons</hi> wordes in the dedication of that house 2. Chro. 6.18. For right well is it said, that the very person whome
<pb facs="15"/>
that holy king prefigured, dwelt not in that house made with handes: howbeit as concerning his power and th'excellent graces of his spirite, he is ever present in and with that holy church which <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple hath prefigured and expressed. After all this (to passe over the Apostles and their worthie estimation of this person and his workes, from the which they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and cited argumentes to confirme their doctrins) all the ancient fathers of the <hi>Nicen Concil,</hi>

Nay we ought not to be such sharp cēsorers as either to deny, or to bring into doubt the salvation of all thē whose sins have bin made manifest in the holy scriptures, albeit of their finall repentance we finde no mention in plaine forme of wordes.
