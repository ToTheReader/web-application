   <p>So vild, and audacious, so publike, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious haue mine offences beene; such, and so extraordinary the mercy I haue receiued (of both which I am truly sensible) that I wish really, and sincerely from my heart, I had suffered the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death was due vnto mee, then, that now there is a faire occasion, I should bee debarred from regaining my lost honour, and reputation, in his Maiesties Warres abroad. May it please your Honours, when I saw all my fellow offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and other Delinquents whatsoeuer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged and sent vpon imployment, I enuied not their happinesse, but seriously began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how I (who alone was denied that fairest way of all) might doe my Country some seruice, euen whilst I continued here, an vnfortunate,
<pb facs="5"/> and wretched prisoner. Thus sadly musing (fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my Conscience burthened,) I resolued to write this reall <hi>Recantation</hi> of all my euill wayes; whereby I haue not only disarmed, and preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my selfe, from falling into the same lewd course of life, at any time hereafter; but also so fully and faithfully instructed all honest Trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, that no man that will bee pleased to follow my aduise, can from hence forth, (that way) miscarry. Sithence therefore I haue yeelded so faire a testimonie, both of my contrition, and conuersion; I most humbly beseech your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to entertaine a fauourable, and good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of me, and (moued thence vnto commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that you would vouchsafe to grant a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for my discharge, that I may not spend my youthfull dayes in this miserable and wretched prison, but may on, vpon my Prince, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries seruice; where I am resolued to acquite my selfe, by some braue, and notable exploite, or a worthy death; and whilst I liue, I shall at all times rest accountable for my libertie, and the life that is lent</p>
