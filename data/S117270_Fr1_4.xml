   <head>The Argument.</head>
   <p>IT chaunced that at Christmas last I was at the Court with master Ferres then master of the Kyngs maiesties pastimes about the setting forth of certaine enterludes, which for the kynges recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we had deuised and were in learning. In which time among many other exercises among our selues we vsed nightly at our lodging to talke of sundry thinges for the furtheraunce of such offices wherin ech man as than serued. For which purpose it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed master Ferres to make me his bedfellowe, and vpon a pallet cast vpon the rushes in his owne cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to lodge master willot and. M. Streamer, the one his Astronimor the other his diuine. And among many other thinges to long to reherse, it hapned on a night which I thinke was the. xxviij. of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber after that M. Ferres was come from the court and in bead, there fell a controuersie betwene M. Streamer who with M. willot had already slept his first slepe, and I that was newly come to bead the effect wherof was whether birdes and beastes had reason, the occasion wherof was this. I had heard that the kings players were learning a play of Esops Crow, wherin the most parte of the actors were birdes, the deuice wherof I discommended, saying it was not commicall to make eyther spechles things to speake, or brutish things to common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably. And although in a tale it were suffreable to Imagine and tel of somthing by them spoken or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably done, which kind Esop laudably vsed, yet it was vncomly sayd I and without example of any author to bring them in liuly peirsonages to speake, do, reason, and alaege au<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

      </gap>uine, being more diuine in this poynt than I was ware of, held the contrary parte, affirming that beastes and foules had reason, and that as much as men, yea and in some poyntes more. master Ferres him selfe and his Astronimer

wakened with our talke harkened to vs, but would take parte on neither side. And whan M. Strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer had for profe of his assercion declared many thinges of Oliphants that walked vppon cordes, Hedgehogges that knewe alwayes what weather would come, Fores and Dogges that after thoy had bene all night abrode killing Geese and Sheepe would come home in the morning &amp; put their neckes into their collers, Parates that bewayled their ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers death, Swallowes that with Selandine open their young ones eyes, and an hundred things more which I denied to come of reason, and to be but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall kindly actions, alleging for my profe authority of most graue and learned Philosophers, well quod master Streamer I know what I know, and I speake not onely what by hearsay of some Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers I knowe, but what I my selfe haue proued. why (quod I then) haue you profe of beastes and fowles reason? yea (quod he) I haue heard them &amp; vnderstand them both speake and reason aswel as I here &amp; vnderstand you: at this M. Ferres laughed. But I remembring what I had read in Albertes workes, thought there might be somwhat more than I knew, wherfore I asked him what beastes or fowles he had heard, and where and whan: At this he pawsed a while, &amp; at last sayd: If I thought you could be content to heare me, and without any interruption till I haue done to marke what I say, I would tel you such a story of one piece of my own<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
