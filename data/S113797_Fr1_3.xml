      <hi>Ye shall know them by their fruits,</hi> is an infallible and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall way to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maske hypocrites, among which none are more dangerous to the State wherein they liue, then such as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Religion, do poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickely vnderhand practise, all for the good of a forraigne power, to whom they haue vowed themselues. Of which we need no farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance then the vpstart sect of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natians,</hi> who blasphemously terme themselues <hi>Of the society of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/> Yet none do more abhorre from the holinsse of that name, which they so arrogantly vsurpe, or lesse resemble and imitate <hi>Iesus,</hi> the patterne of all holinesse. To omit their intollerable pride &amp; aspiring ambition, their insatiable coueteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, their cunning hypocrisie, their subtil sophistry, their matchlesse Machiauelisme, their equiuocating periury, their compassing sea and land, to seduce and peruert, and the like, wherein they are directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to <hi>Iesus;</hi> who was humble and lowly, liued poorely, is the truth it selfe, and taught the way of God plainely. Are not these their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limest fruits? to intermedle with matters of State, to oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by their blind vow to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Lord; to cōceale high Treason, tending to the danger of Princes persons, and euersion of States, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled to thē in auricular confession,
<pb facs="5"/> (that I may not say, to animate, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then deterre, the Traitors, to put their Treason in execution:) to publish their diuelish and perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrines, ascribing to one man, the Pope, (euen ouer Kings) both the powers Ecclesiastical &amp; Ciuil, which <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> hath separated the one frō the other,<note place="margin">Nich. <hi>1.</hi> ad Michael. Imp.</note>
      <hi>actibus proprijs &amp; dignitatibus distinctis,</hi> as Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the first affirmeth. Looke neerly into their doings, and you shall perceiue them armed with rage and cruelty, not with teares, which (as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> wittnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth) are, and onely ought to be,<note place="margin">In orat. cōtra Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entium <hi>23.</hi> quest. <hi>8.</hi> conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior.</note>

<pb facs="6"/> domum tutam, exercitus fortes, senatum fidelem, populum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum, orbē quietum, &amp; quaecun{que} hominis &amp; Caesaris vota sunt.</hi> Yea, to euery indifferent man they will appeare to be so farre off, from the innocency of holy <hi>Dauid;</hi> who <hi>had a touch of heart,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Sam. 24.6.</note> for hauing but <hi>cut off the lap of</hi> Sauls <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> that by writings they rather approue the murther of Princes, the Lords annointed; a doctrine not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposite to the doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of <hi>IESVS,</hi> but which (I am assured) all true subiects in all lands (not only of such as are taught in <hi>IESVS</hi> Schoole, but euen of them that haue neuer so little sparke of humanity or light of nature) do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and abhorre. And how be it they labour to couer these things, &amp; to perswade their adorers, that these are but slanderous imputations wrongfully cast vpon them. Yet they
<pb facs="6"/> sticke not to publish, to the eye of the world, many things derogatory from the authority of Soueraigne powers, ordained of God; affirming it to be a meerely humane instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Which new, strange, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous paradox, our Authour, in this small Treatise, doth, both by diuine and humane testimonies learnedly confute: the soundnesse of whose reasons, and faithfulnesse of allegations, will to euery indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reader plainely appeare. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not onely the best Christians and most loyall subiects may be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the mouth of the aduersary stopped, and the honest minded, though blinded Papist, be preserued as by a soueraigne antidote against the pestilent doctrines of such as mislead thē. At least, if any of them dare cast an eye on this booke; for that their bondage is so great, as they are forbidden to reade any thing
<pb facs="7"/> written by men of our side, yea, the holy Bible, for feare (forsooth) of hereticall infection. A pollicy which as it sheweth the vnsoundnesse of their cause, so doth it not a little vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their tottering Kingdome, by retaining the people still in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
   <p>But let mee entreate thee (good Reader) not to censure a peece, but reade the whole, with an vnpartiall eye: and friendly to accept my paines in good part vndertaken for thy good.</p>
