      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S often as I dooe by my foolishe witte and simple brain (moste beneuolent reader) somewhat earne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly considre the wittie, sage, yea, rather diuine and heauenly then humain and worldely sciōces of the antique Philosophers, thei dooe cause me not a litle to meruaile at the wounderfull giftes of God. For truely if a manne should iudge them onely in their monumentes and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, &amp; there were no perseuerance of their names, times, or beliefe, I knowe not who would coumpt them vnworthie the names of perfect chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stians. Forasmoche as their precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and teachynges, their iudgemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and wittes, and (if Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers be to bee beleued) their hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, ciuilitie, and moste brotherlike conuersacion, were so passyng and excellent. what Chistian is hable in this our time to comprehende like

woorkes to that very Heathen Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to or Aristotle. Would to god (o Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to) thy faith might haue deserued the name of a diuine philosopher, as thy writynges did. Shewe me one of vs all (that haue rather the name then the true perfection of christiās) that is like, or in any part resembleth the humilitie and pacience that Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes had? Diogenes was called a dog, either for some sluttishe cōdiciōs he had, or els for his barkyng at other mennes euill liuyng. But yet where is the perfeictest liuer of vs all that can vouchesafe with as glad a wil to forsake the worlde and his delightes and felicities, as that Dogge did? Shall we shewe our selues to bee of lesse perfecciō then this dog? truely we lacke soche a good barkyng curre now a daies, to barke at these mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheuous theftes, coueteousnesse, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, pride, periurie, and Deuilishe Simonie. But least any soche band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogge

chaunce to open his mouth at vs now, we will bee sure to haue in our sleue either some litle corde to tie him vp in a kenell, or els we wil cast him a gobbet of meate to stoppe his throte, that he maie leaue his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng. But nothing, no bread or meat no cherishyng, or makyng moche of, could make this Dogge Diogenes ceasse his barkyng. Oh it was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceadyng good Curre, and had many good propreties: to baite beares, that is, coueteous, lecherous, and proude persones, ye might vse him for a bā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogge or mastife. To kepe wolues, or other rauenyng beastes frō our shepe that is, extorcioners and oppressours from the simple people, he was as a good shepeherdes curre. To finde and put vp game, and to retrain thesame, that is, to seke out euil disposed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones, and openly to reprehende and rebuke them, there could be no better Spanell. To ouertake his game, that

is, to peruert the naughtie purposes of euill liuers, there was no swifter Graiehounde. And for to pursue the steppes of the wicked, he was a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng good bloudhounde, I praie to God that we bee not founde wourse, then this dogge, or at least waies ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng that worse propretie of a dogge that is, retournyng to the flithie vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite of our sinfull life. I would to Christes passion there were no more desire of worldelie felicities in the Churche of Christ, then was in this simple Heathē dogge Diogenes. But yet Diogenes, nor any of all the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, or of all the wise antique sage mē, had so singuler &amp; perfeict gif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, nor pricked nigher the streight marke and poinct of a catholike man then this seuere and moste prudente Caton.

Lette a man onely with good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and sincere intelligence peruse this litle woorke of his Preceptes, he shall finde nothing to haue missed or wanted in this Cato, to the perfec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion of Christes religion, sauyng the hope and faithe that a christian man ought to haue in the bloudde of Iesu Christ.
