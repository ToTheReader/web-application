         <p>I may not deny but that there is conteined in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures geuen by inspiration of God (being rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded, followed, and obeyed,) necessary and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent doctrine of saluation: but for want of these thrée prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall pointes, many haue small profite truely. I could also with all my hart wishe that man with man commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not filthines,<note place="margin">No man may iudge of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine but the Familye.</note> nor depended one vpon an other: but to stay them onely on the Lordes truth, and not on flesh and bloud, so were then all controuersies at an end.</p>
         <p>It were well also to proue all thinges: but not as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth me by the crooked rule of mans owne iudgement, or fleshly minde and concerning, nor by his imagination (without the light of Gods truth, or spirite of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and loue:) taken on in constructing, and wresling of the right sence and minde of the scriptures which being seperated from the light of lyfe, as he in the same worke alleadgeth is a closed booke, or a darke word without light, and the seruice administred thereout as a dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye without a soule, or as a dead wife deceased from her husband, which could bring fourth no children of lyfe. For what can the naturall man iudge, that is altogether ignoraunt of the thinges of God, or yet open the holy

thinges without the key of Dauid, or behould the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice of God, when as men can not frely enter the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphin with his fiery sword not being taken away: or yet iudge of an other which hath ouercome, and attained to haue a new name, written in the white stone: that lyeth himselfe, yet in the meane time altogether be wrapped and buried vnder the bondage and subiectiō of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being, and vngodlynes. &amp;c.</p>
         <p>Consider therefore euery thing in his right degrée (if you be endewed with ghoastly vnderstanding, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with the right spirite of iudgemēt,) and then out of your spiritualnes iudge all thinges according to the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of equitye, and trying squaire or measure line of righteousnes in the lyfe and truth. Trie also the spirits by the same rule, and be not vnbeleuing towardes the right spirit, but follow and embrace that which is good. For if you can shew vs any passinger God of Israel, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny better lawe, rites, and ordinaunce: then is his lawes, rites, and ordinaunces, or anye perfecter life then the loue: whereon Christe with his holy ones haue heretofore testified, (Whereto also the Author presently as a concordable witnes with the same doth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point and direct vs) or that there be any better thing then the eternall lyfe and the loue it selfe. So let not thē that same most best, be withheld from vs (whilest that we onely enforce vs thereunto) that we might serue euē so the onely liuing God in vniformenes of hart, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partialitye of minde together with an vpright righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and holynes.</p>
         <p>Take this briefe freindly &amp; well meaning aunswere to your exceptions in good part, and way it not as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter done to defend the worke by the way of contending: but rather as one out of goodwill doe but geue you occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereby to weigh more distinctly, and reasonably of that which commeth so lyuely, &amp; freindly to your hands, out of grace, to your profit and welfare. Therefore saue labour for making any further reply hereunto, least you doe but lose your trauaile herein, for Christ with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

ones will not now in this same day of the Loue (lyke as doe the princes of the earth whose kingdome is of this world) set vp and maintayne his kingdome with conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and discorde, but with peaceablenes, louing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and long suffering.<note place="margin">Louely Poetrie of the Familie.</note> But if one listed to sée wrestlers bestirre them in their play: then for to graunt them le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ground, he might not well denay. And yf one should trauers the right of his case: then must the Iudge sit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parciall in iudgement place, so shall then all matters in equalitye out fall: but otherwise be peruerted and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse right we shall.</p>
