   <p>THE profit of stories, and the prayse of the Author, are sufficiently declared by Amiot, in his Epistle to the Reader: So that I shall not neede to make many wordes thereof. And in deede if you will supply the defects of this translation, with your owne diligence and good vnderstanding: you shall not neede to trust him, you may proue your selues, that there is no prophane studye better then Plutarke. All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learning is priuate, fitter for Vniuersities then cities, fuller of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templacion than experience, more commēdable in the students them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues, than profitable vnto others. Whereas stories are fit for euery place, reache to all persons, serue for all tymes, teache the liuing, reuine the dead, so farre excelling all other bookes, as it is better to see learning in noble mens liues, than to reade it in Philosophers writings. Nowe for the Author, I will not denye but loue may deceiue me, for I must needes loue him with whome I haue taken so much payne: but I beleue I might be bold to affirme, that he hath written the profitablest story of all Authors. For all otherwere sayne to take their matter, as the fortune of the contries whereof they wrote fell out: But this man being excellent in wit, learning, and experience, hath chosen the speciall actes of the best persons, of the famosest nations of the world. But I will leaue the judgement to your selues. My onely purpose is to desire you to excuse the faults of my translation, with your owne gentlenes, and with the opinion of my diligence and good entent. And so I wishe you all the profit of the booke. Fare ye well.</p>
