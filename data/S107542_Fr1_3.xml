   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>VRTEOVS Reader, The Authour will haue you know,</p>
   <p>First that this litle worke, was the fruite of one of his Spirituall Retraites. The Manna which he gathered in the Sacred Desert of Penance. A child of Prayer rather then of studie; begotten at the foote of the Crosse: brought out in the aboundance of his hart: speaking to the hart rather then to eare. Thence he desires
<pb facs="7"/>the hart may rather pervse it then the ey, at least that it may be eyed in pietie, feare and simplicitie of hart.</p>
   <p>Secondly, that, though he were preuented (howbeit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his knowledge) in this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, by two most excellent pens, DREXELIVS, and LA SERRE, yet he falls in with nether of them, but walkes a midle way: for leauing the first in his diligent search of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie; the second, in his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, eleuations of mynd, motions, and rich amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he applies himselfe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the meditation, or simple Contemplation of Eternitie.</p>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <p> Thirdly that in the version of diuers passages of the holy Fathers &amp;c. he was not scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous in tying himselfe to their tearmes (their sense was his ayme: in that he is faithfull) Say the like of holy Scripture. Hence the Translatour will craue pardon, if faithfully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his authour, he giue not alwayes the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though he marke it in another letter, to bring more light and life to the reading, While the humble maiestie therof, is, at least, pointed at.</p>
