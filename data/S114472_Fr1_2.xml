      <hi>seruant</hi> this Prophet. For the Church in his

the generall estate of the Church, after <hi>Iohn</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed

cometh to the works of God, which are predictions, cha.

of things to come, obsignations of such as must be
saued, &amp; indignation on things to be destroyed. And for
the more particular estate of the Church, hauing (chap.
10.) shewed his warrant to write, he cometh to her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
first, in her Prophets: secondly, in her bodie. In her
Prophets, their fighting, falling, rising, chap. 11. In
her bodie, comparing her to a woman clothed with the
Sunne, chap. 12. and describing her by her combats, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
triumphs: her combats defensiue, chap. 13. and
offensiue in Christ, by words, chap. 14. threatnings,
chap. 15. and iudgements, chap. 16. her victories gotten
against that<note n="c" place="margin">The Church of Rome.</note> whore, chap. 17. and 18. the<note n="d" place="margin">The Romane Empire.</note> Beast, chap. 19.

   <p>The things in this booke were (I grant) very darke
to them that liued in the dayes of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as the Prophecie
<pb facs="4"/>
of <hi>Daniel</hi> was to them who liued in the time of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
But as that Prophecie being fulfilled, we can now tell
what was foretold in it: so many things being fulfilled
which were foretold in this booke, we may easily see
what is meant by it: and the posteritie to come shall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vnderstand this booke then we do, because it
may be, all things are not yet fulfilled. Neither is this
booke like the cities of the<note n="a" place="margin">Num. 13.</note>

      <hi>blessed is he that
readeth the words of this booke.</hi> But to come to these
three Chapters written by <hi>Iohn</hi> surnamed the Diuine, &amp;
expounded by one a most worthie Diuine. The first
Chapter is a Proeme or Preface to the booke: the two
latter are Epistles dedicating this booke. The dedication
is made to<note n="d" place="margin">Reu. 2. 1.</note> seuen seuerall Churches, and by name to the

<pb facs="9"/>
at his death. Concerning this author, as he said of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>

Diuine. In a word therefore, whatsoeuer this man
did, he desired to profite others by it: he thought (as it is
written<note n="c" place="margin">Autor vitae Ber. lib. 2. cap. 4. &amp; 7.</note> of <hi>Bernard</hi> in his life) that he was not his owne
man, but deputed to the seruice of others. He was neuer
idle, but as<note n="d" place="margin">Hieron. ad Marcellam.</note>
      <hi>Hierome</hi> reporteth of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi>

himselfe. Yet in this short time of his, what
art was he not a maister of? what vertue was he not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with? He was a complet Diuine, and hath this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in the Church, that no mans writings are read of all
sorts, and in all countries with greater grace and profite
then his. He was peaceable in the Church, patient of
wrongs, and free from ambition. For as <hi>Ierome</hi> said of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potian,
aurum calcans, schedulas consectabatur:</hi> he regarded
not his purse, but followed his booke, and as <hi>Bernard</hi>
said, he liued <hi>in terra auri sine auro,</hi> in a kingdome of gold
without gold. An excellent gift he had to <hi>define</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>deuide</hi> exactly, <hi>dispute</hi> subtilly, <hi>answer</hi> directly, <hi>speake</hi>
pithily, and <hi>write</hi> iudicially: and how he preached, if these
<hi>Sermons</hi> do giue a testimonie, what witnesse had they
who often heard him themselues? I haue published of his
now two Discourses, and I onely did it, that these his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
might not perish: I haue no benefite by them but
exceeding great paines. And since I vnderstand that his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
labours are in the hands of his friends, to make bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
<pb facs="9"/>
for his children, I will ease my selfe of the like labour,
&amp; be a means that they may haue the benefit of the future
impressions of this booke: the which, how faithfully I
haue published, I appeale to the godly and indifferent
Reader, and I hope no honest minded man will be hired
to calumniate it. Thus as one desirous to be <hi>seruiceable</hi> in
my calling, <hi>profitable</hi> to the Church, not <hi>forgetfull</hi> of my
