      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, I know you ar not vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the death of <hi>Robert Greene,</hi> whose pen in his life time pleased you as well on the Stage, as in the Stationers shops: And to speake truth, although his loose life was odious to God and offensiue to men, yet forasmuch as at his last end he found it most grieuous to himselfe (as appeareth by this his repentant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) I doubt not but he shall for the same deserue fauour both of God and men. And considering Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that <hi>Venus</hi> hath her charmes to inchaunt; that Fancie is a Sorceresse bewitching the Senses, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the onely enemie to all vertuous actions. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the purest glasse is the most brickle, the finest Lawne the soonest staind, the highest Oake most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the wind, and the quickest wit the more easily woone to folly: I doubt not but you will with regarde forget his follies, and like to the Bee gather hony out of the good counsels of him, who was wise, learned and polliticke, had not his lasciuious life withdrawen him from those studies which had been far more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb facs="3"/>
to him.</p>
   <p>For herein appeareth that he was a man giuen ouer to the lust of his owne heart, forsaking all godlines &amp; one that daily delighted in all manner of wickednes. Since other therefore haue forerun him in the like faults, and haue been forgiuen both of God and men I trust hee shall bee the better accepted, that by the working of Gods holy spirit, returnes with such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued Repentance, being a thing acceptable both to God and men.</p>
   <p>To conclude, forasmuch as I found this discourse very passionate, and of woonderfull effect to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the wicked from their vngodly waies, I thoght good to publish the same: and the rather, for that by his repentance they may as in a glasse see their owne follie, and thereby in time resolue, that it is better to die repentant, than to liue dishonest.</p>
