   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thou be desirous (good Reader) to see the right pourtraiture of <hi>Innocency</hi> truely laied foorth vnto thee in her proper lineaments, then reade this discourse which is not long. Beeing thou seest thus prouoked as shee is, or rather, to speake the trueth, thus violentlie drawne into th'encounter by the wretched assaultes of an vnleaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mouth, yet marke, I pray thee, howe shee caries her selfe, and how shee comes armed into the fielde, <hi>Patience, Mildnesse, Trueth, and a good Conscience.</hi> This is her armour, these be her weapons, and with these onely shee fights, repelling and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king backe all the bitter dartes that are throwen against her, only with, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee,</hi> and none otherwise. Farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to that babling declaimour who left vs this lesson of olde: <hi>Si quam maledicēdo voluptatē coepisti, eam malè audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do amittes, &amp;c.</hi> That is, <hi>If thou haue taken any pleasure in speaking that thou shouldest not: Thou must loose it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by hearing that thou wouldest not.</hi> Well knewe the defendour, that howsoeuer this might be pleasing to the fleashe, or keepe descant with our corruption, yet he that sayes, <hi>Mihi vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta,</hi> had taught him another lesson, namely, That it could in no sorte sute with the sinceritie of the Gospell, to giue check for check, and rebuke for rebuke: And therefore it is that in his whole Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie he hath not giuen his aduersarie so much as one glaunce of reproche.</p>
   <p>Let this then be thy Paterne (good Reader whosoeuer thou art) howe to wreastle with thy affections in the like assaultes: It is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
<pb facs="3"/> I cōfesse, that such vncleane mouthes as this should thus take their libertie to disgrace at will. But muze not at it, good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it hath bene so in all ages and will be so still: For so long as the Lord giueth Satā leaue to buffet &amp; assaile his church, so long thou maiest be assured there wil neuer want a <hi>Rabshakeh,</hi> a <hi>Shimei,</hi> or a <hi>Senacherib</hi> to play their partes. Neuerthelesse, heerein thou maiest comfort thy selfe, if thou marke how and in what sorte this reviling generation is curbed, as it were, snaffeled and restrained by the powerfull and righteous hand of God, that in the middest of their forwardnesse and boldnesse to blunder out what they list without blushing, they can hardly for their liues blunder out a trueth, as if the Lord in his secrete iudgement had purposely and apparauntly blasted their penne with a lying and distempered spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. All which if thou find verefied without all gainesay and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the writings of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> D. <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> and others of that haire, and withall if thou see these men that doo thus headely and desperatlie lash on in disgrace of others, to be them selues in their seuerall accusations so palpably taken tardie, that the very walles and stones of the streetes may convince them of vntrueth: if I say thou find this to be true (and for proofe therof I referre thee to this short and modest defence) haue patience in thy selfe and giue the glory to God, who doth thus, thou seest, in his wisedome make a way and passage for the clearing of th'innocent, euen thorough the mouth and malice of th'accuser him selfe.</p>
   <p>Cōcerning such things as it pleaseth him so earnestly to father vpō Mr <hi>Cart.</hi> &amp; others by heresay &amp; report, I can not but muze that a man of his coate and calling is no more smitten &amp; abashed at it then he is, For presuppose that one should heare by report that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Sutcliffe was once taken with false dice at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and thervpon being forced to flie the Towne, should euer since beare a kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate hatred &amp; malice to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Beza</hi> and th'Elders there: This
<pb facs="3"/> beeing knowen onely to vs by report (how true soeuer the thing might be in it selfe) I would faine know for my learning, whether this were <hi>aequalance,</hi> or how it might sute with any measure of indifferency, forthwith without any farther examinatiō to spread it abroade in print. And yet this you shall finde to be an vsuall and ordinarie course with M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Deane of <hi>Exeter,</hi> in his solemne infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and personall pleadinges against good men: Marke it who list in him, if the case concerne anie of these <hi>Disciplinarians,</hi> he is of that good nature &amp; ready witte, that rather then he wil be to seeke for matter, he will not sticke to rake the chanell sometimes &amp; take whatsoeuer comes next to hand, though it lie all to be troden and trāpled on in the streetes: yea and of that which I beleeue the poorest Scavenger in a towne would be loth to stoupe for, he with a little helpe and forbishing of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Surveiour of Discipline,</hi> frameth for the most parte some irrefragable &amp; tempestuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion against these new plot-formers, and then forsooth to the Presse it must in all post hast with some rhetoricall varnish of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation: as if <hi>Quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> or as if the poorest &amp; most patched Record vnder the sunne (that blusheth, it may be, to see the light) were evidence strong enough against a <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now there bee that thinke that of all other charges thus strangely and vnwoorthily imposed vppon this Reuerend man, the charge of ignorance, and that his woorkes should be <hi>a fardle of fooleries,</hi> is the most out of ioint and approching nearest to impudency. But sure for mine owne parte I doo not thinke so, neither doo I see why his aduersarie might not with as great reason, yea and euery way with as good a conscience appeache him of ignoraunce as of disloyaltie. For allow that our Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities togeather with forreine Nations and Churches may sufficientlie controll the Reporter in the one, yet this letteth not but that the Countries and places of the Mans resiance,
<pb facs="4"/> can, for neede, giue as plentifull testimonie in th'other. And therefore why a man of that easie gift and rolling veine, so slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the seare as Maister <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> is, should make it more dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to spare M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Cart.</hi> in his learning then he doeth in his loialty (hauing the like warrant and authoritie for both) I see neither reason nor sense. The best is, thou hast heere by this meanes (good Reader) (in th'euennesse and equabilitie of the Dostors hande to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this man) an vnfallible line laied before thee, whereby thou mayest measure all the rest of his reproches so vnconsciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie throwen vpon others. For hath he dealt truely, modestly, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably, and christianly with this man? Then make thou no doubt or question but he hath afoorded full as good measure to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. On the contrarie, hath he made no bones hande ouer heade and that beyonde all compasse of christianitie to speake his pleasure of this man, beeing a man so notably graced in giftes, and one that hath so many vncontrollable euidences of his wise and dueti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cariage of himselfe? If he haue done this (as the reading of this Apologie will make it cleare vnto thee) Then what reason hast thou to maruell or thinke straunge if thou see him nowe and then most fowly and shamefully ouer-reache him selfe against o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are farre short of this man in iudgement and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie?</p>
   <p>It is written of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that beeing vniustly put to death without cause: while he was going to execution, his wife followed him aloofe of howling and weeping and crying aloude: <hi>O my husband dieth guiltles, dieth guiltlesse.</hi> Wherevnto the good old man (looking backe vpon her with a frowning &amp; angry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance) replied thus: <hi>Why, thou foolish woman, wouldest thou haue me dye guiltie?</hi> This being the speach of a heathen man, voied of the true knowledge of God, will rise vp, I feare, in iudgement against many of vs that professe christianitie in this age, whose common corruption is such, that when we are wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb facs="4"/> burdened with any matter of disgrace, we frette at nothing more then that the thing is false that is so charged vppon our heades. <hi>Why, if I were guiltie</hi> (sayeth one) <hi>or if it were true that they report of me, it would neuer grieue me:</hi> wheras in trueth (if we did rightlie consider of it) it should grieue vs and humble vs most to be guiltie, or that those things should bee true that are thus blowen abroad against vs. Wilt thou knowe then (good Reader) howe to cary thy selfe when thou art thus iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie dealt with by any false charge or imposition? Looke vppon th'example of the holy Saintes and seruants of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and as thou seest them doo, so doo thou. <hi>Anna</hi> when shee was charged by <hi>Eli</hi> to be druncken, did not frette or snuffe at it, or looke vpon the man with a disdainfull eye, but in much patience and modestie made aunsweres <hi>Nay, my Lord, not so,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.15.16.</note>
      <hi>I haue drunke neither wyne nor strong drinke, but haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth my soule before the Lord, count not thy hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayde a wicked woman, for of th'aboundance of my griefe haue I spoken, &amp;c.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> likewise, when hee was charged by <hi>Festus,</hi> to be besides him selfe, was, we see, no whit dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered or inflamed with it, but made answere in all wisedome and reuerence: <hi>I am not madd, most noble Festus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 26.25</note>
      <hi>but I speake the wordes of trueth and sobernesse, &amp;c.</hi> This then must be thy course (good Reader) and these be the steppes that thou must treade in. Thou knowest whose counsell and admonishment it is, <hi>not to suffer as a malefactour:</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.15</note> Looke thou to that then in anie case.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Hic murus aheneus esto</l>
      <l>Nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.</l>
   </q>
   <p>Keepe thou still a good conscience, and let the clearenesse of thy heart, and innocency of thy hands be as a wall of brasse vnto thee, and leaue the rest to the Lorde, to doo what seemeth good in his
<pb facs="5"/> owne eies, And then if Satan doo rage, or his instrumentes doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell or revile neuer so much, tearming thee a drunkard, a madd man, a Traitour, a Conspirator, an Innovatour, or what they will els, be not thou troubled or dismaied with it, but rather reioice and giue God thankes. For if thou be able truely to say with th'Apostle in the testimony of thine owne hart, <hi>By honour and dishonor, By good report and euill report,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.8.</note>
      <hi>as deceyuers and yet true, &amp;c.</hi> Then (howsoeuer the bloudthirstie may gnashe and grind their teeth at thee) thy conscience may be at peace: and thou maiest chearefully answere thy good friendes (that are peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture agrieued to see the falsehoode and indignity of th'impositions laied vppon thee) as <hi>Socrates</hi> did to his wife, <hi>Why my Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters would you haue me suffer guilty, or be slaundered and ill spoken of deservedly?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thus dooing what knowest thou, whether the Lord (who hath the hartes of all men in his handes) will make thy condemners to be thy clearers, and thy enemies thy friends, yea and turne all this storme and tempest of vntruthes to thy farther peace, clearing, &amp; securitie in th'end? For was there euer a more bitter and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemy then <hi>Saul</hi> was to <hi>Dauid?</hi> And yet we see how the Lord forced this wretched man (after many false surmises and vniust ielousies of treason and conspiracy against him) to pronounce sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for <hi>Dauids</hi> acquitall in these woordes:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24.17.</note>
      <hi>Thou art more righteous then I.</hi> And who knowes whether the Lorde may woorke the like effecte and remorse in M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Sutcliffe</hi> ere hee die, euen to force him in like maner (after all his bundle of outcryes and vniust accusations) to passe the white stone on the behalfe of th'accused, and him selfe to pronounce: <hi>That certeinly Tho. Cart.</hi> &amp; <hi>Steph. Egertō are much more righteous thē he,</hi> and therevppon to adde farther as the same <hi>Saul</hi> did afterward, <hi>I haue sinned,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Sam. 26.21.</note>
      <hi>I haue played the foole, I haue erred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,</hi> in slaundering and belying th'innocent. Sure I am,
<pb facs="5"/> it were happie and thrice happy for him if he might liue to doe this of conscience. But whether he doo or no, labour thou alwayes (good Reader) so to walke as thou maiest not iustly bee touched, with anie thing that may be a staine to thy holy profession. And so harbouring still in thy breast the comfortable guest of a good conscience (as an asswagement of all the miseries and discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of this life) cease not to pray in the spirit for the peace of Ierusalem, and for her right excellent Maiestie that hath bene so long Gods good instrument of that happie peace, That as <hi>Iosua</hi> commaunded the sunne to stand till he were avenged on his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, So the Lord would commaund this Sunne-shine of our peace to stand and neuer to goe downe, till all the Enemies of his church be brought low to the dust. And as that was the longest day that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was, so this (hauing bene already by the mercy of God the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest) may also prooue by the power of God to be the longest raigne that euer was: That the date of her life may (if it please the Lord) and with the last date and dissolution of this earth, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall blisse and renown of this Land, to the terror &amp; amazing of the wicked, to the comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing of the godly, and to her owne euerlasting peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines in the life to come.</p>
