                 <title>The Popes Parliament : containing a pleasant and delightful historie, wherin are throughly deliuered and brightly blazed out, the paltry trash and trumperies of him and his pelting prelats, their mutinies, discord, and dissentions, their stomacke and malice at Pope Ioane, their shifting and foisting of matters for defence of her, and their antichristian practises, for maintenance of their pompe and auarice. Whereunto is annexed an Anatomie of Pope Ioane, more apparantly opening her whole life and storie. Written by Iohn Mayo</title>

   <head>THE ARGVMENT OF THIS TREATISE.</head>
   <p>THe Pope goeth in his solemne procession: by the aduise of Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> he passed through that streete, where the Marble image of the woman Pope <hi>Ioane</hi> was erected, and yet standeth, representing her filthinesse and abhomination: he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon it, and with the sight thereof is so strangly afrighted, that he ran backe againe like a mad man, to the great admiration of the people. The next day he called his Cardinals, and held a Parliament in his Consistorie: where three questions were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded &amp; agreed vpon. The hollow chaire of Porphirie stone, vsed for the proofe of the Popes humanitie, was torne in peeces. The Marble image of the woman Pope <hi>Ioane</hi> was broken down, and all the English catholikes were exiled and commanded to packe out of Rome the next day. They seeing the Popes holy displeasure against them, concluded togither to giue him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Florens, and euerie yeere after so much, if so be that they might haue his blessed fauour and permission to abide in Rome: whereupon the Pope absolueth and recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, and taketh them into his gracious liking againe.</p>
