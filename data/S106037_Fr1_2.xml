      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it runnes in our Spanish Tongue: <hi>Quien á buen arbol se arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, buena sombra le cobija;</hi> He that retires himselfe vnder a good tree, findes both good shelter and shadow: This I haue found most true by my owne experience, in that since my voluntary banishment out of my natiue Soile, for the peace and libertie of Conscience, into this flourishing Kingdome, like a poore stranger, being in a Labyrinth of worldly cares and necessities: It pleased your gracious Lordship, not onely to vouchsafe mee the protection of your Honourable house, but (though most vnworthy) further to conferre vpon mee many great
<pb facs="3"/>and important benefits, ioyned with Noble promises, of my more preualent preferments, when fit opportunitie serued, that I cannot but applie my selfe in all the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest offices within my poore power, to manifest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some due and vnfained gratitude. Seeing (as learned <hi>Seneca</hi> saith) the best returne of a benefit, <hi>est grata beneficij memoria:</hi> Wherefore, as it hath pleased your gracious Lordship, to countenance, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the Author, extend the same honourable protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and defence, to this his poore labour and worke, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the deprauations, and malignities of so many powerfull aduersaries.
