   <lg>
      <l>DOst weepe to see him dead? or thou dost come</l>
      <l>To view him liuing in his dying tombe?</l>
      <l>Liuing (said I) and dying? yes: his death</l>
      <l>Seems to infuse in him a liuing breath,</l>
      <l>That being dead to earth, earth might transpose,</l>
      <l>His earthy corps vnto eternall ioies.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Deadiyes, and aliue too; this seems strange:</l>
      <l>For single death he gets a double change:</l>
      <l>Of life and death: death to shut vp his eies,</l>
      <l>Life to enthrone him in heauens paradice.</l>

      <l>A good exchange: what better? none to thee,</l>
      <l>Translated prince: yet no change worse to me,</l>
      <l>And to the state: O enuy that our will</l>
      <l>Should so depraued be, to wish him ill,</l>
      <l>For our owne priuate good: Great good indeed,</l>
      <l>And to be wisht for: O where shall we reade</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>So many vertues charactred in youth,</l>
      <l>So rare a mirror in the Court of truth.</l>

      <l>
         <pb facs="4"/>So generall affection as nere any,</l>
      <l>In one heart, kept the hearts of halfe so many.</l>

      <l>Ist then impiety to weepe, or show</l>
      <l>Our zeale to him? whom there was none did know</l>
      <l>That by relation wept not; O I see,</l>
      <l>In euery face the face of Niobe,</l>
      <l>Sencelesse and speechlesse: yet in sense and speech</l>
      <l>Thus much entire affection seems to teach</l>
      <l>Posterity hereafter: as't appeares</l>
      <l>Both sence and speech supplied are by teares.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Teares inundation, so as we might feare,</l>
      <l>And not without iust cause some deluge nere,</l>
      <l>But that we see a rainebow which portends</l>
      <l>Heauen has imposd vnto our sorrowes ends</l>
      <l>And limits, which ore past can hardly be,</l>
      <l>So soone slip griefes out of our memory.</l>
      <l>So soone? indeede too soone: poems in blacke</l>
      <l>Resemble the blacks we weare vpon our backe.</l>
      <l>Which whilst we follow the sad mournfull beere,</l>
      <l>Some more for fashion then compassion weare.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Vnworthy mourners, do your griefes extend</l>
      <l>No further? must your teares with his blest end</l>
      <l>Expire together? why then I pray re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      <l>Let our sole notes sith that our notes be higher</l>
      <l>And far more shrill, supply your place: ile find</l>
      <l>Motiues of griefe vnto th'immotiu'sts mind.</l>
      <l>You are blind with teares, I but of late began,</l>
      <l>One eye may see more then another can▪</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Why should men thinke th'inuention halfe so rare,</l>
      <l>Or worth record: to bring a stream: from Ware,</l>
      <l>Of pure spring water? for without lesse charge</l>
      <l>I could haue dreind a riuer full as large</l>
      <l>Without ere pumping for't: and with a sluse</l>
      <l>As artificiall: which could no way chuse</l>
      <l>

      <l>But conuey water to most parts o'th city.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And this without a Iacobs staffe, or ought</l>
      <l>Saue the dimensions of an aierie thought;</l>
      <l>Which measures each p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>oportion, onely griefe</l>
      <l>Excepted, which the measure of reliefe</l>
      <l>Could neuer compasse: yet there would be fault</l>
      <l>In my conueiance, for my spring is salt</l>
      <l>And mixt with briny vapors which distill▪</l>
      <l>Like pond or marish waters from a hill.</l>
      <l>But theirs more sweet, so could I mine allay,</l>
      <l>If I had been at so much cost as they.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Next wonder that we haue obserud this yeere,</l>
      <l>Is that the winter did like spring appeare,</l>
      <l>Garnisht with varied flowers, and euery sweet</l>
      <l>Checkerd with borders for the Syluans meet</l>
      <l>To frolicke on: and why? they are of that nature,</l>
      <l>That when they'r merry, they presage some creature</l>
      <l>Of worth or admiration must commend,</l>
      <l>Their bones to rest by some approaching end.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Ill natur'd bugbeares, why should you delight,</l>
      <l>To see that sunne lodge in eternall night</l>
      <l>That gaue a lustre with his sparkling eie</l>
      <l>To euery plant within his Monarchy</l>
      <l>Each humble spray or flower that grew i'th field</l>
      <l>Of honor, would he honor with his shield</l>
      <l>Of eminent respect▪ respect lesse you,</l>
      <l>That neuer giue to merit whats her due.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But I must cease, that I may weepe the more,</l>
      <l>For ceaselesse though I weepe, I haue teares in store</l>
      <l>Two buckets to one well, both of them goes,</l>
      <l>The one for my teares, the other for my woes,</l>
      <l>That teares and woes contracted both in one,</l>
      <l>May pierce in time this monumentall stone.</l>
