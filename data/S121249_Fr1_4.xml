   <head>The Authors Epistle to the people of France.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O you (French people) and to no other doe I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this Historie, and I doe diuulge it to the view of the world, vnder the protection of the best aduised, to the end that it being by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and defended, it may remaine sound and perfect, and be as a mirrour to those who know not themselues; and (who being attained with a spirituall leaprousie) haue no more feeling in them, then as if they had vtterly lost all their vnderstanding: not regarding (as vnpitifull) the teares and sighings of the poore afflicted, happened through their occasion: not being able to taste the delicate fruites, which sage and wise councell bringeth with it; not being able to sent the infection and stinke which proceedeth from the imbecillitie of their corrupted braine: not being able by their touching to taste what is the blood which themselues drawe from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome and deepest of their vaines: neither see they the extreame miserie wherein they are plunged, drawing with them therein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the soundest part of their bodies.</p>
   <p>To these doe I present this mirrour, that looking into it, they may the better know what is their present estate; and if they could see (as they may if they will) their grosse deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and great defects, they ought without doubt to beleeue that they are the same persons, which haue made themselues such by the corruption and grossenes of their humors, giuing themselues ouer to their desires, through a contempt of the Deitie, by a priuate ambition and auarice.</p>
   <p>When as therefore you shall see in this Historie the diuision of a people fleshed one against another, for soueraigne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall dignitie: when for this effect, you shall reade herein of Townes and Castles forced, the inhabitants spoyled of their
<pb facs="5"/>
goods and liues, the wiues at the mercie of the souldiour, the maydes violated, many fayre buildings burnt, the subiects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling against their Lords, Peasants against Peasants; you would asluredly thinke they are acts committed in a Countrie farre remote.</p>
   <p>But it is you, who amongst your selues, and vpon your selues, haue committed the like enormities: when for the like effect you shall finde it strange that these miserable and infortunate people, hauing called in amongst them their old and auncient enemies, vnder colour for them to be reuenged one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and (which is yet more bestiall) submitted themselues both of the one part and on the other, to a stranger. I know not then what sound iudgement or good opinion you can conceiue of your selues, being attainted and notoriously conuinced of the selfe same fault, when you shall note the great ruines and desolations of so goodly &amp; rich a Countrie, you may well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue euen at this present, yours reduced into the like estate, and if the calamitie be not in all poynts answerable: yet thinke that you touch it with the very tip of your finger, except the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledement which you may haue of your selues, preserue you not, and diuertit from you. In examination of your selues, you shall finde your selues all kinsmen, there being neither race or linage amongst you, which is not allyed one to another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be some stranger newly come in: you shall finde your selues all of one nation: you shall finde your selues all subiects of one Lord and Prince: and you seeing your selues to be all of kindred, allied of the same nation, and vnder one gouernment: and being able to obserue these conditions in your selues, you shall certainly iudge, that you are culpable of all the disorder which at this present is seene amongst you, and that the fault happened not but from your selues, without imposing it vpon a stranger, who by your losse, seeketh his owne aduauncement, maintaining his triumphs with heaps of your ruines, which serue him for many solemnities. This fault once acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, you shall imbrace your selues, euen one another as kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: you shall frequent one another louingly, as true countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: and you shall make your selues wholy obedient to your
<pb facs="5"/>
Prince, by a mutuall and friendly agreement, remitting all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies that may spring amongst your selues, to those who are admitted to execute Iustice: propounding to your selues the similitude which sometimes <hi>Menewnius Agrippa</hi> a Romane, alleaged to his Citizens, who were infected with the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie that you your selues are, he comparing a common wealth to a humaine bodie, which being composed of many members, hath neede (for the better subsistance of it) that all with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord doe accomplish their naturall functions the one for the other thy a mutuall and reciprocall dutie; euen as in our neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie we doe naturally practise the same euery one by himselfe. If the head doth ake and is ill, we presently applie to it both our hands to comfort it againe, and it receiueth some ease thereby; by meanes of the feete it is carried here and there, that it may the better diuert the griefe; we cherish it, because the losse of it doth ouerthrow all the rost, and we are not so ill adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, vpon the distemperature thereof, to cut it off from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts. That which nature doth instruct you, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of this little bodie, you ought to thinke it to be an instruction which it hath prepared for you to walke in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement of your likes, who are vnited to you by a mutuall frequentation and such as is necessarie amongst your selues, which we name societie, and from whence commeth this heape and masse of people, which we comprehend vnder the name of a common weale; the which, all those that are borne in the same, ought to maintaine and preserue (and not seeke the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and spoile thereof) as being all members of the bodie of it. And concerning the default that herein you commit, you may cleerely see the calamitie which shall happen to you therefore, by the example of this miserable Realme of Hungarie, which was in former time no lesse replenished with warlike men, then you, and which was no lesse enriched with fertilitie, riches, and all other things necessarie for the maintenance of life, then yours. In beholding your selues therfore in this, presently marke withall that the like misfortune may happen to you, that hath ouertaken them, seeing the cause thereof is alike; and so labour, that in the end you may become more wise then they, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="6"/>
before them a like accident proceeding from the same cause in the Empire of Constantinople, could not make vse of it, but haue suffered themselues to fall into the fulnes of euill and miserie. In doing of which, if the first and second haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted such a fault as they cannot recouer, yet he not you the third which should commit the like. There is not any he that is not deceiued the first time; being misled because he had not made proofe thereof: for the second time a man may be also sometime deceiued, vnder a certaine pretence of frindship: but there is no excuse to the wise, when it happeneth the third time. If these first, if these second of our age haue been thus deceiued and ouertaken by their owne rage and retchlesnes, suffer not your feete to stumble against the same stone, after you haue seene two of them to stumble before you with so foule a fall. Stay your selues a while, and giue eare to the wofull reports, which daily are made of losse, of ruines, of fire, of great effusion of bloud, of captiuities, of violations, and of the execrable mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which are daily committed among the rest of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this miserable Hungarie, and euen by those whom they had drawen so vndiscreetly into their countrie, vnder the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of succour and ayde.</p>
   <p>And vpon this report, refraine your rage, take againe your wonted spirits, and indeuour that your follies may be so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie, that in euery wisemans iudgement, they may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed better then heretofore.</p>
