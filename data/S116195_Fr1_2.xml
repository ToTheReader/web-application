      <salute>MADAME,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously bethought my selfe in what doctrine especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to imply my Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="3"/>
in the place in which the Lord had by so strong and strange a prouidence settled me: Amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things I was vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently inclined to study the Cure of the Feare of Death; both because it may be vsually obserued, that the most men are in bondage by reason of these feares; as also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am assured, that ourliues wil become more sweet; yea, and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, when the feare of death is remoued: And the rather was I incited hereunto, because I haue obserued some defect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="3"/>
this point, in the most that haue written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Death. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the censure, which many may giue of this proiect, as accounting it an impossible thing to be effected; but my trust is, that godly and discreet Christians will restraine censure, when they haue throughly viewed my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
   <p>My vnsaigned desire to do seruice vnto GODS Church in releeuing such Christians herein, as are not furnished with better helps, hath emboldned me to offer this Treatise
<pb facs="4"/>
also to the publike view: I haue presumed in your Honours absence to thrust forth this Treatise vnder the protection of your Honours name: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all I desire heartily to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my thankefulnesse for the many fauours shewed vnto me and mine, while your Honour was pleased to be my Hearer. I should also much reioyce, if my testimony (concerning the singular graces God hath bestowed vpon you, and the many good works in which you haue aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the places of your aboad) might adde any
<pb facs="4"/>
thing, either vnto your Honours praises in the Churches of Christ, or vnto the establishment of the comfort of your owne heart in God, and his Son Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p>I haue not made choise of your Honour in this Dedication for any speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fitnesse in this Treatise; for your Honours condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in respect of your age, or absence in a place so farre remote. For my earnest trust is, that God will adde yet many yeares to your happy life on earth; and besides I haue had heeretofore occasion
<pb facs="5"/>
to know how little you were afraid to die, when the Lord did seeme to summon you by sicknes.</p>
   <p>That God, which hath ennobled your heart with heauenly gifts, &amp; so made you an instrument of so much good, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vnto that most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Princesse, with whom you now liue, and towards whom you haue shewed so much faithfull obseruance, and dearenes of affection, and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of attendance: Euen the Father of mercy, and God of all consolations, increase in you all spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb facs="5"/>
blessings, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the ioy of your heart, and make you still to grow in acceptation, and all well-doing: Humbly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pardon for my bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse heerein: I commit your Honour to God, and to the word of his Grace, which will build you vp to eternall life: resting</p>
