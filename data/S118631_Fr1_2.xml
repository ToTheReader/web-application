   <head>❧ And to the Right <hi>Worshipfull &amp; religious Gentleman, Sir</hi> ROBERT LEVVKENOR, of <hi>Acris</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> to Mistris GOVRNY of great Ellingham, <hi>to Mistris</hi> STEVVARD, and Mistris CATLIN of <hi>Denham,</hi> Grace and Peace.</head>
   <p>RIght Worshipfull, after I had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched this Sermon, I conferred with some of my brethren about the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of it, and some aduised me to print it, others to conceale it for two causes: First, because the world is full of bookes: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because it would make me lyable to many censures and imputations.</p>
   <p>For the first, I answer, that the world is full of bookes, but that it is too full of godly bookes, I could neuer heare it prooued. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I know that I shall bewray mine own weakenes exceedingly, and expose my selfe to many hard censures, by publishing this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet; and yet for all that, I choose rather to
<pb facs="4"/> be hated, to make my selfe a by-word, and a reproach, then to neglect any course that may turn to the good, though but of one soule; yea, and if it should turne to the good of none, yet shall I sing but to the same tune that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Gods seruants haue done before me: <hi>I haue laboured in vaine, and spent my strength to no purpose, Isa. 49. 4.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Whatsoeuer I haue done, I haue made bold also to present it to your Worships, as a testimonie of my thankefulnes vnto you all, and a meanes to reuiue and continue, (as much as in me lies) the deserued memorie of your godly brother, whome from my soule I loued in his life, and from my soule desire to honour in his death. If this poore mite may be accepted of you, and profitable to Gods Church, I haue my desire: which that it may be, I haue praied: and so praies still,</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>A poore, but a zealous welwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to your whole stocke and familie, BEZAL. CARTER.</signed>
