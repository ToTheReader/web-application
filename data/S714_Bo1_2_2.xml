   <opener>¶ To the moste christian prince Frauncis the Frenche Kinge, the first of that name, Erasmus of Roterodame sendeth greting.</opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat I haue not tyll this day (most Christiā Kyng Fraū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis) enioyed the commoditee of your maiesties speciall fauour and beneuolence towardes me, hathe nether been thorowe my defaulte or negligēce, neyther yet can y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cause thereof iustly be ascribed vnto your excellency: but among sondry lettes and impedimētes that hytherto hath chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, there hath none so muche enuied me this felicitie, as hathe this troublous and vnquiet worlde. For I haue euer loked when that in these long stormes and tempestes of warres, there woulde some fayre wether or clermes of peace shyne vpon vs oat of one quarter or other. Neither haue I thought my selfe at any time the lesse boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of an hear vnto your bountefull goodnes, then if I had accepted whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer your grace of your princely liberalitie offered me. And I trust ere it be lōge to haue an occasion more euidently to testifye the earneste zeale and good mynde I beare towardes your hyghnes.</p>
   <p>In the meane whyle vntyll oportunitie shall serue me so to dooe, I haue thought good to sende your grace the Paraphrase vpō the ghospell of Sainct Marke as an earnest penny of this my promise. And where I was of my selfe very prone and ready thus to dooe, and as it were runnyng forwarde of mine owne accorde, the very fitues of the matier did also not a lytle excite and moue me therunto. For after I had dedicated Mathewe vnto myne owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall liege lorde Charles themperoure: and Iohn (vpon whome by and by after I had finished Mathewe I made lykewyse a Paraphrase) vnto Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynande his maiesties naturall brother: &amp; Luke (whiche was the thyrde that I wente in hande withall) vnto the kyng of Englande: then remained there Marke, who semed to be lefte behynde for your grace, because the fower go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels shoulde be dedicated vnto the fower chiefe princes and rulers of the worlde. And god sende grace that the spirite of the ghospell maye lykewyse ioyne the heartes of you all fower together in mutuall amitie and concorde, as youre names are in this ghospell boke aptely conioyned. Some there be whiche extende the byshoppe of Romes dominion euen vnto hell or purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: other some geue him impery and power ouer the aungels. And so farre am I frō enuying him this pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>minente auctoritie, that I woulde wishe hym to haue a great deale more, but yet woulde I desyre withall, that the worlde might once fele this his power, good and holsome, in settyng christian Princes at one, and in conseruing the same in peace and amitie, whiche haue a lōg season with no lesse dishonoure, then slaughter and effusion of Christian bloud, warred one agaynste a nother to the vtter decay of Christes religion.</p>
   <p>And all this while we curse and banne the Turkes. But what pleasaunter sight can there be vnto the Turkes, (or yf any other naciō there be of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creauntes that are greater enemies vnto Christes religion) then to see thre of the moste florishing and moste puissaūt princes of all Europe, thus by reason
<pb n="iij" facs="132"/>
of mischieuous diuision, to pursue eche other with mortall battaille? It will scarcely sincke in my brayne that there is any so cruell a Turke who wysneth more mischiefe vnto Christen menne, thē thēselues weorke one an other. And all this whyle ariseth there no peace maker which w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his authoritie maye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peace this vngodly busines and ruffling of the worlde, whereas there lacketh not prouokers and setters on ynowe, and suche as poure oyle (as it is in the olde prouerbe) vpon the fyer. It is not my parte to make any ones title either better or worse with my foreiudgement. I knowe ryght wel that euery one thinketh his owne cause moste rightful and iuste: I knowe also that in all such iudgementes that same partye is euer woonte to haue more fauoure that▪ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth himselfe from iniury offred him, then he that offreth the wrong: but yet would I very fayne that all christian princes, woulde debate the matier ryght, and would well consider with themselues, how much he hathe gotten hereby, whatsoeuer he be, that had lieffer haue and embrace an vniust peace, then wage battaile be it neuer so iust and lawfull. What is more bryttle, more shorte, or more full of misery and wretchednesse, then is this present lyfe of ours? I will not here speake of so many kyndes of diseases as reigne in the worlde, so many iniuries, so many casualties, so many fatall calamities and misauentures, so many pestilences, so many diuers kyndes of lyghtninges, so many yerthquakes, so many sortes of fiers, so many fluddes and inundacions of waters, with other like calamities out of all measure and numbre. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mōge all the euils that mannes life is vexed or troubled withall, there is none where of more mischief and hurte ensueth, then of battaile, the which yet doeth muche more mischiefe vnto mennes maners, then it doeth vnto theyr substance or bodyes. For he doeth the lesse harme of bothe, that bereaueth a man of his life, then he that bereaueth him of his vertuous and good minde. Neyther is battayle euer the lesse detestable &amp; lesse to be abhorred, because the moste parte of the euills thereof lyghteth vpon poore folkes neckes, &amp; suche as are of lowe state and degree, as of husbandmen, craftes menne, and waifaryng men. For the Lorde of all Iesus Christe, shedde no lesse bloude for the redempcion of suche, be they neuer so bile rascals &amp; abiecte persons, then he dyd for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> greatest kynges and princes that be. And when at the dreadfull daye of dome we shall cumme before the iudgement seate of Christ (where muste ere long be presented all the potentates and rulers of this worlde, howe mightie and puissaunte soeuer they be) that rigorous iudge will require as streyght an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte for those sely poore wretches, as he wyll doe for the rulers and great menne. They therfore that thynke it but a small losse vnto the cōmon wealthe when these poore soules and vnderlinges are robbed, afflicted, dryuen out of their houses, burned, oppressed, and murthered, dooe plainly condemne of folyshnes Iesus Christe the wysdome of the father of heauen, who for to saue suche, as the sayde persons are, dyd shed his preciouse bloud, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred passion. Wherfore in mine opinion no kynde of people is more pernicious to the common weale, then suche as put into princes heades those thynges that maye styrte and moue them to warre, who the more highe stomaked and couragious they be, the soner are they deceyued. And amonge all princely vertues, highe stomake and noble courage of mynde is rekened the chief. For this vertue was Iulius Cesar of olde wryters hygly commended. And for the same is noble Kyng Frauncis lykewyse extolled in oure tyme,
<pb facs="133"/>
with the full consent and testimonie of all nacions. Nowe what greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is there of a very loftie and couragious mynde, then to be able nothinge to passe vpō iniuries? The doughtynes and valiaūtise of the olde Capitaines who warred for empire, and not for defence of lyfe, is muche renoumed and praysed, but in Gentyle wryters, and of Panyms or Gentiles. Certes it is a muche more honourable and glorious facte for a christian prince to bye peace and tranquilitie of the common weale with the losse of some parte of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and inheritaunce, then for victory obteyned to be receyued with muche goodly triumphe, bought with so great displeasures of the people. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such as haue incēsed the myndes of princes with a desyre to enlarge their empire, what els haue they inuented but a continual fountaine and quicke spryng of warres. Agayne as much mischiefe dooe they in the worlde that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister vnto the same princes occasion and matter of wrathe, bearyng them in hande that it is a thyng appertainyng vnto princely manhod or couragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to be auenged by force of armes for some folyshe worde spoken, whiche happely was vntruely reported, or at the lestewyse made a great deale worse, and more haynous then it was spoken in very dede. But howe muche greater a pointe is it of a noble courage, for consideraciō to haue the peace and tranquilitie of the common wealthe conserued, nothyng to passe vpon a ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng woorde? For yf any hurte cumme thereof, it is but a priuate hurte, yea, to say the truthe, it hurteth not at all, if it be neglected and not passed on. And in other matters concerning worldly affaires, kynges peraduenture maye take summe vacacion, and nowe and then sequestre them selues from buisy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, at leste wyse if it be lawfull for them to be any where idle and without busynesse, vnto whose office it specially belongeth to watche, for the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and safegarde of so many. But in takyng vpon them the daungerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises and aduentures of warre, forsomuche as the same bryngeth with it a whole floude of great euylles and mischiefes, they ought with all the iyen in their heades to watche, and to be as circumspect as is possible to be, leste they decree and determine any thyng vnaduisedly. Neither speake I these thynges (moste christen Kyng) of any entente to plucke the swearde out of the handes of princes. For peraduenture it is the parte of a good kyng sumtymes to make warre, but that muste be at suche tyme, when all other thynges ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng been assayed in vaine, extreme necessitie compelleth him so to dooe. The lorde Iesus tooke away the vse of the sweorde from Peter, but not from princes. Saincte Paule also confirmeth their authoritie, commaunding suche as in the citie of Rome professed Christes religion, in no wyse to contemne thautoritie of their soueraigne rulers, although the same were Gentiles and miscreauntes, in so muche that he woulde not haue taken from them, being as the very ministres of God, neyther theyr customes, theyr taxes or talages, nor theyr honoure. Taketh he the sweorde from them, who sayeth: For he beareth not the swerde for naught? The selfe same thyng doethe Peter also teache beyng one of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chiefe Apostles, saying: Submitte your selues therfore vnto all maner of ordinaunce of manne, for the lordes sake, whether it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kynge, as vnto the chief heade: eyther vnto rulers as vnto them that are sente of hym, for the punishment of euil dooers, but for the laude &amp; prayse of them that dooe well. &amp;c. Christe woulde haue Peter to haue no weapon saue the sweorde of the ghospell, whiche is the heauenly worde, the whiche as
<pb n="iiij" facs="133"/>
saincte Paul teacheth in the epistle to the Hebrewes, is quicke and mightye in operacion, and sharper then any two edged sweord: and entrethe through, euen vnto the deuiding asoudre of the soule and the spiryte. For he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth the sweorde to be put vp into the scaberte, and taketh it not awaye, doeth more then yf he toke it awaye. For why doeth he commaunde it to be put vppe? Truely because the uangelyke pastoure shoulde in no case make warre. Why doeth he neither commaunde it to be layde asyde, nor yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it so to be. Uerayly to dooe vs to vnderstande, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we ought not so much as then to go aboute to be auenged, when we are of power to reuenge the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties done vnto vs. Wherfore I conclude, that the euangelyke pastoures haue the sweord of the ghospell deliuered them of Christ, wherwith they sleagh vices, and cutte awaye mans carnall lustes and desyres. Kynges also and temporall princes haue theyr sweorde by his sufferaunce and permission, to make euillmen afearde, and to preferre good men accordingly. The sweorde is not taken from them: but the vse therof is prescribed. They haue it for a defence and couseruacion of the publike tranquilitie, and not to bolster, and maynteyne therwith theyr owne ambiciousnes. There are two manier of sweordes, &amp; lykewyse two maner of kyngdomes: The priestes and bishops haue theyr sweorde, and also theyr kyngdome. In stede of Diademes and helmettes they haue theyr Myters: In stede of a scepter they haue a crosyers staffe: they haue theyr brigandyne, theyr souldiers girdle, and to be shorte, al that complete harnes whiche that valiaunt warriour Saincte Paule des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth vnto them in sondry places. These euangelyke kynges are called pastours, so lykewyse are temporall kynges named of the Poete Homer, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours of the people. They bothe dooe one thyng, and yet is theyr office and ministery diuers, euen lyke as we see that in the same enterlude and play, some play one parte, and some an other. But yf they both had eche of theym theyr owne sweord in a readines, I meane, yf eche of theim would vse the power geuen them aryght, and as they ought to dooe, I thynke veryly that we (who are rather christen men by name, then in dede) would not so often times drawe out our wicked sweordes to thruste theim into the bellies of our christen bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Nowe whiles they bothe nothing regardyng theyr owne duetie, haue eche one a desyre to entermeddle with that, whiche in no wyse appertayneth vnto theyr vocacion, it cummeth to passe that neyther of them both do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne theyr owne dignitie accordyngly, nor yet conserue the publike tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. When hath a kyng more kyngly maiestie, then at suche tyme as he sitteth in iudgement, and ministreth iustice: then when he represseth iniuries, endeth centrouersies, helpeth the oppressed? or when he sitteth in counsayle studying how to aduaunce the common wealth? On the other syde, when hath a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop more of hys dignitie, then at suche tymes as he preacheth the doctrine of the gospel out of a pulpit? For then is that euangelike king in his seate royall.</p>
   <p>Loke howe vnsemyng a thyng it was for the Emperour Nero to contende with the maisters of Musyke and wyth harpers in the stage, or to proue maisteries with wagoners in the lystes or turneying place, called in latyne Circus: so vnsemely a thyng it is for a kyng to meddle wyth lowe and peltrie matiers that perteine vnto his own priuate affecciōs, and hurt the prosperous state of the common wealth. Agayne loke how vncomely a thyng it were if a Philosophier would with his cloke &amp; long beard scip about the stage, &amp; play
<pb facs="134"/>
a parte in an enterlude: or els holde a bill &amp; a net in his hande in the place where the swordplayers are wonte to fyght at vtteraunce, and syng theyr accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med song: I would not haue the, I woulde haue a fyshe, cocke why flye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> thou from me? euen no lesse vnsemely a thyng it is for the euangelike kyng to playe the warryer, to bye and sell, I wyll not speake of other thynges more vnhonest, and lesse agreable with his vocacion. Howe chaunceth it that there is anye one byshop in our dayes that thinketh it a goodlyer thyng for hym to haue in is trayne. CCC. horsmen well appointed wyth crosbowes, iauelins, and handegunnes, then to bee accompanied wyth a good numbre of learned and vertuous deacons, and to carry about with hym bokes of holy scripture?</p>
   <p>Why dooe they thynk them selues great by the pompous shewe and setting foorth of those thynges, by contemnyng wherof, suche as they succeded were accompted great and worthy persons? Why haue trumpettes and hornes a sweter sounde in theyr eares, then the readyng of holy scripture? Well then, what if a kyng in steade of a Diademe, and a robe of estate, put on a Myter and a priestes attyre? and contrary a bishop in stede of a Myter and priestes attyre weare a Diademe, and a kynges robe or kyrtel-wil it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare a monstreous sight vnto vs?</p>
   <p>Nowe if the vnright and disordered vse of suche thinges as are but signes of theyr office and ministeries dooe so greatly moue vs, why then are we not a greate deale more moued to see their offices turned cleane cam, &amp; misordered? Certes if either kyng o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> bishop dooe any thing priuately, they must haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to nothing els, but to the health and conseruacion of the people. For yf they dooe theyr dutie aright, either they admonishe such as are out of the way, correct suche as haue done amysse, or coumforte the dismayed, or kepe vnder the proude and hye mynded, or styrre vp idle persons, or make those that are at variaunce frendes and louers againe. This is the very office of kynges but specially of the euangelike kynges, who in no wyse ought ambiciously to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre this worldly kingdome. And forasmuche as the Lorde Iesus was in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dede both a spirituall and a temperall kyng (although he expressed in yerth but a spirituall kyngdom alonely) it is both theyr partes to dooe what in the lyeth to counterfaicte and followe theyr prince.</p>
   <p>He wholly gaue himselfe for his. And how then for shame dare any that calleth hymselfe Christes vicar, lyue onely to his owne priuate wealth and commoditie? Christe whether he were in the temple, or in the Synagoges, or went abrode, or taried at home in his seuerall house, or were carried by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or continued in the wildernes, dyd nothyng elles all his lyfe long but playe the parte of a sauiour, of a comforter, of a well dooer. He taught the multitude, he healed the diseased, he clensed the lepres, he restored the sycke of the palsey, the lame and the blynd. Further he chased awaye hurteful spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, raysed the dead, deliuered those that were in peryll, filled the bellies of the hungry, reproued the Phariseis, defended his disciples, and also the synner that so lauishely poured out her oyntmente vpon hym.</p>
   <p>He coumforted the synfull woman of Canaan, and her that was taken in adulterye: Peruse all the whole lyfe of Iesus, and it shall euidently appeare that he neuer harmed any bodye, notwithstanding he had so manye hurtes and displeasures done to hym of others, and that he coulde eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ly haue been auenged yf it had pleased hym.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="v" facs="134"/>He euery where played the sauioure, euerywere the well doer.</p>
   <p>He restored Malchus eare agayne whiche Peter cut of with his swe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rd. He would not haue his safegarde defeded wyth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> least hurte or displeasure that might be to any body. He made Herode and pilate at one. Hangyng on the crosse he saued one of the theues. Whan he was dead he drewe the captaine of the garison vnto the christian profession. This was the very office and parte of a kyng, to do all men good, and hurte no bodye. His example all christian princes ought as nygh as thei can, to folowe. And forasmuche as your grace is called the moste christian kyng, the very name and title selfe that is geuen your highnes, ought specially to moue you to expresse in all your doinges, as nere as ye can possible, the prince of all princes, Christe. But what sparcle of shame remayneth there in those persons, who albeit they haue a pleasure to be called the vicars of Christe, doe notwithstandyng require to haue (I saye not theyr lyfe or dignitie) but theyr auarice and pryde defended with greate effusion and shedyng of christian bloud? And this wryte I (ryght no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prince) not for to defame or reproue any bishops (albeit I woulde wishe of God that there were not some christian bishops of whome these wordes might beiustely spoken) but onely to shewe wherein y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> true dignitie of kynges and bishoppes consisteth, to the ende that bothe of them knowyng and mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening theyr owne dignitie, maye happily passeouer this transytorye lyfe to Goddes pleasure and contentacion. But muche farder are those euangelike pastours from doyng theyr dutye, who, where it had been theyr parte to make princes beyng at debate and variaunce at one agayne, do of their owne accorde incense them to warre, and as it is an old prouerbe, do cast brandes vpon the fyers or flames of battayle. Surely yf euer it were nedefull for a good pastour or shepherde anye where to prouide for the safegarde of his flocke with the losse and spendyng of his lyfe: if the example of that chiefe shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde Christ, in whose stede they are, were any where to be expressed and folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, here chiefly ought they to haue do one theyr duetie, whereso greate a sea of mischiefes gusseth and floweth out into the worlde. But howe chaunceth it that amōg so great a noumber of Abbottes, bishops and Archebishops, and Cardinals, not one steppeth foorth that dare putte, yea euen his veraye lyfe in hasarde, to make an ende of this greate stirryng and troublous buisynes of the worlde? Howe happily dyeth he, whoso by his deathe causeth so many thousande mennes lyues to be saued? There is no crueller a thyng, then is that fyghting hand to hande, and bucherly manglyng and cuttyng of sweard players: And yet was antiquitie so fondly delyted with this syght, that the moste naughtie and detestable example remaynyng of the vse of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, continued a long season, euen emong christen men, namely in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Rome, whiche coulde not yet forget her old paganitie. But that this manoure of fyghtyng is vtterly set asyde, we maye thanke (as wytnesseth the historye called the tripartite history) one Telemachus a manne of theyr order and profession, who for christian simplicitie, and a desyre they had to leade a solitarye lyfe, and to eschewe the companye of the synfull multitude, were commonly called monkes or solytarye persons. This Telemachus came for this purpose out of the easte parties to Rome, and entryng into the place (whiche was called of them Theatrum, that is to saye, a place or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to beholde shewes and pastimes in) when he sawe two armed men
<pb facs="135"/>
come into the fightyng place, and aboute to sley one another, he leaped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them as they were in their furye and rage, crying and saying with a loude voyce: What dooe ye brethern? why go ye about like wylde beastes to murther one another? To make shorte tale, whiles the good man wente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to saue both theyr lyues, he lost his owne, beyng stoned to deathe of the people: So muche dyd the dotyng multitude set by thys cruelliye pastime and pleasure. But what came of this? Honorius the Emperoure, assone as he was enfourmed herof, commaunded this maner of shewyng the people pastyme by couplyng or matchyng together of swearde players, to be lefte and vtterly abolyshed. Nowe marke me well howe vnhonest a pastyme it was, and how many thousandes had by reason therof been miserablye slayne and murthered, and then shal it euidently appere how much the world is bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

How muche more then by all ryght and reason shoulde he deserue to haue lyke honoure gyuen hym, that woulde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture his lyfe to parte so mightye and puissaunt princes, that thus warre and fyght continuallye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

For the common welth sustey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no great losse yf a swerdplayer kyll a sweardplayer, and one vngracious varlet sleyeth another: And yet as princes cannot be enemyes together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the vtter detr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Nowe yf anye chaunce vpon suche a prince as can by no meanes be intreated, but is of a tyrannous and cruell nature: then let him consyder how the greatest hurt and displeasure that the cruellest tyranne in the world is able to do, is but death.</p>
   <p>And where I praye you shall the successours of the Apostles shewe an exaumple of an Apostolyke spyrite, yf they shewe it not in this case? Some will heresaye: What shall my death preuayle, yf I haue not my desyre? I answere: Christe the rewarde gyuer wyll not see his champion to lose his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. Albeit many tymes death obteyneth, what lyfe could neuer bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. For the death of vertuous men is of no small power and efficacie.</p>

      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable. Iohn Baptist was beheaded for his franke speakyng: but al prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not Herodes: nor all haue not suche peramours as Herodias was. Ambrose bishop of Myllayne shranke not to suspende Theodosius the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure out of the churche, for his cruell and rashe sentence agaynst the Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians, and after he had sharply rebuked hym, and commaunded hym to make satisfaccion, he put hym to his penaunce. And sorthwith the maiestye of so myghtye a prynce gaue place, and was obedient vnto the auctoritie of a bishop.</p>
   <p>The holy man Babylas Bishoppe of Antioche attempted to vse lyke seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie againste a kynge whiche had murthered an innocent, and he was slayne for his laboure: but anon as he was deade, he began to be feared not onely of the heathen Emperour, but also of the deuyles, whiche were as yet in these dayes wurshypped for Goddes. I haue (ryght excellent prince) suche an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="vj" facs="135"/>
of the Emperours maiestes nature, of your Graces disposicion, and of the kyng of Englandes good nature, and vertuous inclinacion, that I put no doubtes but you all would long ere this haue folowed good aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisementes, if there had been any suche counsaillour, whiche would haue been plaine and franke with you all with discretion, and discrete with franke plaines.</p>
   <p>And all this whyle there lacketh not great plenty of suche as incense the myndes of princes to battayle, namely of those persones whome it behoueth, forasmuche as theyr profit and lyuing dependeth therupon, to haue all the worlde in an vprore, and vnquieted with warres. One sayeth: he setteth your maiestie at naught: he gaue your grace suche a mocke. Another, yf your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse ioyne this part vnto your dominions, you may also at your pleasure easely ioyne that. O vnaduised and rashe counsaylour. Why doest thou rather put into his head howe farre he may extende the boundes of his dominions, then put him in remembraunce with howe narrowe lymites the seignorie, whiche he hath nowe at this present was in olde tyme bounded. Why doest thou not shewe hym whiche▪ way that he hath may be well gouerned, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then enlarged? The extending of boundes is endlesse: and therefore most true it is that Seneca reporteth: Many Emperours and princes haue encro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vpon others, and taken theyr marches from them: and yet neuer none tyl this daye hath appointed hymselfe any lymittes to be content withall. But the verye true commendacion of a prince standeth in well gouerning. Alexander the great when he was come to the Oecian sea, wished there had been another worlde for him to conquere, as who saye this, worlde was to litle to satisfye his ambiciousnes, &amp; desyre that he had to enlarge his Empier. Hercules neuer went beyond the yles called Gades. But no Oecian, no Gades can bound our insaciable ambicion. Howbeit against the pestilent wordes of suche persones, christian princes ought to haue their myndes dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently fortyfied afore hand, with the decrees and sayinges of Christe, as it were with triacles or preseruatiues against poison, and in all their counsayles to haue speciall regarde vnto the rule of the gospell, as vnto a marke.</p>
   <p>Peraduenture your maiestie will aske what I meane to syng so long a song vnto your highnesse, sence the same is moste occupyed aboute the weightye affaires of the common wealthe. Yea, my desyre was to haue this song songen to all menne, for no cause els, but for that this vniuersall calamitie of the worlde greueth me very sore, and also for that I muche desyre to see more tranquilitie and quietnes in euery parte of Christendome, but speciallye in the realme of Fraunce, then whiche kyngdome I wote not whether there be anye more excellent eyther in true christianitye and goodlyuing, or els in worldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundaunce and prosperitie. Now yf suche rufflyng and troublous bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synes dyd seldome when chaunce, lyke as great fluddes, earthquakes, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine are wont to do, then were it a thyng more tollerable: but so it is that the worlde is continually troubled, and neuer at quiet by reason of suche dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and diuision. The physycians whensoeuer there chaunceth any newe bodely diseases, do wittely searche out the causes of the maladie, the whiche once knowen, then do they easly cure it: And not onely contented thus to do, they also inuent wayes to let that thesame plague maye not often tymes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn to rage afreshe, or reigne agayne. Why therfore in these so great euils,
<pb facs="136"/>
and so many tymes chauncing, do not men of great wisedome and experience semblably searche out the welles that all this troublous busines so oft sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth out of into the worlde, to the ende that the rootes therof beeyng cleane cut vp and destroyed, they maye perfitely cure and remeady thesame? why are we quycke syghted in thynges of litell weight and importaunce or none at all, and in the weightiest thing of all more then halfe blynde? Myne opinion is, that battaile for the moste part springeth of vayne wordes or titles as it were inuented to nourishe mās pryde &amp; vayne glory, as who saie, there were not ambicion ynoughe in the worlde, vnlesse we fed &amp; maintened this naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vice with newly inuented titles, the whiche vice of it owne propre nature groweth to fast in vs. These, and suche other lyke rootes and chief causes of battaile beyng once cut awaye, then should it be easie to cōclude and establishe a peace among christian princes, with such lawes and condicions that woulde neuer suffre suche ruffling businesse and hurly burly to begyn agayne. By this meanes should the princes encrease in richesse, now beeing common bytwene them by reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n of amitie and frendship: and the christian people should lyue in louely peace and tranquilitie vnder their moste wealthye princes. So would the lorde Iesus, that true king of the whole worlde, be fauorable vnto vs: and cause all thinges to prosper &amp; goe forwarde with vs. So should we be feared of the enemies of Christes religiō againste whom we haue much a do at this daye to defend our owne, much lesse than are we able to discoumfite them and chase them away far from vs: Albeit I had rather haue them refourmed of their misbeliefe, then by force of armes chased away and put to flyght. But howe is it possible for vs to reforme other, yf our selues be (I had almoste sayed) worse and more vicious in our conuersacion then they are? For I dooe not here esteme christian menne by the articles of the fayth whiche we professe with mouthe, but by theyr maners and lyning. Wheresoeuer ambicion, couetousnes, pryde, wrathe, reuengemente, and a desyre to hurte reigneth, there (say I) lacketh the faythe of the ghospell. Nowe albeit this pestilence haue infected, euen those vnto whose office it chiefly apperteined to see a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the decay of christen religion, yet haue I some good hope of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macion, because I see the bookes of holy scripture, but specially of the newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament so taken in hande, and laboured of all men, yea euen as much as of the ignoraunt and vnlettered sorte, that many tymes suche as professe the perfyte knowledge of Goddes woorde, are not able to matche them in reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng. And that there be very many readers of the bookes of the newe testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this one thyng maketh me to beleue, because notwithstanding the printers do yerely publishe and put forth so many thousande volumes, yet all the bookesellers shoppes that be, are not hable to suffice the gred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>es of the byers. For nowe a dayes is it well solde ware whatsoeuer a man attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vpon the ghospell. This so strong a medicine once receiued and dronken canne not but worke and put forth his strength. Wherfore me thynketh the worlde is in case lyke to a mānes body vexed with greuous diseases, after it hath receyued an herbe called Ellebore, or some other strong purgaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For then is it all together distempered and out of quyet, and fareth as though it woulde yelde vp the ghoste. And God sende grace that this euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelike Ellebore, after it haue once searched and entred into all the veynes of our soule, maye so come vp agayne, that (the sedes of vices beyng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="vij" facs="136"/>
cast out and auoyded) it maye restore vs made whole and purged of all our synnes, vnto Iesu Christe, and maye also after this greate rufflyng and almoste vncurable diseases of the worlde, bryng agayne vnto all menne that ioyefull and muche desyred tranquilitie. And verily I would hope better that the common prayers of all good men to that ende and purpose shoulde not be made in vaine, if the chiefe estates of the worlde, woulde lyke trustie and faythfull physycians, do theyr endeuour to helpe the worlde in this euill case, that is to saye, yf the princes, in whome it chiefly lyeth to rule the worlde as they wyll, would call vnto theyr remembraunce that they shall shortlye (for what thing is there in this present lyfe of any long continuaunce) gyue an accoumpt vnto that moste soueraigne and high prince, how they haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned their dominions: Agayne yf the bishoppes, diuines, and all ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call persones woulde likewyse remember, howe they haue not succeded in the places of Annas &amp; Caiphas, or of the Scribes and Phariseis, (who whyles they wickedly defended theyr owne kyngdome, wente about to oppresse the kyngdome of the ghospell: whyles they vphelde and defended theyr owne glorye, dyd theyr endeuour to bury and ouer whelme Christes glorye: and finally, whiles they laboured to approue theyr owne righteousnesse, made God vnrighteous) but rather in the place of the Apostles, who had a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure euen with the leesyng of theyr owne bloude and liues to defende Christes kyngdome, Christes glory, and Christes righteousnes. Christe hath once suffered, once arysen agayne from death to lyfe, and neuer wyll dye agayne. But he suffereth thesame passion afreshe, so oft as the truethe of the ghospell is condemned, beaten, spytte vpon, crucified, and buried. To be short, he reckeneth done vnto hymselfe, whatsoeuer euell or displeasure is done vnto his membres. Peraduenture (moste Christian kyng) I haue spokē here more frankely, and more at large then it became me to do: howbeit the great loue I beare towarde your grace hath made me both lauishe of my woordes, and also more bolde to vtter my minde vnto your highnesse: I beyng a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man, do wishe well vnto all Christian menne generally: but yet haue I a certaine speciall loue and affeccion to the moste noble and florishyng realme of Fraunce. I beseche Iesu thimmortall kyng of the whole worlde, vnto whome the heauenly father hath geuen all power in heauen and in yearth, to geue his holy spirite both to the people, and also to the princes and rulers: to the princes, that they may haue grace happely to passe ouer theyr lyues in mutuall amytie and concorde vnder theyr common kyng and prince Iesu: vnto the other, that they maye lyue in reste and peace vnder their moste god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wealthy princes: and the ende of all to be this, that christian vertue and godlinesse beyng well planted among vs, maye be enlarged and spred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode as muche as is possible to be, not by inuadyng or wasting of others dominions or countreys (for so our enemies become the porer, but neuer the better and more godly) but by preaching euery where the doctrine of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell syncerely and truely, by theyr ministery that haue in them the spirite of the ghospell: and by ordering our liues after suche sorte, that verye many may be allured to professe our religion euen by the swete smell or sauour of our good lyuing. So be ganne the christian empire, so encreaced it, so was it greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, so was it established: and by the contrary we see how it is now almost at a point and come to nothing, if we considre the greatnesse of the whole
<pb facs="137"/>
worlde. Wherfore loke by what aydes it first beganne, by what meanes it was encreaced, and established, by the same must we repaire it beyng decaied, enlarge it being brought into narrowe roume, and finally establishe it againe beyng vnstable and at no sure staye. These thinges wryte I (moste christian prince) of a pure zele and good mynde, neyther reprehending any man, sence I beare all men my good wyll, neyther flatteryng with any, or corying fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure, because I seke naught at no mannes handes.
