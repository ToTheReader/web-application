      <hi>¶ To the Right Honorable and my</hi> verye good Lorde, the Lorde Burleigh, <hi>Lorde high Treasurer of Englande, one of the Knightes of the most Honorable order of the</hi> Carter, and one of the Lordes of the Queenes Maiesties priuie Counsell: Iohn Marbecke wisheth long lyfe, with increase of all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and perpetuall felicitie.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit (right</hi> Honourable) it were good Reason, and moste conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing shoulde come before your Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable presence, but that which were moste perfect and excellent: yet bearing my selfe bolde vppon that incomparable goodnesse, which all men knowe to reast within your Noble nature, I haue here presumed to <pb facs="4"/> offer a taste vnto your good Lordship, of such simple fruite as my poore Orcharde coulde yeelde. Moste humbly beseeching your Honour as well to pardon my rude boldenesse herein, as also to accept my sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Present. My meaning hereby, is not (my good Lorde) to seeme to craue anye thankes or prayse where none is deserued, but onely to seeke some such meanes as my poore abilitie will serue, to leaue a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall of the dutifull good will and single heart, which I beare vnto your Honour, for whose good and prosperous estate, as all men, (who are any thing touched, eyther with zeale of godlynesse, or loue of their Countrie) haue good occasion earnestlye to pray: so I especially, for the fauourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination I haue alwayes perceyued in your good Lordship to remaine towards so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a worme as I am, haue most iust cause <pb facs="4"/> continually to craue the same at gods hand during my life, which vnfainedlye I will. And being not able otherwise to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of my dutie herein, in most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maner I besech your Honor in fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wyse to accept this my good meaning, who being desirous to labour in the Lordes haruest, and yet not able to holde tacke with strong and lustie labourers therein, neyther worthie to bee accounted in the number of good workemen: am contented to come after, as it were a gleaning: and as mine olde age, and other mine imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections will giue me leaue, fayre and softly to creepe after the Carte, picking vp such scattered corne, as is fallen out by the waye in the Lordes fielde: and yet to good to bee lost, or troden vnder foote, but rather, now being gathered togither, worthy in my sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple iudgement to bee sorted into sheaues:
<pb facs="5"/> humbly desiring your good Lordshippe to suffer them to be placed in your Barne, if your Honor shall thinke them woorth the threshing. Or if otherwise, yet, that then by your Lordshippes licence and fauourable protection, they may be permitted to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed amongest the mainye, and simple sorte of the reast of the Christian flocke. The Lorde of all Lordes preserue your good Lordshippe in most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous and blessed estate.</p>
