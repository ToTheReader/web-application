   <head>The Argument.</head>
   <p>AN honest, well-knowing and well-knowne Souldier, (whose name for some Reasons I conceale) dwelt lately in <hi>VVestminster</hi>), in the round Woolstaple, he was a man onely for Action, but such Action as Loyalty did alwayes iustifie, either for his Prince, Countrey, or
<pb facs="4"/>
their Deere and neere Freinds or Allies; in such noble designes Hee would and did often with courage, and good Aprouement em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himselfe in the Low-Countreys, having alwaies with him a little blacke Dogg, whom hee called <hi>Drunkard</hi>; which Curre would (by no meanes) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forsake or leaue him. But lately in these French Warrs, the Dogg being in the Isle of <hi>RHEA,</hi> where
<pb facs="4"/>
his Master (valiantly figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) was vnfortunately slaine, whose death was grieu'd for by as many as knew him; and as the Corps lay dead, the poore louing Masterlesse Dogg would not forsake it, vntil an English Souldier pulld off his Masters Coate, whom the Dog followed to a Boat, by which meanes he came backe to Westminster, wher hee now remaines. Vpon whose fidelity, (for the
<pb facs="5"/>
loue I owed his deseased Master) I haue writ these following lines, to expresse my Adiction to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb, <hi>Loue me and loue my Hound</hi>; I haue a little rubb'd our Gull-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Roarers ouer the Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combes, and withall I haue not forgotten our nose-wise Prescisians: If the Dogg <hi>Drunkard</hi> doe a little snap at them, I hold it their wisest way to be silent and put it vp, but if they
<pb facs="5"/>
will bee maundring, let them expect what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
