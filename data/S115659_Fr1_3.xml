   <head>The Preface to the READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great contention that was betwixt the two Women,<note place="margin">1 Kings Chap. 3.</note> who should be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the liuing childe, was by <hi>Salomon</hi> easily decided, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving childe by his wisedome was restored to the right Mother. If Truth &amp; Peace had ioyned hands with <hi>Rome</hi> and vs, Wisedome her selfe would haue iustified her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and our Adversaries would haue resolued this questiō (which without all question is to be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) that <hi>Bertram</hi> was the true Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this fruitfull issue, and his
<pb facs="5"/>
Doctrine was the Tenet of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers and the Church his Mother.</p>
   <p>But such is the condition of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that although the true sonne may as easily bee knowne by his voice as <hi>Iacob</hi> was from <hi>Esau;</hi> yet the Mother that bred this childe would make him an <hi>Esau,</hi> and supplant him of his birth-right; the wombe that brought him forth disclaymes his Doctrine, the Church that gaue him sucke out of her two Breasts, the two Testaments, denies him entertainment: and yet behold the Mother of the child, and this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Mother do sympathize: The Mother of the child although she were a strumpet, yet would she by no meanes suffer her son to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, nor accept of a dead child, although it was presented to her as her owne. This Authors Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="5"/>
(although at that time of his birth she had lost much of her wonted modestie) yet would she not agree, to haue her blessed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Sacrament to be divided and given by the halues, yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though what was offered her, Christ told her it was her body; yet by no meanes would she allow of the dead Letter which killeth, but of the quickning Spirit which giueth life.</p>
   <p>Here we see the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is auncient, not her errors. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge shee was a Mother Church, and had sometimes <hi>Kings for Nursing Fathers, and Queenes for Nursing Mothers:</hi> yea, behold this man <hi>Bertram,</hi> had a King, a great King, <hi>Charlemaine the Great,</hi> to his Nursing Father, and the Romish Church, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the fairest amongst women, gaue him milke out of her sacred
<pb facs="6"/>
Breasts, as a Nursing Mother.</p>
   <p>If there be any remembrance left to Parents for their childrens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Mother, behold thy Sonne.</hi>] If there be any meanes left for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to relieue their blind and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed Parents. <hi>Sonne, behold thy Mother.</hi>] Such is our charitie to the bond-woman &amp; her children, that we pittie them, we pray for them, yea, in this Subiect of the reall presence; We heartily wish, that men had not studied so much to be open where the Scripture is silent, and that curious wits had not beene wise aboue sobrietie, to haue searched into the wayes of the Lord, which are past finding out.<note place="margin">B: <hi>Andrewes</hi> against <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. cap.</hi> 1.</note> That which <hi>Durandus</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to haue said, doth not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vs; <hi>We heare the Word, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the sound, we know not the manner, we beleeue the Presence, we beleeue (I say) the Presence as well
<pb facs="6"/>
as they, concerning the manner of the Presence, we doe not vnadvisedly define, nay more, we doe not scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulously enquire: no more then we doe in Baptisme, how the blood of Christ cleanseth vs, no more then we doe in the Incarnation of Christ, how the divine nature is vnited to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, we reckon it amongst the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and indeed the</hi> Eucharist <hi>is a mysterie, the remaynders whereof should be consumed with fire, that is, (as the Fathers doe elegantly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it) which should be adored by faith, not debated by reason.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But to come to the Author and his Authoritie. Behold, after 800. yeares silence in the graue, there is risen this Champion, to confute this new borne Bratt <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi> All the credit that I haue, or am like to haue in the Church of God, I will ingage it vpon the worth of this little Tract. A worke
<pb facs="7"/>
not powred forth vpon Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but composed with mature deliberation, being required ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto by <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, (neither was it likely, that <hi>so great an Eagle as</hi> Charlemayne <hi>would consult with flyes</hi>) in whom it was hard to say whether Learning or Magnificence had the vpperhand: and for these later times, let the iudgement of that famous Bishop and Martyr, D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Ridley</hi> informe vs, of whom I may truly say what <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> did of <hi>Nepotian (Pectus suum Bibliothecam fecerat Christi,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ierom ad Paulinum.</note>
      <hi>nec do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leat Ecclesia quod talem amiserit, sed gaudeat quod talem habuerit,</hi>) who publiquely honored this Treatise in his Disputations at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and privatly bequeathed it as a Legacy to D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Brookes,</hi> affirming it to be the first meanes of his conversion, and reducement from the common er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Roman Church.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>But behold the Authoritie of this Man, and the dexteritie of his subiect, is so great an eye-sore to our Adversaries, that they cannot with any patience reflect vpon him: Here shall you see <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> against <hi>Manasses,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses</hi> against <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but both against <hi>Iuda;</hi> here you shall see Iurors and Iudges reconciled, as <hi>Pilot</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> but both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Bertram:</hi> Will you haue him brought as <hi>Paul</hi> was before the Councell, &amp; set before them; <hi>Behold the Man.</hi> The Iudge doth harken, the Councellers be silent, the Cryer biddeth peace, all the people are attentiue to know the cause whereof they would accuse him.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the Foreman of the Inquest, he saith,<note place="margin">Bellarm: de script: Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast. Tom. <hi>7.</hi> fol. <hi>121.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>That</hi> Bertram <hi>the Priest liued aboue</hi> 800. <hi>yeares since, and was the first that brought in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
<pb facs="8"/>
the Reall presence, but sayth he,</hi> Paschasius Ratbertus, <hi>an Abbot wrote fully and freely of that subiect against him.</hi> So then we see him here confessed for the Author, but opposed for his Doctrine, if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> haue spoken the truth, beare witnes w<seg rend="sup">th</seg> him of the truth. Onely let me tell you, I haue read that whole Tract of <hi>Paschasius,</hi> Printed by them, and there I finde he writes of the Reall presence, he mentioneth two Sacraments, and maintaines the cōmunion in both kinds, but of <hi>Bertram</hi> in his whole Treatie <hi>ne</hi>

      <hi>He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, That though in some things he transgressed the forme of wordes, yet he holdes correspondencie with

the Catholique Roman Doctrine.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>By this mans saying, I see no cause why <hi>Bertram</hi> deserved a Writ to priviledge his dotage.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">De visib. Monarch.

      <note place="margin">In his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the <hi>Sacram: cap.</hi> 1 <hi>fol.</hi> 23</note>The sixth:] <hi>Reynolds the Priest saith, toward</hi> 800 <hi>yeeres after Christ, one</hi> Bertram, <hi>and a little before him one</hi> Scotus <hi>wrote darkly of the truth of this Sacrament, but whatsoever the private opinion of</hi> Bertram <hi>was, his publique speeches and writings sounded so ill in the eares of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques of that age, that</hi> Paschasius <hi>an Abbot made a very learned Booke in refutation of him.</hi> These two hold together like a rope of Sand,
<pb facs="9"/>
the one saith, <hi>Bertram</hi> did write but obscurely, the other saith, It was not <hi>Bertram,</hi> but some obscure Authors; the one saith, there was no such doctrine published in that age, the other saith, that <hi>Scotus</hi> at that time wrote darkly, as <hi>Bertram</hi> did on the Sacrament.</p>
   <p>The seventh, and eight:<note place="margin">Posseu: prefi ad Lect: tom. <hi>1.</hi> apparat. Sixt: Sen. prafat. in Bibl.</note>] <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius, vnder the name of</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram <hi>wrote this booke to</hi> Charles <hi>the Great, sayth</hi> Possevinus <hi>and</hi> Sixtus Senensis.</p>

      </note>] <hi>The Worke is spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and tainted with the Leven of</hi> Berengarius <hi>heresie, saith</hi> Gregory de Valentia. These also might well agree, if they could reconcile the times and their different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: for <hi>Berengarius</hi> liued about six hundred yeares agoe, and <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colampadius</hi> about a hundred. But if either <hi>Berengarius</hi> followers, or <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> himselfe wrote this
<pb facs="10"/>
Tract of <hi>Bertrams,</hi> it must needs be that <hi>Paschafius Ratbertus,</hi> who wrote against this Treatise 800. yeares agoe (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> &amp; <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> doe affirme) did write by the Spirit of Prophecie against <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> followers, &amp; <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> long before they were borne.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">In his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Christ. <hi>Sacr.</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</note>The tenth:] D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Heskius</hi> saith, that <hi>Bertram in the time of</hi> Charles, <hi>wrote of the Sacrament suspitiously, and yet in such sort, as no man could be certaine, what hee assuredly meant.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">De Ador: Euchar: cap. <hi>19.</hi>
      </note>The eleventh:] <hi>Espencaeus</hi> saith, That <hi>Bertram wrote a Booke to</hi> Charles <hi>the Emperour, of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet in the iudgement of those that favour his error, he doth intangle both his cause and the minde of the Reader, and although he citeth many of the ancient Fathers, yet one while he seemeth a Catholique, another while of another opinion.</hi> These two
<pb facs="10"/>
are nere to reconciliation, for they both agree vpon the certaintie of the Author, but condemne the vncertaintie of his doctrine.</p>
   <p>The twelfth:] <hi>Trithenius,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Tritenius de Bertr:</note> a man without exception, he sayth, <hi>That</hi> Bertram <hi>the Priest was exceedingly skilfull in the holy Scriptures, he was sharpe in wit, famous in speech, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he lesse notable in life then in learning; he wrote many famous and excellent workes vnto</hi> Charles the Great, <hi>the brother of</hi> Lotharius <hi>the Emperour; he wrote a praise-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Booke,</hi> (to wit) <hi>one Booke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Body and Blood of the Lord; he flourished in the dayes of</hi> Lotharius <hi>the Emperour, about the yeere of Christ</hi> 840.</p>
   <p>You haue heard the great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, what they can say against this Author. Yet all this while the <hi>Trumpet hath given an vncertaine sound.</hi> Some (you see) denyes
<pb facs="11"/>
the man as a singular Novelist, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers acknowledge the Author, but affirme this Worke to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positious, others say he held the catholique opinion in the maine, but squared in the forme of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, so that hitherto you see the Iurors are not agreed among themselues, and therefore they cannot giue vp their Verdict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: Onely this last witnes doth best resolue all the former doubts, he sheweth, that <hi>Bertram</hi> was no dotard, he shewes it could not be written by <hi>Berengarius,</hi> or his followers, for he liued &amp; wrote this Worke to <hi>Charles</hi> 200. yeares before his time, he shewes he was not spurious but the true Author, and by this his testimonie doth cleerely exclude <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> for the Author, whose writings were not extant when <hi>Tritemius</hi> made his Catalogue of this and other Authors.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="11"/>Certainely, if these men had beene sworne to the Truth as well as to the Church, the Foreman of the Inquest, and the last, would haue reconciled all the rest.</p>
   <p>You haue heard (Gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) the Popes tenants, his sworne servants, our sworne enemies, their best witnesses, <hi>Bertrams</hi> worst ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, bound by oath to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Papacy, divided amongst themselues. Now listen and heare their soveraigne Iudges giue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and according to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, let him stand or fall in your judgment: And first let their Lord chiefe Iustice, Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eyght be heard; for, as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre, so he may not be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.<note place="margin">Ant. Posseu: Appar: Pag. <hi>230.</hi> Tom. <hi>1.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Let not</hi> Bertram <hi>be read</hi> (saith he) <hi>but with leaue of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolique Sea, and with this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Reader my confute the heretiques by the errors of that booke.</hi>
      <pb facs="12"/>
The next are the <hi>Roman Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ind: libr. <hi>prohibited Anno 1559</hi> &amp; Trident:</note>
      <hi>and the Trent Fathers; these also haue decreed him to be included in the number of Authors prohibited.</hi> So then you haue two principall Iudges, a Pope &amp; a late Councell condemning him, and yet this may be thought a strange thing, that without a legall proceeding, without triall of the partie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing him, or his Advocate speake for him, to adiudge him? Is it worse with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day, then it was with Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar?</hi> Behold what <hi>Festus</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernour answereth <hi>Pauls</hi> accusers in the like case:<note place="margin">Acts 25. vers. 16.</note>
      <hi>It is not the manner of the</hi> Romans <hi>to deliuer any man to dye before that he which is accused haue the accusers face to face, and to haue licence to answere for himselfe concerning the crime layd against him.</hi> If <hi>Bertram</hi> had beene arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="12"/>
and condemned when he was liuing; if his accusers had beene brought face to face before the Emperour, there might haue bin some pretence, some Plea, some Record against him; but after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred yeares continuance to giue sentence, and to sit in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation against him as Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife, Witnesse and Iudge that is neither allowable in Church nor State.</p>
   <p>Well, what will <hi>Bertram</hi> doe in this case? Surely, he will appeale (<hi>as</hi> Paul <hi>did to</hi> Caesar:) but to whom? Not to one man alone, but to a multitude: not to an ignorant multitude, but to a learned; to a Vniversitie, not on our side (for they would be partiall) but on theirs, the famous Vniversitie of <hi>Doway</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> there he was a free denison, bred and borne, and his request is to be tryed by his
<pb facs="13"/>
      <hi>Countrie. Since therefore he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the learned men of</hi> Doway, <hi>to</hi> Doway <hi>let him goe.</hi> Now I pray what will these Iudges doe? They heare the Popes sentence, the Councels decree, the Inquisitors severe Iudgement, they weigh so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly his accusers reasons, they examine diligently the Author himselfe, and finding the former doome too heavie for so slight er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors committed by him, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale the sentence, and vpon more mature deliberation had of the Author, and his Doctrine, with the consent of <hi>Philip</hi> the second, and the <hi>Duke of</hi> Alba <hi>to all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Catholiques in his behalfe sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth this Greeting.</hi>

      </note>
      <hi>Although we care not greatly for this Booke of</hi> Bertrams, <hi>whether it be extant or no, yet because it is often printed, and read of many, and the Heretiques know by a Catalogue of
<pb facs="13"/>
forbidden bookes, that he was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Priest, and deare vnto</hi> Charles the Great, <hi>and because we Comment vpon other Writers of the same age, and extenuate their errors oftentimes by a favourable construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, by the same reason wee may allow</hi> Bertram, <hi>and acknowledg him, for there is nothing worthy of reprehension in him, setting aside a little obscuritie in his stile, and his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in vsing some darke words and sentences, which with marginall notes affixed, may manifest the true sence and meaning of the Author.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Here then is his last definitiue sentence pronounced; they allow the Author, and they allow the worke, so that a right construction be ioyned to his right meaning, and that no misprision may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the parties on both sides, the Iudges in the particulars haue delivered their Observations. <hi>(Viz.)</hi>

   <p>Besides, if this Author had bin single in his opinion, as he was singular, how comes it to passe, that in these times he is so much opposed, and in former ages, hee was not confuted? To question the Writers, to obscure the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, to mutilate their Bookes, argues a distrust of the truth and goodnesse of the cause, and as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius</hi> sometimes answered the <hi>Gentiles.

   <p>Besides, how comes it to passe, that there is such difference of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions concerning this man? how is it that their kingdome is

      </note> Some hold of <hi>Paul,</hi> some of <hi>Apollos,</hi> some allow the Booke, others deny the Author: Is the Worke man and the Worke divided?

hereticall, which in the Bookes of</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard <hi>and</hi> Austen <hi>are read for holy and Orthodox.</hi> Agreeable to that saying of <hi>Maldonats,</hi>
