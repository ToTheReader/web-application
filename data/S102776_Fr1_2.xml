   <head>THE EPISTLE to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian reader: out of my desire, to the multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy profit in faith, and thy comfort by faith in Christ Iesus: I haue at length obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the republishing of this excellent Sermon of the force of faith in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and afflictions: preached, some yeares since in this citty of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by that learned and Godly man
<pb facs="27"/>
M. Doctor <hi>Fulke,</hi> who was wel seene in the holy scriptures and the fathers: and was of such dexterity in maintayning the truth against errors, that some of the aduersaries themselues did tearme him the hammer: thankes be to Christ who inabled him with such facility to break in fitters their strong arguments that they brought to fortefie their errors.</p>
   <p>But to speake of the Sermon it selfe, this I will assure thee, it hath bin found so profitable, and comfortable to the readers, that diuers of mine own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, haue written it out: and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, for whosoeuer shall read it with attention, and ponder it, shall through Gods mercy, besides other fruits of his labour, easily learne this short and sweet lesson: <hi>that wee ought to assure our selues that howsoeuer it shal please Christ to handle vs, yet he loueth vs still, and hath
<pb facs="27"/>
an eie to that which is good for vs</hi>: which how profitable and comfortable it is I leaue to thine owne consideration, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially seeing it cannot be vnknowne with how many calamities, greifes, and varieties of afflictions, it pleaseth our Heauenly Father to exercise vs, in this vale of teares, during our pilgrimage here vpon earth: it being so, is it not a great quietnesse to our hart when wee haue so profited in faith as we can take Gods wil as our soueraigne welfare &amp; perfect happinesse? for then though all our sences should tell vs that hee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, yet our faith will prompt vs to trust in him, and to call vpon him, as our most louing father, who ceasseth not to procure our welfare continualy. Such is the calmnes of minde which God giueth to the faithful, yea, euen in the midest of stormes and extremities:
<pb facs="28"/>
Is not faith then a most precious iewel which brings such happines to such as haue it? But if thou desire to hold this faith, looke wel to thine heart, striue to purge it from guilt, labour for sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sincerity: for the property of faith is to purifie the heart, Act. 15.9. The cause then, why so many as seeme to haue faith doe fal, and their vertues, which they seeme to haue, vanish to nothing, is because they wāt this sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart: which vnsoundnesse of heart doth plainly show them, if they would see, that their faith is not right.</p>
   <p>Wherefore for the helpe of true and right faith in thee, I commend this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: but why do I commend it? read it, and it wil commend it selfe; therefore I leaue thee to Christ, the author &amp; fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher of our faith: hartely beseeching him so to come vnto thee by his holy
<pb facs="28"/>
Spirit, as that thou maist bee able to come vnto him by thy Spirit, and so by his Spirit to embrace thee, as that hee may stir vp liuely faith in thee to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, and so to ioyne and vnite himselfe vnto thee, as thou maist cleaue vnto him in that most happy vnion and most holy wedlocke between thee and Christ, which is brought to passe by his spirit, and thy faith, and is so full of so sweete, holy, and heauenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</p>
