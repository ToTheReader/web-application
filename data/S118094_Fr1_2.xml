Together with two severall prayers, uttered upon severall occasions by that pious King; which God immediately heard and granted him.

The third part, in the Kings commission for levying of a regiment: his order for drawing vp of a private company; of a squadron; and of a brigade: with his manner of enquartering a private regiment; and of an army royall: vnto which is added the best manner of building and fortifying of a towne of warre. All, in fiue severall figures expressed and explained. Last of all, is the famous Battell of Leipsich, in two fayre figures also set forth: and now this second time more fully and particularly described</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which I here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
you with, is a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Argument:</hi> the
fitter for <hi>Military men</hi>
therefore: whose <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi>
and <hi>Delight,</hi> is
in the fayre practise of <hi>peaceable Armes.</hi>
This is my best hope, that it may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
accepted, for that my <hi>Theme</hi>
and my <hi>Patrones</hi> are so well suited. So
should every thing be, about a <hi>Souldier.</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
I doe it not upon any vaine thoughts
or presumption, to teach you <hi>new wayes:</hi>
a many of you, and your <hi>Leaders</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
are so curious I know, &amp; so skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
at least, in the <hi>Theory</hi> of a Souldier,
that you need not my Booke for a Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in this kinde. Tis meant for your
<hi>Recreation:</hi> to put you into <hi>Discourse</hi>
now and then: and to testifie withall,
mine owne <hi>private respects</hi> both to your
<hi>Persons,</hi> and of your <hi>Practise;</hi> thats the
purpose of it. And truely very fit it is,
that some body in the generall name,
should encourage your <hi>Exercise</hi> with
an acknowledgement, how much your
<hi>Countrey</hi> is beholding vnto you: what
though you haue not for your <hi>Countries
cause</hi> as yet <hi>resisted vnto bloud?</hi> nor in the
open field done dutie against a foe? what
though the fayre Armes that you put
on, be for <hi>ornament</hi> rather, than for <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence?</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
yet is your <hi>Military</hi> skill and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
at your <hi>Orders, Motions, Postures,</hi>
and <hi>Handling</hi> of your <hi>Armes;</hi> as much
(perchance) as many an old <hi>Leaguerers</hi>
that hath. That our <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi>
are so happy in a still and gentle peace;
as neither doe we stand in need of your
<hi>valours;</hi> nor haue you your selues any
great use of your owne <hi>courages:</hi> blessed
be the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Hosts</hi> therefore, <hi>who hath
not dealt so with any Nation.</hi> That here's
no sword drawne in our Kingdome, but
that of <hi>Iustice;</hi> and that of <hi>Honour</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
which is gladly stooped vnto with
a bended knee; we are to thanke our <hi>roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Soveraigne</hi> for, who is so studious of
our quiet. And under the favour of the
<hi>first</hi> sword; may wee all be ever happily
protected: and to the gracious stroake of
the <hi>second</hi> sword, I could wish with all
my heart, that all your <hi>shoulders</hi> that
deserve it, were submitted. <hi>Valour</hi> &amp; <hi>cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
I assure my self you would all shew;
should but your Country require your
service: and did she so, you should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the first &amp; the best men, that her
safetie must rely vpon. That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hath by this means, the more that
are enabled to defend it; is partly owing
vnto your forwardnesse: and that there
is a new <hi>Militia</hi> every yeare reered vp,
and a continuall supply of a <hi>Military</hi>
breede of <hi>Practitioners;</hi> is to be ascribed
to your example. I know you much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that miracle of Souldiers, the <hi>King</hi>
of <hi>Sweden:</hi> &amp; by that time you haue read
<hi>this;</hi> you will find more cause for it Here
in the <hi>First part,</hi> shall you find him <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious;</hi>
in the <hi>Second, Iust:</hi> &amp; in the <hi>Third,</hi>
most <hi>Sufficien</hi> for an every way accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht
<hi>General: Devotion, Iustice,</hi> &amp; a <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
excellency,</hi> make vp his <hi>Discipline.</hi>

   <closer>Farewell Gentlemen, and be pleased to
accept of this, and of the good will and
service, of the namelesse Author.</closer>
