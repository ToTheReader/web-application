   <head>To my honoured Kinsman M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. George Sandys,
on his admirable Paraphrases.</head>
   <l>VVHy com'st thou thus attended to the Presse?</l>
   <l>Thou wants no Suffrages, the Subject, lesse:</l>
   <l>At first, in confidence of thy full Worth,</l>
   <l>Single, unknowne, Thou didst adventure forth:</l>
   <l>Thy living Works since oft have past the Test,</l>
   <l>And every last (to wonder) prov'd the best.</l>
   <l>Thy Prose and Verse each other Aemulate,</l>
   <l>From Rivals free, at home their Right debate:</l>
   <l>Divide the Iudgement, whether most t'admire</l>
   <l>Roabes loosely flowing, or fine shap't Attire.</l>
   <l>Nor art thou to be blam'd, for having past</l>
   <l>Pernassus hill, and come to Sion last.</l>
   <l>The Schooles from Comments on the Stagyrite,</l>
   <l>To heavenly Speculations rais'd their Flight:</l>
   <l>The Progresse fit, though of Philosophy,</l>
   <l>'Tis justly fear'd, they tooke too deepe a Dye.</l>
   <l>God chiefely warm'd their Breasts with sacred Heat,</l>
   <l>Who were in other Knowledges compleat:</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="6"/>
Though all alike to him, but that he meant</l>
   <l>To give some honour to the Instrument.</l>
   <l>He who in other Structures merits praise,</l>
   <l>May without diffidence a Temple raise.</l>
   <l>And sure, Bezaleel-like, Heav'n did instill,</l>
   <l>For this intended Frame, that Matchlesse Skill:</l>
   <l>Till then thy restlesse Mind mov'd Circular,</l>
   <l>Like the touch't Needle, till it find the Starre.</l>
   <l>Well did'st thou from the East thy entrance make,</l>
   <l>From whence the light of Poetry first brake.</l>
   <l>The Hand unknowne, that God this Piece might own,</l>
   <l>(Like the two Tables) for his Worke alone.</l>
   <l>The Marke of his immediate Worke it beares,</l>
   <l>Even at the Spring a boundlesse Sea appeares.</l>
   <l>For what his Hands, without a Second, make,</l>
   <l>At once their Being and Perfection take.</l>
   <l>His first Day Adam a full Man beheld;</l>
   <l>And Cana's Water choicest Wine exceld.</l>
   <l>This first of Authors, first of Poets, flew</l>
   <l>So high a Pitch, as almost out of View.</l>
   <l>And this was not of Iobs rewards the lest,</l>
   <l>That his rare Story such a Pen exprest.</l>
   <l>What high expressions in such depth of Woe!</l>
   <l>How sweet his sighes and grones in Numbers flow!</l>
   <l>When God himselfe was pleased Iob to cite,</l>
   <l>Who could such Language worthy Him endite!</l>
   <l>His just Reproofes so great a Terrour beare,</l>
   <l>As if each Word a clap of Thunder were.</l>
   <l>From hence in smaller Drilles her course she keeps;</l>
   <l>And scarce discern'd, along the Vallies creeps</l>
   <l>Through Moses and the Iudges; yet we may</l>
   <l>In these discover her continued Way.</l>
   <l>But when the State into a Kingdome grew,</l>
   <l>When all did with their blessed King renew;</l>
   <l>In the sweet Singer then againe it flowes,</l>
   <l>Her bounds extends, and to a River growes.</l>
   <l>His large soul'd Son from Heaven full Light receives,</l>
   <l>For every Path and Step direction gives.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="7"/>
Discovers to our long-seduced Eyes,</l>
   <l>Her Fucus off, the Worlds deformities.</l>
   <l>And by a Purer quenches sensuall Fire,</l>
   <l>The Object chang'd, preserves the Heat entire.</l>
   <l>These two, who might with Iob dispute their Right,</l>
   <l>Rais'd Numbers to their Apogaeon height.</l>
   <l>Thence through the Prophets We her Current trace,</l>
   <l>Whose graver Works Poeticke Iems enchace:</l>
   <l>To shew how aptly both assume one Name,</l>
   <l>Both Heaven-inspir'd, compos'd of Zeale and Flame:</l>
   <l>Above the Rest, that funerall Elegy,</l>
   <l>Presents sad Iuda, to th'admiring Eye</l>
   <l>So lovely in her Sable Vaile and Teares;</l>
   <l>Scarce any Bride in all her Trim appeares:</l>
   <l>Of such a winning sweetnesse: O what Heart</l>
   <l>But must due Pitty to her Woes impart!</l>
   <l>All these, for Prose had still mistaken beene,</l>
   <l>Their Native grace our Language never seene:</l>
   <l>Had not thy speaking Picture shew'd to All</l>
   <l>The wondrous beauty of th'Originall;</l>
   <l>Had lien like Stones uncut, and Oare untri'd,</l>
   <l>Their Reall Worth the same, though scarce espi'd,</l>
   <l>But by the skilfull Linguist; To the Most</l>
   <l>In the darke Sense, and hard Expressions lost.</l>
   <l>Thy Art hath Polish't them to what they were,</l>
   <l>Vnvalued Iewels for the Breast, and Eare.</l>
   <l>Here fixe thy Pillars, what remaines there high'r,</l>
   <l>But th'unknowne Ditties of the heavenly Quire.</l>
