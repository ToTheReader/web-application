   <salute>MADAM,</salute>
   <p>

importunity that
brought these poore
Meditations to the
Presse, and it is your
name likewise that
must countenance them abroade in the
world, The Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> heard very
much of <hi>Salomons</hi> glory: yet when shee
came in person to see it, shee found it was
farre greater then the report. But heere
it is otherwise. For though haply some
that doe ouer-loue either me or my Sermon,
haue told you more of it then it deserues;
Yet when you come to see it, to reade it, I
<pb facs="3"/>
doubt, you will find lesse in it then you doe
expect: And so will others too. But the
difference is, that you can blame none
but your selfe; and they will blame none
but me. Yet notwithstanding, as it was a
great comfort vnto me at the first, that my
auditors were pleas'd to accept it then as a
discharge of that debt, that seruice which I
did owe vnto the memory of that Noble
Gentleman your louing husband: So will it
be now likewise, if this dedication may any
way expresse that reuer entiall obseruance,
which the vertues that are in you aboue
your Sexe, and the fauours that you haue
done me beyond my desert, shall euer chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
at my hands. In the meanetime what
is wanting in my endeauours, I will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
by my prayers for your Ladyship, that
God would be pleas'd to afford you a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encrease of comfort in the happy growth
of that tender plant, your little Daughter,
and to multiply his blessings vpon you, and
his graces in you both, to his glory.</p>
