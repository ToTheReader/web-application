                 <title>Pan his syrinx, or pipe : compact of seuen reedes: including in one, seuen tragical and centicall arguments, with their diuers notes not impertinent: Whereby, in effect, of all thinges is touched, in few, something of the vayue, wanton, proud, and unconstant course of the world. Neither herein, to some-what praise-worthie, is prayse vvanting. By William Warner</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Hould I bee curious in applying the forme, or rather deformitie of <hi>Pan,</hi> the Pastoral God, to the learned my skill might seeme no lesse absurde, then to the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt the sence obscure. Let it therefore suffise for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that the Nymph <hi>Syrinx,</hi> in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> in flying <hi>Pan</hi> his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pursute, was by intercessions (as poetically it is fabled) transformed into an heape of Reedes, which being stirred with a gentle blast, and <hi>Pan</hi> hearing them to yeelde a softe mellodious sound, with seauen of the same Reedes, framed to himselfe the Pipe after her name called <hi>Syrinx:</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to which number, I, a Puple of such a Tutor, haue also sorted out this my Musick. Musick I call it, though <hi>Midas,</hi> not for his eares, doth the secōd time dare to tearm it melodious: neither, I thinke anye, except perhaps <hi>Satirs,</hi> will vouchsafe to heare it: for only <hi>Mercurie</hi> his Pipe must bring <hi>Argus</hi> a-sleepe, and <hi>Ganymedes</hi> wring the grapes, if <hi>Iupiter</hi> taste the Nectar: yea, so forcible is a first Conquest to deterre from a second Encounter, that now <hi>Pan,</hi> and his Puples hold themselues very well content, so they can their Plain-song, that <hi>Apollo</hi> can descant.</p>
   <p>And yet, let his coy Prophetise presage harde euentes in her Cell, let the Athenian <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, or Man-hater bite on the Stage, or the <hi>Sinopien</hi> Cynic barke with the Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet, in <hi>Pan his Syrinx,</hi> wil I pype, at the least to my self.</p>
   <p>Vnto whose rude Hermonie if, for varietie, any <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>molus</hi> shall listen, then let such an one imagine, that piping of loue some <hi>Polephemus</hi> is a wooer: If handling Argument some <hi>Coridon</hi> an Interlocutor: or howsoeuer it bee, some <hi>Fanus,</hi> or the Author an Actor: as not daring to be so ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
<pb facs="91"/>
here, as was one vain-glorious els-where, that in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Texte, as it were by the Touch, to be thought a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Clearke to an vnlearned Auditorie, hauing rapped out a round deale of Welsh, such, qd. he▪ are the very wordes in Hebrue.</p>
   <p>But so farre off am I so to resemble, so to desemble, that might I vtter my scarse indifferent, for exquisite, yet would I not offer the same for excellent: onely to keepe a-loose from Laborinthes, in which <hi>Minotaur</hi> is redier with a Club, then <hi>Ariadne</hi> with a Clue, sufficeth to me, might also (curteous Reader) such my considerate feare satisfie you. But what? to father my booke on <hi>Pan,</hi> whose bad nature affordeth not so good nurture, as to feare an offence, when all, in deede, is nothing more then a fault, and thus submissiuely, to craue pardon for mine owne taken paines, and that, perhaps, of such who will soonest mis-like, what they cannot make like, were as if an Asse shoulde bringe forth a Gennet, <hi>Pan</hi> a childe altogether vnlike the father, and for my selfe in <hi>decorum</hi> to degenerate: for <hi>Pan</hi> being clownish, not courtish, should not sing cunningly, if he sing kindly: and why? only to be fine, were in him a fault: but in vaine is it, I know, that I feare suche offence.</p>
   <p>But whether wander I? suffiseth it not, that willinglye I haue straitned my selfe to time, but that I also wilfullye so tie my selfe to one rude Master, that I degresse not so much as in good maners? not so, but if (curtious Reader) not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into Account my worthinesse, whiche claimeth lesse then you should graunte, you accepte of my willingnesse, which is more thē you can gesse, he that expecteth only such curtesie, &amp; resteth most desirous to deserue it, is also therefore and still shall be, yours as hee may,</p>
