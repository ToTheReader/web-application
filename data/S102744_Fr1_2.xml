   <head>THE PRINTER TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>CHristian Reader, there came to my hands, by the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, this Argument of <hi>M. Fullers,</hi> accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with some few lines, wherin, as it should seeme, it was sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed to a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of good worth and worship on this side the Seaes. Having read it over, &amp; perceiving it to be of very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie use for my <hi>Countrimen</hi> (whose good I desire from my heart, and whose welfare I take my selfe bound to procure, as I may, though now I be in a part farre remote from them) I haue adventured to publish it to the view of the world: the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause therein both the uniust usurpation of the <hi>Prelates</hi> over his Maiesties Subiects is notably discovered, and the lawes and liberties of the land (<hi>the high Inheritance of the subjects</hi>) are worthily stood for and maintained, maugre the malice of the Prelates; who, as I heare studie, and striue, even with might and maine, to beare downe all before them, to the ruine of that <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time-flourishing Church and Common-wealth.</hi> How the publishing of it wilbe liked I cannot tell; how ever, I send it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to thy view even as it came to my handes: which I doe (I professe in the presence of that great God) altogither without the privitie either of the <hi>Gentleman</hi> himselfe (whose <hi>bandes</hi> I would be loth any maner of way to increase) or of the <hi>silenced Ministers,</hi> who haue felt the weight of these <hi>lawles</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings too too long in the handes of the <hi>Prelates.</hi> Reade it, and consider well of it: and if thou reape any benefite by it, giue all the glorie to God alone; who can, if it seeme so good unto him, by weake meanes bring great matters to passe. Farewell.</p>
