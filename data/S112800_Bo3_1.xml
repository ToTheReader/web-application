      </gap>utt: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>t may bee that whiles I go vp to see the sicke person, they will open it. <hi>Burgus.</hi> Your worship may go in Gods name, I will tarrye here for you, and seeing the great hall is not opened, I will sitt downe vppon the benche, and will see what doeth passe vntill you come.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Doctour.</hi> Master <hi>Burgus,</hi> I praye you pardon mee, if I haue tarryed long: for the qualitie of the cause hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed mee to tarry. <hi>Burgus.</hi> Rather I woulde haue beene glad that you had tarryed longer, because I would haue seene more. <hi>Doctour.</hi> What haue you seene whiles I was absent? <hi>Burgus.</hi> The great hall being shutt, and the parde full of people, and I looking vppon them earnestly, it seemeth to mee that they are people of estimation, but to my iudgement full of cares: for in them I haue seene so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable and diuerse likenesses of countenance, that I maruel at it. Some of them talking to them selues: others being alone with their heads hanging downe, and with great imagination: Others talking by two and two together: Others in clusters treating of the sales of their merchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize: Maryners and souldiours carrying for their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: Others carrying away their porcions of siluer, which they had taken out, running with it, as though they had stolen it: Others there were with the Notaries about their suites: Others in the office of the treasourer amongest the Registers. There was also a greate noyse of much people, deliuering and receiuing parcels of siluer, but they were in a great strife therevppon. The Iudges were in counsell, and many people tarrying for them in such sort, that I was in greate admiration: I being there onely to beholde, and all the rest to do their businesse. And it was to mee as one that did beholde them without greefe, as a comedye, with many Pageants.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="142" facs="119"/>And that which did make mee maruell more, was to see that none were merrye, nor content: rather they seemed to haue great care and troubles.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Doctour.</hi> Master <hi>Burgus,</hi> I am glad you haue seene what doeth passe in that house, with so much attention: for all that which you haue seene, that Gold and siluer is cause thereof, which with so great good will you came to see, and this is it which is the cause of their troubles, and cares, and not onely it bringeth such as you sawe there amazed and astonied, but many others, for they are at this daye the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of all these things. Some they put downe, others they rayse vp, whereby they haue rule, and dominion in the worlde. These mortall men haue put so much felicitie in them, that they haue and do procure them, by the losse of their lyues, and shedding of their bloud, and after they haue them, they conserue them with much labour, and with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care keepe them, and with much misery they spend them, and with great euill fortune they lose them. These are they that take away quietnesse and rest. They take awaye sleape, and many passe the day to keepe them, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their afflictions and cares. In the night also they rest with feare, and care: there are in them so many snares and hazardes, as wee see euery day.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Burgus.</hi> For all this I woulde see the Golde, the siluer, and the Emeraldes. <hi>Doctour.</hi> What? master <hi>Burgus,</hi> haue you neuer seene Golde, siluer, and Emeraldes? <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</hi> Yea, I haue seene them, but in little quantitie. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour.</hi> What do you thinke is there in seeing of little, or much, but to see much earth, or little earth, and moste of all without the profite of man, of as many as nature hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? And if you haue so great desire to see precious metals: I will carrye you to a place where you shall see one metall much more of price, &amp; of greater estimation, then the golde &amp; siluer y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> you were so desirous to see, &amp; better, &amp; of more profit

See you my maisters howe many and howe variable opinions there are among wise men.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>A common opinion.</hi>
      </note>There is another opinion, which is that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and which for the most certayne we doe followe, which <hi>Auicen</hi> wrote in his bookes of <hi>Metheurous,</hi>

      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Geber.</hi>
      </note> and all the rest that haue treated of these matters, euen vnto our tyme,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Raymond.</hi>
      </note> doe say, that the true matter of all metals is ingendred of brimstone,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Arnold.</hi>
      </note> and quicksiluer, the brimstone as the father, and the quicksiluer as the mother: and the heat of the brimstone, doeth incorporate, and congele with the quicksiluer, in such sorte that of these twoo thinges are made the metals which are in the bowelles of earth: and of the variation of these twoo beginninges, they come to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the one from the other, and of the purenesse of these twoo beginnings, some doe come to be more excellent then other: and for this the golde is more profitable &amp; more fayre then all other metalles, for bycause it is formed of his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, cleane, and pure, which was the cause and originall of his perfection.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="144" facs="120"/>And there were Philosophers which said that al metals should haue bin gold, if it had not bin for the imperfection of the sulphur, and the quicksiluer. And al other metals besides the golde, they call imperfect mineralles, bycause they had not their purenesse, and concoction, that the gold had, with that maruellous friendshippe, which nature gaue vnto it. And of this it commeth, that the Alcumistes for to make golde, doe pretende to make cleane and purifie these twoo beginninges of the which all the metalles are made, and beeing put into their perfection the golde is made by of them, which is the metall most pure and cleane, of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Such as doe wryte against them, making impossible their woorkes and effectes, doe say, that in the bowels of the earth, the metals are not ingendred, nor made of brimstone, and quicksiluer, as they thinke and holde it for certayne, so they cannot make of them by arte, for if it were so, that of brimstone and quicksiluer they were ingendred, there would be some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

And if it were so as they say that the metalles doe breede, and are newly ingendred of these twoo beginnings, it must bee of force, that one metall were alreadie made, and the other shoulde goe a making, for that all coulde not bee made alyke: but rather they take out all metalles ready made, and perfectioned, and in the meltinges

      </note> as also a greate parte of the steele, is in armour, as wel defensiue, as offensiue, so that there is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

      </gap> at this day in the world where they are not vsed, and exercised, and in many Countries they are made. Chiefly there is spent much yron in making of handgunnes, the vse whereof is so much in the warres, and warlyke exercises, that the people of greatest fame and actiuitie, are they which shoote in them: as a thing very principal, and most necessary: but surely it was an inuention of the Deuill, for to carrie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to hell. And to speake of all kinde of weapons which are made of yron and steele, it wil aske a longer tyme, then we haue. The yron doeth profite for the tilling of the earth, and labouring of the fieldes, and for the benefites of all the woorkes in the Countrie, to sowe, and doe other woorkes, a thing so necessarie and profitable for all people, seeing that the woorkes of the fieldes doeth susteine all manner of estates, in the worlde. The yron serueth to make buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges, so many sortes, and diuers, that therewith they builde Cities, Townes, Uillages, Forts, Churches, and publike places, the which without yron and steele coulde not be made, as also in the sciences of any manner of handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts man, in the which there are so many necessary instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for to vse, and exercise, that therby you may see howe necessary the yron and steele is, seeing that without thē they cannot be made, nor any thing can bee wrought. And to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse euery office, and science by it selfe, that by meanes of these twoo metalles are made and exercised, it will neuer bee made an ende of. One thing I wil speake with trueth, that there is nothing in the worlde, bee it by it selfe alone or with the helpe of another thing, that hath not need of yron and steele.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="147" facs="122"/>By meanes of these two metals, kinges &amp; princes do get kingdomes, and cities, &amp; by meanes of them they do make subiect their enimies, and do defende their goods and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. And as <hi>Liuio</hi> sayth, that with Iron the countrie is defended, and not with golde, and with it kings are made strong and mightie, and are esteemed and had in great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. By Iron iustice is kept and maintayned, and by the meanes of it, euill doers are chastened, and the good conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

      </gap> in all places they haue all their assurance, and defence: and so much may be sayde of that which it can doe, and the great aucthority that it hath, and the meane that it is for al things, that my tongue is not able to speake them, nor my memory to expresse them. One thing I will say, that the auncie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>t Romaines had by it such estimation, that onely the noble people onely might weare a ring, &amp; the same to be of Iron.</p>
   <p>Of two needles which are made of steele I wil speake, as of the greatest thinges that may be thought:<note place="margin">
         <hi>The sowing needle.</hi>
      </note> the one is the Needle with the which they do sowe: howe necessary it is in the world, in cities, in townes, in common wealthes, in particular houses, in the feeld, in the Sea, &amp; in al places, yea and to anye one particular man alone? And let so manye Artes speake thereof, that by meanes of the Needle are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and don, and without it, they should not be vsed nor don: and being so many, it will be a thing incomprehensible to speake of them. Let euery man consider thereof, seeing that from the king vnto the sheepeheard, and from the bishop to the sexton, they cannot passe without the vse of it. And if we looke what seruice it doeth to women in their vses and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, in their sowings and workes wrought vpon linen cloth and silke, things so politike, and delicate, that with the Needle they do worke: Imitating also, in things which they worke, like vnto the worke of nature, making b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>asts, birds,
<pb facs="123"/>
plants, leaues, and flowers, which do seeme with the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that they giue of silke in coulours, as if it were the self same that is growing in the feelde. I sawe the picture of the kings maiestie made with a needle so naturally, as if an excellent painter had paynted it. Of all this the needle is the instrument: a thing so small that it is hid among the fingers. The <hi>Indians</hi> were in great admiration thereof at the beginning, when they were first discouered, when they sawe Spanyards sowe with a Needle, for it seemed to them a thing of wonder, and they gaue for a Needle much golde, and they were ask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>d wherefore they would haue them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were naked: they aunswered, for the workes that the Spanyardes did with them, they would haue them in their power for a thing of admiration. And with them they tooke out the thornes that can into their feete, better then with any other thing.</p>
   <p>The other Needle is that which serueth for Nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to sayle withall in the Sea,<note place="margin">

When they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, the nauigation was very little, and short: they fayled onely casting about by the bankes of the Sea coastes: and nowe by the meanes of it, they do ingulfe them selues, and do sayle in such sort, that the shippe called the Uictorie say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the rounde worlde ouer, as the Sunne goeth euerye day, that it is sayde, shee sayled at one time twelue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande leagues. And that which is more to be maruelled at, that the shippe being in a gulffe of 800. or 1000. leagues, by meanes of the Needle they came to the porte which they pretēded to go vnto, without any other knowledge, more thē by the meanes of the Needle, or as we cal it the compasse,

      </note>We haue sayde with the opinion of <hi>Auicen,</hi> and the rest of the authors, that al metals are made of sulfur and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluer, the sulfur as the father, and the quicksiluer as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one as the maker, and the other as the matter, and being so, the matter whereof the yron is made, is of these twoo things, and of these twoo beginninges, of the most hot sulfur, and of the most colde quicksiluer. The which nature hath placed in the inner partes of the earth, and made them metals, and where there was these twoo beginninges, most pure, it was made golde, and lykewyse of that which was grosse and vnpure, according to the degree and qualitie of euery one, there was ingendred and made the metal, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably to the purenesse, or grosnesse that it had: and where these metals are more vnpure, more grosse, and more darke, the yron did ingender. The which being of beginnings not pure nor cleane, but grosse and filthy, became to be a metall, more harde then al other metals, so that by meanes of it strength, there might bee some who might make it easie and subiect to bee wrought, as also it might bee a necessary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument that thereof men might profite themselues. And whereas the yron is made and ingendred of these twoo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, which are, sulfur and quicksiluer, the one hot, and the other colde: so it hath the complection, and temperature, and doeth participate of both qualities: therfore it is so dry, and for this cause hard and strong. By meanes of the sulfur it heateth, it consumeth, it dryeth, it openeth, it comforteth, it prouoketh appetite, and maketh the meruellous woorkes that we will speake of heereafter, and al is done by meanes of the heate which it hath. And by meanes of the quicksil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, being grosse and vnpure, and being formed with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vertue, wherewith it is mingled, it cooleth, it retayneth, it thickeneth, it congeleth, it withdraweth, and detayneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maner of fluxe, or runninges by binding, it taketh away stooles, it cooleth and tempereth the heate, and it doeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="153" facs="126"/>
other effects, which are all done by meanes of the coldnes that it hath, in such sorte y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> as by the aforesaide is seene, the effects are contrarie which the yron doth: the cause wherof is by reason it is compounded of things that haue contrary qualities, which are rooted in it, and do worke conformably to the subiect where they doe worke. For where it is need to open, it openeth; and where it is neede to shut, it shutteth. Trueth it is, that besides these qualities, the yron hath an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther most principal, which is, that it is most dry, more then all other metals, by meanes whereof it doeth many of these effectes and workes, which wee haue spoken of, and also it hath vertue to heate, to coole, and to dry vp. And of this it commeth, that some doe say it is hot, bycause they see that it maketh workes of heate, and others saie that it is colde, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they see that it doeth workes to make colde, the reason whereof is, that it is compounded of twoo contrarie begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges, the one hot, and the other colde, and thereby it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that they may very wel defend themselues, who sayde that yron is colde, and worketh cold effectes: And lykewyse they that sayde, it was hot, and doth hot effects. Whereby it doth appeare that which the one and the other haue spokē and treated therof, to be true. <hi>B.</hi> Maister Doctor hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wel ended the controuersie, and contrariety that is in this matter discretly and wisely, wherby wee are satisfied: but there remayneth a doubt, if the quicksiluer bee colde, as he sayeth that some doe say that it is, and to prooue it, they say that it sheweth by his strength, colour, and taste, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes which it doeth, to make colde, seeing that such as doe vse of it, it maketh impotent, they suffer weakenesse, and trembling of sinewes, and are vtterly voyde of the vse of their members, and many dye all togither of a disease cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apoplexie, and all this doeth come of cold causes. They which say that the quicksiluer is hot, doe prooue it with his effectes, for anoynting the iointes, and other partes, of the body therwith, it maketh great workes, and effects of heat,
<pb facs="127"/>
it inflameth their mouth, and throte, their gummes, &amp; rooffe of their mouth, with great heat, and burning: it prouoketh sweat most vehement: we see that therof is made that most strong thing like to fire, that is called <hi>Sublimatum,</hi> which is most strong fire,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Sublimatum.</hi>
      </note> and burneth wheresoeuer it bee put, and all that it taketh, it consumeth, and fiereth. Of it is made that corsiue poyson, called pouder <hi>Precipitatos,</hi> in such sorte that the cause is doubtful, seeing it hath and doeth the workes so contrary to make colde, and to make hot. <hi>D.</hi> The same doubt we haue of it, as of the yron, and what is that which Maister <hi>Burgus</hi> wil now haue? <hi>B.</hi> Now that you brought vs out of the first doubte, we pray you that you wil bring vs out of the second. <hi>D.</hi> It semeth vnto me that Maister <hi>Burgus</hi> doth take the matter so earnestly that I must needs do it, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I meane to content him, in al things, &amp; it shal bee done very quickly: the euening commeth vpon vs. The quicksil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is a metal cōpounded of diuers parts, the watery parts that it hath, are mingled with earthy things, which is tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> that giueth it substance and strength. It hath also min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with it fulfery parts, which seemeth to be very bright: for in chafing the quicksiluer betweene the hands, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in them the perfit smel of brimstone, &amp; so the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluer i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>mpounded of diuers things. The watery &amp; earthy parts giueth it vertue to make colde: by meanes whereof is done the vertue which we haue spoken of, and by meanes of the sulfure which hath ayery parts, it heateth, penetrateth, openeth and maketh thin, and by them it prouoketh sweat, it causeth to expel by the mouth, and by stooles the humour that doeth abounde, by hearing and doing other effectes of heate. And therfore it is not to be maruelled that the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluer doth contrary effects, seing it hath diuers operations, which is the selfesame that we haue spoken of the yron, and so the doubt remaineth discouered which was propoūded by M. <hi>Burgus. D.</hi> I remaine sufficiently satisfied of that which
<pb n="154" facs="127"/>
is saide, but not so satisfied that there doeth not remaine for me to aske of M. Doctor another thing, which is of more weight then all that is saide: which is, to knowe the vertues that the yron and steele haue in the vse of medicine: for their works, and effects, as I haue hard it reported, are many.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>D.</hi> It wilbe a trouble for me to recken, and tel of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ancient authors as also of late written authors, which doe treate of the vertues of yron, and of the steele, by reason they are many, and doe treat of great things. And seing that it shalbe declared, let vs loose no tyme, wherby we may the rather make an ende. By that which is sayde, you haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood howe the yron, and steele, are one kinde of metall, sauing that the steele is more cleane yron, and more fine, &amp; for this cause it is hard and strong. They of old tyme knewe not the steele, but onely treated of the yron, and to it they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the medicinal vertues that wee will speake of, and vnder our talke of yron, we wil comprise the steele, seeing that it differeth not from it, in more then in being purer, &amp; cleaner from superfluities: and for this cause the steele doth make cold, and dryeth more then the yron. For where it is needful to heate and to open, the yron hath more force, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not cleane of the sulpherie partes, for there is lost much thereof, when the steele is made in the forme as it is aboue sayde.</p>

      </note> whereby wee may the better treate of the vertue of yron, that wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how it ought to be prepared. For if it be not prepared, neither can it be administred, nor yet wil it worke it effe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Al the which wee haue treated of in briefe, whereby it may be a beginning of our pretence that shall follow, which is to shew the manner how to make tolde with snow, and because that which shall be made colde is the water, and vnder is also to be vnderstood the wine, &amp; al the rest that shalbe made cold, we will speake of that which shall be treated, vnder the water.</p>

   <p>There is an other water which is not so colde as is conuenient for vs, as wel for our conseruation &amp; health, as for our satisfaction: and by reason it is not so colde as it ought to be, it is the cause of the hurts it doth, that before we haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. Some waters are not so colde as they ought to bee by nature, by reason they are in whot countries: Now our intent is to treate of them how they ought to be made colde, because with their heate they hurte vs, and beyng made cold as much as neede requireth, they doe satisfy vs so that wee may drinke

them and vse them without any hurt that they can doe vs: &amp; so we wil shew of al the meanes that we may haue to make cold, which are vsed at this day in all the worlde, and of them wee will choose the best, and most sure, setting downe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience that is in euery one.</p>
   <p>There are foure maner of waies to make colde, which at this day are vsed in all the worlde:<note place="margin">

      </note> that is to say, with the aire, in the well, with salt Peter, and with snow: euery one of these is vsed at this day.</p>

      </note>The first is, to make colde with the ayre, although it bee a common thing, and vsed in all places, yet it hath beene and is most vsed of the Egyptians, by reason they haue neither wels, nor snowe, and that of the salt Peter they neuer knewe. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> maketh a large relation of the manner howe to make cold with the aire, and saith thus: they of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and Egypt for to make their water colde,<note place="margin">

      </note> that they may drinke it in time of whot wether, doe warme it first, or doe seeth it, &amp; then they put it into earthen vessels, and set it in the colde aire, or deaw in the night in windowes, or in the gutters of houses, and there they set it all the night, and before the Sunne riseth, they take it away, and washe the saide earthen vesselles in the outside with colde water, and then they roule them with the leaues of a Uine tree, and of lettice, and other fresh herbes and they put them in the grounde in the most colde part of the house, that there the cold may conserue it. This maner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king colde is vsed at this day in all the worlde, although not with so much curiositie, by reason they seeth not the water and they content themselues with putting it in the cold ayre, and in the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>,
<pb n="165" facs="136"/>
and this the Sheepheardes and other people of the fielde doe.</p>
   <p>This manner to make colde with the ayre hath many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The hurte to to coole in the ayre.</hi>
      </note> because the ayre is a subtil element subiect to any maner of alteration and corruption: and therefore it may be infected with some euill qualitie, easily: &amp; being infected, it may infect the water that so is made colde, infusing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into his malice. The which <hi>Auicen</hi> sheweth very wel in the second of the first saying, The ayre is an euill thing, by reason it is mingled with euill thinges, as Uapors, and smelles,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Auicen.</hi>
      </note> and euill smoakes, chiefly that which is put in betweene two walles, and especially that which passeth by places where are rotten Plantes, and naughty Trees, and where dead bodies are, for it altereth at euery one of these thinges, and of them receiueth an euill quality. And for this cause the auncient Phisitions did forbid that in time of the plague the water shoulde not be put into the ayre to bee made colde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the corrupt ayres should not infect it. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise an other inconuenience, that you cannot euery night set the water too bee made colde in the Ayre, for some nights and the moste parte of them, in the Summer time are so whot, that not onely the ayre doeth not make colde, but the water that is set in the ayre, is whotter then it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and if it bee made any whit colde, it dureth no longer then the Morning, when it is not needefull, and likewise in the time betweene Winter and Sommer, or in the Winter when the ayre woulde make colde, then the rayne, the tempestes and cloudes and other alterations will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ayre to doe it. All these thinges experience doeth shewe at this day.</p>
   <p>There is an other manner of way how to make cold with the ayre, which is the most wholesome, and more without hurt than any of all the other: wherein there is no occasion of any euill qualitie. And there are many people of estimation which doe vse this way to make colde that, which they should
<pb facs="137"/>
drinke, the which they put into vessels of earth, or metall, and do alwayes make winde and ayre to the vessels with a wet lynnen cloth. And it must be so, that it be in the ayre continually without ceasing, as long as you are at meate. And in this sorte it will be made colde to purpose, and the hote ayre that is ioyned to the vessell is taken awaye, and in place of it commeth freshe and colde ayre, euen as it doeth when there is gathered winde to the face, and taking away the hote ayre that is ioyned to it, and with freshe ayre it maketh it colde and refresheth.</p>
   <p>The other waye to make colde, is in a well, wherein they do put the vessels with water or wine,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The seconde manner howe to make colde which is in wels and the hurt that commeth thereof.</hi>
      </note> and there they remayne the moste parte of the daye. This kynde of making colde hath also many inconueniences, as well of the parte of the water, wherewith it is made colde, as of the parte of the place where it is put, cheefely in the welles of the cities and townes, that for the moste parte are fowle and full of filthinesse. The water of these welles is an earthly water, grosse and harde, because it is continually standing in one place, and shut within the bowels of the earth. And as it is a standing water, it must of force he putrified, for that the beames of the Sunne do not pearce it, nor yet the ayre doeth visite it, and therefore continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is full of euill vapours, whereof they do easily rott, and they are foule waters full of durte and claye, and of other mischiefes of an euill qualitie.</p>
   <p>And seeing the water or wine is so put a long tyme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this foule standing water, what can come of it, but that it participateth of the euill qualitie that it hath? And so <hi>Galen</hi> sayeth,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Galen.</hi>
      </note> that the vessell which must be put into the well, ought to bee full: for if it lacke of his fulnesse, then the water of the well doeth penetrate it, or the vapour of it goeth into that which is emptie: and therefore it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient

      </note> And hee sayeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye, when wee shall make colde in the ayre: for then the vessell shall not bee put full, but some parte thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne emptie: for the colde ayre in the night season ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into that which is emptie, doeth make the water more colde.<note place="margin">

   <p>Ordinarily they are vessels of Copper, or of the lease of <hi>Milan,</hi> which are put in welles for to make colde. The Copper, if it bee not well tinned within, doeth suffer too enter into that which is to be made colde an, euil qualitie: for with the moysture of the well, there is growen in it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, a certeine greenesse that is seene vppon it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it hath stoode a fewe dayes, which is a thing verye euill and hurtfull.</p>

Necessity did teach thē this remedie, although it is not good, for the great inconueniences which it hath. It doth coole, as some say, the colde running vnto the inner partes of that which it doeth make colde, for the excessiue heate which the saltpeter hath, the which is done with the strong force of the saltpeter with the water, which the saltpeter beeing entered into the inner partes maketh to bee colde, comming from the heate of the saltpeter working vpon the strong force thereof.
