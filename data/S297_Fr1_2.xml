<pb facs="3"/>
skirt, <hi>Acceptance</hi> with <hi>Patronage:</hi> Ʋndertaken at first by your <hi>MAIESTIES</hi> commandement, for the repulsing of the lewde slaunders of a namelesse Papist, and to redeeme the credit of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed Bishop; but continued to the confirmation of <hi>Your MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IESTIES</hi> leige people, in their <hi>Reiligion</hi> to <hi>GOD,</hi> and their <hi>Obedience</hi> to your <hi>MAIESTIE,</hi> with all subiection. <hi>In qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus duobus, vniuersa Lex pendet, &amp; Prophetae,</hi> (to speake it in his words, whose doctrine it was most, yea whose onely errand it was, as <hi>Hegesippus</hi> testifies) I meane, <hi>in seeking the face of GOD,</hi> and his <hi>IACOB,</hi> as some euen <hi>Papists</hi> haue noted vpon that <hi>Psalme,</hi> that they are distinguished there not without cause, and the one is consequent, or to be consequent, to the other.</p>
   <p>But not so the <hi>Cardinall</hi> (the more too blame he) a maine stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in these Controuersies (after the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Pioners)</hi> that encomber the world; and I know not by what lucke, though <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uini generis animal,</hi> yet <hi>Your MAIESTIES</hi> audacious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current in the cause. Who if he were younger, perhaps hee might be borne with, either fancying his superstitions, or fostering his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: As the <hi>Stoicke Philosopher</hi> was wont to say, that a young man at Sea, if hee abandon the Shippe to walke ashoare a while, and either digge some roote, or gather some shell which the Sea casts forth, there is no danger in it; but in an olde man it is dangerous, whome death, and sickenesse, and sundry casualties may preuent, from euer recouering ship againe. Yet he in his deuoutest meditations of all other, his booke last set forth <hi>de Aeterna Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitate,</hi> will not excuse Kings from beeing murthered <hi>de iure,</hi> (not onely <hi>de facto)</hi> onely hee passes it ouer as a <hi>casus omissus,</hi> happily because anouched in his other Volumes more perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</p>
   <p>Of another minde was his <hi>Vnckle,</hi> of whome hee brags in one place, contesting with your <hi>MAIESTIE,</hi> (though S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> note, that S. <hi>Pauls</hi> sisters sonne, of whome there is mention in the Acts, was neuer a whit the blesseder for his Ʋnckles vertue, and as it may seeme neuer any good came of him; saue onely that he reuealed the Iewes conspiracie against <hi>Paul,</hi> which this man would rather defend the concealing of) but <hi>Marcellus secundus,</hi>

      </gap>im) <hi>In animo habuerat omnem militiam à se prorsus abigere, ipsos etiam corporis custodes exauctorare</hi> (whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> lately vrged this Pope to draw the sword, if fame say true; his Vnckle not admitting of necessarie Defence, if it were forcible;) <hi>cum illud saepe repeteret, multos principes viros, non tam armis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensos, quàm signo Crucis, &amp;c.</hi> (himselfe hauing been lately Cardinall <hi>Sanctae Crucis.)</hi> And in particular of the Pope, <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificem maximum neutiquam indigere, aut scutis, aut gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dijs</hi> (indeede <hi>Athanasius</hi> remooues all iron from the Apostles, and <hi>S. Austen</hi> will not haue them strike, though they may carrie weapons, <hi>ferre ferrum,</hi> but not <hi>ferire) satius{que} esse ipsum si res ferat occîdi, quàm tam indecorum exemplum praeberi Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae,</hi> namely as for the Pope either to handle a sword, or giue allowance to others, at his direction, so to doe.</p>
   <p>So as no maruell, if the same man, considering the practises of such as were Popes in his time, clapt his hand once vpon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, protesting in great earnestnes, that <hi>it seemed impossible for a Pope</hi> (as things then went) <hi>to be saued.</hi> And another saies, it was the voice of almost all men in those daies, <hi>that a Pope could not be saued,</hi> when this <hi>Marcellus</hi> came to it. I know not what cōtentment the <hi>Cardinall</hi> may take in his new skarlet-additions, which they would make vs beleeue he accepted of so lothly; but for my part, I should thinke one day of his Vnckles, (as <hi>Tullie</hi> saies of <hi>Antonie,</hi> compared with his grandfather) were more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, then a whole age of the <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> lending his pen and bending his wit to the defence of such <hi>trumperies,</hi> and, which is worse, of such <hi>treacheries,</hi> as are now in vre with them; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slike whereof, and onely intended Reformation, cost his Ʋnckle his life, and that in very short space, after he came to the Popedome.</p>
   <p>Of whome, because I haue said so much, almost before I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, I will not <gap reason="foreign">

      </gap>, trouble <hi>Your Royall</hi> eare (as that Councell speakes, which forbids <hi>Clerks</hi> to disturbe <hi>Kings,</hi> not onely in their states, or liues, (as now the fashion is,) but so much as in their leisures:) onely this it may please <hi>Your MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IESTIE</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
giue me leaue to adde, That the Pope whome I speake of (as <hi>Onu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>us</hi> testifies) <hi>OMNEM ECCLESIASTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAM IVRISDICTIONEM, viris profanis, &amp; nullis sacris initiatis, demandare cogitaverat;</hi> had a purpose to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate all Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction to meere Lay-men: he calls them <hi>profane;</hi> but the more vehemently he expresses it, the more it makes for vs, and against themselues: the Papists all so stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at the thing this day, and the <hi>Adioynder</hi> by name (with whome therefore I haue a dealing about this point somewhat at large) in <hi>Your MAIESTIES</hi> high <hi>Prerogatiue,</hi> and iustest <hi>Title;</hi> allowing <hi>You,</hi> by no meanes, <hi>Ecclesiasticall Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> (if happily <hi>You</hi> should euer fulfil their suspicion of owning it:) Though <hi>KINGS</hi> were so farre from beeing counted <hi>profane,</hi> by the auncient <hi>Synods</hi> of <hi>CHRISTS</hi> Church, that their <hi>letters</hi> were <hi>holy</hi> to them, their <hi>syllables holy,</hi> their <hi>palace holy,</hi> their very <hi>bed-chamber holy,</hi> and all that was about them, or belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> in the style of those godly times, and Fathers.</p>
   <p>Where I cannot but obserue, the prouidence of <hi>GOD,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites humane actions, and how euen a course it keepes with our courses. For as the intents were good, which <hi>Marcellus</hi> fostered, but no effects followed, nay rather his Nephew drawes now backe most of all, and mainly opposes his Vnckles determinations: So we read, that the Cardinalls in fauour of his person (because repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted honest, and well be loued amongst them) decreed to haue his charges of the direption of his house and houshold stuffe, (a graue custome no doubt, and worthie of <hi>Christs Vicar,</hi> to haue all ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, and ransackt, that the people can but lay hands of, when he is chosen Pope) to be repaid him of the publique; but it was neuer done (saith the <hi>Historian)</hi> till this day.</p>
   <p>But to leaue the <hi>Vnckle</hi> (sith our question is not whether the Popes may keepe guards about their persons, but whether <hi>Kings</hi> crownes, or (if that be more deare) their liues are to be wholly at the Popes disposing) and to returne to the <hi>Nephew;</hi> He is peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, as I said, in his most mortified Treatise, and the fore-runner of his ende (as he would haue it thought at least) that <hi>Kings</hi> are
<pb facs="4"/>
subiect to murther, at best: First, <hi>de facto;</hi> though the Scripture as it flatters not, nor no where diuerts vs from the consideration of our mortality, so it leades vs to speake of <hi>KINGS</hi> and Princes in another straine; as if they that ought not to be violated by any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall hand, could not die at all, or at least not die, till God himselfe assoild them of the bands of this bodie. <hi>How was he slaine</hi> (saies <hi>Dauid</hi> of <hi>Saul) as if he had not beene annointed with oyle?</hi> And, <hi>O King, liue for euer,</hi> saies the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> not any courtly flatterer. The <hi>Kings soule is bound vp with God in the bundle of life,</hi> as it were <hi>Gero in sinu, nec discingor;</hi> fast bound, and not to shedde out. The period of their gouernment, is <hi>cum Sole &amp; Luna,</hi> as <hi>long as the Sunne and Moone endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</hi> And though <hi>they die like men,</hi> (that is, <hi>quatenus homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, non quatenus Reges)</hi> yet we are to remember, that <hi>they fall like one of the PRINCIPES,</hi> that is, one of the <hi>Angels</hi> (saies the <hi>Cardinall</hi> himselfe, among others, vpon that <hi>Psalme)</hi> who we know are not iudged, till <hi>GOD</hi> iudges them: though, no doubt but that aggrauates their iudgement so much the forer.</p>
   <p>And whereas the Scripture so often, entitles the constitution of <hi>Kings</hi> to <hi>GOD,</hi> it may be it is to shew, that their authoritie is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abrogable; as the <hi>Platoniques</hi> hold opinion, that whatsoeuer is mortall, was produced by some mediation of the vile creature, as man of the dust, most things of the <hi>materia prima, &amp;c.</hi> but that which immediatly proceedes of God himselfe, as the soules of men, and the Angells, and the heauens, they are immortall. So of Princes.</p>
   <p>Yet the <hi>Cardinall</hi> not content with a death <hi>de facto, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes</hi> that they may be slaine <hi>de iure</hi> too, though he <hi>affirme</hi> vpon the other onely, which belike was enough to serue his turne in that place. No more <hi>Ceruinus</hi> now, nor of the mothers breed (which was the better of the two) but <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>—as <hi>Constantine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spake <hi>Arius</hi> in the Nicene Councell, somewhat merrily; for the one hath <hi>Mars,</hi> the other <hi>warre,</hi> and <hi>weapons,</hi> and <hi>threats</hi> in his name; and as the one opposed the <hi>naturall,</hi> so the other the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Christ,</hi> he in his person, this in his offices and principall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; but each of thē to the most lamentable embroyling of Chrsts

Church. And as the one of them was quelled by the Imperiall <hi>Constantine,</hi> iudicially proceeding, and Synodically sentencing him, with his band of three hundred and eighteene Bishops; So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other, God hath excited <hi>Your</hi> most excellent <hi>MAIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIE,</hi> but without the trouble or labour of an Ecclesiastique Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node, to ouerthrow him by <hi>YOVR</hi> pen, and the pen of one onely <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Your</hi> many; yet worth many, where all most worthy.</p>
   <p>And albeit <hi>Your MAIESTIE</hi> needes no Defender, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with so many continually about <hi>Your Person, guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> the bed, and <hi>girding</hi> to them the sword (as the Spouse speakes) (besides <hi>Your</hi> owne inherent puissance inuincible) yet because what I haue now vttered concerning the <hi>Cardinall</hi> and his <hi>mortified propositions</hi> (crossing with <hi>Your MAIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIES</hi> both <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> as much as may bee) I haue vttered it with the priuitie of many of <hi>Your</hi> leige people, (whom I confesse, as before, that my especiall care hath been to confirme, and whereof some perhaps will not disdaine to cast their eies vpon these papers, if at least they may passe with <hi>Your MAIESTIES</hi> approbation) it were worth the considering, what correspondence such grounds haue with the auncient doctrine, which the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> and his followers would seeme so close to follow. Of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi> for one, <hi>That a Soueraigne King is accountable to none</hi> (not onely to his Subiects, but) <hi>not so much as to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,</hi> (as <hi>Dauid</hi> said euen now, that he is to be iudged like the <hi>Angels,</hi> that is, by God, and by God onely, and neither liuing nor dead by any other:) The same <hi>Chrysostome</hi> againe noting in another place, that where as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> passes ouer other mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the wildernesse in deepe silence, he insists onely vpon the death of Og and <hi>Sehon,</hi> two mightie Monarches; because Kings liues are so wholly in Gods hands, and the disposition of them is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>miraculous,</hi> reserued and appropriated to God himselfe. Of <hi>Basil,</hi> That <hi>a King is subiect to no Iudge:</hi> Of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that <hi>nullis tenetur legibus,</hi> not onely the King of Israel, but not the King of Egypt: Or (because the Papists make his case the worse of the two, that should bee the better in all reason,) not onely the King of Egypt, but not the King of Israel; for he saies it of both of
<pb facs="5"/>
thē, &amp; in two seuerall places. Of that Pope in <hi>Theodoret (Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasius</hi> I take it) who persecuting <hi>Flauian</hi> (as his Predecessours had done for a long time before) <hi>Theodosius</hi> that was their arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bidde the Pope let goe <hi>Flauian</hi> (because hee sawe there was malice) and argue against himselfe, as if he were <hi>Flauian,</hi> giuing him good leaue to say what hee could. To whome that Pope most submissely; <hi>We may not doe so, if please your Maiestie, it is not lawfull for vs to implead a King; not onely in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but not personating another,</hi> not <hi>fictione iuris,</hi> as the Lawyers say. Yea the verie heathen Poet, and one of the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedest, yet he had so much grace in him, as to make seruants thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues safe vnder a Crowne (though worne not for Soueraignty, but for Solemnity onely, as was the fashion in their festiuals) <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. As for that which follows, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, &amp;c. it is right the doctrine of our moderne <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi> concerning Kings, that if first they be decrowned, then they may be vsed, no longer as Kings, but as priuate men, that is, abused at pleasure. Euen the <hi>Cardinall</hi> himselfe opens his eyes at last, (the case is so cleare) and acknowledges as much. <hi>The STE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VVARD of a house</hi> (saies he) <hi>may be deposed by none, but only by the grand-master of the Family:</hi> which is <hi>God</hi> in the world, as the <hi>Steward</hi> in the State is the <hi>King,</hi> by analogie. Not but that his meaning is as trayterous as euer (for he vnderstands it of his Pope) but I suppose <hi>Your MAIESTIES</hi> name was partly fatall to giue him light (which is the character of <hi>Supremacy</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in you by God) and partly it confirmes my opinion of him, that if <hi>Your MAIESTES</hi> Bookes and rare trauailes in this cause (out of which we all take, that now write any thing) had been but read of him when he was young, and afore he was embondaged in this damnable preiudice, he would haue yeelded to the spirit and power which they are fraught with, acknowledged your proofes, submitted to your reasons, admired <hi>Your MAIESTIES &amp; cor &amp; linguam;</hi> and finally thanked God for him his conuerter, whom now he is faine to endure his confuter. But, <hi>longa dies quid non captiuat?</hi> making vs, as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> sayes, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, to preferre euen garlicke before Ambrosia.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
But although not he (froward as he is) yet there are others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite both forreiners &amp; domesticks, that profit by <hi>Your MAIE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIES</hi> peerelesse writings daily; not onely to the enlarging of their skill and knowledge (whereof <hi>your Works</hi> may seeme to be an <hi>Vniuersall Seminarie)</hi> but to their redeeming from ruine (which Vn-subiection drawes to) and building them vp to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting saluation in the world to come, with quiet mindes and content in this present, which before they wanted. And truely our hope is, that the Rights which <hi>Your MAIESTIE</hi> shall transmitt to your posteritie, as nobly cleared by <hi>Your</hi> pen, as euer they were wonne by your Auncestors swords, will both breed much peace to the Land in generall, and great security to <hi>Your</hi> royall offspring the inheritours, confusion to the aduersaries, and barkers against Soueraignty; euen as long as either learning shall be held in price, or a man shall be left aliue to reuolue bookes.</p>
