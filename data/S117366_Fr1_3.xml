<note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 2.27.</note> And be not in any thing terrified by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, what to them is cause of perdition is to you of saluation; and this from God: for asmuch as to you it is giuen for Christ, that not only yee beleeue in him but that yee also suffer for his sake.
<note n="b" place="margin">Ephes. 12.</note> Yee were in times past without Christ, aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the conuersatiō of <hi>Israel,</hi> strangers to the testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt, hauing no hope of the promise, &amp; without a God in this world.
