      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the Conquest of Ireland made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, untill of late, the Office and Authoritie of a Iustice of Peace have very little or nothing at all beene here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood or regarded, but have beene alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether eclipsed by those many and often Rebellions, which have beene in this Kingdome almost in all ages since that happie Conquest. These Rebellions (after many yeares continuance) were totally repressed by that il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious Princesse Queene <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> who having finished that worke was called to another Kingdome, there to enjoy an everlasting Crowne of Glory. Since which time by the goodnesse of Almighty God, and the most happy, prudent, and peaceable governement of our late Soveraigne King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed memory, and of his most Excellent Majestie that now is (especially since your Lordships governement here) that Eclipse is so vanished and dispersed that now the light of Iustice doth cleerely appeare and shew it selfe in all parts of Ireland: and the office of a Iustice of Peace is duely
<pb facs="4"/> regarded, and his Warrant in all parts of the Kingdome obeyed. So as now it will be needfull that the Iustice of Peace should well understand the duty of his place, and neither exceede, nor come short of the Authority given him, either by Cōmission, or by the statute Lawes of the Realme. And albeit divers worthy and learned men in England have published many profitable Bookes concerning the Pleas of the Crowne, and the Office of a Iustice of peace, yet none of those will be any sufficient guide for the Iustices of peace in Ireland, because the Statute lawes of England and Ireland doe in many things differ: for there be many ancient Statutes made in England some whereof are in some things altered, and others repealed (either in part or in the whole) by later Statutes which are not of force in Ireland: (so as those ancient Statutes as they were first enacted remaine still of force in this Kingdome:) and likewise there be many statutes made in Ireland (aswell before 10. <hi>H.</hi> 7. as since) which were never any lawes in England. The consideration whereof hath incited me (although by reason of mine age, and other infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties least able of all my brethren the Iudges) for the helpe of the Iustices of peace here, to compose this worke according to the lawes and Statutes now of force in this Kingdome: which I humbly make bold to present to your Lordships view &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, not doubting but as all other labours which any way tend to the advancement of Iustice, &amp; the well ordering of this Common-wealth, so also these poore endevours of mine to that purpose vvill easily obtaine your favourable acceptance. Mine errors or mistakings I shall humbly beseech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to pardon &amp; impute them rather to my weaknesse, want of abilitie, and multiplicitie of other imployments then to my will: and to accept of this small mite as a free-vvill offering at the hands of him who for your Lordships many noble favors will not only ever pray for your happinesse and long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this place of governement, but also earnestly desire to manifest his thankfulnes for the same, and to be accounted</p>
