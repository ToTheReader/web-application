                 <title>Funeral teares : For the death of the Right Honorable the Earle of Deuonshire. Figured in seauen songes, whereof sixe are so set forth that the wordes may be exprest by a treble voice alone to the lute and base viole, or else that the meane part may bee added, if any shall affect more fulnesse of parts. The seauenth is made in forme of a dialogue, and can not be sung without two voyces. Inuented by Iohn Coprario</title>

      <l>The thronging miscreates brought in Deu'nshires name,</l>
      <l>Some figuring lamentations, others ioyes:</l>
      <l>Some wept, some sobd, some howld, some laught, some smild,</l>
      <l>And as their passions strange, and different were,</l>
      <l>So were their shapes, such heapes were neuer pil'd</l>
      <l>Of Monstrous heades as now consorted here.</l>
      <l>For some like Apes peere out, like foxes some,</l>
      <l>Many like Asses, Wolfes, and Oxen seem'd,</l>
      <l>Like hissing Serpents, and fell Hydras some,</l>

      <l>What th' humane speakers in defence replyed:</l>
      <l>To latter ages let this tale be told</l>
      <l>Which is by fame for euer verified.</l>
      <l>Did Mountioy loue? and did not Hercules</l>
      <l>Feele beauties flame, and couch him vnderneath</l>
      <l>The winges of Cupid? or did ere the lesse</l>

      <l>Did not he free the trembling world from feare,</l>
      <l>And dire confusion? who else could subdue</l>
      <l>Monsters that innocents did spoyle, and teare,</l>
      <l>Or Saturnes auncient goulden peace renue?</l>
      <l>Did Mountioy loue? and did not Mountioyes sword</l>
      <l>When he marcht arm'd with pallace dreadfull helme</l>
      <l>The rough vnquiet Irish rebels curbe?</l>
      <l>And the inuading Spaniard ouerwhelme?</l>
      <l>Lou'd he? and did not he nathlesse assist</l>
      <l>Great Brittaines counsils, and in secret cells</l>
      <l>The Muses visite? and alone vntwist</l>
      <l>The riddles of deepe Philosophick spels?</l>
      <l>Did Deu'nshire loue? and lou'd not Deu'nshire so</l>
      <l>As if all beautie had for him beene fram'd?</l>
      <l>For beautie more adorn'd no age shall know</l>
      <l>Then hers whom he his owne for euer nam'd.</l>
      <l>Let then base enuie breake, fond rumour sleepe,</l>
      <l>Blacke malice turne to doue-white charitie,</l>
      <l>Let Deu'nshire triumph, and his honor keepe</l>
      <l>Immune, and cleare from darke mortaliie.</l>
      <l>This spoken, Fame charg'd Zepherus to sound</l>
      <l>His goulden trumpet, after whose smooth blast</l>
      <l>These words she made from earth to heau'n rebound,</l>
      <l>Braue Mountioyes glory shall for euer last.</l>
      <l>Then forth was brought aboss't booke destined</l>
      <l>For Kings, and Heroes, where with liquid gould</l>
      <l>Deceased Deu'nshires name she registred</l>
      <l>In charmed letters that can nere grow old.</l>
