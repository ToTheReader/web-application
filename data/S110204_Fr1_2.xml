      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the exposing of this Historie vnto you, I thought it best to deale with you, after the manner of that puissant Kinge of the <hi>Lacedemonians, Agesilaus:</hi> who being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen (according to the custome at such friendly meetings) by drawing of lottes, the maister of the banquet (whose office was to prescribe how much each guest should drinke) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked of his Sellerer, how much wine he should set before each of them? If there be store (saith hee) giue euery one as much as he requireth: if there be but little, diuide it equally amongst them; to the ende there should neither be want of wine, nor any man enforced to drinke more then hee thought sufficiently conuenient: So I, tracing his steps herein, wish no man to spend his pretious time in reading this my historie, any longer, then it standeth with his owne liking: neyther will I discourage any one, that taketh liking therof, frō the cōtinuall reading; promising to him that desireth most, inough: and leauing to them, that at the most esteeme the least for i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, leaue inough to vse therein their owne discretions. As for those who hauing once perused the same, and are desirous once more to renewe some especiall matters: as also for thē, whose waightier affaires will not lend leasure to the reading of so long an Historie, I haue set downe my Chapters so, as some of them are almost full histories; at least, amongst other straunge aduentures, containe sundry Tragicall and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble relations: The names wherof you may finde in the table. What faultes are eyther committed for want of good heede in the writing, or haste in the reviewing, it resteth in thy pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to pardon it: if in the historie it selfe, it remaineth to my power to perfect it. Which, till my leasure shall giue me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leaue to performe, I leaue you to the perusing of what al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready is proposed.</p>
