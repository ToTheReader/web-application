those whō saynt Augustin did im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ponge,
graunting that the begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyng
of our belefe is the gyfte of
god which theye denied, but with
toothe and nayle defendyng, that
al good workes are of our selfe,
(which thother ascribed to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gift of

in our own power ether to do thē,
or to leaue them vndone, procedīg

necessari to ioyn to this his forsaid
boke of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> predestination of saints
the seconde boke which he wrot of

forsomiche, as they do condemne
al men of thys age whiche are of a

might nowe se what fault they can

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
grasse. I wold coūsel al men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of thē. For the end of al there
studys and labors (how holy a pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence
soeuer they haue) at, not only
the destruction of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> souls of men
but also the vtter confusion &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersion
of whol commen welthes:
declaring therby, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> they at a more
pestelent sect than euer wer the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes.
Which papistes althoughe
they were right nought for y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> soul
yet were they good and profyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the body for ciuil common
welthes, for the mētinaunce of cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
iustice, &amp; al good politique or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
But as for thes, thei ar nether
good for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> body nor for the soule
yea they ar most mortal enemies
<pb facs="5"/>
and cruell murtherers to both.</p>
   <p>Forthermore, by these two smalle
workes, your grace shall perceaue
howe necessarye a thynge it is,
that the predestinatiō of god shul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
be knowen amonge the people,
y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> ignorance wherof, what is it els
but the veri lacke of knoledge of
y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> grace of god. And that not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen,
as it ought to be, how can the
glori of god be praised as it shold
be, yea howe is it not by that mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes

them whiche shoulde haue it, and
so geue to god his right praise?</p>
   <p>To the confusion therfore, and
shame of thos detestable &amp; shamles
heretiques, and for the erudition
of the rest of the people, whiche are
vnlerned and easi to be deceaued,
I haue brought thes workes into

boulde vnder your graces fauour
as to dedicate them to your grace
as to a faythfull mother of all

trewth may be knowen, and god
praysed in all thinges: whose
