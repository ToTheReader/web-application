For who ever tasted more deepely, than my selfe; of the Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liberality, and singular bountie of that right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Ladie, the <hi>Ladie Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,

      <pb facs="3"/> who when hee was Lord Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> sent for mee into these parts, where now I dwell, not by sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of friends, but onely out of his former remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of me in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where hee was then to me a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall and memorable Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.
