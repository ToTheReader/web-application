      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other
passages not
long since, I happened
on a Stranger, by
Language, <hi>French;</hi>
by Education, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by Habit (which
many times happens)
meane, and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible:
<pb facs="8"/>
But entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
discourse with him,
I found him full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Discourses; and
by his being not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
but of few, hee
was the more sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
I out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
respect and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
I had to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
(especially lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned)
redeemed him
out of the hands of an
ignorant Host, whom
I saw deputed him to
<pb facs="8"/>
base uses and offices;
(as to light mens pipes,
and the like) and in
conclusion finding him
full of worth, I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
him inwardly,
insomuch as I taught
him to utter such <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosities,</hi>
(whereof
hee was full) in our
<hi>English Tongue;</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
my selfe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
understood, he was
of sufficient ability to
instruct, not without
<pb facs="9"/>
variety of content and
pleasure: so that upon
some expence of time,
not with him alone, but
other Strangers also of
the like quality, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated
certain houres
for a discourse, which
I thought good to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part;
for as I may say
with the <hi>Poet,</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Scire meum nihil
est, nisi me scire hoc
sciat alter:</p>
   <p>which conferences and
<pb facs="9"/>
discourses if they come
to thy content, I have
gained what I aymed
at, and withall an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
that Study, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I might please all, if
it could be; for <hi>Hee

Proverbio: If dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please,
howsoever I
will continue in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
my selfe: and as
for such as shall despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably

misse at my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
indeavours, (of
which kind there are
too many) I must attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
their contempt to
silly Ignorance, the
enemy of <hi>knowledge,</hi>
w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> is of the condition
of a Woodcocke, which
is alwayes pecking at
any thing that is neare

my selfe to have
<pb facs="10"/>
committed an errour,
<hi>Projecisse Margari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas

I had no such intent,
which was to instruct
the not kowing, and
to recreate the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
