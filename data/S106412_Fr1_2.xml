   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Pray thee (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
first learne to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this direction,
examining it in euery
poynt, so that thou finde
it true, &amp; agreeing with the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Then consider how thou likest and
allowest of it. Both which if thou doest,
thou shalt easily finde and feele the
whole to worke vpon thee, as it is to be
desired. The first part by diligent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
will humble and bring thee low
in thine owne sight, and raise in thee a
true sorrow of heart, by seeing thy dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="3"/>
miserie. The second part, by the
working of Gods Spirit, shall settle thee
in most cleare safety and peace, by seeing
thy selfe deliuered from the same misery.
The third part will shew thee how to
chang thy life, and conforme it vnto
the will of God, and giue thee direction
how to walke with God dayly. If thou
dealest not soundly with thy selfe in the
two former partes, neuer set vpon the
third. And although thou attaine to the
vse of them both, yet shall it be meete for
thee to prooue thy selfe dayly by them,
that thine estate may be found good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and after make the third part instead
of a dayly direction for thee, vntill
thou see thy selfe reformed, and made
like vnto it; which is the true vse of it.
For hee that is come to repentance in
trueth, must make dayly▪ vse of them all
three.</p>
