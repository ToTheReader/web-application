   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>REader, I must first intreat thy Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
afterward thy Ingenuity; thy
Patience, that thou wilt read some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
before my verses: thy Ingenuity,
that thou wilt not censure the worse of them,
because thou shalt find them censur'd to thy
hand. The purpose of this Poem is Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Delight, which if thou shalt find in any
place wanting, or disjoynd, vnderstand, that it
was either not my intent, or mine Error. And yet
I dare affirme no man shall be the worse by it, and
that if there be any want, it is more of the Delight
then of the Religion: If I intended excuses I
could tell you, and that truely too, that these Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were not now first made, although they are
now first published, and the Composure was a
yonger mans, though the Edition be a Diuines.
This I could say, if I thought Poetry incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with Diuinity, if it were a serious truth, that
God could bee onely magnified in Prose: But
when I consider that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> could be both a
Poet, and a Saint, and that it was heresie that
cast <hi>Tertullian</hi> out of the Church, and not his
Verses. I dare acknowledge these for mine owne
<pb facs="6"/>
and feare not to suffer in that cause, wherein
those Worthies were so magnify'd: Especially,
since these Essayes (which I feare their weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
will too strongly testifie) were not my study,
but my Recreation when in the vacations hauing
for a time intermitted my more serious affaires
I chose Poetry before Idlenesse; yet I haue not
chose Poetry with the hazard of my Conscience,
and so in stead of a Diuine haue writ a supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
worke; howsoeuer Malice or Ignorance
may wrest a passage vnto Popery; I meane that,
where <hi>Abraham</hi> prayes for the victory of the
Israelites: But besides that the Intercession is
generall for the Church, which no iudicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
but will allow for Orthodox, it is made by
him, whom a Popish Diuine will deny at that
time to be able to intercede: there was no solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
of him they saw not, and God they did not
see (as they would tell you) till after the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension:
I haue the more fully exprest my selfe
in this, because I would not be esteem'd as one of
them (whereof there is now too great an haruest)
who play the wantons with Religion, that will
halt betweene two parties, and in spite of the
Prophet, at the same time scrue God and Baal▪
who like not Orthodoxe truth, vnlesse deliuered
in hereticall termes, and so by a notable new trick
of Iuggling, call that Pacification, which is
<pb facs="6"/>
Conspiracy; of whose proficiency in Religion I can
speake little; but this I may most confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that (perhaps not after the Apostles
mind, yet certainely in his words) they goe on
from Faith, to Faith. Of this crime, and of the
suspition of it, I trust I am sufficiently acquitted:
for other errors which Malice and Curiosity will
aboundantly multiply, I onely referre my selfe to
the truely Iudicious, who know that a good Poem
is as a good Life, not wherein there are none, but
wherein there are the fewest faults.</p>
