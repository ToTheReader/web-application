      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Honour <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> much for honouring his Mother so much after her death, whose name and example had otherwise lyen in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie. But I like better, and wish rather to follow the piety of <hi>Nazianzene,</hi> who gaue himselfe to the
<pb facs="3"/>
performance of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Offices to his louing Mother. God hath so blessed the former part of your life aboue the lot of most women, with two such able guides, as haue so sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you with Spirituall and Temporall furniture, that you neede not the ayde of any your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Neuerthelesse, Grace and Nature will bee ascending and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselues, though in weake seruices. <hi>REV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BEN</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
when hee found but a fewe Flowres, must bring them to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>LEAH. ESAV</hi> when hee takes Uenison, gratifies his aged Father withall. <hi>SAMPSON</hi> findes home by the way and presents of it to his parents. Heere is a Posie gathered out of olde and new Gardens; this sauory meate hath God brought to hand, heere is sweete out of the strong. Let your soule eate and blesse.
<pb facs="4"/>
The vse and fruit of them I wish to euery beleeuer, especially in age and sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: but the handsell and honor of them (if any be) to your selfe, whom the Law of God and Nature binds mee to honour aboue others. Long may you liue to blesse your Children with your daily Prayers, especially your sonnes in that worke which needes much watering. Yet euery good Christian in yeares cannot but desire to bee
<pb facs="4"/>
forewarned against death approching, and that is the ayme of these endeuours. God prosper and blesse them as the former: and send mee my part in the benefit of these (as hee hath done of them) in the time of vse.</p>
