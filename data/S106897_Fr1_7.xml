   <head>The argument out of the second booke of <hi>the Retractations of Saint</hi> Augustine.</head>

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Riumphant <hi>Rome,</hi> ruinated and deiected from her throne of Maiesty, into a gulphe of calamity, by the violent irruption of the barbarous <hi>Gothes,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging their bloudy wars vnder the standard of ALARICVS: the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of false, and many gods, (whom wee brand in the fore-head with the common name of heathen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         </gap>on,</hi> as the wicked <hi>Mother</hi> of all this mischiefe, and murderer of their worldly happinesse. Wherefore the fire and zeale of <hi>Gods House,</hi> burning within my bowells, I resolued to compile these bookes of the <hi>Citty of God,</hi> to batter down the strongest hold of their bitter blasphemies, and dispel the thick clowds of their grosse errors. Some yeares passed ouer my head, before I could compile and finish the whole frame of this worke, by reason of many intercedent affaires, whose impatient hast of quick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition would admit no delay. But at last this great, and laborious worke of the <hi>Citty of God,</hi> was ended in two and twenty bookes: of which the first fiue rebate the edge of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious opinions, which build the prosperity of humane affaires vpon such a tottering foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that they thinke it cannot stand long, vnlesse it be shored vppe by the worship of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gods, whom the blinded <hi>Pagans</hi> haue beene accustomed to worship and adore: auerring (but their truth is meere false-hood) that neglect and contempt of their vnworthy adoration hath beene the fountaine from whence these bitter waters of aduerse occurrences haue strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med abundantly, and ouerflowed them. But the other fiue following are not meale-mouthed, but speake boldly against them which confesse, that the spring of worldly euills is not exhaus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor shal euer be dried vp: but the current flowing some-time more, some-times lesse, some-times swiftly, some times slowly, changing their state according to the circumstance of places times and persons: yet fondly are they opinionated (for verity hath not made them a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant) that the deuout adoration of many gods, in which sacrifices are offered vnto their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary <hi>Deity,</hi> is profitable for the life which wee hope for after death. Therefore in these ten bookes the absurdity of these two vaine opinions, both deadly foes vnto <hi>Christian religion,</hi> is discouered and confuted. But least some man may vpbraid mee that I am too forward to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the assertions of others, and slow enough to proue mine owne: the other part of this worke, which is confined within the bounds of twelue bookes, is directed to that purpose. Although in the first ten (where it is needfull) wee are not behinde hand to confirme the truth of our owne opinions and also to infringe the authority of contrary oppositions in the twelue bookes ensewing. Therefore the first foure of the twelue following, containe the originall of two <hi>Citties:</hi> of which one belongeth to GOD, the other to this <hi>World.</hi> The second foure containe their progresse. The third foure, which are the last, conteine their due bounds. Now though all the two and twenty bookes are compiled together of both <hi>Citties:</hi> yet they haue taken their title from the better part, and haue the name of the <hi>Citty of God</hi> printed on their fore-head. In the tenth booke it ought not to bee set downe for a miracle, that the fire falling <note place="margin">Retract. 1.

In the seauenteenth booke, where it is sayd of SAMVEL. <hi>He was not of the sonnes of</hi> ARON: it should rather haue beene sayd, <hi>He was not the sonne of the</hi>
      <note place="margin">Retract. 2. Chap. 5.</note>
      <hi>Priest.</hi> For it was a more lawfull custome, that the sonnes of the <hi>Priests</hi> should succeed in the roome of the deceassed <hi>Priests.</hi> For the Father of SAMVEL is found in the sonnes of ARON, but hee was not a <hi>Priest:</hi> yet not so in his sonnes, as if ARON had begot him, but in such sort as all of that people are said to bee the sonnes of ISRAEL. This worke beginneth thus, <hi>That most glorious society and celestiall Cittie of GOD &amp;c.</hi>
