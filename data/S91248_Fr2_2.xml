      </gap>
      <pb facs="76"/> direction in this Treatise, and so suffer the holy religion of God, to take place amongst their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies at home, otherwise they shall trauell much, and profit little.</p>
   <p>For although there be neuer so good lawes in Cities, neuer so pure order in Churches, yet if masters of families, doe not practise at home catechising, and discipline in their houses, and ioyne their helping hands to Magistrates, and Ministers: they may in truth, (but vniustly, as many haue done) complaine that their children and seruants are disordered, and corruptted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, when in truth, they were disordered, and are still corrupted, and mard at home. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be, neither is it to be hoped for, that either the father of his children, or the husband of his wife, or the master of his seruants, should looke for that obedience, that reuerence, that faithfulnesse, and that dutifulnesse, which they of right ought to haue, and the other in conscience, and of bounden dutie are bound to performe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they doe now at length endeuour to see these orders and duties hereafter mentioned, to be practised within their seuerall Households. For if Parents and Householders shall performe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dutie to their children and seruants, then to prouide for them meat, drinke, and apparrell, and to pay them their wages: then Papists, Atheists, yea, Turkes, and Infidels, doe yeeld this dutie as well as they.</p>
   <pb facs="77"/>
   <p> And seeing all men be carefull that their Horses and Bullocks should haue sufficient fodder and prouender, to the end they may haue their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in leiu and recompence thereof: it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently follow, that therefore a Christian House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder ought to haue ouer his Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, as much more Christian care, then hee hath ouer his dumbe and insensible beasts, that so hee may make a singular comfort from the daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of their encrease in spirituall graces.</p>
   <p>Oh what a sweete and comfortable thing shall this be to the soule and conscience of such an house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, when he hath beene so diligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the training and bringing vp of his children and Seruants in the obedience and wayes of the Lord, that he may rightly deserue to haue this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie report and commendation giuen vnto him, from the mouth and penne of the godly: namely, that he hath a Church in his house: that is, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of sound and faithfull Christians, such as feare God indeed; as the like report was giuen by the Apostle, to those godly House-keepers, <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> his wife: <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 5. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 19. as also to <hi>Philemon. Phil.</hi> 2.</p>
   <p>Therefore all Parents and House-holders are (in the Lord) to be exhorted that they would be carefull to bring vp their children and familie, so as they eyther (by some good tokens) may see them the children of God, and heyres of the couenant, or at the least, they may be comforted in their owne
<pb facs="77"/> consciences, notwithstanding that their children and seruants (for some cause vnknowne to them (do refuse their counsell and instruction; seeing they to the vttermost of their power &amp; abilitie, haue vsed all good meanes to bring them vp well, and haue rightly offered them to the Lord.</p>
   <p>Now if parents and masters haue iust cause to bewaile and lament, when (thus trauelling in good education and information) they cannot yet see good effects, and godly fruits in their children and seruants: how much more cause of griefe may they haue, when they haue vsed and bestowed no labour at all (either by themselues or others for them) to bring them vp in the nurture and feare of the Lord? And yet alas, many will be greiued for the one, that will not be any thing mooued for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherefore let all Parents and Masters of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies know and learne, that if they will conuay Gods blessings to their posterities, then they must doe, and performe the duties belonging therevnto: yea, let them (if they be loth to conuay Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to their children) carefully auoid the means vnto it.</p>
   <p>And surely, as it is a blessed thing in the houre <note place="margin">Luke. 2. 29.</note> of death, with <hi>Simeon</hi> to depart in peace, leauing their wiues, children, and seruants, members of Christ, spouses to Christ, children to God, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to the Lord: so in extreamitie of death, no one thing will be more grieuous vnto Parents and House-holders, then (the Lord hauing giuen them
<pb facs="78"/> the charge of so many soules to be furthered<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

      </gap> saluation) that their owne tormented conscienc<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap> shall presse them, in as much as they haue help<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

      <pb facs="78"/> and vngodly seruants, are for the most part, loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, pickers, and deceitfull: whereas on the other side, godly seruants are iust and faithfull, whom in his absence he may trust to doe such businesse and <note place="margin">Gen. 30. 30. and 39. 5. &amp;c.</note> worke as he willeth them to doe.</p>
   <p>If masters of families be carefull and desirous (as in conscience they ought) that their wiues, children and seruants, should reforme themselues, and endeuour to practise such duties as doe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and belong vnto them; then they must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be diligent and carefull to reforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, both inwardly and out wardly in such points and duties, as hitherto they haue left vndone: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, they may iustly say vnto them: Phisitian, heale your selfe: or, why doe you will vs to do that, <note place="margin">Luk. 4. 23. and 22. 32. Rom. 2. 21.</note> which you doe not practise your selfe? For as one candle cannot light another if it selfe be out: euen so a master of a Household shall not reforme those of his charge, and inflame them with the loue of God and godlinesse, if hee himselfe be voyd of the same.</p>
   <p>Let euery master of a Household therefore say and performe with <hi>Iosua: I and my familie will serue the Lord: Iosua.</hi> 24. 15. And likewise let euery Christian Ladie, Mistresse, and Dame, say with <hi>Hester: I and my maides will doe the like: Hest.</hi> 4. 16. And so no doubt, God will poure his blessings on them, and theirs, in this life, and euerlasting happines on them in the life to come.</p>
