God, God
will honor, and
so will godly
men: God will;
for he useth not to be behind
with any, neither will hee
with you: You have done
God much honour in setting
up such Lights in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
Ministers who both

Christ hath it) <hi>shall be called
great in the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
and so shall you. And
so will godly men honour
you, both Ministers and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
Ministers, because
you have built us of our coat
some Synagogues: Others
(who had it not beene for
you, might have sate in the
<note n="c" place="margin">Luke 1. 79.</note>Shadow of Darknesse and
Death) for that they now
see best by their present mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
what was their former,
and what would have beene
their future Misery. To save
one soule fom death is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the<note n="d" place="margin">1 Tim. 31. Iam. 5. 20.</note> Word to be an
honourable piece of service:
How great is your Honour
and comfort then? to whom
God hath given an Heart
<pb facs="3"/>
and meanes to set up sundrie
<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 5. 14.</note>Lights of it for the Saving
of many soules, in many
Parishes. Now as God and
GODS People will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
you for providing that
which is<note n="f" place="margin">Isa. 55. 2.</note>
      <hi>Bread</hi>
      <note n="g" place="margin">Iohn 6. 55.</note>
      <hi>indeed:</hi> So
you must conceive that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
will not<note n="h" place="margin">Luke 10. 18▪</note> fall downe
from Heaven like lightning
thus without some stirre;
You doe plucke downe his
Kingdom, and he will pluck
at you, and you must, and
(I hope) doe provide for his
assaults. As for your Safety,
your<note n="i" place="margin">Luke 10▪ 20.</note> Name being written
in Heaven (out of Satans
<note n="k" place="margin">Iob 1. 7. 1 Pet. 5. 8.</note>walke) you stand<note n="l" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> sure;
The<note n="m" place="margin">Iob. 10. 29.</note> Father holds, and the
<note n="n" place="margin">vers. 28.</note>Sonne holds, and none shall
plucke you out of their
hands: But as touching your
<pb facs="4"/>
inward Quiet, by GODS
<note n="o" place="margin">Luke. 22. 31.</note>Leave, Satan will take his
time to winnow you (not as
Chaffe) but as Wheat: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it, he will doe what he
can (and he can doe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)
to interrupt your
Peace: He hath<note n="*" place="margin">Iam. 2. 19.</note> no Peace
himselfe, and so he cannot
abide (as farre as he can doe
withall) that any should
have any: He durst and did
set upon, and vex the Lord
himselfe with the smoake of
an<note n="p" place="margin">Matth. 4. 9.</note> heavie Tentation: And
will he not, Dare he not,
let drive at us? Verily, when
we come to have those<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 16. 11.</note> true
Riches about us, and to be
in some spirituall strength,
(which usually is in our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more<note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 5. 14.</note> experienced
age) it is usuall that GOD
<pb facs="4"/>
should, and he often doth
suffer Satan; What? to beat
us? No! But yet to<note n="r" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet
us, as he did Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
Wherefore, after some great
things done to GODS ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Satans undoing,
we are then chiefest of all,
to looke for the houre of
Tentation, and to take the
best care we can, both for
our Safetie and Peace: This
is to fight, not so much
<note n="s" place="margin">Ephes. 6. 12.</note>with men, nor with<note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor▪ 15▪ 32.</note> beasts,
after the manner of men,

all of us, by all meanes to
furnish our selves with such
<pb facs="5"/>
      <note n="y" place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 5.</note>Armes as may fit us in our
several occasions. And now
to helpe the weaker sort
of Christians, I have here
done somewhat that way,
which (what ever it be) I
doe here make bold to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it under your Name and
Countenance: To whom I
wish, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did to
<hi>Gaius</hi> (the<note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 16. 23.</note> Hoste of the
Church in his Time:)<note n="a" place="margin">3 Ioh. 2.</note> That
above all things you may
prosper, and be in health,
even as your soule prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</p>
