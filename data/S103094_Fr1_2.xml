WORSHIPFVLL SIR

Standard-bearer in the Armies

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are exhorted by
Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to be
euer ready to make
answere to euery
man, that asketh a reason of the
hope that is in vs, with meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and feare. So must wee
bee ready to giue an account
<pb facs="3"/>
of all our actions, if the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God, the edification of
the Church, and the truth of
our profession doe so require.
Hereby I haue beene mooued,
at the desire of my Brethren of
the Synode of <hi>Brechin,</hi> to set
downe these reasons of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
which I propounded
before them briefely in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
to shew in what faith,
and assurance of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
both they and I might
and ought to giue obedience to
the Acts of the late Assembly
holden at <hi>Perth.</hi> These I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
vnto your Worship, to
whom I know, they shall bee
most acceptable; not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are conform to your
<pb facs="3"/>
owne wise &amp; solid iudgement
against the whole externall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of our Church; but also,
by reason of the sincere affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that you haue euer carried
to his Highnes Person, and the
great estimation, or rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
that you haue of his
Maiesties surpassing wisdome,
as well in the Ecclesiastike, as
Politike Gouernment. And I
hope, by the grace of God, that
as vnder the protection of that
Standard, which you haue frō
your Noble Progenitors, and
they for their valour haue had
the honour to carry these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundreth yeeres in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of <hi>Scotland;</hi> our Nation
hath been often victorious, and
<pb facs="4"/>
euer inuincible: So the veritie
shall march with courage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Patrocinie of your
name, and according to that
Martial Motto of your Armes,
DISSIPATE, shall scatter and
driue away these doubts, scrupo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losities,
anxieties &amp; feares, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
custome, opinion, and
preiudice, doe enuiron and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
the weake &amp; tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
as with Armies of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
enemies, who will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
no conditions of Peace,
and hauing deliuered her out
of their hands, shall restore her
to that liberty wherwith Christ
hath made her free; that with
confidence she may draw neere
to serue the liuing God, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="4"/>
to put difference betweene
circumstantial indifferent alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Ceremonies, wherevnto
shee is not tyed in the worship
of God; and the necessarie sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
points of Religion,
which cannot bee changed,
without the vtter exterminatiō
of a good Conscience, and the
shipwracke of Faith. In this
hope I consecrate D.D.D. this
testimonie of my sincere affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to your worship in Christ.</p>
