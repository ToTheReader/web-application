   <head>TO THE ORDINARIE
READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O read with profit (and otherwise thou had better
neuer read) these Rules are to be followed.</p>
   <p>1. First, beware of a preiudicate affection;<note place="margin">Notes for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Reader.</note> an
euill, forestalling the grace of God; barring the
doores of mercie against such: For we should not
dare any thing against, but for the trueth.</p>
   <p>2. Secondly desire of God, that in trying of all
thinges, thou mayest keepe that is good: Otherwise, with the Spider,
thou wilt fashion Poyson▪ where the painefull Bee would cull Hony.</p>
   <p>3. Thirdly marke diligent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>y the Argumentes and Reasons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
any poynt is prooued. And consider whether they be Essentiall
and to the matter, or but Paralogifmes, or seeming fayre Colours,
which we tearme Sophistication.</p>
   <p>In disputation about the Beeing of a true Church, it must be well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
waighed,<note place="margin">VVhat ìs to be obserued, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Being of a Church.</note> whether speach be had of such a true Church as is <hi>Visible</hi>
and knowne plainely of man; or, of such a true Church as is <hi>Inuisible,</hi>
and so onely knowne of God: For, though we may hope well of such
as we see and know, yet God knowes who are his. And then, if the
Question be about the true visible Church, it must further be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
if so it be a true visible Church <hi>setled</hi> in orderly constitution, or as
yet <hi>vnestablished,</hi> or not yet constituted: for euery of these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
(though true Churches) be differenced one from another by some
<hi>substantiall</hi> marke or propertie, peculiar to the owne kind.</p>
   <p>In disputation about Ecclesiasticall policie, or Church-discipline,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
it must at first be examined,<note place="margin">VVhat, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Church policie.</note> whether speach be had of that, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes
generally with euery true Church, (and that's th'inward regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Spirit; wherevpon Christ sayth, <hi>The kingdome of God is
vvithin you;</hi> and the Psalmist, <hi>that the Kings Daughter is all glorious
vvithin;</hi> and therefore not to be poynted at with <hi>Loe heere, loe there;)</hi>
or, it must be waighed, if so the discipline be externall and outward:
And if that; then, whether of such pollicie, as tendes barely to the
Being of a true visible Church stablished, or vnestablished, in whole or
<pb facs="6"/>
in part, &amp;c. Otherwise, thou shalt swallow <hi>Quid</hi> for <hi>Quo;</hi> and when
the question is of Myles, the answere will be of Plummes.</p>
   <p>In the lacke of such a Spirit, as should discerne betweene thinges
that differ, it comes to passe, that Schismatiques exceedingly seduce
poore plaine people; describing a Visible Church, by such scriptures as
properly appertaine to the Inuisible, wherein all are really holy: and
when the question is of Discipline <hi>Essentiall,</hi> they cast in scriptures that
speake of that is onely <hi>Accidentall;</hi> as if there were no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the <hi>Maine</hi> and the <hi>By:</hi> betweene that is naturally perpetuall;
or but temporarie, fitting some one time.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Againe,<note place="margin">VVhat, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching true Ministrie.</note> if question be about <hi>True Ministers,</hi> the Schismatikes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
for a marke thereof, the verie perfection of the Lords Canon;
as if he could not be a <hi>True</hi> Minister, except he were <hi>Perfect:</hi> as if
there were no difference betweene a true man, and a man that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in euery ornament of Nature. And yet, when the <hi>Perfectistes</hi> haue
done that, the very best Minister they can make, is to be conuicted of
imperfection.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Besides,<note place="margin">VVhat, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Gospell.</note> ìf question be made, What is the <hi>Gospell?</hi> or, what is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thereto, namely, <hi>Ant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>christianisme?</hi> They determine neither of
them by that which is <hi>Essentiall,</hi> but by some <hi>Accidents,</hi> which tend
not simply to the <hi>Beeing</hi> thereof, but to the <hi>Decking</hi> of that Beeing:
the most absurd kind of Sophistication that can be. In a word, they
deale as sillily as if one should define a man, not by the veritie of Body
and Soule; but by so many Haires of the head, or so many Nailes of
an hand; or by hauing more or fewer Garmentes vpon him, of this or
that fashion.</p>
   <p>If thou know what I haue sayd, then thou art the fitter to iudge after
reading. If not, then read, but iudge not: For he that giueth false
iudgement, doth make himselfe accursed. And so, beseeching God to
giue thee vnderstanding in all thinges, I leaue thee and my labours,
to the blessing of the Almightie.</p>
