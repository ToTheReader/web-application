   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, it is a thing to be considered, that a man may seeme both vnto himself and to the Church of God to bee a true professour of the Gospel, and yet indeede be none. All professours that are of this sort, are excellently described, Luke 8. vers. 13. in these words: <hi>And they which are vpon the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ground are they, which when they shall heare, receiue the word with ioy: but hauing no roote, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue for a time, and in the time of temptation goe awaie:</hi> where are to bee noted three thinges. First, their faith, in that they are saide to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue for a season. Secondly, the fruits of that faith, in that they are said to receiue the word preached with ioy. Thirdly, their vnsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in that they are compared to stony ground, and in the time of temptation goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
   <p>Concerning their faith, whereas the spirit of God saith, that they doe beleeue, these thinges are to bee considered: first, that they haue the knowledge of the word of God: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they both can and doe giue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="5"/>
vnto the worde of God, that it is most true. Thirdly, in more speciall manner they giue assent vnto the couenant of grace made in Christ, that it is most certaine and sure: and they are perswaded in a generall and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed manner, that God will verifie the same couenant in the members of his Church. I his is all their faith; which indeede proceedeth from the holie Ghost, but yet it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make them sound professours. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they doe generally beleeue Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, yet herein they deceiue themselues, that they neuer applie and appropriate the same promises to their owne soules. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this faith wee haue, Iohn 2. vers. 24. where it is said: that when our Sauior Christ came to Ierusalem at the feast of Easter, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie beleeued in his name, &amp; yet he would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himselfe vnto them, because he knew them al, and what was in them.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To come to the second thing, those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours which are indewed with thus much grace, as to beleeue in Christ in a confused manner, goe yet further: for this their faith, though it be not sufficient to saluation, yet it sheweth it selfe by certaine fruites which it bringeth forth: for as a tree, or a braunch of a tree that hath no deepe rooting, but either is couered with a few moules, or els lieth in the water, at the season of the yeare bringeth
<pb facs="5"/>
forth leaues and blossomes, and some fruite too, and that for one or two, or mo yeares: so one that is an hearer of the worde, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the word, and the word as seed, by this generall faith may bee somewhat rooted in his heart and setled for a season, and may bring forth some fruits in his life, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very faire in his owne and other mens eies: yet indeede neither sound nor lasting, nor substantiall. What these fruits are, it may be gathered forth of these words, where it is saide, <hi>that they receiue the word with ioy,</hi> when they heare it: for here may be gathered: First,<note place="margin">1.</note> that they doe willingly subiect themselues to the ministerie of the word: secondly, that<note place="margin">2.</note> they are as forwarde as any, and as ioyfull in frequenting Sermons: thirdly, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence<note place="margin">3.</note> the Ministers whom they so ioyfully heare: lastly, they condemne them of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">4.</note> which will not bee hearers, or bee negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hearers of the word. Now, of these and such like fruites, this may bee added: though they are not sound, yet they are voide of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie. For the mindes of those professours<note place="margin">Mark, that there is a true faith, wrought by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghost, verie like sauing faith, yet no sauing faith.</note> are in part inlightened, and their hearts are indued with such a faith, as may bring forth these fruites for a time: and therefore herein they dissemble not that faith which they haue not: but rather shewe that which they haue. Adde hereunto, that a man being in this
<pb facs="6"/>
estate, may deceiue himselfe and the most godly in the worlde, which haue the greatest giftes of discerning, how they and their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren stand before the Lorde: like as the fig tree with greene leaues deceiued our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ as hee was man: for when in his hunger hee came vnto it to haue had some fruit, he found none.</p>
   <p>If this be so, it may be then required, how these vnsounde professours differ from true professours. I answere, in this they differ, that they haue not sounde hearts to cleaue vnto Christ Iesus for euer. Which appeareth in that they are compared to stonie grounde. Now, stony groundes mingled with some earth are commonly hot, and therefore haue as it were some alacrity and hastines in them, and the corne as soone as it is cast into this ground it sprouteth out very speedily, but yet the stones wil not suffer the corne to be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted deepely beneath, and therefore when Summer commeth the blade of the corne wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth with roots and all. So it is with these professours: they haue in their hearts some good motions by the holy Ghost, to that which is good: they haue a kinde of zeale to Gods worde, they haue a liking to good things, and they are as forwarde as any other for a time, and they doe beleeue. But these good motions and graces are not lasting, but
<pb facs="6"/>
like the flame and flashing of strawe and stubble: neither are they sufficiēt to saluatiō.</p>
   <p>With the true professours it is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: for they haue vpright and <hi>honest hearts before the Lord.</hi> Luke 8. vers. 15. <hi>And they haue faith which worketh by loue.</hi> Galath. 5. vers. 6. And that Christian man which loueth God, whatsoeuer shall befall, yea though it were a thousand deaths, yet his heart can neuer bee seuered from the Lord and from his Sauiour Christ: as the spowse speaketh vnto Christ of hir owne loue, Cant. 8. vers. 6. <hi>Set me as a seale on thy heart, and as a signet vppon thy arme: for loue is as strong as death: Iealousie is as cruell as the graue; the coales thereof are fierie coales and a vehement flame. Much water cannot quench loue, neither can the floudes drowne it: if a man should giue all the substance of his house for loue, they would greatlie contemne it.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Wherefore (good Reader) seeing there is such a similitude and affinitie betweene the temporary professour of the Gospell, and the true professour of the same: it is the duetie of euery Christian to try and examine himselfe whether hee be in the faith or not. 2. Cor. 13. vers. 5. And whereas it is an harde thing for a man to search out his owne heart, we are to pray vnto God that he would giue vs his spirit to discerne betweene that which is good and euill in vs. Nowe, when a man
<pb facs="7"/>
hath found out the estate of his heart by sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it, <hi>he is further to obserue and keepe it with all diligence.</hi> Prouerb. 4. vers. 23. that when the houre of death, or the day of triall shall come. he may stand sure and not be deceiued of his hope.</p>
   <p>And for this purpose I haue described the most of these small treatises which follow, to minister vnto thee some helpe in this exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and obseruing of thine owne heart. Reade them and accept of them, and by the blessing of God they shall not bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable vnto thee. 1589.</p>
