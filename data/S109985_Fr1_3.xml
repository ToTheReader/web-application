   <head>To the READER.</head>
   <p>WE may truly in this Age take vp the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans complaint, There is no end of writing Bookes; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there among the many intemperancies of our time, any greater or more hurtfull. As when there is a rot of Cattell, sound meates are not saleable, by reason the bad is so cheape and plentifull; so our frothy Pamphlets infect the ignorāt, &amp; discourage more able iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from writing at all, <hi>Ne in magno populo non ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noscantur.</hi> I say againe, There is no end of writing many Bookes: for, what good is ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="6"/> intended or attayned? Errors are rather multiplyed in questions of controuersie: the best wits are imployed in the mystery of Satan, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feedeth vpon the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals Swads, and no proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (which ought to be the end of writing Bookes) made ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in truth or in godlinesse. Wee taste no meate at all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some condiment, but such are powdred strongly, which wee keepe for store. So ought all our speeches to be seazoned with salt, to minister grace and edification to the hearers; But when we commend words and conceptions to the posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<q>Victurus genium debet habere Liber:</q> Or, to vse the words of our learned Apostle, A booke ought
<pb facs="6"/> to bee <hi>a platforme of sound words,</hi> that the Reader by his proficiency may become the Booke it selfe, and the Crowne of the Author. Such is this Booke presented to thy view: the Noble Knight, the Writer thereof, hath conuerted all his learning into godly knowledge, and his knowledge (as Saint <hi>HIEROME</hi> aduiseth) into practice. There is no teaching comparable to that which is experimentall. It was our Lords direction to Saint <hi>PE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, Tu conuersus, confirma fratres.</hi> This and many other his meditations are an account he maketh to the World, of his time piously spent, and an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say of that happy treasure in his heart, out of the abundance whereof these lines haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. His seruice to his Prince
<pb facs="7"/> and Countrey, both in peace and warre, his abundant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the poore, his so many children religiously educated, his hospitality such, that his house is becomen <hi>(quae vidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus testamur)</hi> a Colledge where learned men of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions are entertayned. All these are here modelled to thy instruction and imitation: Neyther (to the incouragement of all good Protestants, who doe not incline to the errours eyther of the right hand or of the left) hath his labour beene in vaine in the Lord: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that hee hath cleared and improued his estate left him by his valiant and liberall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any grieuance to his Tenants, of twelue Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (nine of them sonnes) hee hath not lost one: but all of
<pb facs="7"/> them are seuerally imployed in worthy callings, some within, some without the Land. Let it be still the glory of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that wee haue not in Church onely able Diuines, who with their wings doe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Arke of the testimony, but that our Gentry also doe i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate their learned King, who, besides the Sword, doth handle the Pen of the Writer, and ouercommeth
<q>
         <l>Barbariem calamo,</l>
         <l>Barbariem gladio.</l>
      </q> Enioy (good <hi>READER</hi>) the benefit, and enter vpon their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; &amp; if thy Presses of Wine and Oyle be fraught with the like liquor, <hi>Vade tu, &amp; fac si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militer.</hi>
