   <head>To the right honourable <hi>W. Webbe. L. Maior of the Cittie of London: the right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull Sir</hi> Richard Martin <hi>Knight, and to all the rest of the Aldermen of</hi> the sayde Cittie: <hi>Samuell Cottes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde</hi> wisheth increase of all spirituall and temporall blessings in this life, and euer lasting happines in the world to come.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honourable and beloued in the Lord, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had the greatest part of my maintenāce or my studies in that your houourable Citie, as also spent some time of my publique ministery there: in carrying therefore some louing affection therunto, could not otherwise satisfie my selfe, being held in conscience, bound in some du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to some of the same place of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement in your Cittie, but shewe
<pb facs="9"/>
forth in outward appearance, some to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of thankfulnes, thereby to remoue that cōmon blot of ingratitude, which to be guiltie off, I account it with him that saide: <hi>Omnia dixeris, stingratu dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eris.</hi> The cause that moued me to this, from whence in no wise I could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, was the matter in this treatise, which concernes most those places where greatest assemblies are, such as is your honourable Cittie, and besides it none like in the Land. Maye it please your honor therefore in a woord, the matter of this treatise is, of the duety of euery subiect for the discouery of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and traitors, set forth vnder an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the holye Scripture, whence this treatise is drawne, as in the treatise itselfe may appeare: And truelye as I consider the perillous estate of our Church and commonwealth, by reason of some factions people both in the one and the other, whereof your Cittie is not vtterlye voide I feare: I cannot but humblye admonishe you (if euer)
<pb facs="9"/>
now as you will approue your selues good watchmen and Shepheardes, to take heede and as <hi>Salomon</hi> Pro. 27. 23. saith: <hi>Be diligent to know the state of the Flocke, and take heede to the heardes:</hi> Which howsoeuer it is to be referred to vs the watchmē &amp; Shepheards ouer your soules, yet is it an instruction not impertinent vnto you that are gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: and if it concernal gouernours (as it doth) so most of all you my Lord and the rest of your brethren, because your Cittie waxes euery day more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous (and shal I say more vicious thē other) if I doe so affirme, I thinke your selues will ioyne with me in the same: for the multitudes, flockes, companies within that your Cittie, if a man do but view your theaters &amp; publique places of resorte for vanity, idlenes, pilferye, adultery, cousonage: what flockes in the feeldes? what thronges in your stretes? what resorte to your Tauerns, Tabling houses, places of dicing, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and gaming? what matches in
<pb facs="10"/>
bowling allyes? to consideral these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether it is a wonder to see, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of poore lying in euery streete, it will make a Christian hart bleede to see it: besides, what crying out of the poore that are honestly minded in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye corner of your Cittie for want of work, vtterly voide of any stock therby to maintaine the necessities of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and their families, and very fewe or none at all that regarde to prouide in speede for it. Thither also (because your Cittie is the place of the largest receipt, where the whole cause of the Church and Commonwealth, in cases of iustice is handled: according to the Tearmes thereunto appointed) vnder colour hereof, men of no busines, of no calling, idle, vnprofitable, wicked and vtterlye godles, thither doo they flye making it their refuge, comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in flocks and swarmes, not as p in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Bees by their honest labour to bring honye into the Hiue, but as idle drones, seeking to destroye that which
<pb facs="10"/>
others haue in the sweate of their brows most painfully gotten. Thither also the companies of recusants when they cannot finde harborough else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, do they repaire, assuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues there to finde birds of a feather, amongst whome all the treasons h ue hitherto beene hatched. Take heede therfore take heed, seeing your charge is so weighty and your burden so great: haue an eye to your Cittie, looke well to your wardes, watch and ward ouer it, neuer more neede, restraine wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in all without respect of persons. For alas your cittie swarms wtth Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istes, papists, sectuaries: look diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye for Gods glorious sake, for her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties sake, for the safetye of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Cittie and people therin: let not any English Seminarie, Italianated or rather Hispaniated as I may say, let not any such rest there in any peace: as you haue bene faithfull and carefull, as the daies growe more dangerous, be you so much the more watchfull: take
<pb facs="11"/>
heede, for in your Cittie do hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the most wicked of the Land, such bellygods, eatmeales, drunkards, whoremaisters, dicers, carders, ruffians, pickethankes, quarrellers, cousiners, theeues, busie bodies, malecontentes, harkeners after newes, newes tellers, forgerers, waiters for other dayes, dislikers of the time present, neither liking the Church, nor fauouring the Common wealth, neither louing God, nor caring either for prince or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: factious, seditious, vicious, and what not? The vnfaithfulnes of your seruantes, the vnthriftines of your sonnes in all prodigalitye and lasciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, drawen on by brasen faced companions for the purpose, maye teach you what vncleane birdes are concealed and kept close within your Cittie, gaping after the praye thereof. These thinges being laide together, the populousnes of your Cittie on the one side, and the wickednes of the most of these on the other: as you loue
<pb facs="11"/>
God, tender his Gospell, honor her Maiesty, regarde her life (wherin your care hath not beene inferiour to anye Subiectes in her Maiesties Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) so goe one: as you regarde the soules and bodies of your selues and your sonnes and daughters, your men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruantes and maideseruants: and as good fathers of the Common wealth, respecting the peace and prosperitye of your Citizens: take heede, keepe watche diligentlye, haue your eyes in euerye place, and ouer euerye person, and as your selues will not fauour any of these enemies to the state, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caye of the Church, the bane of the Common wealth: so shewe not anye fauourable countenance to any that within your precinctes shalbe abetters of them.</p>
   <p>Thus referring your honor and the rest of you the worshipfull of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the charitable viewe of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise it selfe, I commend you ouer to the protection of the almightie, who
<pb facs="12"/>
so direct you in your gouernment to the glory of God, the prosperitie of her highnes, and the safetye of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: that finally after the long enioying of your earthly temporalties heere in this wo lde you maye finallye attaine to the blessinges of euerlasting life with your good God through Christ in heauen for euer. <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> this 6. of Nouember. 1591.</p>
