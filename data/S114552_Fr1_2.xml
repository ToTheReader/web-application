      </gap> me, to present vnto your Worships, my worthles labour, to manifest the good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I beare to this fraternity: and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, you lent a gentle looke on the first part of this History, I have beene the more bolde to proffer you the second: for having bound my selfe by promise to performe it: and you perhaps clayming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise as a debt, expecting payment, I bent all my study to keepe touch: whereupon I tender this small trifle vnto you, onely crauing at your worships hands, a good opinion of my poore endevours. And albeit this pamphlet doth not minister matter worthy your grave view: yet in regard of the subject, I trust you will deigne to esteeme it sith so well as I could, though not so well as I would, I have sought herein to procure your delight: and although you finde not all the men spoken of, which is promised in the first part, yet thinke it no faintnes in me, but fault of good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: and againe, for as much as these men here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, were all of this Citie (whose story grew longer then I supposed) and the other of the country: I thought good so to breake off, and to defer their story to another time, when I may more perfectly speake thereof. In the meane space I commend your Worships to the protection of the most highest.</p>
