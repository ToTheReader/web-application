   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here came forth some few monethes since <hi>(Christian Reader)</hi> out of the supreme tribunall of the holy Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Decree printed at Rome by the Printer of the Apostolicall Chamber, &amp; to be published throughout the whol Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world, wherein two Bookes which I wrote with a simple, and sincere intention, are condemned, and the Author commanded to purge himselfe forthwith. I haue obeyed their command, and made forthwith my purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and haue done as much as lyeth in me, to send it forthwith to <hi>his Holinesse.</hi> But because that Decree is printed, and published in euery place, and the purgation which <hi>I</hi> haue sent is only in written hand, lest Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes should perchance imagine, that <hi>I</hi> haue not been carefull to fulfill <hi>his Holinesse</hi> command for purging my selfe, <hi>I</hi> thought it necessarie to Print also, and publish that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript purgation which <hi>I</hi> haue sent, which otherwise without doubt would come into few mens hands, that so the whole world may sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb facs="3"/>
iudge as well of my purgation, as of that condemnation of my bookes, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>I</hi> am to be accounted a Catholike and a child of the Church, or an Heretike, and an enemie thereof, as some men very irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, yet vnder pretext forsooth of religion, are not afraid. (<hi>I</hi> pray God forgiue them) to giue forth speeches of me.</p>
