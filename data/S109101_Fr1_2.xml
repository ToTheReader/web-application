   <head>¶TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>AS euery humane body</hi> (deare Countrey men) how wholesome soeuer, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding subiect, or at least naturally inclined to some sorts of diseases, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: so is there no Common-wealth, or Body-politicke, how well gouerned, or peaceable soeuer it bee, that lackes the owne popular errors, and naturally enclined corruptions: and therefore is it no wonder, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this our Countrey and Common-wealth, though peaceable, though wealthy, though long flourishing in both, be amongst the rest, subiect to the owne naturall infirmities. VVee are of all Nations the people most louing and most reuerently obedient to our Prince, yet are wee (as time hath often borne witnesse) too easie to be seduced to make Rebellion, vpon very
<pb facs="3"/>
slight grounds. Our fortunate and oft prooued valour in warres abroad, our heartie and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent obedience to our Princes at home, hath bred vs a long, and a thrice happy peace: Our Peace hath bred wealth: And Peace and wealth hath brought foorth a generall sluggishnesse, which makes vs wallow in all sorts of idle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and soft delicacies, the first seedes of the subuersion of all great Monarchies. Our Cleargie are become negligent and lazie, our Nobilitie and Gentrie prodigall, and solde to their priuate delights, Our Lawyers couetous, our Common-people prodigall and curious; and generally all sorts of people more carefull for their priuat ends, then for their mother the Common-wealth.</p>
   <p>For remedie whereof, it is the <hi>Kings</hi> part (as the proper Phisician of his Politicke-body) to purge it of all those diseases, by Medicines meete for the same: as by a certaine milde, and yet iust forme of gouernment, to maintaine the Publicke quietnesse, and preuent all occasions of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: by the example of his owne Person and Court, to make vs all ashamed of our sluggish delicacie, and to stirre vs vp to the practise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of all honest exercises, and Martiall sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb facs="3"/>
of VVarre; As likewise by his, and his Courts moderatenesse in Apparell, to make vs ashamed of our prodigalitie: By his quicke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and carefull ouerseeing of the Cleargie, to waken them vp againe, to be more diligent in their Offices: By the sharpe triall, and seuere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the partiall, couetous and bribing Lawyers, to reforme their corruptions: And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by the example of his owne Person, and by the due execution of good Lawes, to reforme and abolish, piece and piece, these old and euill groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded abuses. For this will not bee <hi>Opus vnius diei,</hi> but as euery one of these diseases, must from the <hi>King</hi> receiue the owne cure proper for it, so are there some sorts of abuses in Common-wealths, that though they be of so base and contemptible a condition, as they are too low for the Law to looke on, and too meane for a <hi>King</hi> to interpone his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, or bend his eye vpon: yet are they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, aswell as the greatest of them. So is an Ant an <hi>Animal,</hi> aswell as an Elephant: so is a VVrenne <hi>Auis,</hi> aswell as a Swanne, and so is a small dint of the Toothake, a disease aswell as the fearefull Plague is. But for these base sorts of corruption in Common wealthes, not onely the
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>King,</hi> or any inferior Magistrate, but <hi>Quilibet e populo</hi> may serue to be a Phisician, by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering and impugning the error, and by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reformation thereof.</p>
   <p>And surely in my opinion, there cannot be a more base, and yet hurtfull, corruption in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, then is the vile vse (or rather abuse) of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Tobacco</hi> in this Kingdome, which hath mooued me, shortly to discouer the abuses thereof in this following little Pamphlet.</p>
   <p>If any thinke it a light Argument, so is it but a toy that is bestowed vpon it. And since the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect is but of Smoke, I thinke the fume of an idle braine, may serue for a sufficient battery against so fumous and feeble an enemy. If my grounds be found true, it is all I looke for; but if they cary the force of perswasion with them, it is all I can wish, and more then I can expect. My onely care is, that you, my deare Countrey-men, may rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue euen by this smallest trifle, of the sinceritie of my meaning in greater matters, neuer to spare any paine, that may tend to the procuring of your weale and prosperitie.</p>
