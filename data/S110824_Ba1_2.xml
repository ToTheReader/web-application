Howbeit where the length of Music did conveniently extend it selfe to two branches of matter, by reason of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viti: it is signified in the margent by this mark {. Where a branch of matter continueth on beyond the length of the Music, whereby som strains of the Music are to be repeated: the verses on which that repetition dooth fall, are noted by a mark of the same fashion, but larger size. And lastly, where the matter ends before the Music, it is expressed by these prict lines <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
