      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing taken in hand to entreat of this place of Scripture (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my poore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, wherewith God hath enabled me) at the sundry motions &amp; earnest requests of some of my friends (such as feare God) I was earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to put the same in print, for the benefit (as they said) of others, whose christian desier, I take in this case, as a sufficient calling hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; neither do I yet see, how I could haue made them a denyall, without some preiudice to their soules, and some checke vnto mine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.

      <hi>(The Lauar of the heart, or the Bath of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> I confesse is of that excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that it requireth both large and deepe discourses, wherein both lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and godly haue not bin wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. In this corruption of nature it is not possible to do any thing so exactly well, but will bee carped at, depraued and slandered; so that who offereth any thing to the sight of the world, must make ready his backe for the deepe surrowes of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry byting censurer.<note place="margin">Psa

<pb facs="6"/>hath any man iust cause to accuse me in this my honest enterprise. And so much the lesse because my care hath been to bee sound and plaine, for the benefit of the simplier sort, and especially for the satisfying of such honest and good hearts, as desired to peruse that with their eyes, (which they heard with their eares) that so better meditating and remembring that, which otherwise they forget, they might make their hearts as rich in grace, as Sermons (according to the truth of God) are full of goodnesse: If thou (gentle Reader) meete with any thing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the Sermon, that thou shalt iudge worthie the censuring, as me right in vnderstanding me, as I expresly spake it; and let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="7"/>shall be most ready (God willing) to satisfie thee therein: or to alter, or to better my iudgement, if any man out of the word of God shall offer to instruct me for as I desier to teach what I know without grudging; so I disdaine not to learne that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I am ignorant without blushing: we know nothing yet, as we ought to know (saith the Apostle) therefore I doe not presume of perfection, I confesse much imperfection euery way; and in this do wholy and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly submit my selfe to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church; as I do for my sinfull life, in Christ craue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God. The Lord enforme vs all, with all profitable and conuenient trueth, and frame all our affections thereafter. And the Lord giue vs all grace, to turne our hearts from the world vnto God, our contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the peace of the Church:
<pb facs="7"/>and our mindes into loyall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto Soueraigne authority, and our prayers and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings for our gratious and dread Soueraigne King <hi>IAMES.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>
