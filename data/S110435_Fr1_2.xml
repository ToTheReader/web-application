   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He fables of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sope (mooste to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde younge Lorde) are not only had in com mendation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the Phi losophers, as with Plato, Ari stotle, &amp; diuerse other of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> moste excellent of thē: but also the deuines, when in theyr preachynges there cometh to theyr purpose any matter, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse to the rude people, they alledge the allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye sence of them, to the muche edification of the hearers. I saye therfore, that amonge other his wyttye fables (not to you noble gentleman vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen) he telleth, how that the cocke scrapynge on a doungehill, found a precious stone, and when
<pb facs="3"/>
he sawe it, disdayninge, he spurned it from hym, sayinge, what haue I to do with the, thou canste not serue me to no kynde of vse, and so dispysynge it, left it where as it laye on the dongehyll styll.</p>
   <p>Euen so there be a nomber of that sorte, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case when they shall eyther heare redde, or them selfe reade this excellent tryumphes, of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous clercke Petrarcha, shall lytle set by them, and peraduenture caste it from them, desyrynge rather to haue a tale prynted of Robyn Hoode, or some other dongehyll matter then of this, whiche I dare affirme, yea, and the Italians do the same, that the deuine workes set aparte, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in any vulgar speche or language, so notable a worke, so clerckely done as this his worke. And albeit that he setteth forth these syxte wonderfull made triumphes all to the laude of hys Ladye Laura, by whome he made so many a swete son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, that neuer yet no poete nor gentleman could amend, nor make the lyke, yet who that doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande them, shall se in them comprehended al morall vertue, all Phylosophye, all storyall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and briefely manye deuyne sentences theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall secretes declared. But alas who is he that will so reade them, that he wyl marke them, or what prynter wyll not saye, that he may winne more gayne in pryntynge of a merye ieste, then suche lyke excellente workes, suerlye (my good Lorde) very fewe or none, whyche I do lamente at my harte, consyderynge that aswell in French, as in the Italyan (in the whyche both tongues I haue some lytle knowledge) there is no excellente
<pb facs="3"/>
worke in the latyn, but that strayght wayes they set it forth in the vulgar, moost commonly to their kynges and noble prynces of theyr region and countreys: As one of late dayes that was grome of the chaumber with that renowmed and valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunte Prynce of hyghe memorye, Fraunces the Frenche kynge, whose name I haue forgotten, that dydde translate these tryumphes to that sayde kynge, whyche he toke so thankefully, that he gaue to hym for hys paynes an hundred crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to hym and to his heyres of inheritaunce to enioye to that value in lande for euer, and toke suche pleasure in it, that wheresoeuer he wente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge hys precyous Iewelles, that booke was alwayes caryed with hym for his pastyme to loke vpon, and as muche estemed by hym, as the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest Diamonde he hadde: whiche sayde booke, when I sawe the coppye of it, I thoughte in my mynde, howe I beynge an Englyshe man, myght do aswell as the Frenche man, dyd translate this sayde worke into our maternall tounge, and after much debatyng with my selfe, dyd as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe doth se, translate the sayde booke to that moost worthy kynge our late soueraygne Lorde of perpetuall memorye kynge Henrye theyghte, who as he was a Prynce aboue all other mooste excellente, so toke he the worke verye thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye, merueylynge muche howe I coulde do it, and thynkynge verelye I hadde not doone it, wythoute helpe of some other, better knowynge the Italyan tounge then I: but when he knewe the verye treweth, that I hadde traunslated
<pb facs="4"/>
the worke my selfe, he was more pleased there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with then he was before, and so what his highnes dyd with it, is to me vnknowen, one thynge is, that I dyd it in suche hast, that doubtles in many places (yf it were agayne in my handes) I thynke I coulde well amende it, albeit that I professe, I haue not erred moche from the letter, but in the ryme, whiche is not possible for me to folow in the translation, nor touche the least poynt of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy that this elegant Poete hath set forth in his owne maternall tongue. But as it is, if in the translation there be anye thynge to be amended, or any wyll depraue it, I shall, praye you (mooste noble younge Lorde) the very myrroure of al the yonge noble gentelmen of this realme in vertue, in learnynge, and in all other feates appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to such a Lorde as you be, to defende it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agaynst those that will more by enuy thē by know ledge depraue it, and then I do not feare but those that knowe and can speake the Italian, will beare with the simple translation, and commende the worke, as it is so muche commendable, that it can not be to dere bought, I desyre god noble yonge gentleman, to make the lorde Matrauers an olde gentleman, and then thy worthy father the Earle of Arundell my most speciall good Lorde and frend, shall make an olde Earle and lyue <hi>vsque in senium et senectum.</hi>
