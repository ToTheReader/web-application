   <head>THE PREFACE TO the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the excellencie of S. <hi>AVGVSTINES</hi> Pietie, Vertue, and Learning, we purpose not (Christian Reader) to derogate any thing: nay, we doubt not to preferre him before many others, both ancient and late Prelates. Let the whole List of late Popes, and their purple Cardinals, and Mitred Prelates, be produced, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that holy Father, I suppose he will surpasse them all; neyther doe we doubt, but he is more worthie then manie others, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: yet doth hee not exempt his Writing from other mens iudgement. <hi>Id genus literarum,</hi> sayth he, writing against <hi>Faustus, lib. 11. c. 5. Quae non praecipiendi authoritate, sed proficiendi exercitatione scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buntur a nobis, non cum credendi necessitate, sed cum iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicandi libertate legendum est:</hi> so hee permitteth <hi>others to iudge of his Writings.</hi> Neyther doth he disdaine in the same place, to preferre the Canonicall Bookes of Scripture before them: nor doe wee thinke it any disparagement vnto him, or other Fathers, to haue the Apostles preferred before them, as hee writeth vnto <hi>Hierome, Epist. 19.</hi> There also hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that priuiledge to Scriptures onely, <hi>Not to erre in any thing.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The Apostate doth in diuers places call him <hi>an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Doctor:</hi> yet neuer did S. <hi>Augustine</hi> so thinke of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, nor doe other learned men so esteeme him, but that <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius,
<pb facs="5"/>Gregorie Nazianzene, Chrysostome, Basil, Hierome, Ambrose,</hi> and others, might bee compared with him.</p>
   <p>But the more excellent hee is, the more is our gaine; the lesse the Apostates aduantage. For this I affirme, and I doubt not but to make it good against all the packe of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and not onely against this silly Translator, whose soule is lately turned and translated Popish; First, that S. <hi>AVGVSTINE</hi> neuer beleeued the Popes infallible judgement in matters of Faith, nor his sublime and vniuersall Monarchy ouer the whole Church, nor the Doctrine of the Popes Schooles and Decretals; and secondly, that hee holdeth nothing as a matter of Faith and necessary to bee beleeued, that is contrary to the Articles of Religion publikely professed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>In proofe whereof, that wee may proceed more particularly and punctually, wee shall (God willing) declare in the first Chapter, that S. <hi>AVSTINE</hi> neuer knew eyther the Decrees of <hi>Trent</hi> enacted against vs, or that part of <hi>Romish</hi> Religion which this Church of <hi>England</hi> admitteth not, and which this Apostate and his Consorts hold to bee Catholike. In the second Chapter shall bee demonstrated, that many of these Points of <hi>Romish</hi> Religion which wee reject are also contradicted by S. <hi>AVGVSTINE.</hi> Thirdly, because the Apostate and his Consorts, doe euer and anon challenge to themselues the name of <hi>Catholikes,</hi> wee propose in the third Chapter by Arguments inuincible to conuince them, that they are neyther Catholikes nor hold the true Catholike and Apostolike Faith. The fourth Chapter, shall contayne the examination of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states Title page, and his Epistle dedicatory. In the fift Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Apostates absurd tedious and malicious Preface is scanned and refuted. The sixth Chapter, setteth downe Notes and Animaduersions vpon the Translators idle Aduertisement. Jn the seuenth and last Chapter, the false wicked and absurd Notes of the Translator vpon S. <hi>AVGVSTINES</hi> Text, are refuted and expugned.</p>
   <p>Now how contrary S. <hi>AVGVSTINES</hi> writings are to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, here I will giue a touch in generall. <hi>Non sit nobis
<pb facs="5"/>religio,</hi> sayth hee, <hi>c. 55. de Ver. Relig. in phantasmatibus nostris; Let vs not frame Religion according to our fancies.</hi> But Popish Religion is wholly grounded vpon the Popes fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and fantasticall Decretals.</p>
   <p>In the same Booke and Chapter he sheweth, that true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth tye vs to <hi>one God, that is Almightie.</hi> But Popish Religion doth oblige men to serue Saints and Angels, and to worship many Gods on euery Altar, that haue no power. And againe, <hi>Non sit nobis Religio humanorum operum cultus.</hi> And afterward, <hi>Non sit nobis Religio cultus hominum mortuorum.</hi> And speaking of Angels, he sayth, <hi>Honoramus eos charitate non seruitute nec eis Templa construimus.</hi> So he declareth, that Religion consisteth not in the worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or the workes of mens hands, or in the worship of dead men, or Saints, or in the seruice of Angels; shewing, that then Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were not built in the honor of Angels, or any Seruice giuen to them: all direct contrarie to the practise of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>In ijs quae aperte in Scripturis posita sunt inueniuntur illa omnia quae continent fidem moresque viuendi,</hi> sayth hee, <hi>lib. 3. de Doctr. Christ. c. 9.</hi> So hee holdeth Scriptures to be <hi>both sufficient</hi> and perspicuous in all matters concerning sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And <hi>Lib. de Bon. Viduit. c. 1. Sancta Scriptura nostrae Doctrinae regulam figit, ne audeamus supera plus quam oportet.</hi> All contrarie to the Doctrine of false <hi>Romish</hi> Catholikes, which hold the Scriptures to be obscure and darke, imperfect, and no sufficient Rule, without Traditions.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Disp. 2. contr. Fortunat. After that man sinned by Free-will, wee were cast headlong into a necessitie of sinning.</hi> And <hi>Enchirid. ad Laurent. c. 30. Man, ill vsing Free-will, lost both himselfe and it.</hi> But false Catholikes denie that it is so lost, but that we may freely doe well.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Lib. 4. contr. Iulian.</hi> he denyeth, that Infidels can doe works pleasing to God: which Papists admit not.</p>
   <p>In his Booke <hi>de Vnit. Eccles. c. 1.</hi> he acknowledgeth <hi>no Head of the Church but CHRIST IESVS, the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="6"/>Sonne of the liuing God, who is also the Sauior of his Body.</hi> False Catholikes make the Pope to be the Head of the Church.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Omnes homines sub Lege constitutos reos facit Lex,</hi> sayth S. <hi>Austine.</hi> But false Papists seeke for iustification by the Law.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Iustitia nostra quamvis vera sit, tamen tanta est in hac vita, vt potius peccatorum remissione constet, quam perfectione virtutum,</hi> sayth S. <hi>Augustine, lib. 19. de Ciuit. Dei, c. 27.</hi> He sayth, <hi>Our iustice standeth in remission or sinnes,</hi> and <hi>not in the perfection of vertue:</hi> The Papists teach contrarie.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Lib. 2. contr. Epist. Parmen. c. 8.</hi> he denyeth, that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or other Apostles, are our Mediators. And againe, <hi>Pro quo nullus interpellat sed ipso pro omnibus hic vnus verusque Mediator est.</hi> But this Apostate, and his Consorts, vse the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of Angels, and Saints.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Cum</hi> Petro <hi>dicitur ad omnes dicitur, pasce Oues meus,</hi> sayth S. <hi>Austine, de Agon. Christ. c. 30.</hi> Papists contrarie beleeue, that these words doe properly belong to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Pope.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>When it was sayd to</hi> Peter, <hi>I will giue thee the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen, the Church Vniuersall was sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,</hi> sayth S. <hi>Austine, Tract. 124. in loan.</hi> The Apostate contrarie restraineth this to the Pope.</p>
   <p>S. <hi>Austine</hi> in <hi>Epist. ad lanuar. 118. &amp; Lib. 3. de Doctr. Christ. c. 9.</hi> mentioneth onely two Sacraments, which our Church alloweth: False Catholikes adde other fiue, and hold, they iustifie <hi>ex opere operato;</hi> which was a Doctrine neuer knowne by S. <hi>Augustine.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Lib. de Fid. ad Petrum, c. 19.</hi> he sayth, <hi>The Church cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not to offer the Sacrifice of Bread and Wine, wherein there is action of Graces, and a commemoration of Christs Flesh, which he gaue for vs, and of his Bloud, which he shed for vs.</hi> Contrariwise, the Apostate and his fellowes denie, that Bread and Wine are effered, and suppose, that his Flesh and Bloud is really offered for vs in the Eucharist.</p>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <p>
      <hi>Tract. 30. in Ioan.</hi> S. <hi>Austine</hi> sayth, that Christs Body, in which he rose againe, must be in one place. And <hi>Serm. 53. de Verb. Dom. Christus caput nostrum sursum in coelis est.</hi> The Aduersaeries of Truth say he is here below on euerie Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and beleeue, that the Pope is the Head of the Church.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Tractat. 26. in Ioan. &amp; in Psal. 77.</hi> he sayth, that <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Old and New Testament are equall in the thing that is signified, though diuers in signes:</hi> Which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the carnall reaell presence of Christs Body and Bloud, vnder the accidents of Bread and Wine, in the Sacrament.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>De morib. Eccles. Cath. lib. 1. c. 3.</hi> S. <hi>Austine</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth such as <hi>worship Sepulchres and Pictures. Et de Fid. &amp; Symb. c. 7. Tale simulachrum Deo nefas est Christiano in Templo collorari,</hi> sayth he, condemning the making of the Image of God, and placing it in Churches. In his Booke <hi>de Haeres.</hi> he sheweth, that the <hi>Simonians</hi> &amp; <hi>Carpocratians</hi> were reputed Heretikes: yet the worship of Images and Saints Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques is reputed no small part of the <hi>Romish</hi> Faith.</p>
   <p>In his <hi>6.</hi> Booke of <hi>Confessions, c. 5.</hi> hee sheweth, that God perswadeth vs to beleeue Scriptures, condemning such as aske, how wee know that <hi>the Scriptures were deliuered to men by the ministration of the holy Ghost.</hi> But false and counterfeit Christians, and this Apostate, doe make this question commonly, and beleeue not Scriptures, without Tradition.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Quid mihi est cum hominibus vt ipsi confessiones meas audiant,</hi> sayth S. <hi>Austine, lib. 10. Confess. c. 2.</hi> But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state and his Apostaticall Consorts thinke it a matter necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to confesse, and reckon vp all sinnes, and the circumstances thereof, making Confession a necessarie ingredient of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance.</p>
   <p>Finally, it were an easie matter to shew, that S. <hi>AVGV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STINE</hi> doth discord with the Papists in all those Points wherein they differ from vs; but this may serue for a tasse in the interim, vntill we discourse hereof more particularly in the second Chapter of the Treatise following. Now this is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to shew the falsitie and pouertie of the Translator, and
<pb facs="7"/>his Notes and Obsernations vpon S. <hi>AVSTINES Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,</hi> wherein most simply and weakely hee endeuoureth to make that worthie Father of his partie. <hi>Quid est egere,</hi> sayth S. <hi>AVSTINE, de Vit. Beat.</hi> And he answereth, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiam non habere.</hi> And againe he sayth. <hi>Nihil est aliud habere egestatem quam habere stultitiam.</hi> So that by Saint <hi>AVSTINES</hi> iudgement, this man being void of Wisdome, and full of Foolerie, is but a poore Translator, wracking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vpon S. <hi>AVSTINE,</hi> vpon whom he meant to lay the ground of his foolish and vaine Religion. Therein also we may percciue how vainely our Aduersaries boast of Fathers, and especially of S. <hi>AVGVSTINE,</hi> who in all important mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith are directly opposite vnto them. But lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all further preambular speeches, we will now begin to handle such matters, as the rinegned Translator doth principaelly insist vpon.</p>
