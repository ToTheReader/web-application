   <head>Pseudoepiscopomastix. THE PRINTER TO
THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>FTER that the iust copie of this
Recantation, good Reader, came
sundrie times to my handes in
writt, I wes moued at last, for the
great benefite of many, to put it in
print, as a worthie monument of Gods mercie
towarde his Church, in iustifying the righteous
cause thereof, and in condamning the crooked
course of all sortes of adversaries, and that so
plainelie and mightilie, that it can not be denied
bot to be done by the verie fingar of <hi>GOD</hi> him
selfe, and not by the witte or policie of man.
For howsoeuer some euill affected persones, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versareis
to Christian Discipline, surmise this
Recantation to haue bene craftelie procured, or
rather violentlie inforced by the policie of the
contrarie partie (as they speake) yet the credite
of the worshipfull and faithfull witnesses, yet
aliue, that testifie the trueth hereof by their
hande-writtes and subscriptions, according as
the thing with the haill circumstances thereof
wes done in their sight and hearing, as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="3"/>
truely is set downe, plainlie proueth the work
to be of God, and not of man. Which thing as it
ought to mooue the godlie to an earnest thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing,
for so rare &amp; great a benefite: so it should
worthilie terrifie the adversareis of all sortes,
from further striuing against the trueth of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Discipline, no lesse iustified here by their
owne mouth, as it were, then wes Davids inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
by the mouth of Saul, when he saide: Is
this thy voyce, my sonne David: Thou art more
righteous then I: whiche more cleared Dauid,
and condemned Saul, then if either David him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
or any of his friendes or fellowes, by worde
or writt had taken vpon them to make his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.
For this recanter wes no meane adversary
to true Discipline, or one of the cōmon sorte, but
a chiefe Ringleader, &amp; one that as in style moū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the hiest Antichristian (if not heathenish
after the maner of Flamine and Archiflamine)
digniteis in Scotlande: so in will, diligence and
all industrie negotiating against trew reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
none either did or wes able to matche him.
Whose extorted and cōstrained confession by the
hand of God, though volūtarie in regard of mē,
as wrasted out of the mouth of one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in name of all the rest, should worthily moue
all of his coate and complices, to kicke no more
against prickes, least otherwise continuing with
<pb facs="3"/>
Saul in persecuting David, against their owne
consciences, they be brought (in Gods righteous
iudgement) at last to some tragicall and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
end in this life, and to eternall torments in
the world to come: which is spokē not so much in
regard of such graue and learned fathers, as not
of ambition, but through the iniurie of the time,
for holding out euill persons from those digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
who would make hauoke of the Church, &amp;
for staying the furie of the storme of persecution
of the brethren, which otherwise no doubt would
ensewe, are cotented (being called) for the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the Church to accept for an interim and
time, till God send further reformation, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
and monstruously mangled Ministrie of
thinges that otherwise are meere <hi>asustata,</hi> as
we say, and not competent in one person, to witt,
a cōtemptible ministeriall seruice, making men
to be compted the ofscourings of the world, and
a lordlie pompeous gouernement like to that of
the nations plainlie forbidden by Christ in these
words, <hi>vos autem non sic,</hi> but ʒe shall not be so:
To these men I say, who wilbe readie vppon all
occasions, to farder reformation, the former
threatnings apperteineth not so much as to the
malitious persecutours of the true Ministrie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of fathers of the Church, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of their ambition.</p>
