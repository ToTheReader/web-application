                 <title>The Christians sacrifice : much better then all the legall sacrifices of the Iewes; and without the which, all the said legall sacrifices of the Iewes, euen when they were in force, were not acceptable to God. Or, a logicall and theologicall exposition of the two first verses of the twelfth to the Romanes, with all the doctrine in the said two verses, plainly laid forth, and fitly applied according as these times do require the same. Wherein also besides the orthodoxall exposition of the said words, diuers other places of Scripture by the way occurring, before somewhat obscure, are so naturally interpreted, as that the iudicious reader shall thinke his paines well bestowed in vouchsafing to reade this treatise following. With the authors postscript to his children, as it were his last will and testament vnto them</title>

Hauing therefore nothing else whereby to expresse my duety to your Honours, I am bold to present such as I haue, the rather, because as I dedicated the first fruits of my like labour to my old most Honorable Lord before mentioned, about
<pb facs="3"/> some 24. yeares past, euen before I was throughly knowne vnto him, and that because of his most <hi>Christiā care</hi> for the churches of God in <hi>Essex</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was Patron, so I thought I might the more presume of your Honorable acceptance of these my paines, the rather because in respect of my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold infirmities by age, they may be my last. The more also that God himselfe hath now honored your Noble house, and made it renowned in the Church, both by the profession of the Gospell, and also by the protection of the professors thereof, euen now to the third generation of your name, the more my selfe and all other that loue the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell haue cause to honor you: euen as the more any king aduanceth any subiect, the more all other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects ought to respect such a subiect for his kings sake, yea we haue the more cause to pray also for your honors, so to continue still your honoring of the Lord, and of the Gospell most worthy of honor, as you haue begun, that your selues and your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie may yet be the more honored: yea, and this as a Minister of the Gospell I exhort you in the name of the Lord Iesus, that shewed me mercie in making me a Minister, that you continue so much the more so to do, by how much the more enemies the Gospell dayly hath, both of A theists and of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall professors thereof, and also and especially of papists: not onely in other countries but euen in our owne: and those euen of your owne rancke: I meane of the nobilitie it selfe: besides them of the gentry and other inferiours at the commaund of such superiours. Herein if ye shall ouercome (as I
<pb facs="4"/> doubt not but that ye shall) oh how great shall your honor then be. One of you two now do sometime weare a coronet with other the like princes, and do sit in <hi>Parliament</hi> with one of the <hi>Lords Cheife Kings and Iudges of the earth.</hi> But the time shall come, when <hi>the Lord Iesus, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</hi>

      </gap>ly loue, that <hi>he needed not to write vnto them thereof, because they were taught</hi> (inwardly) <hi>of God, to loue one another, and so indeed did,</hi> yet for all that exhorted them more and more<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 10. 11.</note>
      <hi>to abound in so doing:</hi> and as the Apostle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> hauing said that <hi>God was not vnrighteous that he should forget the worke and labour of their loue, which they had shewed to his name in hauing ministered to the Saints, and yet ministring,</hi> doth for all that desire euery one of them <hi>to shew the same deligence to the full assurance of hope to the end,</hi> so do I (Right Honorable) exhort you to do the like for the aduancing of the Gospell, and the countenancing and comforting of the professors, especially the sincere and painefull Ministers thereof euen to the end: that your present comfort from consideration &amp; hope of the former
<pb facs="4"/> glorie promised, may be the more inlarged in you. And verily ye haue the more need so to doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the enemies of the Gospell doe not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and swarme, but also they thinke they doe God best seruice that doe most persecute it, and the<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 1. 2.</note> professors &amp; Ministers therof, even to death it selfe. But hereof the Lord Iesus hath told vs before, that when it should come to passe we might not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended neither meruaile at it. Heereby also all that loue the Gospell may be the better assured that they<note place="margin">Ioh. 15▪ 19. Phil. 1. 28.</note>
      <hi>are not of the world but of God.</hi> This to such aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is a most sure token of perdition, <hi>but to them that are so persecuted of saluation,</hi> Finally, this plainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth that religion that is so bloudy and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse<note place="margin">Iam. 3. 15. 17.</note> to be the wisedome that is <hi>earthly, sensuall and deuilish; because that that is from aboue is pure, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, gentle, easie to be intreated, full of mercy.</hi> Lastly heereby therefore all men may be the more encou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raged to put forth their hands for the vpholding of the Gospell heere professed by vs, and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors and Ministers thereof, as likewise to do what els they can and may for the opposing, oppugning, and ouerthrow of poperie, and of the champions thereof: as whose cheife weapons for vpholding their abominations, are slaundering of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, crueltie, and treacherie, all which the Prophet<note place="margin">Psal. 5. 6.</note> saith <hi>the Lord abhorreth.</hi> If there were nothing else to condemne papists and to discouer them to be of<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> the deuill, who <hi>hath bin a murderer and a lyer from the beginning,</hi> these onely were sufficient. And there fore these should the more prouoke all <hi>that loue the Lord Iesus</hi> to set themselues against <hi>Rome</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Psal. 137. 8.</note>
      <pb facs="5"/> of <hi>New Babilon, and to reward her as she hath serued others.</hi> The rather because she shall as certainly fall, as old <hi>Babilon</hi> is long since fallen. Yea, I doubt not<note place="margin">Reu. 18. 3.</note> also, but that some yet striuing tooth and naile to support her, shall at the last, and ere it be long, either in the sight of the truth, or in the loue of her riches be principall agents in her destruction. <hi>He that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth</hi>

      <hi>for bloud,</hi> and that daily bringeth to light the most secret murthers that are, and causeth such mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers bloud to be shed, and in iustice to be spilt on the ground, will at the last much more be reuenged of that <hi>Roman Antichristian</hi> bloudy and trecherous brood, that hath betrayed and murthered, and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth betray and murther so many thousands and millions of his <hi>Saints, whose death is most deare and</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 116. 15.</note>
      <hi>precious in his sight.</hi> The greater any are the forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der should they be in repressing this generation, <hi>Whose teeth are as swordes, and whose iaw teeth are as</hi>
      <note place="margin">Pro. 30. 12.</note>
      <hi>kniues to deuoure the poore of the earth, and yet are pure in their owne eyes.</hi> To behold one to murther ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not to resist the murtherer what may be, is (as I heare) by our law, and as I am sure by the Law of God to be an acter in shedding of bloud.</p>
   <p>How much more are they to be oppugned that liue by the bloud and death of other. <hi>Curse ye Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roz (said the Angel of the Lord) curse ye bitterly the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iudg. 5. 23.</note>
      <hi>thereof, because they came not to the helpe of the Lord, to the helpe of the Lord against the mightie.</hi> If they be <hi>cursed that came not to helpe the Lord</hi> (or that came not to helpe when the Lord helpeth) in such a case, and that against the mightie, how shall they escape that come themselues forth, against the
<pb facs="5"/> Lord, and against his people, and yet for all that say they are for the Lord, and that themselues onely are his people? <hi>As they that are blessed of the Lord shall be</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 33. Num. 23. 8. vers. 19.</note>
      <hi>blessed: so they that are cursed of the Lord shall be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Hath the Lord said and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good?</hi> In this respect therefore as all men should be the more ready to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne that man of sinne, and to helpe them whom he persecuteth, so especially they ought to feare the putting their hand or little finger, in the least degree to ayd him, and to vphold and repaire his state so long since decaied, and begun to fall. If <hi>Ioshua cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>

      <hi>before the Lord the man that should rise vp, and build Iericho,</hi> which notwithstanding we neuer reade to haue bin a bloudie Cittie, how much more may all they looke for a curse that rise vp to support <hi>Rome,</hi> that alwayes not so much before as since it hath beene the seate of <hi>Antichrist</hi> (I meane of the Pope) hath bin a most bloudy Cittie, and hath mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more men, women and children, (of the Saints and of other) then euer had dwelt in <hi>Ierecho</hi> before the said curse of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> from the first founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof to the time of <hi>Ioshua?</hi> The bloud of one <hi>Abel</hi> cryed to the Lord from the earth for such<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 11. &amp;c.</note> vengeance that the Lord so cursed the earth, and <hi>Caine</hi> himselfe for shedding the same, that <hi>he being made a fugitiue and vagabond vpon the earth cryed out vnto the Lord and said, My punishment is greater then I can beare.</hi> Oh then how lowd is the cry of the bloud of so many thousands as that <hi>man of sinne hath shed and dayly doth shed?</hi> Verily, as he hath a long time shewed himselfe to <hi>be the man of sinne,</hi> so all<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 3.</note>
      <pb facs="6"/> men shall shortly see him to <hi>be also the child of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The longer the Lord hath suffered him to rage and reigne, and to exalt himselfe <hi>aboue all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God &amp;c, and to sit in the Temple of God, and to shew himselfe as God,</hi> presumptuously forgiuing sinnes, dispensing with sinnes, casting downe to hell those whom God hath prepared for heauen, aduancing them to heauen, and canonizing them for Saints, that were traitores and rebells heere in earth against Princes, <hi>and so speaking great thinges, and blasphemies,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Reu. 13. 5. 6. &amp; 17. 3.</note>
      <hi>yea being full of blasphemies,</hi> the longer (I say) the Lord suffereth him thus to do, the greater certainly, and that speedily will be his condemnation. This is so much the more manifest, by how much the more now he rageth and stormeth as a man hauing the panges of death vpon him. The deuill himselfe rageth the more, and did the more rent and teare<note place="margin">Mark. 9. 20.</note> the child possessed with him, by how much the nearer he saw his eiection to be; yea when Christ charged him to come out of him, and to <hi>enter no more into him,</hi> euen then did he rent him sore, <hi>and</hi>
      <note place="margin">vers. 25. vers. 26.</note>
      <hi>laid him for dead, so that many said he was dead. Pharao</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Aegiptians,</hi> notwithstanding all the great signes &amp; wonders the Lord had wrought amongst them, did then most cruelly oppresse the <hi>Israelites</hi> when the Lord was neerest to deliuer them, and to ouerthrow the said <hi>Pharao</hi> and all his hoast in the red sea. As therefore <hi>Moses</hi> said to the <hi>Israelites</hi> greatly fearing and murmuring, when<note place="margin">Exod. 14. 13.</note> they saw <hi>Pharaoh</hi> following them behind, hard at the heeles, and the <hi>red sea before them, Feare ye not, stand still, and see the saluation of the Lord; for the
<pb facs="6"/> Aegiptians whom ye haue seene ye shall neuer see againe,</hi> so may I and all other the Lords Ministers say to all the Lordes people now fearing because of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> present raging, and preuailed against the <hi>Churches, Feare not, stand still, and see the Saluation of the Lord. For the time</hi> cannot be far off when this<note place="margin">Reu. 17. 16. and 18. 18.</note> great <hi>Whore</hi> of <hi>Rome shalbe iudged and burnt with fire, and her Cittie laid wast and desolate.</hi> Then shall all her friends howle and cry as bitterly, as euer they mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily reioyced and tryumphed and much more then euer they made the Lords people to weepe and mourne. As therefore Right Honorable, you are wise, iudiciously to consider of these things: as you are godly to helpe the Lords people against the mightie by your daily praiers, for performance of his promises in confounding his said mightie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, and doing to them as sometimes he did to <hi>Midian,</hi> and <hi>Sisera,</hi> and <hi>Iabin,</hi> and to other his<note place="margin">Psal. 83. 9.</note> old enemies, so be you also strong in the <hi>Lord, and in</hi>

      <hi>the power of his might, to do whatsoeuer you now may</hi> or shall hereafter be able to do, by your selues, or by your acquaintance of like place and honor with your selues: yea also, with all such as ouer whom you shall haue any authoritie from his most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Maiestie. Too much is knowne to be done for the said enemies of the Lord, euen by the papists heere at home, and much more is done then is knowne. Shall therefore such friends of the Lord as your Honors are, doe little for him, and for his people▪ <hi>God forbid.</hi> As therefore the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 24.</note> the <hi>Hebrewes to consider one another &amp; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vnto loue and to good workes</hi> in generall, so I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
<pb facs="7"/> you <hi>to suffer the wordes of exhortation</hi> to do the like in this speciall against that <hi>Belzebub</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all his deuouted and sworne friends: that by your noble examples, all other may be the more prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to doe the like also.

Hate them, hate them with perfect hatred.

You haue most worthily begun. Since also your<note place="margin">Cal. 5. 7.</note> beginning, you and your noble ancestors haue run well. Let nothing hinder your obedience to the truth vnto the end.

<pb facs="7"/> excellent Maiestie, for the helpeing of other Churches abroad, against the furie of their <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Roman</hi> aduersaries, and for the repressing of Iesuites, Seminarie Priests and other obstinate &amp; traiterous harted Papists at home, It may be (I say) that you with other may speake <hi>a word</hi> in such sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that shalbe <hi>as apples of gold in pictures of siluer:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Pro. 25. 11.</note> both for the greater glory of God and also for the better comfort of the Churches, and the like safetie of his Maiestie himselfe, of his Royall posteritie, and of all his kingdomes.

      <hi>the Lord negligently, and kept backe his sword from bloud: so shall all Princes and other most certainly be blessed, that in these distresses of the churches shalbe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull (according to the mercie of God, whereby</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues haue bin aduanced) <hi>for they shall obtaine</hi>

   <p>As hitherto Right Honorable I haue directed my speech to both your Honors ioyntly, so giue me leaue now to conuert my selfe to you my yong Lord more especially; whom before in the inscription of this myepistle dedicatorie I haue mentioned. And so much the more do I presume thus to do because you are not nobly desended onely according to the flesh, but also because you come of a stocke as noble for religion and the profession of the Gospell. For of my knowledge you are now the fourth of that Honorable house in a right line that haue bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned in the Churches for profession of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, and fauour vnto the professiors and Ministers
<pb facs="8"/> thereof. Your Honorable great Grand-father main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his house learned Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> afterward called from thence to be Preacher at <hi>Ispwich</hi> in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke:</hi> &amp; then from thence remoued to <hi>Dinnington,</hi> where yet (I hope) he remaineth, a graue reuerend and vigilant pastour. My selfe also once being at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> about some 43 yeares past, when Doct. <hi>Some</hi> was to preach before most renowned Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of most blessed memorie, did there see your said Noble great Grand-father, in his humilitie to be as carefull (yea also painefull) to see all things in pulpit to be fit for him, as if he had beene some inferour officer in the chappell to haue looked vnto such things. Of your late Noble Grand-father the memoriall was and is most sweet and precious, and will neuer die. Of your most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Father I haue said ynough before in this my epistle dedicatorie to him and your selfe. Heere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so may not be forgotten the most virtuous and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Countesse and Ladie your Mother, of pietie and modestie a most worthy patterne to all other Noble women of like sort.</p>
   <p>How good also is the Lord vnto you in your christian education and instruction vnder Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> the godly and painefull pastour of <hi>Braintree,</hi> as it were <hi>at the feete of Gamaliel?</hi> In which respect it<note place="margin">Act. 22. 3.</note> may be said of you as <hi>Paul</hi> writeth of <hi>Timothie, that</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 14. 15</note>
      <hi>you from your childhood haue learned and knowne the holy Scripture.</hi> Therefore also all that know these things may the better hope the like of you, that <hi>Paul</hi> testifieth of <hi>Timothie</hi> touching the faith of his Grand-mother and Mother, yea in a degree higher
<pb facs="8"/> viz <hi>that the faith which dwelt first in your</hi> Honorable<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 5.</note> great Grand-father: secondly in your Grand-father, thirdly both in your Noble Father and Mother <hi>dwelleth also in you.</hi> All these things considered I may well say, that you are not onely Nobly discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but also Royally euen of the bloud Royall of heauen, of God himselfe. So also you are a greater heire then of an earthly Earledome, euen of the<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> Kingdome of heauen: and heire together with <hi>Christ Iesus of an heauenly inheritance, immortall &amp;c.</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 4.</note> And for your preseruation vnto this inheritance, the Angels not onely pitch their tents <hi>round about</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 34 7. Ioh. 10. 28. 1. Pet. 1. 5. Psal. 5. 13.</note>
      <hi>you, but God himselfe also guardeth you with his power, and compasseth you about with his fauour.</hi> God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being greater then all, you may no more doubt of your preseruation to the foresaid heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance and Kingdome, then you may doubt of the power of God. As you are heire apparant to an Earle, and may hereafter be an Earle, you haue men to attend vpon you: but as you are such as before I said, you haue the glorious Angels of heauen to waite on you, <hi>and to beare you in their hands &amp;c.</hi> In the<note place="margin">Psal. 91. 11. 12.</note> resurrection you shall not onely be as the <hi>Angels of</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 30.</note>
      <hi>God in heauen, but you shall be also like vnto Christ Iesus himselfe: being where Christ Iesus is, and beholding the glorie of God &amp;c.</hi> O Right Honorable, were <hi>Peter Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> so rauished with the sight of Christ<note place="margin">Mat. 17. 4.</note> Iesus his transfiguration onely for a time, that they prayed him they might neuer depart from that mountaine wher they saw him so trāsfigured: How therefore ought your Noble heart to be rauished with the certaintie of the euerlasting promises?
<pb facs="9"/> Therefore also reioyce more in these things, then in all your earthly honors whatsoeuer. And as the Lord hath thus highly honored you, so labour you (I beseech you) to honor him accordingly: not so much considering what benefits <hi>you haue receiued from him</hi> for this life, and for the life to come, as deliberating with your selfe <hi>what to render vnto him</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 116. 12. Luk. 12. 40.</note> in behalfe of them. <hi>Vnto whom much is giuen, of him much is required.</hi> So shall you indeed present your selfe such a sacrifice as in the treatise following you shall see the said mercies of God to bind you vnto. The same that <hi>Dauid</hi> said to <hi>Salomon, know the God</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Chron. 28. 9.</note>
      <hi>of thy Fathers, and serue him with a perfect heart &amp;c. Euen the same</hi> I beseech you to consider to belong vnto you. So shall you be sure of that that <hi>Azariah</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Chron. 15. 2.</note> said to <hi>Asa,</hi> namely that the Lord will be <hi>with you, while you be with him &amp;c.</hi> As you are <hi>one of the sonnes</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 29. 2.</note>
      <hi>of the mightie,</hi> so <hi>giue vnto the Lord glorie and strength: yea the glorie that is due vnto his name.</hi> He that onely<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 7. 8.</note> aduanceth <hi>whom it pleaseth him, can also bring low them whom before he hath aduanced.</hi> As young as you<note place="margin">Psal. 113. 7.</note> are, you haue seene meane persons aduanced to great honor: and Noble Houses brought to deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Let not your tender yeares preiudice your consideration of these things. For in this treatise you shall afterward see, that men may too long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the sacrificing of themselues vnto God, but they cannot begin to soone. And indeed what sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect can begin too soone to serue such a soueraigne as will entertaine him into any speciall seruice? That you may so do, beware (I beseech you) of flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: beware of euill councell to the contrarie: both
<pb facs="9"/> of superiours and also of equals. <hi>Let the testimonies</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 24.</note>
      <hi>of the Lord be your delight, let them be your counsellors.</hi> yea persons also of such emminencie haue neede likewise to beware of seruants. For euen such some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doe more preuaile by euill suggestions, then the grauest learnedst and godliest diuines can do by their best instructions. Notwithstanding as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, <hi>I am perswaded better things of your</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor:<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 9.</note> and such as beseeme all Christian wisedome: viz that you will continue according to your begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: growing <hi>like a Cedar in Lebanon, flourishing like</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 92. 12. 13.</note>
      <hi>a palme tree in the Courtes of God; bringing forth fruit in your old age: and being then (in your inward man) fat andin good liking.</hi> Therefore to conclude with the wordes of <hi>Peter,</hi> as your Lordship shall grow in age, strength, stature and outward comelinesse of person, so I beseech you all so to endeauour <hi>to grow</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3. 18.</note>
      <hi>in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To speake againe ioynctly to both your Honors, although my labours following be not worthy to be presented to such Honorable persons, yet as God himselfe towards the building of his Tabernacle, as well accepted the small gifts of the poore sort, viz <hi>goates haire, red skinnes of Rames, and badgers skinnes</hi>
      <note place="margin">Exod. 35. 22. 23</note>
      <hi>&amp;c,</hi> as he did of <hi>the braccletts and earerings, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bletts, and other Ieweles of gold, offred by the Princes, and other the richest sort of</hi> the <hi>Israelites,</hi> so I do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly craue the like acceptance of this my poore trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise in my old and poore state presented vnto your Honors in testimonie of my thankefull minde for those fauours I receiued long since of that most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Earle late deceased, and now <hi>in heauen resting
<pb facs="10"/> from all his labours, and enioying the fruite of all his</hi>
      <note place="margin">Reu. 14. 13.</note>
      <hi>workes.</hi> Indeede Right Honorable, my thankefull minde for the said favours required, the later I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent these my labours unto you, the more exact in all reason they should haue bin, because as every <hi>Grammer scholler</hi> hath learned, that <hi>Gratia ab officio qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>Beneficia crescunt mora, tantò{que} plus solvendum quantò tardiús. Ingratus est qui beneficium reddit sine usura.</hi> Whereunto agree the wordes of <hi>Tullie, Terra nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam sine usura reddit quod accepit, sed alias minore,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cicero. de senectute.</note>
      <hi>plerun{que} maiore cum faenore:</hi> and elsewhere, <hi>Beneficio provocati imitari debemus agros fertiles, qui maltò plus</hi>
      <note place="margin">De offic. lib. 1.</note>
      <hi>afferunt quam acceperint.</hi> And as in the beginning of this my Epistle, by some divine examples, I shewed that the kindnes of Ancestors is to be remembred to their posteritie, so <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassaeus</hi> by the light of nature speaking of a worthy <hi>Romane,</hi> saith, <hi>Quamdiu ipse vixit, illinos decuit pro beneficijs habere graciam Nunc verò postquam fato functus est, posteris</hi>
      <note place="margin">Dionisi Halicar. lib. 4.</note>
      <hi>cius referenda est: ne videaminicum corporibus simul defodere beneficiorum memoriam.</hi> These things I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge so much the more to oblige me vnto both your Honors in respect of the honorable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors of the late most Noble Earle vnto me; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding as <hi>Tullie</hi> againe saith, <hi>Malui me tibi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere</hi>
      <note place="margin">Philipie. 2.</note>
      <hi>consiteri, quam cuiquam minus prudenti non satis gratus videri,</hi> so say I to your Honors, I had rather acknowledge my selfe to owe to you more dutie (being as I am) then to any that cannot well iudge seeme not at all to be thankefull. For although ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former wordes of <hi>Seneca</hi> benefits doe
<pb facs="10"/> require so much the greater thankes by how much the late: they are performed, yet according also to other words of the same <hi>Seneca,</hi> in the same epistle <hi>Beneficium non quantum sit, sed a quali profectam ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo perpenditur,</hi> I doe likewise hope that your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors will not so much regard this my gift it selfe, as esteeme of the mind where with I present the same. In hope whereof, as likewise of your pardon both of my boldnes in dedicating the same vnto you, and also of my tediousnes in this my epistle, I now being going <hi>the way of all the earth,</hi> as <hi>Ioshua</hi> said to the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iosh. 23. 14.</note> and <hi>Dauid</hi> to <hi>Salomon,</hi> and being ready to be<note place="margin">1. Kin. 22. Philtpi 1. 23. 2.
