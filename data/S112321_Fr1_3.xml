      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O all beneficiall Christians, vvho loue and practise goodnesse and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to the relieuing of their poore and distressed brethren; and to all that do receiue the holy and Christian benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of their good &amp; mercifull relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, in anie time of their need:</p>
   <p>For a token of thankes to the one, and for an admonition and spurre of thankefulnesse to the other, with all dutifull and heartie desire, that through the blessing of our bounteous good God, it may be a helpefull incouragement to all, for continuance and increase in all well-doing: R. A. a Minister of the holie Word and Gospell of our Lord Iesus Christ, as one greatly indebted to all, offereth this poore mite; which, as touching this shot and recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is euen all which for the present he hath.</p>
   <p>Crauing herewithall, that (seeing by the goodnes of God there is first a vvilling mind) it may be accepted according to that he hath, and not preiudiced for any want of that which he hath not, according to the priuiledged rule of the Apostle Paule, 2. Cor. 8.12. the equitie whereof, as well agreeth to thankefulnesse for benefites as to beneficence it selfe. Crauing furthermore no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reward, then the benefite of your faithfull prayers, that he
<pb facs="7"/> together with your selues, may haue all meete and conuenient sufficiencie in all things, and abound in euery good worke, through the rich grace of God mightily abounding toward vs all, euen for our Lord Iesus Christs sake: who, though he was most rich, yet willingly became most poore, that through his pouertie all of vs might be made rich. To him therefore with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the holy Ghost, one onely true God, be all praise, honour, and glorie, for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
