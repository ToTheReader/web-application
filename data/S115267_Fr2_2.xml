Therfore (my deare &amp; welbeloued Christians, which professe the Gospell) to the intent that you should liue therin, according to your profession and knowledge: I haue here breefely and plaincly set forth what it is, and how you ought to leade your lyues therin, accordinge to the Rules of the holy Scriptures, so that your pure and godly lyfe may bee a good example, and also make such ashamed as would sclaunder the holy Gospell, and professours of the same: yea, and that their wonted worde (which is, marke these new men by their lyuinge) may sound to Gods glory, to the honour of his most holy worde, and praise of al them in Christ, which do professe the same.
