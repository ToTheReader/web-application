   <p>THese promises I have observed: many more there bee of most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent use, but because they need opening for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of them, I would not set them downe, lest through the shallownesse of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding I should wrong the precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises: but I picked out the most plaine, and those that I found of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall use for Soule and Body, which I have found much good by, for the promises are our Legacies bequeathed to us in the will of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="137"/>&amp; wee are to claime them, as wee stand in need of any of them: and surely that God which would not have children wronged in that which is bequeathed to them in the will of their fathers, much lesse will he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that which his Son hath bequeathed to us in his last will, which he sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with his blood. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us sue for them, for the saith, hee will bee sought to, to performe them to us. And when thou applyest any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, seeke unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and labour to keepe it, and doubt not
<pb facs="137"/>of the performance of what is promised, for he is both able and faithfull that hath promised.</p>
