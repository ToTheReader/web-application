   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>GOod courteous Reader, be thou young or old,</l>
      <l>Here giue me leaue to make a little bold.</l>
      <l>To shew to thee my want of learning here,</l>
      <l>Which after will in euery verse appeare,</l>
      <l>I am well knowne no Scholler for to be,</l>
      <l>Therefore marks well what I shall say to thee,</l>
      <l>A foot-man may more easilier goe a mile,</l>
      <l>Then a lame cripple may ouer a stile.</l>
      <l>A Scholler might a thing of farre more worth,</l>
      <l>With much lesse labour very well set forth,</l>
      <l>For had this by a Scholler beene set forth,</l>
      <l>It surely would haue beene of lesser worth,</l>
      <l>For he that wealthy is must liberally</l>
      <l>Contribute to the poores necessity.</l>
      <l>I seeing those that wealthy were and rich.</l>
      <l>Into the treasury did cast in much,</l>
      <l>I my one mite, like to the widow poore,</l>
      <l>Likewise cast in euen all I had in store,</l>
      <l>For had I wit and learning as haue many,</l>
      <l>I would as bountifull haue beene as any,</l>
      <l>Though learning euer did prohibit me,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="3"/>
One of her Schollars in her schoole to bee.</l>
      <l>Yet common reason doth to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>e declare,</l>
      <l>All they that worke, not master builders are,</l>
      <l>For some must carry water and some stones,</l>
      <l>And some fill vp the midst with shells and bones:</l>
      <l>And some must carry morter, and some other lime,</l>
      <l>And some must tend the tooles all dinner time,</l>
      <l>And in the euening safely them vp lay,</l>
      <l>That in the morning nought bee wanting may.</l>
      <l>If I accounted like the worst of these</l>
      <l>Shall bee, it will mee both content and please:</l>
      <l>And I to thee will further promise make,</l>
      <l>To quit thy loue some greater paines Ile take:</l>
      <l>I will omit no opportunity,</l>
      <l>Vntill some better shall bee made mee by,</l>
      <l>That what is wanting both in art and skill,</l>
      <l>May bee supplide in kindnesse and good will:</l>
      <l>What's here defectiue Ile no way defend it,</l>
      <l>But hee that can Ile giue free leaue to mend it:</l>
      <l>I hast till I the matter shall you tell,</l>
      <l>And for this time thrice heartily farewell.</l>
      <l>Though Poetry my lines may seeme to shame,</l>
      <l>Yet truly <hi>William Painter</hi> is my name.</l>
