                 <title>The tell-troth's reqvitall, or, Truth's recompence : as it was preached the 12th day of November, 1626, at Eckington: wherein are contained these three propositions, (vindicating Paul from the aspersion of enmity, and laying it on the Galatians,) viz. 1 No grace of God in man can secure him from the enmity of the unregenerate. 2 Sometimes a ministers owne hearers are set in variance against him. 3 The publication of the truth is the cause of this variance. By Samuel Kenrick student in divinity, and preacher of Gods word in the same place</title>

   <head>To my reverend and venerable Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Ministers of the Gospell of <hi>Truth,</hi> peace and prosperity in this world, and fulnesse of glory hereafter.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>Reverend Brethren:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Bring forth my papers among you,<note place="margin">Quasi &amp; latere simul &amp; legi vellem, educo. Cunaeus.</note> as one that scarce knowes, whether it be best to <hi>hide them, or reveale them.</hi> But, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now, that no other <hi>Nay</hi> would stop the mouth of <hi>necessity,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Durum telum, necessitas.</note> but the Printing of them, I am bold to desire a part of <hi>Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> from you (too) for my <hi>Impe.</hi> All is little enough to shrowd it from the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the winde now sits. Therefore bee good to it, I pray you. Twas a quicke birth, God knowes; and, it may die, like an <hi>abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> in its nativity, for ought I perceive, if it misse the <hi>almes</hi> of your approbation. Nor, is my request without reason, if you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature of my <hi>subject;</hi> whose nobility entreats not onely the <hi>courtesie,</hi> but commands the <hi>debt</hi> of your acceptance.</p>
   <p>For first it concernes you much:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> tis the <hi>Truth;</hi> and tis your profession to stand for it. Its owne <hi>worth,</hi> not my <hi>comment,</hi> may move you to it. My dull oratory hath too low areach to handle the height of it: yet my poore straine (what ever it be herein) though hasty, yet tis liberall, and free-borne; which calls me, <hi>Parent;</hi> and you, <hi>Patrons.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Tis the honour of your spirituall valour to buckle for the <hi>Truth:</hi> you have the Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God: you are tough, and approved Souldiers in the Schoole of Christ; (I speake not to the <hi>silent Cattell</hi> in the Ministery.) Sit ye downe then, in the <hi>Charets of Ammi-nadib,</hi> and plead for my <hi>yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> that can scarce speake for it selfe. Let the care of its credit, or pitty of its weaknesse, perswade you to patronize it.</p>
   <p>Nay further,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ye are bound by the lawes of Piety, Charity, and Nature, (too,) unlesse you deeme me one of <hi>Levies illegitimates,</hi> to astipulate to my request. For, in Natures Schoole, strike the
<pb facs="4"/>dog, and (with an inherent proclivity) he runnes to his master: wound the Souldier, and be hastens to the army: the <hi>Antiperista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> of the cold sends the heat backe againe into the fire: yea,<note n="*" place="margin">Vnumquod{que} magis inclinatur adid, cuius est.</note> every thing (by a natur all inclination) hath respect unto that, whereunto it chiefly belongs. Now, the Church is my <hi>center,</hi> and receptacle; you, the <hi>Guardians:</hi> whither then, should I flye for shelter, but to you? if any refuse me this curtesie, tis either for envy, or else for enmitie.</p>
   <p>But alas, we are not cleane, in <hi>Levies</hi> Tribe, from Critickes, whose best learning consists in censuring others; whose best skill is to shew their owne folly. And indeed, tis no wonder, to see some <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Curs,</hi> when they dare not bite, dare barke: some cowardly <hi>Braggadochioes,</hi> when they dare not fight, dare cracke of their manhood: and tis no injury, to say, There are some Ideaes of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who, when they dare not write, dare carpe; and happely prove themselves as liber all of their ignorance, as of their words.</p>
   <p>But I leave such unto the further doome of my silent censure: nor let them thinke, that my purpose was ever bent to grace them with the dedication of my lines. Therefore to you, my Brethren, (whose grave discretion &amp; Christian love have taught you to cover an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,) to you I turne my selfe againe: And if, in this Pamphlet, my phrase shall seeme too clownish, (for such was the adversaries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the delivery) pardon it, and say, I live among my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and have not, as yet, learned any better eloquence, then (with the home bred Souldier) to call a <hi>Spade,</hi> a Spade. Besides, some of you know, that Physick is a part of my profession, and practice:<note place="margin">Ex spuma dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum veneneta fit Bezoardicum.</note> and therein of strong poison, I make an wholesome medicine: why may not then some <hi>Balme of Gilead</hi> (by a divine confection) be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of an harsh phrase; which (simply taken) may breed an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. But your judgments I know are apprehensive; I need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. Your affections, I trust, friendlike; I need no further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade. Frustrate not then my expectation of your acceptance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: so you may haply <hi>milke</hi> from me some sweeter streames of my more maturate studies: and in the meane while, (yea ever) you shall find me obliged by this <hi>truth,</hi>
