   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, William EARLE OF <hi>PEMBROKE,</hi> Lord Steward of his Majesties most Honourable Houshold. Robert EARLE OF <hi>LINDSEY,</hi> Great Chamberlaine of ENGLAND.

      <salute>My Lords:</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> that most learned Treasurer of Antiquitie, having by perusall of my Generall Historie, and others, found that I had likewise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone divers other as hard hazards in the other parts of the world, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted me to fix the whole course of my passages in a booke by it selfe, whose noble desire I could not but in part satisfie; the rather, because
<pb facs="4"/>
they have acted my fatall Tragedies upon the Stage, and rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked my Relations at their pleasure. To prevent therefore all future misprisions, I have compiled this true discourse. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie hath taxed me to have writ too much, and done too little; but that such should know, how little I esteeme them, I have writ this, more for the satisfaction of my friends, and all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and well disposed Readers: To speake only of my selfe were intolerable ingratitude; because, having had so many co-partners with me; I cannot make a Monument for my selfe, and leave them unburied in the fields, whose lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got me the title of a Souldier; for as they were companions with me in my dangers, so shall they be partakers with me in this Tombe.</p>
   <p>For my <hi>Sea Grammar</hi> (caused to bee printed by my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy friend, Sir <hi>Samuel Saltonstall</hi>) hath found such good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment abroad, that I have beene importuned by many noble persons, to let this also passe the Presse. Many of the most eminent Warriers, and others, what their swords did, their penns writ: Though I bee never so much their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, yet I hold it no great errour, to follow good examples; nor repine at them, will doe the like.</p>
   <p>And now my most Honourable good Lords, I know not to whom I may better present it, than to your Lordships, whose friendships, as I conceive, are as much to each others, as my duty is to you all; and because you are acquainted both with my endevours, and writings, I doubt not, but your honours will as well accept of this, as of the rest, and Patronize it under the shadow of your most noble vertues, which I am ever bound in all duty to reverence, and under which I hope to have shelter, against all stormes that dare threaten.</p>
