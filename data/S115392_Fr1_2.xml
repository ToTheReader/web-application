   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not the farre fetcht pedegree of noble Ancestors, nor those Honours your Lordship deservedly posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that make mee crave your Patronage to this my Labour; but it is that Heroick minde, enriched with the choice endowments of Nature and Art, and that earnest affection wherewith your Honour enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines all Sciences, Arts, and Artists, with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Judgment which sees into the inner man, which embolden and incite me to sue for your Honours assistance, in protecting the fame of him, who by your many favours is made yours. I know the seeming and selfe-pleasing Wisedome of our times, consists much in cavilling, and unjustly carping at all things that see light, and that there are many who earnestly hunt after the publike fame of Learning and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by this easily trod, and despicable path, which notwithstanding they tread with as much confidence as folly; for that oft-times which they vainely and unjustly brand with opprobrie, out-lives their Fate, and flourisheth when it is forgot that ever any such as they had being.</p>
   <p>I know your Lordships disposition to be farre dissenting from those men, and that you rather endeavour to build up the fame of your lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Judgement upon a strong laid foundation of your owne, than <hi>Herostratus</hi> like, by pulling downe any howsoever faire built fabricke of another. I heartily wish that your Honour could propagate this good, and that all Detractors might be turned into Actors, and then I know it would much mitigate their rigour in censuring others,

when as they themselves were also exposed unto the same Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>
   <p>I thinke it impertinent to acquaint your Honour with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Worke, my Paines in translating, or the Benefit that may ensue thereon, for that I know your Honour ignorant of nothing in this kind; neither doubt I of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable acceptance of the good-will of him, that thinkes himselfe much honoured by being</p>
