   <head>❧A preamble of the authour vpon the Arte of Nauigation, wherein is declared the great excellencie of the
said arte.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Monge all other vertues some are so much the greater, by howe much it is comunicated of
amongst others, wherby the vertue of Iustice is most perfit among other vertues, for it doth
most communicate and participat withall, so that amonge all artes the arte of Nauigation is
more excellent then others, for it doth not oenly communicate with them, but doth shut vp
into it, the most principall of them, that is to say, <hi>Arithmeticke, Geometrie,</hi> and <hi>Astrologie.</hi>
These haue excellencie among the <hi>Mathematicals,</hi> by the most true shewe that is made
of their conclusions. And that this arte hath his beginning and greatnes among other artes,
it appeareth by three reasons following.</p>
   <p>The first, by reason of his subtillitie.</p>
   <p>The second, by reason of his certaintie▪</p>
   <p>The third, by reason of his profit.</p>
   <p>For the first, who is sufficient to speake of so great a misterie that a man with a compasse, and certaine strekes
marked in a carde, doth knowe howe to goe rounde about the world, and knoweth both by day and night whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he shall come, and from whence he shall depart, and howe much he shall go from one place to another, and
that he goe certainly in his right way, by so long and so large a thing as the sea is, where is no way no signe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
it is a misterie very difficult. And so it was considered by <hi>Salomon:</hi> who saith, that one of the hardest things
to be found, is the way of a ship in the sea, for she followeth not any way, nor leaueth any signe where she went,
And who is able to speake of so great a secret, that with a rounde instrument no greater then the palme of a mans
hande called <hi>Astrolabio,</hi> the roundnesse of the heauen is measured, being so great th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t the vnderstanding of
man cannot atteine thereunto. And therewith is taken the heigth of the sunne, passing it by a very litle and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
place, being much greater then all the earth and the sea. And it is knowen howe nere and howe farre off it is
from vs: And in like manner the heigth of the starres are taken, and by this we are so certainely guided, that so
much as one point fayleth not. Likwise who can speak of the secrete &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>inenes of the compasse, that being made
with as much paper as a mans hande, and with certaine streekes marked thereon, doth note the windes. And
with a litle iron put into it, is made an instrument that doth moue of it selfe, with onely the naturall vertue that
a stone hath giuen vnto it, and mouing without the helpe of any thing, sheweth where is the East, the West, the
North, and the South. And likwise the thirtie two windes which the Nauigation hath, and this is sheweth not
onely in one place but in all places, and it sheweth it so certainly that thereby they do it, and are certaine of their
purpose and pretence as many as are saylers in the sea. For the second, the certainetie of this art is so great, that
it seemeth the knowledge of one man not to bee sufficient to ordaine it, nor yet of many men, more then God
prouided a speciall grace and vnderstanding for that purpose, it is proued wherein it happeneth that a pilot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
sayling, and a storme taketh him three hundreth leages in the sea, and the day very cloudie, and the night so
darke that standing in the poope of the shippe, which is the hinder part, he seeth not the fore part of her, and
scantly the maste, and making many turnes in the seas, running from one part to another, rising and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending,
with a vehemencie of the windes and strength of the sea, and yet for all this, by the certainetie of the
arte, he knoweth the way that she hath gone, and the place where she is, and being come to the lande, shee
goeth to the port although it be in the night, not seeing the lande, likewise it happeneth many times, as the pilor
goeth sayling, he findeth a rocke or shoolde CC. leagues in the sea from any lande, and marketh the place where
he is, although he seeth not wherewith to marke it, for he seeth but the heauen and the water, and in it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing wherewithal to marke or make any signe, because al doth moue, but marketh it in his carde by the land,
he seeth in it and according to the art, which the carde hath, it is so certaine, that he and others both by day &amp;
night do knowe howe to preserue and keep them selues from that place going aside from it, because they would
receiue no hurt, although it be vnder the water, that nothing of it is seene, whereby is concluded that although
the other artes haue trueth, this hath more by reason of the demonstration so certaine, which sheweth to keepe
a man from hurt and danger that he seeth not. For the third, I say there is no art of any that man vseth, so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
nor so good as this art of Nauigation is, and this to be true it seemeth well, because by it we haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of diuerse and sundrie thinges in the worlde, and also of the trade with all partes of the worlde. And if
nauigation shoulde cease, men shoulde be driuen to liue straightly, for that they should lacke many things which
are necessarie for the life of man.</p>
   <p>Also here is to be noted, that amonge al artes which men doe vse and practise, none is of so great peril and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as the art of Nauigation, and chiefely in these dayes, seeing it is so greatly encreased and well neere the hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="4"/>
roundnes of the worlde is sayled about: it is strange to consider that the auncient writers, neyther sawe it, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
thought of it, but rather helde it for vnpossible: it is worthie to be noted, that I haue seene many times a Pilote
come from the East India, who hath bene one yeere vpon the way, and from our Indias foure or fiue monethes,
passing such great daungers and troubles that many times they haue beene at the point of death, and being come
home to their naturall countrey, all hath beene so forgotten of them, as if it had past in adream, and so they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to returne with so geart good will, as though they went to a thing of pleasure. I thinke that couetousnesse
of goods is not the cause thereof, nor any other worldly gaine, but I take it to come of the will of God, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be a thing so naturall to feare death, and great labour, yet all these labours and feares which they passe
in the same Nauigation, are by them forgotten, for if they shoulde remember and feare them, there is none that
woulde sayle on the sea: And seeing the wise pilot that so often times putteth his life in hassarde; and not onely
his owne, but in his knowledge is put in trust the liues and goodes of many: wherefore if any person will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the arte of Nauigation, let him peruse this booke and arte, and studie therein, and he shall finde plainly
all things set forth necessarie for the same, whereby pleasing God he will graunt, to his way the ende which hee
desireth.</p>
