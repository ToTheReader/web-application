   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, I haue here presented you with an Historie out of French into English, containing the life and glorious actes of Scanderbeg King of Epyre, a Prince no lesse admired in his life, then memorable after his death. I neede not commend vnto you, eyther the excellencie of the Historie, or the worthinesse of the partie: for that both the one and the other are sufficient to commend themselues, and the shadow of my prayses will but eclipse the brightnesse of their deserts. Notwithstanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may be expected that I should say somewhat, giue me leaue to speake what I thinke, though I cannot thinke what I ought to speake. First there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore touching Scanderbeg, so exquisite was his skill and experience in the art and science militarie, so excellent and heroicall was his cariage and gouernment amongest his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, amongst his subiects, and towards his very enemies: so amiable and louely were his vertues▪ so vnspeakable and vnmatchable were many of his qualities, so honorable and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious were all his actions, and so extraordinarie was his fortune in the multitude and rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his victories, that it may be a question whether was greater his vertue or his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The one was rare, the other admirable, and both together haue exempted him from comparison: in so much, that if Hanniball the Carthaginian the scourge of Rome, and Scipio the Romaine the plague of Carthage, were now liuing, to reuiue their old dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, who should be reputed the best Captaine: I doubt not but each of them would giue Scanderbeg the garland, at leastwise they would acknowledge him (if not superiour to all) yet inferiour to none, and equall to the worthiest. If we compare his small meanes with his mightie exploites, you will say they were wonderfull, if you consider his policies and fine stratageames, you will say they were singular: if you respect his corporall giftes and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nature her selfe will say she was prodigall in gracing him, hauing made him as comely as Edgar Atheling, who was called Englands darling, and as vnpenetrable as Achilles, whom no weapon could fasten on. If you regard his fortune, fortune her selfe will tell you, that she was fond ouer him. For in him onely she shewed a change of her nature, which being vsually changeable and inconstant to all men mortall, yet to him continued constant and vnchangeable. As for his vertues, Oh how they shine most glorious as the sunne beames, dazeling the eyes of the beholders with the excellencie of their obiect. Looke into his life, and let this Historie be the glasse to shew you his perfections, you shall finde, that for warinesse and prudence, he was comparable to Fabius Maximus, who by tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing repayred the estate of Rome almost ruinated: for loue to his natiue countrie, he was another Camillus, who being exiled by his ingrate citizens, yet rescued them from the Gaules. For discipline he was equall to Manlius, whose seueritie to his owne sonne hath made him euer famous. Couragious as Hector that neuer turned backe to his enemies, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and courteous as Caesar, who by giuing, forgiuing, and relieuing, made himselfe way to the Romaine Empire: mercifull as Traian, who neuer signed Bill for the execution of malefactors but he bedewed it with his teares: deare to his subiects and souldiers as Tytus, who was termed the delight and the Iewell of the world. Alexander the glorie of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon, got the name of Great amongst the Greekes, because he ouercame the Orient like a tempest: Pompey the ioy of the Romaine Nobilitie, had the name of Great giuen him by
<pb facs="4"/>
the Romaines, because he purged the seas infested with Pyrats, and because he stoode for the common libertie: Charlemaine the honour of the French was entytled Great because he brake the force and power of the Sarracens. Gonsaluo the pride of the Spaniards and Italians was called the great Captaine, because he extorted the kingdome of Naples from the Frenchmen. As iustly may the Epyrots vaunt of their Scanderbeg to be the glorie, the honour, the pride, and the ioy of Albanie, seeing the Turkes themselues his sworne and mortall enemies haue giuen and attributed the name of Great vnto him, and seeing the greatnesse of his exploits doe testifie that the name and title of Great is no greater then his deserts. Nay all Europe may worthily acknowledge him to be as great as the greatest: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his conquest in Asia and Europe vnder Amurath, the strange recouerie of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of the libertie of his countrie, which he purged from the Infidels: his often and wonderfull victories atcheeued against infinite and huge armies, and the continuall course of his life, and of all his actions doe shew apparantly, that he was the glorie and onely staie of his owne countrie, the sole protectour of the common libertie, a bulwarke to Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, a champion for the religion, the paragon of that age, and the wonder of posteritie: a terror to his enemies whilest he liued, and adored by them after his death. Pardon me (my masters) if I be somewhat immoderate or superstitious in admiring his excellencie, for what almost can there be in any man, that was not aboundantly in our Scanderbeg? so many were his perfections, and so few his imperfections, as it may iustly be imagined, that God created him as a mirror for the world rather to wonder at, then any way possibly to be matched, and yet most worthy of all men to be imitated.</p>
   <p>Now by the excellencie of the person here represented, the worthinesse of this historie may easily be imagined, for where the subiect is so rare and notable, the estimat of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie must needes be made correspondent and agreeable. I will not compare it with the best that haue beene written, but this I dare auerre, that therein is litle or nothing wanting which in a historie is thought needfull. The ornaments of an historie are, elegancie of the stile, truth of the reports, varietie of the discourse, and the profitablenesse of the matter. For the stile, howsoeuer this historie may seeme defectiue, it is not much materiall: for though it want the grace of elegant and fine phrases to make it pleasaunt to curious eares and to daintie appetites: yet for all other the accomplements of a good and perfect historie I thinke it may go beyond the most: if it compare not with the best: touching the trueth thereof, diuerse circumstances and arguments do proue it to be without controllment, The age and time wherein it was first written: the consent of succeeding times which haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it without reproofe, and the testimonies of sundrie authors who haue recorded the most notable and strangest accidents contained in this historie. For the varietie thereof to procure delight, I appeale to your owne iudgements when you haue read it. And I doubt not but you will confesse: that you haue found few histories or none, more copious, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable and more delightfull. For profit likewise: in many pointes it will shew it selfe to be excellent, and you can turne to no part through, but you shall finde matter of benefite. Hence may the sage Philosopher and prudent Poletist deriue all or the most precepts of the Arte and science militarie. Herein may both the expert Martialist and the simple souldier see the excellencie and perfection of his calling and profession: the benefit of good order and martiall discpline: and out of the <hi>Idea</hi> of Scanderbeg his actions, may they behold (as it were) the anatomie and shape vnto themselues, the image both of an expert Generall and an absolute souldier. Here may Princes and great persons behold the bright shining lustre of many royall and heroicall vertues, making their names glorious in the eye of the world, their power fearefull and terrible to their enemies, and their persons deere and gratious to their subiects: here may they take a view of those pernitious vices &amp; enormities of those rash &amp; inconsiderat assertions which make them odious to God, hatefull to men, disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="4"/>
in their estates, and most wretched and miserable euen in the greatnes of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. In some, such is the varietie, the veritie, the profit and the excellencie of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: that there is no estate, degree or calling, but may find therein somewhat to admire at, much to delight in, and most things to imitat and to put in practise and execution.</p>
   <p>It resteth now (my masters) that you make that estimate and account of it, which both the excellencie of Scanderbeg his vertues, and the worthinesse of the historie doe require and merit: and that you measure the good will and painefull labours both of the authors, and of the translator by their dispositions affecting your good and benefit, and not by any sinister singularitie of your misdeeming conceipt. For if you be not too ingrate and iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the memorie of a Prince so well deseruing, if you shew not your selues more then barbarous in contemning a monument of so great reckoning: or if you be not too austere and rigorous in your censures: you cannot but graciously accept the acquaintance of this historie: you will friendly welcome the rare example of Scanderbeg his peerelesse vertues and his surpassing fortune: and last of all, you will couer the imperfection of this worke (if you find any) with the vaile of your selfe-gracing courtesie.</p>
