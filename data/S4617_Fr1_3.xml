   <p>RIght Hononarable: Right Worshipfull, and my best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued in him that loues you best and hath paid for his loue deerest. In the hearing of the most of you (according to the godly commaund of lawfull authoritie knowne vnto you all) I haue lately entred vpon that most commendable and most profitable course of Catechising: and to the end that I might the more cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish you, and bolden yours, I tooke courage to my selfe by God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I began the worke it selfe, to say something as a short begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and introduction to my future endeauours by Gods permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: For your selues by way of Sermon and continuall discourse, as the foode of the strong, for your children and seruants, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the same into peeces, for the smallest and weakest disgesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by way of questions, for all (I hope) as members of the same body, a fit receipt and preperation, especially it being the desire of of some of you to haue these published for the benefit of children, as crummes in common, I know whit-meates are wholesome for you that are growne great ones, but yet I presume it will not be troublesome to you to taste of the milke, both before, and after your small children. I shalbe refreshed before the Lord for the time present, as well as any fare can make me, if you like the Lord that maketh both the body and the bread, will accept of these poore pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I haue to present you; and for the time to come, your gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such fruite as is growne shalbe full payment for the past sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: God that onely must giue encrease (euen to <hi>Pauls</hi> planting) grant vnto your information, and my consolation, his heauenly blessing, through Iesus Christ, to whom be all honour and glory.</p>
