      <salute>Most pious Lady:</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat's all the Title I shall bee bold with at this time; your <hi>Religion</hi> in my eyes being a more
<pb facs="4"/> glorious attribute than your <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Honours:</hi> I am glad your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi> (though I wish it bad beene a <hi>Command</hi>) hath prevented my slacknesse, and turn'd my <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> into a <hi>Debt,</hi> and my <hi>Gift</hi> into
<pb facs="4"/> a <hi>Duty:</hi> GOD knows with what joy I read your faire <hi>Letter,</hi> when I perceiv'd Your holy desire to bee instructed by Writing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the dayly Tryall of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee past over
<pb facs="5"/> in a short Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which is but conceite and thought made au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible by Words; whereas the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Character is both thought and word made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. I would to God (so much I
<pb facs="5"/> tender my Soules good) that I were alwaies thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I could bee alwaies thus hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily prevented in the unforc'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of a Devoute Soule. So little cause your honour had to complement
<pb facs="6"/> a feare of trouble in my task, which is above merit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imployment, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially since your Goodnesse hath condescended to request, where your Greatnesse might command. Hee that in this
<pb facs="6"/> would not serve you, would forfeit the Title of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to his God; who put it into your soule, to put Your Conscience into a <hi>Quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Triall:</hi> a great mysterie in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, every heart does not
<pb facs="7"/> conceive it, every eye cannot see it; or both these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yeelded, every hand cannot skill to put that in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the heart has in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable helpe to all <hi>Devotion,</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/> I could relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you what admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Divine Elogies it has beene Crowned within the circle of all Ages, ever since the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch walk't out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fields to meditate, even to this colder time
<pb facs="8"/> of, at the best luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme Religion; by what, and how many glorious Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries of the Church, nay, the very Sophies and Philosophers it hath been set upon a hill conspicuous to all the World, had the World not
<pb facs="8"/> lost her old Eye-sight: But the rare Opinion your Honour professes to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd of it at my first Discourse, saves all this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and I shall hereafter ranke your admiration of it amongst the
<pb facs="9"/> choysest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both of its use &amp; glory: both being exceeding ample; the use be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of its neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to Man; the glory by reason of our familiaritie with God: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> beeing from hence espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="9"/> stil'd <hi>Gods Friend.</hi> We see, that speaking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men, time has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd unto us a Proverbe, viz. <hi>that even recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings make long Friends.</hi> GOD has caught the World, or would
<pb facs="10"/> doe in her owne Dialect: For this <hi>EXAMINATION</hi> being derived from a Latin word that signifies the Tongue of the Scales, is nothing else but a just and even <hi>Triall</hi> of the <hi>Conscience</hi> (by that weight which
<pb facs="10"/> Law exacts, and that Allowance which Gospel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits) every Day in the Sight of GOD, that all Accounts of the Soule may be even before the Image of <hi>Death,</hi> that is, <hi>Sleepe</hi> sieze on us in a figure:
<pb facs="11"/> So that let GOD please, to call when hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, no Minuite shall finde us in security, all our Accompts are made, and writ in the blood of a Mediator, all is even, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee has
<pb facs="11"/> paide all, and thus GOD and wee are Friends for all our ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality: Thus with <hi>Enoch</hi> wee walke with GOD here, till it please him to translate us to a better place. This is the <hi>Tryall</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<pb facs="12"/> and a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Soule it is wheresoever this gracious Guest shall make abode: Wherfore to make some little, but constant prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Ile onely doe as much for the Stranger, as the <hi>Shunanite</hi> did
<pb facs="12"/> for the waifaring Prophet, provide a Table, a Stoole, and a Candlestick, the one for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past, the other for his repose, the last for his late and early Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is, by way of Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="13"/> set downe three generall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites necessary to bee observed of all those who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to reape a blessing by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.</p>
