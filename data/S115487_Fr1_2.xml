   <p>To hear of <hi>contentions</hi> breaking out against the <hi>customes of the Church</hi> is no news at all,
<pb facs="3"/>neither must it stumble us:<note place="margin">Ver. 19.</note> he that for the <hi>tryall of his children</hi> suffers <hi>heresie,</hi> hath his ends in the least and smallest oppositions: and if it be the will and pleasure of God, by the light skirmishes of some few to bring to passe a greater good, I shall learne to magnify the wisedome of the Almighty, that turns the cavills of contentious men to the further enlargement of his glory. Howsoever it be, thou hast the same that was first delivered, nothing is altered but the outward dresse, much lesse any word or sentence changed, which I could heare was subject to exception. If thou light upon any thing worth the reading, thank not me for my good will, who never intended to make it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, but thank the ill will of those carping hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who put me upon it in mine owne defence, and thinke of me as of the poorest unworthy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ Iesus, who shall be ever ready upon all occasions to approve my selfe</p>
