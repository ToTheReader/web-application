   <p>THe proude Pecocke (gentle Reader) strouteth and playteth his gorgeous tayle so long, till at the length he discouereth the filthe thereof: so some will thinke, and will not sticke to say, that whyle I indeuour to discouer the imbecillitie of other mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I reueale thereby mine owne licencious liuyng, if so (at the least) I speake by experience. And what if I did? yet are they farre deceyued herein, and doe but dreame (as it were) vpon falshoode it selfe. For the market declareth how the coine is solde: and though I am but yong of yeares, yet may I dayly heare &amp; see that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by action I am not partaker. It seemeth also the vanities of this world are the greater, when as they lie so open, and are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest vnto my youthfull yeares. And though it hath not pleased <hi>Polymneia</hi> so to fauour my penne, as to counteruayle my well wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: yet I truste yee will accepte of me for my well meanyng, who am not therein &amp; s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

But vnto the carelesse Reader it is (as it were) a peece of vnleauened dough, wherefore for such I thinke it better to haue their browes knitte harde with the kercher of <hi>Morpheus,</hi> and so to lay them downe to sleepe, than <hi>Legere &amp; non intelligere, nempe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glegire est.</hi> And as I haue bene briefe in all things heretofore, so will I be likewise herein: and as I haue brought you into my rude Garden, so (turnyng the key) here will I leaue you, to choose what flowers shall like you beste. My penne is stubbed, my paper spente, my Inke wasted, my wittes grauelled, and (to be shorte) tyme calleth me away: wherefore stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your curtes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
