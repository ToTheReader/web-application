   <head>¶ A Preface vnto the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Manuel so liked me, and the wel accepting of other bookes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I haue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to the same purpose, so pricked me forward, that I thought it requisite to set foorth the same in such order as I haue done.</p>
   <p>The rather I tooke this in hand before anie other in the workes of S. Augustine, because this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie hath bene annexed in our English tong vnto those of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, which alreadie I haue translated; and therefore that, as hetherto they haue ben ioined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, so hencefoorth they may be, if it so like the owners, I thought good to do this afore anie other. Againe, who so wil dulie compare this with the other, especialie with S. Augustines praiers, shal find this to be euen an abstract in a maner of the rest, containing special and piked meditations in few words,
<pb facs="3"/>
which in other bookes be more at large. Finalie, had this booke nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ben ioined, nor yet had such affinitie with the other of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine alreadie in English: yet, so singularlie diuine are the praiers comprised in the same, that wel I could not publish anie other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this were finished.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">1 <hi>This Booke why called a Manuel.</hi>
      </note>I do cal this booke, as also the author doth, a Manuel, because my wish is, that Christians would vse, and haue it in their hands, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie when they are at home in their chambers, and studies priuatelie, but also when they are abroade in the fields, gardens, and else-where idlelie: and that not to dandle, and to handle onlie, but diligentlie, and zealouslie, as the part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians is, to reade the same for their spiritual exercise.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">2 <hi>Author of this Booke, who.</hi>
      </note>Touching the Author, who hee was, I dare not directlie set downe. For in some copies I finde, that S. Augustine made the same, in others it is flatlie denied. Therefore, although it be enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled S. Augustines Manuel: yet is it in none other sense applied vnto him, than are diuers Psalmes
<pb facs="3"/>
in the Psalter, entituled <hi>Dauid his Psalmes,</hi> which happelie Dauid neuer sawe, much lesse endited. Notwithstanding, were S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine the Author of the same, or were he not, it skilleth not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. For the matter it conteineth, is verie spiritual, godlie, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie: and wise men either do not respect the Author, or not the Author so much as the matter; nor so much who writeth, as what is set downe.</p>
   <p>The Argument of this booke is doubtles verie good,<note place="margin">3 <hi>The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Booke.</hi>
      </note> either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie meditations, or praiers: <hi>the one whereof,</hi> which is meditation (as Bernard noteth <note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>D. Bern. in die S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreae serm.</hi> 1.</note>,) <hi>teacheth vs what is wanting, the other, to wit, praier, obteineth that which wee want; Praier bringeth vnto the ende of our iournie, meditation sheweth the waie; to conclude, by meditation wee confesse the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers hanging ouer our heads, and by praier wee escape them, through the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> Of these this whole booke doth consist.</p>
   <p>The occasion of making this treatise was this.<note place="margin">4 <hi>The occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on why this Booke was made.</hi>
      </note> The Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
<pb facs="4"/>
the frailtie of al men in general, and especialie his owne weakenes in particular; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king some prop to staie himselfe from falling, found none so sure à staie against the engins of Satan and his limmes, as continual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and praier. And therefore out of the meditations and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the fathers (for so he saith) he gathered this booke, as à pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious iewel alwaie to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, both to keepe him from securitie, and to enflame the zeale of godlines within him when he waxed colde.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">5 <hi>Methode of this Booke.</hi>
      </note>The methode (for that is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumstance to be noted in anie booke) is verie exquisite: for neuer did Goldsmith more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninglie dispose either pretious stones in à iewel, or linkes in à golden chaine, than are both the meditations in this Manuel, and the sentences in each meditation, and each phraze wel-nigh in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sentence.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">6 <hi>Vse of this Booke.</hi>
      </note>Last of al, how necessarie this, and such like bookes are for this present time, he wil confesse that calleth into remembrance the
<pb facs="4"/>
great and general corruption of al mankinde; and waieth by what sleightes and subtelties both the Diuel seeketh to deuoure, the flesh to entangle, and the world to drawe vs headlong vnto perdition: which to auoide, we haue none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedie, beside earnest, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and continual praier. This made both our Sauiour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vs to <hi>Watch and praie</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Mark. 13, verse. 33.</note>; and S. Paule to bid vs, <hi>Praie conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nualie</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">1. Thes. 5. verse. 17.</note>; and Cyril to breake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these words <note n="d" place="margin">
         <hi>Cyril, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. Catech.</hi>
      </note>, <hi>Bee thou ydle neither in the daie time, nor in the night; and when sleepe is gone from thine eies, euen then let thy minde bee occupied in praier.</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto agreeth that of Hierome <note n="e" place="margin">
         <hi>Hierome in Epist.</hi>
      </note>, <hi>When you go abroade, praie; when you returne home, praie; before meate, praie; and before you go to rest, praie.</hi> The reason Augustine doth yeeld. <hi>For praier is, as à sacrifice vnto God: so à scourge vnto Satan</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">
         <hi>August. in serm.</hi>
      </note>. <note n="f" place="margin">
         <hi>August. in serm.</hi>
      </note>. Vse therefore that which God delighteth in, but neuer do that which liketh Satan, that is, neglect not praier.</p>
   <p>One Chapter you shal find in this booke, lesse than is in the Latine
<pb facs="5"/>
copie: and yet moe by two, than hetherto hath bene in English. The addition, I doubt not, wil like you, but the omission of a Chapter some perhaps wil mislike, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding was done, neither of negligence vnwittinglie, nor hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie of presumption, but with good aduisement, that thy zeale might not be cooled by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof. For it containeth strange, that I saie not erroneous doctrine: as that <hi>Vnicuique</hi>
      <note n="g" place="margin">
         <hi>Manuel cap.</hi> 25.</note>
      <hi>propria voluntas est causa suae damnationis vel saluationis</hi>; that, <hi>Bona voluntas Deum ad nos deducit, &amp; nos in eum dirigit</hi>; that, <hi>Per bonam voluntatem Deum diligimus, Deum eligimus, ad Deum currimus, ad Deum peruenimus, &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um possidemus, &amp;c.</hi> which sentences being contrarie vnto the truth, and sauoring of a superstitious time, were better quite omitted, than translated to the infecting of some,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Manuel cap.</hi> 11.</note> or offence of anie.</p>
   <p>Againe, another Chapter there is, though not cleane left out, yet applied from an il, vnto a good purpose, as the eleuenth Chapter, where that which was spoken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the sacrifice of the altar, is
<pb facs="5"/>
applied vnto our Sacrament of thankesgiuing, or of the real and carnal presence of Christ, vnto his spiritual being at the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And these are the things cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in this booke.</p>
   <p>To conclude, whatsoeuer is done either in translating, correcting, quoting, or publishing this booke, is al done for thy edification, and to prouoke thee vnto this godlie exercise of praier. For a better meanes thou hast not to keepe thy selfe in the feare of God than it is. Therefore the more zealous, godlie, and learned bookes to this purpose are publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, the more thou hast to praise God, and be thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
