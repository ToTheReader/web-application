      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are three ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary vertues well be-seeming euery Christian Man, <hi>Charity, Fidelity,</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> both towardes <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
      <note place="margin">4. Reasons of louing God. Math. 23. 9</note> There are foure reasons (to passe by many moe) which should moue vs to the loue of God: First,<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 18.</note> because hee is our gracious <hi>Father,</hi> who of his owne will <hi>begat vs with the word of truth, that we should be as
<pb facs="3"/>
the first fruits of his Creatures.</hi> Now if a childe shall loue his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of whom he hath receiued a part of his body, how much more ought he loue God, <hi>(Qui animam suam infundendo creauit, &amp; creando infudit)</hi> of whom hee hath receiued his soule, and to whose goodnesse he stands ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged both for soule and body, both for the being &amp; continuing of them? Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Thou hast possessed my reines,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psalm. 139 13. Psal. 71. 6.</note>
      <hi>thou hast couered me in my Mothers wombe. Vpon thee haue I been stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the wombe: thou art hee that tooke me out of my mothers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> long before him, <hi>Thine hands haue made me,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iob. 10. 8. 11. 12.</note>
      <hi>and fashioned me wholly round about; thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and ioyned me together with bones and sinewes: thou hast giuen me life and grace, and thy visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="3"/>
hath preserued my spirit.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note>
      <hi>God</hi> is to be loued for his most <hi>sweet</hi> and pleasing <hi>nature,</hi> which the wicked indeed feeleth not; because (as <hi>Isidore</hi> saith) <hi>he hath lost the palate of his heart with the feuer of iniquity.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Reason</note> God by his <hi>beneficence</hi> hath deserued our loue:<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 16.</note> for out of his meere loue he sent his <hi>own</hi> and <hi>onely Son</hi> into the world, to saue vs when we were lost, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs when we were <hi>captiues,</hi> and by his death to giue vs life when we had deserued nought but death.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, <hi>aske now the beasts,</hi>
      <note place="margin">4. Reason. Iob. 12. 7.</note>
      <hi>&amp; they shall teach thee,</hi> and the fowles of the heauen, and they shall tell thee: speake to the earth, and it shall shew thee, or the fishes of the sea, &amp; they shall declare vnto thee. Euen these things in their kindes do praise
<pb facs="4"/>
God, and shew their loue vnto man, for whom they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: and shall man shew no loue to God; and in loue do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for God, for whom his creatures doe so much good, &amp; suffer so much euil, being all put vnder his feet, and subiected to his power,<note place="margin">Psal. 8. 6. 7. 8.</note>
      <hi>All sheepe &amp; oxen, yea &amp; the beasts of the field, the fowles of the aire, and the fish of the sea?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Of the manner how wee ought to loue God.</note>Now because a man hath in him <hi>life</hi> like a plant, <hi>sense</hi> as a <hi>beast,</hi> and <hi>vnderstanding</hi> proper to a <hi>Man,</hi> therefore it behooues him to <hi>loue God</hi> with his life, with his senses, and with his reason. Our Sauiour saith, we ought to <hi>loue God with all our heart, with al our soule,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 37 1. With all our heart.</note>
      <hi>and with all our minde.</hi> We ought to loue him with <hi>all our heart,</hi> that is, with all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, delighting and ioying in him more then in any thing:
<pb facs="4"/>
For he loues not God, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in any thing more then in God: and as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <hi>Austen</hi> saith, <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus te amat, qui aliquid t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>cū amat,</hi>
      <note place="margin">A Simile.</note>
      <hi>quod non propter te amat.</hi> By how much the more the lower bowes of a Tree are multiplied, by so much the lesse it groweth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: so by how much the more a man doth loue these things beneath, by so much the lesse is his loue erected and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto God aboue: therefore such loue is to be pruned &amp; cut away, as superfluous branches frō a tree, that it may thriue the better. God requires the whole heart, <hi>My son, giue me thy heart,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Pro. 23. 26. A Simile.</note> like some noble <hi>Bird</hi> of prey, that seizeth vpon the heart: for he alone created it, he alone co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers it, and he only can content and fill it. <hi>Totum exigit te,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Augus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ine.</note>
      <hi>qui fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit te totum,</hi> he requires thee all
<pb facs="5"/>
that made thee all.<note place="margin">Si totum me debeo pro me fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto, quid addam iam pro me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecto? <hi>Bernard.</hi>
      </note> If we owe our selues wholly for our generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what shall wee adde for our regeneration? Neither are we so easily new made, as made. In the first work God gaue vs vnto our selues: in the second he gaue vs himselfe, and restored vs vnto our selues. Being therefore both giuen and restored, we doe owe our selues for our selues, and we do owe our selues twice. But what shall wee repay vnto the Lord for himselfe? For although we were able to repay our selues a thousand times, what are wee vnto the Lord?<note place="margin">A Simile.</note> If a man had some speciall iewell which he is minded to giue away, he would bethinke himselfe where hee might best bestow it. Our heart is the best member which wee haue, and <hi>God</hi> is our best friend, let vs bestow it vpon him: it is
<pb facs="5"/>
not lost, that is giuen vnto him.</p>
   <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. With all our soule.</note> wee must loue the Lord with all our <hi>Soule,</hi> induring rather the separation of the <hi>soule</hi> from the <hi>body,</hi> then that our <hi>soule</hi> should be separated from <hi>God,</hi> who is the soule of our soule, &amp; the comfort both of soule and body.<note place="margin">Our life and senses should be bestowed vpon God</note> And because our soule affoords life and sense vnto the body, therefore to shew that we loue God with all our soule, we ought to honour him with our liues all our life long, and with all our senses, suffering them to be guided by his will, and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rather to bee depriued of them all, then of him, that gaue them all.</p>
   <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. With all our minde</note> we must loue him with all our minde and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings and cogitations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixt vpon him, and ruled by him: His word should informe

         </gap> &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</note> our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son rightly informed, should rule our wils, our affections and conuersations, in all which wee ought to seeke and apply our selues vnto God, that our liues, our affections, our wils, and our vnderstandings may be said to be Gods, so as although we liue, yet we may truly say, <hi>We liue not, but God doth liue within vs.</hi> And so much for our loue of God.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Of <hi>self loue</hi> Why and how a mā should loue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note>Loue of <hi>Man</hi> is either loue of <hi>our selues,</hi> or of our <hi>Neighbour.</hi> That a man should loue <hi>himselfe</hi> it is very necessary: for he that loues not himselfe, cannot loue another. And as S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <hi>Austen</hi> saith, <hi>Sinon nosti diligere teipsum, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>o ne decipias proximum sicut te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipsum</hi>; if thou knowest not to loue thy selfe, I am afraid least thou shouldst deceiue thy neighbour as thy selfe. Yet is it
<pb facs="6"/>
no easie matter for a man to <hi>loue himselfe aright</hi>: for he that loues iniquity hateth his owne soule, and hee that loues himselfe in the way of sin, doth loue a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber condemned to dye.<note place="margin">Augustine.</note>
      <hi>Si malè amaueris, tunc odisti: si benè ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>is, tunc amasti</hi>: If a man loue himselfe amisse, hee hates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: but if hee hate himselfe well, then he loues himselfe. If a man loose himselfe by louing himselfe, then he finds himselfe, if he hate himselfe. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learne to loue our selues by not louing our selues. He that hates his lusts, loues himselfe: he that <hi>loues his lusts,</hi> hates himselfe. He that will loue himselfe well, must loue himselfe in <hi>God,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>or <hi>God:</hi> and either because he is <hi>Gods,</hi> or that hee may bee <hi>Gods.</hi>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nd thus much for <hi>Selfe-loue.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Our <hi>Neighbour</hi> also is to bee
<pb facs="7"/>
loued, whether friend or foe, rich or poore, yong or old, high or low:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Gregory.</hi> Why our neighbour is to bee loued.</note> For <hi>(Per amorem Dei a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor proximi gignitur, &amp; per amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem proximi amor Dei nutritur)</hi> the loue of our neighbour is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the loue of God, and the loue of God is nourished by our loue of our Neighbour. Here first I say, we ought to loue our neighbour, because he is a <hi>Man</hi> of the same <hi>flesh</hi> with vs, or because he is a <hi>Christian</hi> of the same <hi>faith,</hi> incorporated into the same body, and animated by the same spirit. In whomsoeuer Christ doth shew himselfe, he is to bee loued, in the poore as in the rich, without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. A Diamond is a Diamond whether set in Gold or Siluer, or in Iron, or Wood, and hee that reiects or cōtemnes Christ in a <hi>poore</hi> man, loues not Christ
<pb facs="7"/>
in a <hi>rich</hi> man, but riches: yea,<note place="margin">5. Reasons of louing our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Math. 5. 44</note> we are to loue our <hi>Enemies.</hi> So Christ said, and so he did. Hee said so: <hi>I say vnto you; L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ue your enemies, blesse them that curse you, doe good to them that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>e you,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Colos. 1. 22 Rom. 5. 8.</note>
      <hi>and pray for them that hurt you.</hi> And so hee did; for vs, <hi>which were strangers and enemies, hath he also reconciled. Whiles we were yet sinners, Christ died for vs.</hi> Secondly, thus it behooues vs to doe, that wee may resemble our heauenly Father, and shew our selues to be his sonnes: For hee sendeth <hi>his raine on the iust and vniust.</hi> Thirdly, else shall we loose our reward:<note place="margin">Math. 5. 45 46.</note>
      <hi>For if you loue thē that loue you, what reward shall yee haue?</hi> Fourthly, because GOD hath selected and singled vs out from the multitude of the world, therefore wee must bee singular and egregious for our
<pb facs="8"/>
conuersation:<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 47.</note>
      <hi>If yee bee friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to your brethren onely, what sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular thing do yee? do not euen the Publicans likewise?</hi> And shall Christians do no more thē Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanes, then Turkes, then Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, then naturall men? Fiftly, it is by our Apostle comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and commended vnto vs, When hee saith;<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note>
      <hi>Let vs do good vnto all; if vnto all, then vnto our enemies</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 20</note>
      <hi>Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him,</hi> saith he, <hi>If hee thirst giue him drink.</hi> Now if wee must not deny him our <hi>beneficence,</hi> then not our <hi>beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> for it is no good deed, if it bee not of good will: And if we must <hi>recompence no man euill for euill,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 17.</note> then not to our enemies; and where there ought to be no <hi>maleficence,</hi> there should also be no <hi>malevolence</hi>; as wee must not worke him ill, so wee must not
<pb facs="8"/>
will, nor wish him ill.</p>
   <p>So then our Neighbour is to bee loued,<note place="margin">How our neighbour is to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> but how? Euen as our selues; which <hi>As</hi> doth not shew partiality, or equality, but simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude; not measure, but manner;<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 39</note> that is to say, Holily, Iustly, Truely, and Constantly: <hi>Holily,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Sanctè.</note> that is, <hi>for</hi> GOD, and not <hi>against</hi> GOD, <hi>vnder</hi> GOD, not <hi>aboue</hi> GOD: For he loues not GOD, that loues his neighbour with GOD, whom hee loues not for GOD; and hee that loues his neighbour more then GOD, is vnworthy of GOD, and makes his neighbour to be his GOD.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Iustly,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iustè.</note> for a man must not loue his neighbour in euill, or for euill, but in good, and for good: Hee must bee so loued, as that his vices may be hated: Hee must bee loued, if not <hi>(quia iustus)</hi> because hee is iust, yet <hi>(vt
<pb facs="9"/>
sit iustus)</hi> that hee may become iust. <hi>Loue</hi> must not bee the bond of vnrighteousnesse; we may not loue a man so as to fall in loue with, and to learne his vices.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Verè. August.</note>
      <hi>Truely,</hi> that is in the <hi>Truth,</hi> For <hi>(nemo potest veraciter esse amicus hominis, nisi primitus fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit amicus ipsius veritatis)</hi> no man can be a true louer of a man vnlesse first he bee a louer of the truth. I say againe <hi>truely,</hi> that is, the man must be loued, not his riches, honours, greatnesse, his <hi>good</hi> must be sought, and not his <hi>goods</hi>; hee, not his. Some loue their neighbours, as dogs doe bones, for the flesh that is on them; or as men do Trees, for their fruite; or as Kites do a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kase, for reliefe: But wee ought to loue them euen for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, for this, that <hi>they are men,</hi> or for this, that <hi>they are vertuous</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/>
and good men.</p>
   <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Perseueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Of the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of loue.</note> our Neighbours are to be loued <hi>Constantly:</hi> With some men, friends are like flowers, which are esteemed of no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then whiles they are fresh. Many mens loue is like to that of Harlots, who loue, whiles there is lucre; they loue not the man, but his gifts: They are like the <hi>Gleads</hi> in the fable, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the old wife bearing Tripes to the Market, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke her home-ward, when she returned empty. A man shall be loued in prosperity; but it is a question whether the man, or his fortunes, bee rather loued: Aduersity will try the force of friendship, and vertue of loue: Hee which forsakes his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in aduersity, doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly shew that hee loued him not in prosperity: It was not the
<pb facs="10"/>
man which was loued, but the mans prosperity. But we ought to bee constant in our loue: Whiles we see either <hi>Humanity,</hi> or <hi>Christianity,</hi> we haue cause to loue.<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 9.</note>
      <hi>Let vs not therefore bee wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of wel-doing:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 1.</note>
      <hi>Let brotherly loue continue.</hi> And so much for <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> which for perpetuity,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 13</note> and seruiceablenesse vnto others, is more excellent, then either faith or hope.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</note>The next is <hi>Fidelity,</hi> when men are fast and faithfull vnto men for GOD, and vnto GOD for GOD himselfe. This faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnto GOD is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by fearing him vehemently, by obeying him constantly, by dispensing faithfully, by keeping things committed to him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, by louing him incessantly, and by suffering for him coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously. The reasons that should

The example of GOD, and his seruants: Of GOD,<note place="margin">Psal. 94. 14. Psal. 146. 6.

and chused rather to die for Him, then to liue against Him. 4. We desire GOD to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto vs, therefore we should shew our selues faithfull vnto Him. 5. Wee exact fidelity of those, that are vnder vs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reason we should behaue our selues faithfully to GOD, which is aboue vs. 6.

      <note place="margin">Why wee must bee humble toward our inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</note> For it is a mans honour sometimes to neglect his honor, and his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Greatnesse, in case, not to know his greatnesse. I suppose there is in euery man some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which craues our humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and euen this should make vs humble vnto all, because life and death is common to vs all, because by Nature wee are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners all, and it is nothing in vs, that makes the difference, but the grace of GOD vnto vs, which was neuer deserued of vs. <hi>For who hath separated thee?</hi>

      <hi>For euery man that exalteth himselfe, shall bee brought low: and he that humbleth himselfe, shall bee exalted.</hi> For GOD is gracious to the humble, but opposeth himselfe to the proud, hee breaketh their bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, hee teareth them vp by the rootes, hee scattereth brimstone vpon their dwellings, hee tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them from their seates, and laughs at their downe-fals.</p>
