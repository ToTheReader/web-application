   <head>TO THE RIGHT WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIPFVLL
SIR RICHARD
MVLLENEX KNIGHT: ALL
health of bodie, increase of ioy,
with the full fruition
of perfect feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT Worshipfull, It is reported
that <hi>Althema</hi> hoping to gratifie
<hi>Alexander</hi> that famous Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
with some excellent piece of
workemanship, searched so farre in
the depth of his Arte, as striuing
with cunning to be curious, his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill
past beyond his skill, not being
able to make his worke perfect: who
being blamed by his friend <hi>(Pethieus)</hi> for imboldning himselfe
so vnaduisedly, answered, that although Arte wanted to beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the worke, yet heart and good will did make perfect that
which lacke of cunning had left vnperfect: whose answere
(Right Worshipful) as one guiltie of a greater crime, I claime
for the sufficient excuse of my follie, in beginning this worke
rudely, continuing rashly, and ending rawly.</p>
   <p>None can expresse a Passion that he feeleth not, neither doth
the penne deliuer, but what it copieth out of the minde. This
passionate Discourse, thought it reach not to the dignitie of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
repenting, yet shall I thinke my endeuours well apaid, if it
may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">

I confesse my fault in committing these vnpolisht lines to
the Presse, yet I craue pardon with fauourable censure, and thus
<pb facs="3"/>
farre dare I answere for my selfe, that although <hi>Demosthenes</hi>
had a plaudit for his Oration, because it was curious, yet <hi>Nimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
got the Sentence for the trueth of his plaine Tale.</p>
   <p>This worke of S. <hi>Peters</hi> path to the ioyes of heauen, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
commit to your Worshippes protection, which if it may
please you to let this tearie Mappe passe vnder the countenance
and credite of your Name, and that you will deigne to reade it
ouer, and therewith seeme to be but pleased, I account my selfe
highly fauoured.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Apelles</hi> presented <hi>Alexander</hi> with the counterfeit of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paspe,</hi>
the face not fully finished, because hee liked the Picture;
and I offer these few stanzes vnto you, not well furnished, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I know you are a fauourer of vertue.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Achilles</hi> made it not daintie to take the view of <hi>Phidias</hi>
homely worke, because it was the Image of the God of Warre:
and I hope your Worship will vouchsafe the viewing of this sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
booke, for that it describes the submissiue mind of a penitent
Sinner, although it spring frō a barren soyle, being a dish of such
fruite as my poore orcharde can yeeld, not vnlike to <hi>Zeuxes</hi> pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
which seemed to the birds to be grapes, but being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
proued, were bare shadowed colours, yet it may be, that
you passing ouer many learned works, wil at last view this, and
smile as <hi>Theodosius</hi> did at the Pomegranate, not that he scorned
the fruit, but to see the simple meaning of the man that presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him with so slender a gift, yet I hope by your protection this
my labor shall find acceptance, according to the minde of the
giuer: and to haue as many fauorers as readers, &amp; no moe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that mislike the matter, then like to write some other
as well meant, for that it proceedes from a minde as willing to
shew it selfe thankefull, as whosoeuer els, that commends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
by a greater present. Thus I humbly take my leaue, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
you all heartes content in this life, and euerlasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in the World to come.</p>
