      <salute>RIGHT HONORABLE,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His famous City hath now enioyed the
peacefull succession of more than one
and thirty worthy Lord Maiors, since
Master <hi>Iohn Stow</hi> (the painfull Searcher
into Reverend Antiquity) did first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
LONDONS SVRVEY to this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Senate, Sir <hi>Robert Lee,</hi> then
Lord Maior, with gracious and favourable acceptance.</p>
   <p>Who purposing to adde increase to this Worke (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the dignity of the Subiect) but prevented by infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and Sicknesse-bringing Death, imparted not only his
good Intentions, but best Collections also unto me, by his
importunacy now perswaded both to correct the Errors,
and perfect so well deserving a VVorke: And had his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
beene wanting, the respect and honour I owe to this
Royall City (the tender Mother and Nurse to us both)
had beene incitement enough to further a Booke of such
consequence, as far as my weake abilities would give leave.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
Having therefore at first drawne a briefe Discourse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
lest I might unadvisedly dash on the Rocks of Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
I delivered it to the Right VVorshipfull, Sir <hi>Henry
Mountague,</hi> then Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> by whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to appeare before your Worships in the Councell
Chamber at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> I received Encouragement and
Authority, with promise of helpe and furtherance, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
this worthy Monument. VVhich accordingly (after
the care and paines of twelve yeeres travell about it) I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto this Honourable Senate, in the yeere 1618.</p>
   <p>But now that I might adde a Complement to this <hi>Survey,</hi>
which might best become it, have I done my diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour
(unto which have I called the assistance of other
learned Antiquaries) to set downe Methodically,<note place="margin">M. D.</note> the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,
Increase, Moderne Estate, and Government of this
City; as also by what Name, or Office rather, whether of
<hi>Port-graves, Port-reeves, Barons, Provosts,</hi> or <hi>Bayliffes,</hi>
the Governours, Rulers, and Magistrates were anciently
distinguished.</p>
   <p>Before all other, I find the name of Alderman, well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
observation, as being derived from most venerable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity:
<note place="margin">C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>mbd. in Brit.</note> For ancient Records say, that in the dayes of King
<hi>Edgar,</hi> there was a worthy Noble man, of the Blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
named <hi>Ailwine,</hi> in great authority and favour with
the King, insomuch that he was therefore termed, <hi>Healf-Koning,</hi>
as much to say, as <hi>Halfe-King;</hi> and by Office was
stiled, <hi>Alderman of all England:</hi> as appeares by this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph
engraven on his Tombe, in that Famous Monastery
(by him founded) in the <hi>Ile of Ely:</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Hic requiescit D. Ailwinus, incliti Regis Edgari Cognatus,
totius Angliae Aldermannus, &amp; huius sacri Coenobii mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culosus
Fundator.</p>
   <p>Here resteth Lord <hi>Ailwine,</hi> Cousin to the Noble King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
Alderman of all England,</hi> and miraculous Founder
of this holy Abbey.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
VVhich plainly sheweth, that in those times of ancient
and venerable respect, this Title of <hi>Alderman,</hi> was only gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
for a further addition of Repute and Honour.</p>
   <p>Some Authors have delivered,<note place="margin">Math. Paris. Geffery Monm. Will, Malmes. Pol▪ Virgil.</note> that men bearing such a
Stile, were sometimes called <hi>Doomesmen,</hi> sometimes <hi>Ealder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Judges of the Kings Courts, &amp;c.</hi> As being distinguished
by those additions of Honour and Esteeme from other men,
for their greater maturity of Iudgement, gravity of yeeres,
experience and person; and therefore the fitter for weighty
imployment in the State-affaires, by apt correspondency of
their trust and fidelity. Which name of dignity declaring
the most eminent degree of Magistracy, doth still (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
it hath) extend it selfe thorowout all <hi>England,</hi> in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Townes, and Corporations; and in some the <hi>Alderman</hi>
only is the chiefe Commander: Even so is it much more
Maiesticall here, in the supreme City of the whole Land,
<hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> the Mother of
authentike Memory, the Ancient and Moderne Seat of our
Kings, yea, the very Chamber Royall for Maiesty it selfe,
and the open Haven for all Merchandise and Commerce,
as being the rich Store-house of Peace and Plenty.</p>
   <p>It shall be needlesse to trouble your Honour, and the rest
of my worthy Masters, with repetition here of those Officers
and Governours, that ruled this Great City in elder times,
because you shall finde them sufficiently set downe in their
apt and distinct places, untill this higher degree of Honour
came to full perfection, I meane the <hi>Maioralty,</hi> which some
hold to be in King <hi>Iohns</hi> time, but most maintaine &amp; avouch
it to bee in the first yeere of King <hi>Richard</hi> the first, whose
Vertue and Courage won him the name of <hi>Cueur-de-lion.</hi>
From which happy beginning, it hath neither beene mine,
nor my most industrious and helpfull Friends good fortune,<note place="margin">W. W.</note>
to ranke downe in formall order the successive line of the
<hi>Sheriffes, Maiors,</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> according to my former
intended purpose, concerning their Birth-place, and Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
nor how many of them this Honourable City it selfe
<pb facs="4"/>
then yeelded, as challenging them her owne Off-spring, she
being as well a loving Mother to breed them in her owne
Bowels, as a carefull Nurse afterward to bring them up.</p>
   <p>For my selfe, <hi>Londons</hi> Off-spring, though the meanest,
yet hold I it no small attribute of Honour to record it, how
much more Glory then for you (equall in worth and ranke)
to reade it, and what comfort for Posterity to remember and
acknowledge it, that this Ancient, Famous, and Renowned
Mother City, never wanted from time to time Honourable
Sonnes of her owne bearing and breeding, to sit at Sterne, to
undergoe all Offices of Credit and Authority, yea, even the
Maioralty, from Father to Son in the third Generation;
and they to boast their Grandfathers, and great Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Witnesse</hi> Garrards. Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>. Branch, &amp;c.</note> borne &amp; bred in this worthy City, some to the fourth,
others the third, but many the second Generation, as in the
Reportary following will more at large appeare.</p>
   <p>I forbeare to speake of such as have beene Aldermen and
Sheriffes;<note place="margin">Witnesse <hi>Barnhams,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son.</note> first, the Fathers; then, the Sonnes; yet neither li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to enioy the Maioralties Dignity. As also what flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
plenty of Magistrates in the same high Office, the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Sheirffes of <hi>England</hi> have yeelded, wherewith the said
Discourse will more familiarly acquaint you.</p>
   <p>And now, let me beseech your Honour and VVorships,
to allow this <hi>Survey of London</hi> your gracious entertainment;
and the rather, for that it now comes in a fairer Volume than
ever, replete with plenty and enlargement of memorable
<hi>Additions,</hi> not only with the splendor of <hi>Armes,</hi> and other
glorious Ensignes of Honour, but with speciall observations
of venerable <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and infinite supplements of Ancient
and Moderne Monuments, as well of the Churches in the
famous Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> as in foure miles
compasse round about them, such as before this instant were
never published.</p>
