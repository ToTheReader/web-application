Yet this hath beene my lot. I heare, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las poore <hi>Burton,</hi> he is crackt. Discontentment, or hope of preferment haue imbarkt him in this perilous aduenture. Such be the censures of the wise world. What shall J say? Am J crackt? Wherewith? Not, J am sure, either with too much learning (as <hi>Festus</hi> charged <hi>Paul,</hi>) or too much liuing. And if I am mad, J am not the first. Euen the Prophets of old were so accounted. When one of them was sent to annoint <hi>Iehu,</hi> his followers said, what said this mad fellow to thee? Yea Christ the Prince of Prophets escaped not this doome: He is mad, why heare yee him? Patiently therefore will J beare his reproach. But am I disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? for what? What need I, when, blessed be my God, I haue enough, no lesse then I desire, and much more, then I

deserue? <hi>Beneest, cui Deus obtulit larca quod satis est manu;</hi> could the wise heathen say. Surely a speech worthy of Christendome:
<q>
         <l>Well is the man whom God (for goods or land)</l>
         <l>Giues, what sufficeth, with a sparing hand.</l>

Or will any man perswade me this is the way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment? Jt is no beaten path, I am sure. Let others, who will, take this way: surely I neuer went it, nor euer meant it, for that end. And y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>as. Nothing more absurd. But a hope to glorifie God, to doe faithfull seruice, and bring some profit to his Church, to my Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, to my Country. And if this should faile in the successe, hope yet for Gods mercy in the rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

For this cause <hi>I</hi> haue with <hi>Moses</hi> chosen rather to suffer affliction with Gods people, then to inioy worldly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments. If J had consulted with flesh and blood, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their councell, I might haue been as worldly wise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as others, and spared my labour, and spent my dayes in a more safe silence, or silent safetie. It was not any blind fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardinesse that pusht me on; J did first cast vp the reckoning, before J began to build. And howsoeuer the building may be impe▪ c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

      </gap> of the Lord Bishop of London, at my first examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about Israels Fast) I haue done nothing, but with a true intent and desire for Gods glory, the good of my King and Country, and the Church of England, whereof we are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and for which I am ready (if need were) to lay down my life. So little doe I esteeme the Serpents hissing, or the dogs barking.</p>
   <p>Not to stay thee too long in the threshold, here take a full view of my answere to a Popish booke bearing in the Front, <hi>A collection of priuate Deuotions,</hi> or, <hi>The houres of Prayer.</hi> If I haue not fully vnfolded the mystery of iniquity wrapped therein, let thy charity pardon my imperfections, and thy sharper judgement supply my defects. Onely, J con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse J haue purposely omitted many things for breuity sake, wherein the Author rather expresseth his popish, if not apish affection, in symbolizing with Iesuiticall catechismes, <hi>Officium B.

      </gap>der the ferula, or censure. Wherein wee might


<pb facs="7"/>
haue shewed the absurdity of Popish distinctions of sinnes mortall and veniall, yea how it verifies and cryes downe the inestimable price of Christs death, and extenuates or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilates the rigor of Gods law, and eleuates or sleights the nature of sinne: the least, deseruing eternall death. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, we might haue shewed, how by Christ al sins are veni-that pardonable: but without Christ, mortal, and vnpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, nable, seeme they neuer so small. Thirdly, we might haue shewed the absurdity of his number of those seuen deadly sins of the: of which ye shall not find the breaches of many of the Commandements of the second table ranked, nor of any of the first Table: as if Athiesme, infidelity, idolatry, blasphemy, periury, profanation of the Sabboth, and the rest, were not deadly sins, but to be reckoned (if the Author account them any sins at all) onely among his venials. But J hope some other will supply, what I haue omitted. Jn the meane time take this in good part, and so Farewell.</p>
