   <head>The wordes of Venerable Bede folowing after the abridgement of this whole history, in the 3. Tome of his workes, which we haue thought good to place here at the ende of the History it selfe.</head>
   <p>THIS much touching the ecclesiasticall history of the
Britons, and especially of the english nation, as I could
lerne by the writinges of my aunceters, by the tradition
of my elders, or by my owne knowleadg, I haue by the helpe
of God, brought vnto this order and issue, I <hi>Bede</hi> the seruaunt
of God, and priest of the monasterie of the blessed Apostles
Peter and Paul at Weimouth. Which being borne in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorie
of the same monastery, when I was seuen yeares of age,
I was deliuered by the handes of my frendes and kinsfolkes to
be brought vp of the most Reuerend Abbat Benet, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to Ceolfrid. From the which time, spending all the daies
of my life, in the mansion of the same monastery, I applied all
my study to the meditation of holy scripture: and obseruing
withal the regular discipline, and keping the daily singing of
Gods seruice in the church, the rest of my time, I was delighted
alwaies, to lerne of other, to teache my selfe, or els to write. In
the xix. yere of my age I was made deacon, and in the xxx.
yeare Priest, Bothe which orders I receaued by the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of the most Reuerend bishop Iohn of Beuerlake
at the commaundement of Ceolfrid my Abbat.
From which time of my priesthood vntell the
yere of my age lix. I haue vpon holy scriptu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re
for my owne instruction and others
partly brestly noted and gathered what
other holy fathers haue writen,
partly I haue at large expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
after the maner of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir
interpration and
meaning.</p>
