To the furtherance of which arte of navigation, the said M.

      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F Astrolabes I haue neuer seene but
three sorts, First that of Stofflerus, which
for these hundred yeares past or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
hath beene had in most price and
estimation, as an instrument containing
all the vses, or at the least the most part
of all other Mathematicall Instruments,
which because it requireth almost for
euerie seuerall Latitude a seuerall Table: Gemma Frisius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
since another kind of Astrolabe, hauing but one Table
to serue for all Latitudes, and therefore he called it the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon,</hi>
that is to say, an vniuersall Astrolabe, which hath also
been most esteemed &amp; vsed many yeres. Since whose time, &amp;
of very late yeares, one of our owne countriemen a Gentleman
of Reading besides London, called M. <hi>Blagraue,</hi> hath greatly
augmented the saide <hi>Catholicon,</hi> and hath thereby as it were
newly inuented a third kind of Astrolabe, which he calleth the
Mathematicall Iewell, whereby are to be wrought more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
then by any other one instrument whatsoeuer, for
which his most excellent inuention vsed therein, he deserueth
great commendation. And to the intent that others which
haue not beene exercised in such thinges, might the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
attaine to the better vnderstanding of the said Iewell: I
haue made a plaine description of all the partes belonging to
the said Iewell, without committing any offence (I hope) to
the Author thereof, to the intent that euery Gentleman might
haue the perfect knowledge and vse of so worthie an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But broade Astrolabes though they be thereby the
truer, yet for that they are subiect to the force of the winde,
<pb facs="291"/>
and thereby euer moouing and vnstable, are nothing meete to
take the altitude of any thing, and specially vppon the Sea,
which thing to auoide, the Spaniards doe commonly make
their Astrolabes or Rings narrow and waightie, which for the
most part are not much aboue fiue inches broad, and yet doe
waigh at the least foure pound, and to that end the lower part
is made a great deale thicker then the vpper part towards the
ring or handle: Notwithstanding most of our English Pilots
that be skilfull, doe make their sea Astrolabes or ringes sixe
or seuen inches broad, and therewith very massiue and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
not easie to be mooued with euery winde, in which the
spaces of the degrees be the larger, and thereby the truer, of
which kinde of Astrolabes or Rings, I shall speake hereafter
in my Treatise of Nauigation, and also of the Mariners
Crosse staffe. But whensoeuer you haue to take the altitude
of the Sunne or of any other starre be in wandering or fixed,
I would wish you to vse the Mariners heauie and massiue
Astrolabe, which in mine opinion for that purpose, is the
sittest and most assured instrument of all others and to finde
out all other conclusions by helpe of Maister <hi>Blagraue</hi> his
Iewell, or rather by helpe of the Celestiall Globe, which
for Astronomicall matters is the perfectest instrument of
all, in which are contained all the starres both southerne and
Northerne that haue beene heretofore knowne, and those
that are lately knowne or shall be knowne hereafter may be
easily placed therein: which thing can not be so well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed
in any Astrolabe were it neuer so great. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Globe is combersome and not portable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
costly, and especially if it bee of any greatnesse, (for
the greater the better) and also if it chance to be broken
in any part of the bodie thereof, it can neuer bee made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
perfectly whole, it is therefore no meete instrument
for euery Mariner to haue, but onely for such as be of good
habilitie, in steede whereof to finde out manye necessarie
conclusions, Maister <hi>Blagraue</hi> his Mathematicall Iewell may
serue verie well, and specially if it had on the backe parte
the like mater and <hi>Rete</hi> or <hi>Nette,</hi> to serue the South Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the worlde as it hath in the fore parte to serue the
<pb n="281" facs="291"/>
North latitude, for then I beleeue verilie, that the chiefest
Sotherne starre, as the Crosse, the Southerne Triangle, Noahs
Doue or Pigeon, and another called <hi>Polophilax,</hi> latelie found
out by such as haue travelled by sea on the South side of
the Equinoctiall, might easilie be placed by Maister <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue</hi>
in that <hi>Rete,</hi> hauing once learned of the skilfull Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
the true longitude, latitude, and declination of the
saide Starres, so shoulde his Iewell in mine opinion bee
much more serviceable to the sea men, then nowe it is, by
reason that those fewe Southerne Starres that be contained
in his first Net, are nothing so nigh vnto the South pole,
as the Northerne Starres described in his first Net, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the North pole, amongst which Northerne Starres, it
were verie necessarie for the Sea men, that the seuen prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Starres as well of the great Beare as of the little Beare,
were all dulie placed in his first Net. Trulie if Master
<hi>Blagraue</hi> his affaires would suffer him to take paine herein,
I beleeue that his Iewell should not be much inferiour to
the celestiall Globe, which indeede it representeth, and
in so doing he should greatly profite the sea men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
thereby great good will and commendations at their
handes.</p>
