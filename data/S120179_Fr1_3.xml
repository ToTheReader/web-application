      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE late gracious acceptance, most worthy yong Prince (with so prompt &amp; welwilling hand, so amiable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant a countenance, and so kinde and courteous words,) of those mine hastie and bold attempted labours, in transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into Latin and English verse the seuerall Precepts and Instructions of our dread Soueraigne your Fathers Maiesties <hi>ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΟΝ ΔΩΡΟΝ,</hi> for your owne sake, and vnto your owne selfe by him so Christianly, fatherly, painfully and learnedly first penned: that <hi>Princes Looking-glasse,</hi> or Princes direction, (for that title or inscription I then thought best befitting such an argument) so benignly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, hath animated and encouraged me once againe, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish vnder your Graces Patrocinie, an other Looking-glasse, to wit, this present <hi>Loyall Subiects Looking-glasse,</hi> or a good subiects Direction, a treatise I suppose in these our last dayes and perillous times, very requisite and necessarie for all Christian subiects, like as was the other for a Christian Prince. A fault I confesse is by me here committed, by this my second so bold an enterprise, but yet <hi>Priùs perspecta clementia, &amp; lenitate tua fretus,</hi> in good hope you will beare with my wants and imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and accept and respect mine heart, and plaine simple well

The euer-liuing God for his annointed Christ Iesus his sake, graunt you his eternall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, grace, and blessing, long and many happy yeares, with your owne hearts desired felicitie, to the aduauncement of Gods honour and glory, to the ioye and comfort of all good faithfull Christian hearts, to the terror of all your, and our forreigne enemies, and home-borne conspirators, and to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie conuersion or vtter confusion of the publique and priuate aduersaries of Gods eternall truth.</p>
