   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, health in the Lord.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight well saith the Wiseman, <hi>(gentle Reader)</hi> that there is nothing new vnder the Sunne; and further, that there is no end of writing bookes: for, how soever in a generality the subiect of any knowledge be declared, yet the particulars, that may bee gathered out of the same, be so manie, as new or more matter may bee produced to write thereof againe; and, as <hi>Horace</hi> also affirmeth, it is hard to entreate of any subiect, that hath not beene formerly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by some other. Wherefore seeing that of all the benefits that ever Almighty God bestowed on man from the creation of the world, as there is none more glorious &amp; admirable, thē the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his owne deare, &amp; welbeloved Son to vs, &amp; for vs to be crucified: so likewise I thought it best to bestow these my first labours in the meditation of his passion; because that of all the duties that man can do, or are required of man to be done vnto God, there is none so high, nor so acceptable vnto him, as to imbrace the same, his crucified, and passionate sonne by faith in our hearts, (which must not only be done for our owne pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, or private vse, but also to endeavour our selues, to helpe &amp; further others in the same.) For, it is the only doctrine, that availeth with God, the key also to binde and loose sinners, the touchstone to try all doctrines, the lanterne &amp; light that scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth and expelleth the mist and darknes of all hypocrisie, and a preservatiue against all errour and heresie, the mother of all goodworkes, the earnest of everlasting life, and title whereby we challenge our inheritance. And also, it is the only motiue, that I might in all humblenesse of duty, with these or such like meditations, end and spend the rest of my time in the divine service of my Lord Iesus, that hath called me from teaching of
<pb facs="5"/>
Schoole, and brevity in writing, to become a Minister, for to instruct, and labour in the vineyard of the Lord. Wherefore <hi>(Gentle Reader)</hi> if I, that spent the whole prime of my youth in that forme or faculty, be now applyed vnto better labours, thinke though it be <hi>Serò,</hi> yet it is <hi>Seriò;</hi> and though these my first endeavors begin but in the Autumne, or declining of my age, yet doubt not, by the helpe of God they will continue the time of my whole life. Hoping you will grace mee with your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable suspence, vntill my deeds proue my doctrine; in which hope I kindly present you this <hi>Treatise,</hi> entituled my Saviours Crosse. The which if you balance with the zeale of my minde, I shalbe sure you will not mislike it, in regard of the matter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though happily you may finde some distast in the method. For, what can be more commodious to reviue, &amp; preserue the soule of a good Christian, then a serious meditation in the doctrine of our Saviours bitter <hi>Passion?</hi> which is the summe of my smal and vnlearned <hi>Treatise.</hi> Wherefore if you looke in the booke of God, where this my draught would draw you, you woulde not only finde there sufficient salue to cure your owne soule, which conteines the full satisfaction of these my labours; but also it would be a motiue to animate me forwards to continue my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in the like studies. In which hope of your zealous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsing and dayly practising of the same, I commit my selfe, and my booke, to your favourable censure, praying the Almighty, to giue you such spirituall refreshing vnto your soule, that neither Sathan may deceiue you, nor the Law terrifie you, but that you may rightly enioy the abundance of Gods mercies. <hi>Vale in Christo.</hi>
