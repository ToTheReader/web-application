concerning Christ Iesus his Sonne our Lord, saying, <hi>Heare
him. In the beginning was the word, yet that word was before all

before the <hi>Word:</hi> Therefore is the Fore-runner <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>
called, <hi>The voyce of a Cryer in the Wildernesse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="2"> That is most true: For Christ is the <hi>Cryer,</hi>

      <hi>If wee will neither heare Voyce, nor Cry, nor the
voyce of the</hi> Cryer; <hi>How doe wee thinke God should lend
an eare to our voyce when we cry vnto him? Is it not iust
with God to say vnto vs,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Prouerbs 1.</note> Because I haue called, and yee haue
refused; I haue stretched out mine hand, and none will regard:
Therefore you shall call vpon me, but I will not answer; you shall
seeke me earely, but you shall not finde me. Thinke on this, ye that
forget God, yee that suffer Christ to call and cry vnto you, <hi>by his</hi>
Preachers, <hi>and ye regard not.</hi> Consider this ye great ones, lest
God lay your honour in the dust: yee mighty, lest the Almighty
throw you downe, and there be none to helpe you vp, lest he tumble
you from your seate, and set in your places the humble and
meeke.</p>
   <p n="5"> Doe yee refuse to heare the still voyce of the Cryer, take
heede lest the shrill Cryer himselfe cry against you with his great
Voyce, which is Powerfull,<note place="margin">Psal. 29.</note> full of Maiesty, breaking the Cedars,
yea the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> euen the great ones,<note place="margin">4.</note> diuiding the

thinke not themselues too many, nor the Cleriques too clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall,
nor the mighty too maiesticall to attend the voyce of the Lord.

the lowdnesse thereof: Know ye, it calleth to them that are gone
as farre off from God, as the Prodigall was into a farre Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and these haue need of a Trumpet to recall them. If it be too
plaine for Clearenesse, know yee, it is the euidence of the spirit of
God that you might distinctly discerne what is spoken, proclamed
and sounded, that so you might prepare your selues vnto the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.
A lamentable woe would it be vnto you all, if the voyce of
all such as cry vnto you from the Lord, should be the vncertaine
and hoarse voyces of Hereticall, Schysmaticall, Atheisticall, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisticall,
prophane, vaine deceiuers.</p>
   <p n="7"> For you know, that if the sonnes of men, who are ordayned,
and set apart for this businesse of the Lord, doe not lift vp their
voyces like Trumpets, and tell <hi>Iacob</hi> their sinnes, and <hi>Israel</hi> their
transgressions, God will open the mouth of an Asse to reproue
them, yea God will cause things without life, the stone in the
wall, and the beame in the house, to cry out against them.
