   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was well saide of that Italian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,<note place="margin">Machiauel. de repub.</note> for all refined pollicies of this last age: That the world must be sicke and purged also before it die. Wherein what the great Physition hath from time to time practised vpon that vaste bodie somtime by fire, sometime by water, &amp; generally by many great, &amp; cōmon destructions, euery generation and story are perpetuall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses: and Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> most passionately doth expresse and bewaile, writing thus against <hi>Iouinian:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Libro primo contra Iouin.</note>
      <hi>Succrescit silua vt succidatur.</hi> Howbeit a better Prophet prognosticated of some more speciall diseases which should befall, and possesse the wayward, crasie, &amp; most distēpered old age of the world, auouching by the spirit,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. v. 1.</note> that in the last dayes men should bee full of selfe loue, couetousnesse, pride, wantonnesse, and such like (which the learned haue obserued, and found to be the root and causes of all heresies;) as also disobedient and breakers of oath and promises, from whence haue proceeded the manifold Sects, Schismes, and personall separations disturbing alwaies the outward peace, &amp; quiet gouernment of the Church of God. For the mitigating and repressing whereof (because they can neuer wholly be cured, or taken away:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. Math. 13.</note> for there must be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and Coccle, tares, and darnell will be sowed, and must grow amongst the best corne, and croppe vntill the end) it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christ, the soules sole Physition and great protector of his
<pb facs="6"/> Church, to substitute the Ministery and Magistracy; whereby as Chirurgians and his owne hands in those his ordinances, to apply sundry kinds of remedies, to so many and diuers mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; both which working diuersly, yet to one and the same end, partly by the word and spirit, and partly by the ciuill sword, doe hold vp, as well the generall frame, and compage of the whole body, as the estates of all particular Churches and Common wealths, vntill the day of perfect recuring and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all things come. Now the physicke and Cure committed to the hand of the Church (which is the subiect matter of my treatise ensuing) may for our better discerning and handling the same for this present, not vnfitly bee matched with the termes and parts made, and giuen by the learned to that happy art, whereby the life and health of the lesser world, mans body is procured, and maintained. Which being by the vsuall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count three in number, namely <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, may for breuity &amp; order sake, be reduced to the three special heads, to which I haue referred this my so termed threefold Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, and desired to apply the same to our present state in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, being now by God his blessing (if all had eies or grace to see it) as was sometimes said of Rome and Athens <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: euen a little world, or a briefe and Epitome of all God his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies elsewhere bestowed vpon all the Churches, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths in the world. Vnderstanding by the first thereof Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication (which comprizeth vnder it, as a part for the whole, exhortations, admonitions, reprehensions, threatnings, confession, absolution, and such like) all these meanes which the ministery and power of the keies may by the word and spirit prescribe at any time, for the purging and healing so many soules sicknesses, which the whole Church for this life, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member thereof, is continually subiect vnto. And by the second, termed Subscription, answering to that second general
<pb facs="6"/> part of physicke, called <hi>Hygeine,</hi> in respect of the nature, end and manifold vse therof; we meane all wholsome decrees, Councils priuate or publique, and constitutions of the Church, by which the trueth of doctrine, amidst the manifold differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and contrarily minded people in the world may be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and maintained, the inward peace of each conscience more fully and safely secured, and the outward order of euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church better established and defended against al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of oppositions, by turbulent spirits in that behalfe, and the iust temper of the whole body of Christ, by all good meanes, &amp; wise foresight cont nued throughout the world. And lastly, by the Crosse, which I haue made the noble Hierog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>yphicon of all other decent ceremonies to bee vsed at any time in the Church of God; I vnderstand all comely ornaments, whereby as well Christ his Ministers, according to their differences, degrees &amp; dignittes; as all other things belonging to the least performance and holy administration in God his seruice may and ought to be beautified, decked and adorned: all scarres and defects natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally or by euill euent incident to any Church, healed, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and the most naturall sweet colour, vigour, and beautie of Christ his Spouse, be made resplendent, and apparant to the whole world, with all other properties and effects, which that decoratiue art, and last part of Physicke is knowne, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated to bring to passe in mans body▪ all which as in those last dangerous dayes they haue been much incombred by the hands and meanes of Schismatikes, Atheists, Churchrobbers, and such like, of the prophane &amp; cursed crue of so many heathenish people, that haue rushed into Gods inheritance as <hi>Psal. 80. v. 1.</hi> and no lesse tortured and afflicted now a long time with all kind of spirituall diseases and enormities, and euen brought (as they say) to the last cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>; so stand they now in need, if euer, to be releeued with all the best antidotes and electuaries, which
<pb facs="7"/> from both hands of Ministery and Magistracy the Lord is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (as <hi>Esay. 42. ver 21.</hi>) if men also would do their parts at all wants. And assaies most readily to affoord; and indeed, now is the time spoken of by the Prophet: <hi>Psal. 119. ver. 126.</hi> for the Lord to put to his hand; for men haue destroied, and euen with plague and pestilence (as the Septuagints render it) wasted and adnulled his Lawe, and all the meanes for the magnifying and exalting the same, as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> complaineth in the place aboue named. Howbeit because purging medicines, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the highest kind and degree, such as Excommunication, hath proportion vnto, are very seldome, and with greatest care to be vsed; it hath been the iudgement, and resolue of our late graue Diuines, and very worthy and wise gouernours, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of that thrice reuerend <hi>Whitgift,</hi> that considering these late turbulent times, very little or nothing at all should be spoken or written touching the true nature, power, vse, and necessity of that great and high censure. But now that it hath pleased God by the eye and care of our most noble Soueraigne, to appoint a couragious prudent <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the place and roome of that renowned <hi>Philip</hi> for his wisedome, meeknesse, and sweet moderation of all things belonging to Ecclesiasticall affayres (whilst he sate at that stearne, and hath withall enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged somewhat his vergee power, by putting the garments of <hi>Aaron,</hi> as <hi>Exod. 28. vers. 2.</hi> vpon his shoulders, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the golden rodde as well as the pot of Manna and tables of the Lawe to his speciall custody: I holde it high time for all sorts of persons, and especially of our owne tribe, to vse all good meanes for the repayring the manifold breaches, irruptions, and depopulations before mentioned, and the giuing and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vpon Ierusalem beauty in stead of ashes, the oyle of ioy for mourning, and the garment of gladnesse for the spirit of heauinesse, as was prophecied and promised by the prophet
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>Esay 61. vers. 3.</hi> to come to passe in these dayes of the Gospell and greatest grace, and would no doubt, but for the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, contempt, and neglect of both, be fully effected and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished. In which respect if all meanes were summed vp together, I presume none would be found so excellently vsefull, and absolutely necessay as Excommunication &amp; Subscription, which therefore I haue placed in the forefront; the one contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in it and requiring by it, a iust power to be inuested in the sacred ministery, for the establishing all due meanes for the soules health, and recouering the same once lost or decayed: the other prouiding a constant, vniforme, and certaine course and order for the executing and obseruing most precisely euery the least thing once enacted and so appointed, as without which indeed it is impossible any where to vphold a comfortable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, or that the Magistrate should be able to retaine any meanes in any for me or due tenor for Gods seruice, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peace, iustice, and equity amongst men; for want also whereof, any may perceiue how little profit hath been made of so long and much preaching in this kingdome, arising chiefly from so many differences, new inuentions, and extrauagant courses as well in preaching as in infinite strange opinions, and vnheard of new and vaine doctrines broached and scattered in euery country, Church &amp; corner: insomuch as I may too too truely say, the cause of so litle religion in the world is, for that there hath been of late &amp; now also is so much religion, I meane so much padling and medling in it, and so many kinds and meanes vnrepressed, and not so seuerely proceeded or seriously prouided against of euery mās deuice to expresse it. And which is treason to attempt in state affayres once appointed by men, is now admired and magnified, and not only admitted, or at the least wise permitted and winked at in Gods matters; which a good writer seeing, and foreseeing, complayned of long sithēce
<pb facs="8"/> in this manner: <hi>Ratinnculis &amp; sermonibus de religione sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisticis inhiant iam omnes etiam ex ima plebe, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>bis &amp; pascuis armenta,</hi> with many other such like words and matter to that purpose, the summe &amp; sence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is according to our former inference, that whilst euery one is bold, and taketh liberty to himselfe to dispute and dispose of Religion in generall, and the highest and chiefest points there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; it is come to passe that they haue in them no true or sound religion at all,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. vers. 5. with 1. Tim. 4. vers. 1.</note> but to end as we began with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> his prophesie, most make a shew of godlinesse, but deny the power thereof, and to become flat Apostates at the lest to deny the faith, that is all true Religion, the Church, God and all. For my part,<note place="margin">In Epist. res. pons. ad Augu.</note> albeit I could wish according to the old word; <hi>Da mihi medicum canum canillis,</hi> that as <hi>Hierome</hi> told <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> all mens endeuours in this kind were like the steps of the weried Ox, that fastneth sure footing wheresoeuer he goeth; yet obseruing as <hi>Camerarius</hi> doth the like in the practise of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> and <hi>Theucidides,</hi>
      <note place="margin">In his notes vpon Theu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidides.</note> how yong vpstarts and Emperick mountebankes are too bold &amp; aduenturous to offer their drugs in this behalfe, I meane much loose, old, and disguised stuffe without new matter or better forme and order (both which, or at the least the latter ought to be discerned in euery new work) and that euen at the games of <hi>Olympus:</hi> and how withall our auncients for dayes, as <hi>Elihu</hi> termeth them (who indeede should speake by word and writing to this cause) doe sit still in that their politique resolue vpon <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, or like <hi>Ruben Iudg. 5. vers. 16.</hi> are content to abide all their liues priuate, by their sheepfolds, notwithstanding the much bleating of their owne and other flocks: the indignation of the matter on both sides hath drawne and enforced me to this second aduenture, and to say with <hi>Elihu,</hi> Who can in such a cause refraine from speaking and writing also, especially in the behalfe of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
<pb facs="8"/> and Subscription, whose reproch redounding so to God and his Church, I haue so often heard? and for which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely (some may say) and I must needs acknowledge) my selfe haue payed so decre, and can yet be c nten, and will be most willing to be more vile (as he said) yea if it could be so purchased with name, liuing and life it selfe to redeem the great good and consequence of them both to the present state of our Church, to wh ch I haue adressed and after my manner prepared this poor Antidote, desiring GOD that it may sort to none other euent &amp; end then I aymed at &amp; propounded to my selfe in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; which is and euer shall be partly to stir vp others of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ability to some better seruice in this kynd, as also to cause much other of th kind and quality spent already and truely meant that way, to be reuiued againe, and by this meanes if it may be to worke the better: the issue whereof I commit and commend to the hand and blessing of that great physition that came to heale the sores &amp; repayre the decayes of our nature,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. vers. 17.</note> and tooke vpon him our infirmities, and cured all our diseases, as it is in the Gospell, euen Iesus Christ, the Prince and author of all health and saluation, who is God blessed for euer. Amen.</p>
