      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Panish is a speech, whereof in times past (in Spaine) there hath beene fower kinds vsed:<note place="margin">
         <p>Fower sorts of Spanish.</p>
         <p n="1">
            <hi>1.</hi> Biskay toong most ancient. This toong drawen from the Caldean.</p>
      </note> The first and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientest is the <hi>Biskaine,</hi> which was the speech of the prouince of <hi>Biskay</hi> and <hi>Nauarre:</hi> it hath his originall from the Caldean toong, as the learned in them both affirme, to whome it plainly appeereth that this is of greatest antiquitie.</p>
   <p>The next is that which was spoken in the kingdom of <hi>Granado,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <p n="2">2. Arabique toong in olde time vsed in Granado, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daluzia, Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, and Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it in the pronunciation of these letters, <hi>ç, g, j, x, z.</hi>
         </p>
         <p n="3">
            <hi>3.</hi> Catalan toong or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uençal, a kinde of French, had originall from Gāscoigne, and was vsed in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taluña, Malor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Juiça, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deña.</p>
         <p n="4">
            <hi>4.</hi> The Spanish now vsed.</p>
         <p>Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall toong.</p>
      </note> and in parte in the kingdomes of <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luzía, Valencia,</hi> and <hi>Aragon,</hi> and was the Arabique, whose originall is the Hebrewe almost among them quite worne out, yet to this daie they keepe the pronunciation of some of their letters still, as <hi>ç, G, j, X, Z.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The thirde is the <hi>Catalan,</hi> which is a kinde of French, and had his beginning from the prouince of Gascoigne, from the ancient citie Limojes: they spake this in the kingdoms of <hi>Cataluna, Mallorca, Menorca, Iuiça</hi> and <hi>Cerdena.</hi> This Cáta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan toong was called Prouençal: and the Italians confesse that the Prouençals were the first inuentors of their rimes and verses, which are so much prised in Italie where <hi>Petraque, Boccace,</hi> and <hi>Dante,</hi> giue some testimonie in retaining their wordes in manie places.</p>
   <p>The fourth is that which is now at this day commonly vsed and spoken thorowe all Spaine, and is called <hi>Léngua vulgár,</hi> the mother toong, otherwise <hi>Léngua Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellána,</hi> or <hi>Española,</hi> the Castilian or Spanish toong, principally vsed in Aragon, Andalucia, Múrcia, Castilla, Nuéeua, and Veja, León: also in Portugall, although the Portugall toong haue such difference in certaine wordes and pronunciations, that it may well be called a language by it selfe, euen as the English and Scottish, yet in truth, it is not so seuered, but that they sprange from one fountaine, and haue one descendence.</p>
   <p>This <hi>Lengua vulgár</hi> or Spanish toong draweth his originall from the Latine or Romaine, and bicause the Romaine conquerours were most politicke in proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the continuance of their estates &amp; language to their posteritie, by planting where they woone,<note n="*" place="margin">
         <p>A Colonie is a place vnhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whither people are sent to dwell: or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sent to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite such place: or a citie, the people whereof once came from another citie or countrey.</p>
         <p>Why the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish keepeth so much of the Latine.</p>
         <p>Andaluzia, whereof first so named.</p>
      </note> Colonies and garrisons; as also not permitting any stranger to the priuiledge of their lawes or freedome of their townes, to buie, sell, or traffique, but in the Romaine or Latine toong, as in Spaine they haue done: Therefore the Spanish retaineth still to this daie so much of the Latine toong. And by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Incursion and ouerrunning of so many strange nations, as the <hi>Africans</hi> inhabiting about <hi>Carthage,</hi> called <hi>Carthaginians, Gothes, Huns,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> which ceased not till they had ouerrunne the most part of Europe, yet so setled themselues in <hi>Andaluzia</hi> in Spaine, that they called it by their owne name Vandaluzia or Vandalia of <hi>Vandalles,</hi> as also Africans inhabiting Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania called Moores, whose first comming in, proceeded from the licentious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="6"/> and vnbrideled lust of <hi>Don Rodrígo</hi> then king,<note place="margin">Howe the Moores first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Spaine. Chro. of Spaine.</note> in dishonouring and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowring a ladie called <hi>Cáva</hi> the daughter of earle <hi>Iulian,</hi> one of his nobles.</p>
   <p>By meanes heereof, this language remaineth so altered and changed from his owne first propertie and nature, admitting wordes, accents, and pronunciations of other strange nations, as it is become a language of it selfe compounded of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and aboue named toongs: but yet so, that it hath much more of the Latine then of all the other, whereby it may be called the Latine toong altered or corrupted.</p>
   <p>For Spanish wordes comming from the Latine, marke the table heere following and their like.</p>
   <p>Spanish wordes drawen from the Moorish toong begin much with <hi>Al,</hi> as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cúza,</hi> a vessell for oyle: <hi>Alfidél,</hi> or <hi>Alfilér,</hi> a pin: <hi>Almúd,</hi> a measure, a pecke: <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarísmo,</hi> Arithmeticke: <hi>Almoháda,</hi> a pillow, &amp;c. or in <hi>ç,</hi> as <hi>çaherír,</hi> to vpbraid, <hi>çahórda,</hi> a hogstie: or sounde on <hi>r,</hi> or <hi>x, Almaráxa,</hi> an ewer of glasse: <hi>Xabón</hi> soape: <hi>Almoradúx,</hi> marjoram: <hi>Arredrár,</hi> to driue away: <hi>Arrélde,</hi> fower pounde waight, &amp;c. also in <hi>z,</hi> as <hi>Zagál,</hi> a shepheard. And at this day the Moores in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Spanish for <hi>júro a Dios,</hi> I sweare by God, they saie <hi>jureux a Deux:</hi> for <hi>Hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,</hi> they say <hi>Homber,</hi> for <hi>Vuéstra mercéd,</hi> your worship or mastership, they saie <hi>Voxár mérxe.</hi>
