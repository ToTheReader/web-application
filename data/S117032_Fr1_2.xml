      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, that which of late I commended in a Sermon as a gift, to a couple of my friends, vpon their mariage day, as the best thing I had to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on them, for their then (as we call it) entring vpon the world, the same (being ouercome by intreaties to put it into print) do I here present to you, as a meet

implement for you at your now first beginning to keepe house. If God shall moue your heart (as I trust he hath begun to do, and will more) to the entertainment of that Lesson, which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall subiect of this Sermon, it will bring that vpon you, which is onely able to make you rich, (<hi>the blessing of God</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">Pro. 10.22.</note>) and be better to you then all that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward estate, which either you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready haue, or are in possibilitie hereafter to enioy Whatsoeuer of the worlds is now yours, either in possession or in expectation, may be either wasted greatly, or lost wholy, but that which <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.5.</note>,

is that <hi>durable riches</hi> which the <note n="c" place="margin">Pro 8.18</note> Wiseman speakes of, and that <note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 10.42.</note>
      <hi>good part</hi> which can neuer be withdrawne. As therefore in your childhood (in the seasoning whereof with the rudiments of Religion &amp; Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, my selfe by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence bare a part) by the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of your disposition, and tractablenes in the best things, you gaue much hope, and haue since both answered and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it by shunning the atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call profanenes of these godles times, so goe on I pray you, and increase, &amp; whatsoeuer the guise of others be, who thinke religion is to be made shew of, no where

but at Church, yet lay you the foundation of your family, with the noble resolution of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Iosua, <hi>I and my house will serue the Lord</hi>
      <note n="e" place="margin">Ios. 24.15.</note>. Hereof this Sermon may be vnto you, when you shall please to looke theron, a very fit Remembrance.
