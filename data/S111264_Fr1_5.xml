   <p>LIttle I hope, needeth me at large to discourse the first Originall of Aeglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, hauing alreadie touched the same. But for the vvord Aeglogues I knovv is vnknowen to most, and also mistaken of some the best learned (as they think) I vvyll say somevvhat thereof, being not at all impertinēt to my present purpose.</p>
   <p>They vvere first of the Greekes the inuentours of them called Aeglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaj as it vvere <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. that is Goteheards tales. For although in Virgile and others the speakers be most shepheards, and Goteheards, yet Theocritus in whom is more ground of authoritie, then in Virgile, this specially from that deriuing, as from the first head and vvelspring the vvhole Inuericion of his Aeglogues, maketh Goteheards the persons and authors of his tales. This being, vvho seeth not the grossenesse of such as by colour of learning would make vs beleeue that they are more rightly termed Eclogai, as they vvould say, extraordinary discourses of vnnecessarie matter, vvhich difinition albe in substaunce and meaning it agree with the nature of the thing, yet nowhit answereth with the <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> and interpretation of the word. For they be not termed Eclogues, but Aeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues. vvhich sentence this authour very vvell obseruing, vpon good iudgement, though indeede fevv Goteheards haue to doe herein, nethelesse doubteth not to cal thē by the vsed and best knovven name. Other curious discourses hereof I reserue to greater occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. These xij. Aeclogues euery where answering to the seasons of the tvvelue monthes may be vvell deuided into three formes or ranckes. For eyther they be Plaintiue, as the first, the sixt, the eleuenth, &amp; the twelfth, or recreatiue, such as al those be, vvhich conceiue matter of loue, or commendation of special personages, or Moral: vvhich for the most part be mixed with some Satyrical bitternesse, namely the second of reuerence devve to old age, the fift of coloured deceipt, the seuenth and ninth of dissolute shepheards &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, the tenth of contempt of Poetrie &amp; pleasaunt vvits. And to this diuision may eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing herein be reasonably applyed: A few onely except, vvhose speciall purpose and meaning I am not priuie to. And thus much generally of these xij. Aeclogues. Now vvill vve speake particularly of all, and first of the first. vvhich he calleth by the first monethes name Ianuarie. wherein to some he may seeme fovvly to haue faulted, in that he erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously beginneth with that moneth, vvhich beginneth not the yeare. For it is welknown and stoutely mainteyned vvith stronge reasons of the learned, that the yeare beginneth in March. for then the sonne renevveth his finished course, and the seasonable spring refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth the earth, and the pleasaunce thereof being buried in the sadnesse of the dead winter novv vvorne avvay, reliueth. This opinion maynteine the olde Astrologers and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, namely the reuerend Andalo, and Macrobius in his holydayes of Saturne, which accoumpt also vvas generally obserued both of Grecians and ROmans. But sauing the leaue of such learned heads, vve mayntaine a custome of coumpting the seasons from the moneth Ianuary, vpon a more speciall cause, then the heathen Philosophe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of his birth in the ende of the last yeere and beginning of the next. vvhich reckoning, beside that eternall monument of our saluation, leaneth also vppon good proofe of
<pb facs="5"/>
special iudgemēt. For albeit that in elder-times, vvhen as yet the coumpt of the yere was not perfected, as aftervvarde it was by Iulius Caesar, they began to tel the monethes from Marches beginning, and according to the same God (as is sayd in Scripture) comaunded the people of the Ievves to count the moneth Abil, that vvhich vve call March, for the first moneth, in remembraunce that in that moneth he brought them out of the land of Aegipt: yet according to tradition of latter times it hath bene othervvise obserued, both in gouernment of of the church, and rule of Mightiest Realmes. For from Iulius Caesar vvho first obserued the leape yeere vvhich he called Bissextilem Annum, and brought in to a more certain course the odde vvandring dayes vvhich of the Greekes vvere called <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> . of the Romanes intercalares (for in such matter of learning I am forced to vse the termes of the learned) the monethes haue bene nombred xij. vvhich in the first ordinaunce of Romulus vvere but tenne, counting but CCCiiij. dayes in euery yeare, and beginning with March. But Numa Pompilius, vvho vvas the father of al the Romain ceremonies and religion, seeing that reckoning to agree neither vvith the course of the sonne, nor of the Moone, therevnto added tvvo monethes, Ianuary and February: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it seemeth, that vvise king minded vpon good reason to begin the yeare at Ianuarie, of him therefore so called tanquam Ianua anni the gate and entraunce of the yere, or of the name of the god Ianus, to which god for that the old Paynims attributed the byrth &amp; beginning of all creatures nevv comming into the vvorlde, it seemeth that he therfore to him assigned the beginning and first enrraunce of the yeare. vvhich account for the most part hath hetherto continued. Notvvithstanding that the Aegiptians beginne theyr yeare at September, for that according to the opinion of the best Rabbins, and very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the scripture selfe, God made the vvorlde in that Moneth, that is called of them Tisri And therefore he commaunded them, to keepe the feast of Pauilions in the end of the yeare, in the xv. day of the seuenth moneth, vvhich before that time was the first.</p>
   <p>But our Authour respecting nether the subtiltie of thone parte, nor the antiquitie o thother, thinketh it fittest according to the simplicitie of commen vnderstanding, to be gin vvith Ianuarie, wening it perhaps no decoru, that Sepheard should be seene in ma ter of so deepe insight, or canuase a case of so doubtful iudgment. So therefore beginne<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
