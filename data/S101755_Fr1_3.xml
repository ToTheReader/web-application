The true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstāding of our beléefe is the pure gyft of God, and among his gifts the chiefest Beleefe with knowledge of Gods word, ordereth the minde, gouerneth the body, dyrecteth all our workes and affayres, teachinge what wée ought to doo, and what to leaue vndone, without whiche neither can King, Lord nor subiect, well order them selues, nor those things that bée committed to theyr charge. Nowe if we esteeme other things to be of valewe and can prayse them: your honour kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that the knowledge of true beléefe grounded vpon Gods word, doth so farre excell all other things, as heauenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures excell the commodityes of the earth. And this is moste profitable to kinges, Dukes, Earles, and Lords, (as
<pb facs="3"/>
appeareth in the 2. Psalme, Deutero. 17 chap. and Esay 46. chap. where they be named the nurces of religion) and vnto all other degrées spyrituall or temporal. And vaine are all men which know not this truely. And S. Paule sayde because it séemed not good to them to haue the knowledge of Gods word, he gaue them vp into a lewd mind, &amp; to all vncleanes, For if God be the lyght, suche as knowe him not stumble in darknes. If he be the only way, the ignoraunt go stray. If he be the trueth, they that knowe him not be deceyued. If he be onely good, all good thinges must be borrowed and craued of him alone. If all knowledge &amp; learning be his, wée must be Gods scholars. If he be life, not to knowe him his eternall death. For it is written, this is eternall lyfe, to know Iesus Christ whome thou hast sent to be very god. But this know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge muste wée haue and learne in the scriptures, as S. Paule sayth, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is profytable to teach, to controll, to amende, and to instruct in all ryghteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="4"/>
that the offyce of saluation is lyttle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: But this myngle mangle of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and temporall regiment, is vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by them, as if no Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat ordained of God, sufficed to redresse such abuses. What maruell if mans or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynaunces be broken, where the ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of God is playnlye resysted. Also in the country where most nede of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and instruction is, there bée ydell chaplaynes, which possesse and withhold the Preachers liuings, and most special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in the Cathedrall Churches: many of the which bée but onely a very refuge and denne of ydell, ignoraunt, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching lubbers. Is not the ordinance of God, and good meaninges of noble founders broken here? Is not his procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation disobeyed, who proclaymed by the mouth of saint Paul, hée who labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not, ought not to eate?

Tite, and many others. If we do alowe the order of the primatiue &amp; holy aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church, let vs folow their examples. Beholde the fathers, as Origine, Cipri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Ambrose, Iherom, Augustine, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, and others, who spent the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test part of their lyues in preaching and teachinge the people, as appeareth by their workes, which be for the most part Sermons, Lessons, Homelies, disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and confutations of heresies in their tymes. They preached on the son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes and expoūded the scriptures. And on the wéeke dayes they procured theyr Sermons and expositions to be written. There were no pluralities of liuings in those dayes, neither dispensations, Tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quottes, nor Residences, qualifications, nor improperations. Chyldrē and boyes enioyed no Benefices in those dayes by no manner of means, or considerations to come.

And that wicked Idolatrous murderers of Gods people, and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his word and lawes, may be cut off, that Gods wrathe and indignation maye bee pacifyed by amendemente, accordynge to Goddes expresse woorde, Deuteromie thyrtéene Chapter: Thine eye shall not pyttye suche one, nor shewe mercye to him, but hee shall bée slayne. And so shalte thou take the euyll awaye foorth of the myddes of thee, sayeth the Lorde God. (Reade the whole Chapter.) Also Saint Paule to the Hebrewes the tenth Chapter. If he that despiseth Moises Lawe, ought to dye without mercie, howe muche more punishment deserueth hee that treadeth vnder foote the sonne of God, and coūteth the blood of the newe Testament an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holie thing?
