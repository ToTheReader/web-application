   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E that feasts high Estates, must seeke
out for forraine Cookeries, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall
dishes to please their pallats;
but hee that in true charitie inuites
home his plaine honest neighbours,
doth well enough if he prouide such homely fare
as shall be competent and befitting men of meaner
qualitie: It is the plaine Country-man I feast, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the <hi>Good-man;</hi> And therefore for
thee <hi>Reader</hi> to expect any curious Diuision, rare In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention,
or Rhetoricall composition in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
would be as vaine and idle, as to hope to
meet with puft paste at a Plow-mans table.</p>
   <p>As for those who driue their flockes vpon the
mountain tops, for euery speare of grasse they there
spie growing,<note place="margin">Qui sua metitur pondera ferre po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. Martial.</note> I neither enuie them, nor dare fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, for I confesse ingenuously my abilitie
and gifts will not suffer me: Or if they would, yet
I would forbeare, and rather chuse to feed my sheep
in the valleyes where is grasse enough, handling
the Doctrine of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Good life,</hi> than to trauell
in the controuerted points of Predestination, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
Church-gouernments, &amp;c. for hee is blinde
who sees not that mens braines are full, but their
<pb facs="6"/>
hearts are emptie. Our tongues runne ouer, but for
twentie good words, we haue not one good work;
which is our shame.</p>
   <p>If then thou louest not plainnesse, lay this booke
by, for such as loue it; for though such diet be not
for thy tooth, yet there are thousands of good
soules, who like better with such pulse, than with
daintier fare, growing faster in knowledge, and
stronger in the Faith, with such plaine Instructions,
than by more learned Treatises. But if thou be such
a one as desirest rather to haue thy conscience, than
thy curiositie satisfied; thy heart seasoned, and
soule profited, than thy eares tickled with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singnesse
of words; thou art hee for whom this
was penned: And thou art welcome. I haue said;
doe thou reade; God blesse thy reading. And doe
thou remaine mine, as I am</p>
