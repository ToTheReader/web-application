teach us, that as Piety and Iustice are
the pillars of a State, and the Countrey
happy (as none more than ours) whose
King is endued with them, seeing people
commonly follow their example; so most fortunate is the
Land, where a most wise King substitutes such officers of
State, as whose piety, justice, charity, and other vertues,
may be a comfort, rule, and example to the people, over
whom God and their King hath placed them: That this
reflecteth upon you my Lord, none of our Nation is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of understanding as to question; upon which assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

I have adventured this dedication to your Lordship,

there can be no clouded mystinesse cast betwixt a candide
