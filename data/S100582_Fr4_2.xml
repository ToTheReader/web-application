   <head>A small Preface vnto the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten Reader.</head>
   <p>FOr so muche as this Image of both churchs, or exposition vpon S. Iohns Apocalipsis, seemed vnto me (as it came vnto the printing) to be farre to much for one volume. I thought to deuide it by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall porcions into three smal bookes, as I haue now done in deede. Of whom the firste contayneth x. Chapter, the second vii. &amp; the third v. onely, which maketh out the whole number of the xxii. Some peraduenture wil maruel, that the smaller nūber of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chapters should comprehend so much of that commē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie as the greater number. But if they marke in the text, the aboundinge of miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries euermore as the matter thereof aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, they will soone leaue their marueiling. The nature of this reuelation is, the further it goeth, the more wonders it sheweth &amp; ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neth vnto hym that after praier shal in faith reade it and deserne it. Neuer therin are the principles well perceiued, till the conclusion thervpon folowinge doth playnely with the other scriptures conferred, declare them.</p>
   <p>In these v. last chapters are the two chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (wherevpon resteth the whole argumēt of this booke) fully by all dew circumstaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces described, thē turned ouer into a moste fearefull and terrible destruction, vnder title of the olde whorish Babilon, the other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning a moste glorious rayse, vnder the name of the holy new Hierusalem.</p>
   <p>In the xvij<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Chapter is that execrable
<pb facs="312"/>
churche of antichrist with hyr filthye wares and occupings painted out hereof the holye Ghost, &amp; with hir most horrible fal in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> end, hir worldly fauours shewing gret heanies, and the seruants of God an excedyng reyse. In the .xix. Chapter is that reyoice of elect number ouer the tirryble iudgments of that whore much more highly discribed, the deth of Christes holy witnesses most plentyously reuenged, and how the Angel in no case will of Iohn be worshiped.</p>
   <p>In the .xx. Chapter is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> dragon tied vp for a thousand years, the chosen sort reigning w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Christ. Gog and Magog gather thē to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle, and are ouercōmen. The dead after that ariseth and receiueth iudgement.</p>
   <p>In the xxi. Chapter is the church of the chosen or the new Hierusalem prepared to to hir spouse. That citie commeth downe from heauen, and is of the holy ghoste here, after most wonderfull circumstaunces in hir right proportion described.</p>
   <p>In the xxii. Chapter, the riuer of lyuinge waters proceedeth from the throne of God.</p>
   <p>Iohn sealeth vp the sayinges of this prophecy. Christ concludeth what his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is, and who shall be therevnto recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, admonishyng that vnto his worde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be added of men in payne of dampna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
   <p>Some hatefull and vngodly blasphemers there are and euer hath bene, whiche wyll in no wise this Booke to be of equall authorytie with the other scriptures of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes

      </gap>rts. The most high Theologye and secret wisdome of God the eternall father, is the blessed doctrine there of, geuen vnto hys onely sonne in our humanytie and after that of him so cōmited vnto Iohn by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy ghost to be distributed &amp; taught by hym to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal christen cōgregation, which is a most sufficient argument of the authoritie therof, what so euer mad Momus shall quarrell to the contrary. Iames Faber Stapulensis in his preface prefixed to the woorkes of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise the Ariopagyt, doubted neuer a deale to prefer this heauenly prophesie to all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> other writings of the other Apostles, confessing that in worthines, it farre passed them all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> due circumstances there of considered. The more nigher (saith he) the light be to the sun, the more strength it hath, and the more cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it ministreth vnto men. But Momus hath not yet done away the madde mistes of his monkery, nor yet the darke dregges of his sophistry, which both are great blemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing vneo his eye sight. The wisdom of Plato, Homerus, &amp; Cicero, auaileth nothing in this. Aristotle &amp; Uirgil if thei were aliue, could herein do little or nothing. In estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more maketh the poore fishers, learning to the vnderstanding of these misteryes, thē the prowd painted eloquence or far set resōs of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> philosophers. The Lord geue vs grace from the barne of his most plentuous scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to fetche the fat feedyng of our feble &amp;
<pb facs="313"/>
hungry soules, that we may by thē obtayne his strength into the lyfe euerlasting.</p>
