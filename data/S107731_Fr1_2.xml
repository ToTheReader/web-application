I will pray alwaies for you that GOD may settle and confirme you, and make you worthy of his calling, that the name of the Lorde Iesus may be glorified in you, and you in him. Pray you also for mee: for I trust that through your praiers I shall the sooner be giuen vnto you againe. The Lorde bee with you, London the first of Ianuarie: 1594.</p>
