      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He notable sayinges of Gods chosen seruantes, in whom the holy Ghost it selfe speaketh, are worthy perpetual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce. Which if they be not regarded, the godly are taken away to their rest and ioy, and then foloweth (in plague to the people) the miseries and calamities that before were threatned by the mouthes of those his messengers.

Who in his lyfe tyme amongst al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, left in memorial this notable prophesie: That these three thynges would be the destruction of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion. The fyrst, is forgetfulnesse of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites that we receiue at Gods handes by the Gospell, and vnthankefulnesse for the same. The seconde, is carelesnesse: the woorde is brought vnto vs, and we care not for it, we make a profession of a fayth for a shewe, but we reckon not what we doo, nor how we lyue. The third, is that we loue &amp; like better of world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly wisdome, then of godly wisdome: within the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>passe

of our foolyshe braines, we wyll comprehende the reason, rule, order, and ende of euery thyng: vngodly counsel is a prop and stay vnto our determinations, we depende not vpon the Lordes prouidence, we aske not counsell at the mouth of the Lorde: yf the Lorde guide not the worlde after our owne wyl, we lyke no longer to be gouerned by hym: We forsake the Lorde, we flie streight vnto fleshe and blood. The prosperitie of the worlde is our delyght, and therefore we say iumply as it was sayd vnto <hi>Ieremie,</hi> We remember what we haue <note place="margin">Ieremi. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

I am horribly afrayde because of the vngodly, so often as I heare my deare brethren and felowe labourers in the Lord: Who, I am sure with earnest groninges, pray vnto the Lorde, that his spirite may teache them what to speake: So often as I see that the spirite woorketh in them to threaten, aboue al other this woe, to haue the kyngdome of heauen taken away from vs, to haue the glorious Gospell of GOD, the immortall seede, the spirituall foode of our soules, taken quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from vs: So often, me thynketh, I feare and tremble to thynke how soone that terrible hunger shall come, that we shal go, and run, and seeke earnestly, and yet not fynde the foode of our soules wherewith to be comforted. If we wilfully forget Gods glory, wyll he care for vs? wherefore? There was neuer a goodlyer thyng vpon the earth, then was Hierusalem: and yet when they refused to be obedient vnto the Lorde, and began to waxe forgetfull of his great benefites, when they left of to aske counsell of the Lorde, and trusted to mans foolyshe wysedome and pollicie, to mans vayne strength, euen then they were destroyed by vnciuyll dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention, poysoned with the plague of pestilence, murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by cruell famine, deuoured of the enimies swoord, many thousandes of their Nobles forced to doo the dayes labour of slaues, no more accompt of them, but that. 30. of them were solde for one poore penie: the rest were forced to lyue agaynst theyr wylles in lacke and wo, pinched with penurie, oppressed with labour in most cruel bondage and perpetual slauery.
