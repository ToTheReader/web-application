wanting, I haue thought it not amisse, to deliuer a breefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsall of such of our English nation, as either were, or are reported to haue been Cardinalls of the Church of Rome. And to these I haue yeelded a place amongst our English Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates; first because they were men for the most part very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable, famous in their times, and endued with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie gifts: Secondly to this intent, that where of late yeeres a great volume hath been published at Rome, by one <hi>Ciaconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> containing the liues of the Bishops and Cardinalls of the same, a worke (as it is pretended) of great perfection; it may appeare vnto the world, that there as well as elsewhere, some thinges glister which are not gold, many particulars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing misreported concerning our Country-men; which may assure vs, the rest of that worke so highly esteemed, to be but <hi>eiusdem farinae</hi>; and in other parts as well as these, full fraught with the like vntruthes and errours. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by reason of a mischance in our coppy, and my absence, the Printer hath not been able to doe his duty so well, as that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges are not mistaken; I must earnestly intreate the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to take notice of the corrections; the want whereof may greatly wrong both me and himselfe. That done, I trust these my labours shall find the like acceptance as my former did; the which I must commend vnto the mercie and goodnes of our gracious God, whose name be blessed and praised now and for euermore.</p>
