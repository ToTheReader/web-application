   </head>
   <opener>
      <salute>Good Madam,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T what time it pleased Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dauids</hi> heart, &amp; <hi>Salomons</hi> hands to build him an house at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> that his name might be there; It is memorable, how in that great
<pb facs="3"/>day of Dedication, the King did sanctifie the same with his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and honoured it with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; teaching vs thereby, that <hi>Dauid</hi> may purpose, and <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> may performe, what God would haue done: and yet all in vaine, if the Lord doe not blesse in both his owne ordinance.</p>
   <p>The helpe of heauen was with that good Knight your late hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, of worthy memory, in his prouision to build vpon the poore in many works of mercy: which he left for you Madam to be perfected in the honor of Christ, in his poore members, of which the world is full, wee can goe to no Pulpit, but they pearce our hearts to prouoke our speech.</p>
   <p>In tender whereof, it ioyeth vs much in these Northerne parts to heare, see, and feele,
<pb facs="3"/>how fully you haue perfected a worke so well begunne, with a liberall augmentation of more mercy, and greater extent of bounty, then euer was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or expected of many I am sure (his poore Allies and Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks here) whose dayly prayers are with GOD, for that wherein you haue much inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
   <p>And especially in that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy foundation of your Free Schoole here at <hi>Heskyne,</hi> drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping much vpon the death of that Founder, for feare of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fall, till your Ladishippe take holde to perfect the worke so well begunne, with so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable a reflection, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of future good, as now it hopeth in GOD euer to breath sweet like the sauour of a field,
<pb facs="4"/>which the Lord hath blessed.</p>
   <p>Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his day hath beene the day of Dedication, from the foundation till now, where and when the Eue hath beene kept solemne for Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasticall exercises (from the first day, and Master, who gaue it first life a shining Lampe, consuming himselfe to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten others) euen downe to these dayes, laudably performed by the Masters, Vshers, and Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers there, In their succeeding times, and now haue exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well performed both in Greeke and Latine, Prose and Verse. I leaue it to the report of the Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearers, who heard it, and ioyed much in their Acts.</p>
   <p>The Eue so spent, the Feast was sacred for holy deuotion in the Parrish Church of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>being your Ladyshippes pleasure, it should so bee kept, as formerly it had beene; That those many Children, ouer whome you are now a carefull mother, being sanctified with the word of God and prayer, might learne more chearefullie to sing <hi>Hosannah</hi> to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.</p>
   <p>The Prayers and Sermon so ended, your liberall heart and hand thought not good to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse the people, (after their soule solace,) without a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of some bodilie repast, like vnto that of our Sauiour Christ, when hee sayde, Giue yee them to eate, which was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily done, and performed with chearefulnesse.</p>
   <p>And now, good Lady, I doe heere present in priuate,
<pb facs="5"/>and lay in your Ladishippes lappe, what was then preached in publike, then this my poore frame of Palme and Cedar, speciall Materials in the Fabricke of the Temple, if <hi>Bezaliel</hi> or <hi>Hiram</hi> the widdowes Sonne of <hi>Nephthalie</hi> were, to put them into the worke: But they are dead, so is the Tabernacle and Temple too, with all it glorie, all demolished and turned to dust, all buried in the bowels of Christ, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sayeth, <hi>Ne populus rediret ad Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daismum,</hi> left the people might returne againe to Iudaisme.</p>

<pb facs="5"/>beauty, a Minister of a better sanctuary, which the Lord hath pight and not man.</p>
   <p>Righteous men, the plants of his pleasure, are Palmes and Cedars of that glorious buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and a more cunning hand then eyther that of <hi>Bezaliel</hi> or <hi>Hiram</hi> hath framed them for the worke; for <hi>Summa sapientia aedisicauit domum:</hi>
