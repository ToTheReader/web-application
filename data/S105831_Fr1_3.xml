   <head>TO THE GENTLEMEN REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS, HEALTH.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lexander the great (Gentlemen) commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a certaine Embroderer to worke him a most curious carpet, who in deed was so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull in his science, as his worke amongst meane men could carrie small credite, staied almost two yeares ere the worke was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and at last presenting that vnperfect peece to his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, Alexander smiled at the follie of the man which would enterprise such a curious worke hauing so small cunning: and being demanded of his Lordes, how he liked of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, answered, that how bad so euer the work were, he must needs thinke it passing curious, because it was so long in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. I feare Gentlemen to incurre the like forfeite with the Embroderer because I haue committed the like offence, for both I shall be appeached of follie for presuming so farre without skill, and condemned of sloth, in that I haue bene breeding a Mouse while others would haue brought forth an Elephant. And also I shall feare, if Gentlemen speake well of my worke, that they iest with Alexander, and though they know my want of wit and lacke of skil to merit dispraise, yet they will Ironice say all is well, because it hath bene so long in penning. Well (Gentlemen) let Momus mocke, and Zoilus enuie, let Parasites flatter, and Sicophants smile, yea, let the sauage Satyre himselfe, whose cynicall censure is more seuere than need, frowne at his, pleasure, I hope honest Gentlemen will make account of Mamillia for her modest constancie, although shee hath not the Pumistone of learning to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish her words with superficiall eloquence: and so (Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen) shrowding her vnder your curteous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, hoping you will thinke well of my toy, I bid you fare-well.</p>
