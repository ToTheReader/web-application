      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ow necessary it is for all sorts of men in the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, to trie their estates whetherthey be true Christians or no, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the expresse charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenin the Scriptures concerning it. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth men to <hi>examine themselues whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be in the faith,</hi> and <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ Iesus be in them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they be reprobates, 2. Cor.</hi> 13. 5. And the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> would haue all Christians <hi>diligently to make their calling and election sure, 2. Pet.</hi> 1. 10. And the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandemēt
<pb n="200" facs="113"/>
lay vpon them in the Church of the Iewes in the old Testament, as may appeare by that exhortation, Lam. 3. 40. <hi>Let vs search and try our wayes, and turne againe vnto the Lord:</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in this case, chargeth men to <hi>commune with their owne hearts,</hi> Psal. 4. 4. How can men <hi>draw neere vnto God in the full assurance of faith,</hi> if they will not be at the paines to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themselues? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. Or how shall we euer <hi>know that wee are of God,</hi> or attaine vnto any <hi>confidence of faith,</hi> as we ought to doe? 1 <hi>Ioh. 5. 19. Eph.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
   <p>How fearefully this point of sound triall is neglected, and how miserably most men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for want of it, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by this obseruation, which may vsually be made of men in the most places, <hi>viz. that many</hi>

      <hi>that are carnall men, say, they are godly; and many that are godly men, say, they are but carnall.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="201" facs="113"/>
that, a multitude of men, both good and bad, liue in secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: the one not caring to get out of so wofull an estate; and the other not regarding the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Assurance.</p>
   <p>The causes of this miserable securitie, may be obserued and noted both in wicked and in godly men.</p>
   <p>In wicked men these things may be easily discerned.</p>
   <p n="1">1 A lothnesse to examine <note place="margin">Why wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men neglect the triall of their estates. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

         </gap> well.</note> themselues and try their estates exactly, for feare lest they should finde that they are not in a good estate. Their hearts secretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, and they thinke, if they should take particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their owne condition, it would be found, that they haue indeed no true grace in them: and therefore they rather chuse to liue in that doubtfull estate, then to be put out of doubt, and made to know, that they haue yet no right to the Kingdome
<pb n="202" facs="114"/>
of heauen: neuer considering that the knowledge of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, may be one degree to get out of it.</p>
   <p n="2">2. In such as see all is not well <note place="margin">2. They are sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> with them, the cause is <hi>slothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> mingled with horrible <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption:</hi> they had rather weare out their dayes in danger, then be at the paines to vse the means for their owne repentance and reformation: they will wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly put it to the venture.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Others will aduenture vpon <note place="margin">3. They rest vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hope.</note> their <hi>common hope of mercy:</hi> they haue certaine generall confused apprehensions of mercy in God, vpō which they wilfully engage their hopes, without care of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or the particular warrant of their hopes from the Word of God, and so miserably perish: their hopes prouing but <hi>as the house of the Spider:</hi> and the imaginarie mercy failing them, they die either as stockes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sense, or as <hi>Iudas</hi> in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

   <p n="4">4. Others rest themselues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their outward <hi>profession of Religion</hi> and some general things wrought in them, and the good opinion others haue of them: &amp; so being somewhat <hi>neare the kingdome of God,</hi> they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to rest there, as the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites did neare <hi>Canaan,</hi> though they neuer possessed it. We see many think, there needsno more to be sure they are in a good cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then to heare Sermons, &amp; abstaine from grosse outward prophannesse, and to be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of among the godly, &amp;c. pleasing themselues with the <hi>shew of godlinesse,</hi> though as yet they <hi>deny the power of it,</hi> as hauing attained to other righteousnesse <hi>then the righteousnesse of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

   <p>Thus of wicked men: It is <note place="margin">Why so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>e that are godly, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the triall of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states.</note> true also, that many godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians haue beene, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly faulty in neglecting the triall of their estates, and their assurance: and the causes of this negligence in them are diuerse: as,</p>
   <p n="1">1. Some are so much <hi>mis-led</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Euill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</note> by the surmises of their owne hearts, that they think that assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance would breed security, and that it is a better way to keepe their owne hearts humble, to be somewhat doubtfull: not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that vnbeliefe is the chiefe cause of slothfulnesse and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: and that the assurance of faith is the chiefe meanes to
<pb n="205" facs="115"/>
purge the heart, and quiet the soule, and works effectually in all the duties of loue.</p>
   <p n="2">2. In the most, <hi>Ignorance</hi> of <note place="margin">2. Ignorance.</note> their owne gifts and Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, is the cause: for if Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians did see distinctly; how far the Lord hath brought them by his grace, and withall did behold the euidences of their faith and hope in Gods promises, they should not faile of comfort, and establishment of heart.</p>
   <p n="3">3. <hi>Smothering of doubts</hi> and temptations, is a great let in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: <note place="margin">3. Smothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of doubts and temptatiōs</note> diuers Christians are secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and daily assaulted with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine strange doubts; which, if they did propound, &amp; get sound answer vnto their hearts, would heale within them, and the worke of faith prosper.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Some Christians are kept <note place="margin">They are wicked o uerm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
            <desc>•…</desc>
         </gap>ch.</note> without assurance, through the ouermuch <hi>viewing of their owne daily infirmities</hi> in all parts of Gods seruice: They <hi>are wicked
<pb n="206" facs="116"/>
ouermuch:</hi> wheras if they would study those Scriptures that shew how graciously the Lord stands inclined toward his people, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their daily wants, their hearts would be much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and their minds cleerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to trust vpon the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting mercies of their God.</p>
   <p n="5">5. In some, the cause is found <note place="margin">5. Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</note> in the disease of their bodies: <hi>Melancholy;</hi> when it is growne to a disease, is a most stiffe and pertinacious aduersary to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Assurance: it doth fill the heart with so many sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and fancies, and is an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour so vnteachable, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for the most part is as water spilt vpon the ground: And the more difficult it is to remoue this let, because vsually the parties possest by this humour, are so far from seeking help, that they will not be perswaded that they are troubled with any such disease.</p>
   <p n="6">6. Some Christians are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <note place="margin">6. Passions.</note>
      <pb n="207" facs="116"/>
by their owne <hi>Passions;</hi> they are so froward and vnquiet in their dispositions, that their hearts are daily lifted off from the benefit of setled assurance, by their own habituall discont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>nts. Frowardnes is a mischieuous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>r, that weakens both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and minde; and assurance and strength of faith, seldome dwels in an vnquiet minde.</p>
   <p n="7">7. Others want assurance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">7. Neglect of the meanes.</note> they <hi>neglect the meanes of assurance:</hi> they doe not <hi>try all things, and keepe that which is good;</hi> or <hi>they call not vpon God</hi> daily, feruently, and constantly, to giue them the <hi>spirit of reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to shew them <hi>the hope of their calling,</hi> and their glorious inheritance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18, 19.</p>
   <p n="8">8. <hi>A barren life</hi> is an vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable <note place="margin">8. A bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren life. 1 Cor. 15. 58</note> life: and contrariwise, to <hi>abound in good workes,</hi> hath stedfastnesse, and a secret rest of heart, as an vnseparable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it.</p>
   <p n="9">
      <pb n="208" facs="117"/>
9. The <hi>loue of earthly things</hi>
      <note place="margin">9. Too much loue of earthly things.</note> is another great impediment. Many professours haue their thoughts and cares so eaten vp with worldlinesse, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not seriously seeke Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nor constantly hold out in any course for the attainement of assurance. This degree of faith requires some degree of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world.</p>
   <p n="10">10. In some, there lodgeth some <note place="margin">10. Secret sin.</note>
      <hi>secret sin,</hi> which they know, and do not purge themselues for, and doth daily preuaile in them; and this either keepes out Faith, or keepes it downe in the cradle, that it can get no strength. When I say, <hi>secret sins,</hi> I meane, secret from others, not from themselues. For sinnes of meere ignorance God doth not scourge in his seruants so, as to withhold his graces from them.</p>
