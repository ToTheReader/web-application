   <head>THE PREFACE
to the READER, in
the French and Latine
Copies.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst all the
other <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
(louing
Reader) only
our <hi>Artephius</hi>
is not enuious, as himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
of himselfe in many
places, and therefore he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
downe the whole <hi>Art</hi> in
most open words in this
<hi>Treatise,</hi> interpreting as
farre as he may, the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
speeches and <hi>Sophismes</hi>
      <pb n="144" facs="86"/>
of others; Neuerthelesse
least he should giue vnto the
wicked, ignorant, and euill
men, occasion and meanes to
doe hurt, hee hath a little
vailed the truth in the
<hi>Principalls</hi> of the <hi>Science</hi>
vnder an Arteficiall Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode,
sometimes <hi>affirming,</hi>
sometimes <hi>denying,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
as though hee often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
one and the same
thing, whereas in those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions
hee alwayes chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
some words, seeming
often to say the contrary of
what hee had said before,
willing to leaue vnto the
iudgement of the Reader,
the way of <hi>Trueth, Vertue,</hi>
and <hi>true Working,</hi> which
if any man finde, let him
giue immortall thankes to
God alone; but if hee see
<pb n="145" facs="86"/>
that hee walketh not in the
right way, let him reade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
this <hi>Author</hi> againe and
againe, vntill hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his meaning. So did
the learned <hi>Iohn Pontanus,</hi>
which saith in his Epistle
Printed in <hi>Theatrum Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micum:
They erre</hi> (saith
hee, speaking of them that
labour in this <hi>Arte) they
haue erred, and they will
alwayes erre, because the
Philosophers in their books
haue neuer set downe the
proper Agent, except onely
one, which is called</hi> Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phius,
<hi>but hee speakes for
himselfe; and if I had not
read</hi> Artephius, <hi>and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
whereof hee spake,
I had neuer come to the
Complement of the worke:</hi>
Therefore reade this Booke,
<pb n="146" facs="87"/>
and reade it againe, vntill
thou vnderstand his speech,
and so obtaine thy desired
end. It shall bee needlesse to
speake any more concerning
our <hi>Authour;</hi> It sufficeth
that by the grace of God,
and the vse of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>Quintessence,</hi> hee liued
a thousand yeeres, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth
<hi>Roger Bacon,</hi> in his
Booke <hi>of the wonderfull
workes of nature,</hi> and also
the most learned <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus
Baracelsus,</hi> in his
Booke of <hi>long life:</hi> Which
terme of a thousand yeeres,
none of the other <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
no nor the Father
of them, <hi>Hermes</hi> himselfe,
was able to attaine vnto.
Looke therefore, whether
peraduenture this man haue
not vnderstood the vertues
<pb n="147" facs="87"/>
of our <hi>Stone,</hi> and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how to vse it, better
than the rest. Howsoeuer
it bee, vse thou it and our
labours, to the glory of
God, and the profit of
this Kingdome.</p>
