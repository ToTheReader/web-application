         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LCIBIADES,</hi> right Worshipfull (as
<hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth) comming to speak with
<hi>Pericles</hi> on a time, was answered, that hee
could not then haue accesse vnto him, being
very busie in studying how to make vp his accounts with the
Athenians. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> knowing he was deeply in their
debt, said, his studies would haue more profitably bene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied
in deuising how to auoidreckoning at all. Which his
saying of <hi>Pericles,</hi> may not vnfitly be applied to my selfe,
that am inuenting what accoūt to yeeld for the receit of your
manifold fauours, for which being in no small arrerages,
I might better study how to passe them ouer with silence, thē
to bee found so farre engaged aboue my ability of merit,
yet knowing that you expect nothing but acknowledgement
of the same, which you accept as a sufficient satisfaction, I am
content, by confessing your boūty, to haue exceeded the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of my weake deseruings, rather to bewray my defects i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> publike,
then iustly by silence to be taxed with the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of base vnthankfulnesse. And therefore as well in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of my remembrance of your curtesies, as in pledge of
my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>utious affection, I make bold to present these papers to
your patronage: Not doubting but vnder your tuition, my
tender Muse shalbe as safe from the sting of Detraction,
as was <hi>Vlisses</hi> secure from the Greeks, being couered with
<hi>Aiax</hi> Target. And thus loth longer to detaine you with my
rude lines, I wish you as much happinesse, as you can desire,
or I deuise.</p>
