      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y leasure would not suffer me to read so much of your Dictionary, as I wish I had: but that I haue perused, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me that good liking of it, that I assure you, I do take it to bee a very profitable worke, both in regard of the easie Method and order of finding out such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as are therein contained; as also, for the sound exposition of such Wordes and phrases as you set downe: besides, the manifolde variety of thinges, which a man shall see in a <hi>Synopsis</hi> laide before his eyes. Of all which, the faithfull Reader (especially the Preacher of the word) shall make singular vse. I must therefore giue my best approbation to this worke of yours, as to other your godly labours in this kinde: and when it shall be finished, I shall bee glad to vse the benefit of it, and will aduise such as I am acquainted with, to do the like. Fare ye well.</p>
