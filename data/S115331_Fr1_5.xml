      <salute>Reader,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here present thee with a <hi>Cornu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copia</hi> of knowledge and Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If thou dost not receive it with an acknowledgement proportioned to the Worth of such a Gift, mayst thou acquire two <hi>Cornucopia's</hi> of Ignominy, to Adorne thy forehead, and bee condemned to the Reading of the <hi>English Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,</hi> as long as thou livest. If the whole Mountaine of the Common-wealth (whereof thy selfe art a molehill,) were as sensible as thou oughtest to be, I assure my selfe, shee would bow her venerable knees, and doe mee Homage for that mighty Portion of Wit, and Courtshippe, whereof shee goes now to take Possession. But I see thee already blear-eyed with reading <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Balzaac,</hi> and the <hi>Packet of Letters;</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give mee good Reader, I aske thee most humbly Mercy, and with much Resentment call backe my former Imprecation, since I perceive thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready exposed to a more rigorous Pennance, than
<pb facs="6"/>
that which my Charity would have suffered my Justice to impose upon thee: For what mischeif could I have imagined (though I had beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with the Soule of <hi>Phalaris</hi> his inginer) equall to the Malice of this which thou hast already incurred? in the one thou learnest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to speake Baudy with a good Grace, in the other nothing but to blow a horne; Here thou suckest in the Principles of Atheisme, there of Ignorance; Here thou art instructed to Preach in an Epistle, there to Court thy Friend in a Sermon: This stuffs thy Memory with Stolne French, that with English not worth the Stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: The one Commands thee to Violate the Laws of all Ancient Rhetorique, the other to observe none. The one will give thee Rules how to speak <hi>Balzaac,</hi> (or) badly, the other like a Post <hi>(id est)</hi> nothing at all.</p>
   <p>The Consideration of this (Loving, Kind, Courteous Reader) did much precipitate my Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Times from Error; or (as the Pure Hees and Shees of this Age say,) did even force my Spirit to reclaime the Idolatrous from adoring that Malicious Idoll the <hi>English Secretary,</hi> that Image which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar the King had set up, the Post</hi> with a <hi>Packet of Letters,</hi> and that most abhominable <hi>Baal, Balzaac:</hi> by divulging this Peece of Excellent Workmanship, (which the Gods themselves did hammer and frame in the Head of <hi>Monsieur La Serre;</hi>) by letting this Bird of Paradise
<pb facs="6"/>
fly out of her Cage, that she might recreate Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with the Charms of her Voyce, and resuscitate the Intombed Spirits of Men, from that Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den sleep which the former <hi>Tarantulaes</hi> had throwne them into. Or as with most reason I may averre, by Publishing this new Ephimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to the World, which shall teach thee to know the Conjunctions of the Planets, or erring Stars; I meane the Connection of Wandring words and sentences, used, and abused by Men of all sorts <hi>ad Libitum.</hi> It will teach thee the rising and setting of the Sun, or Elevation and depression of Periods; The Ecclipses in writing, as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish amongst sounds, and to know when one obscures another, or at least renders it lesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable. But if thou beest not yet Contented with this moderate touch of knowledge, it shall proceed farther, and open to thee a sluse of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sublunary Sciences whatsoever. Where canst thou have better Philosophy than here, where it teacheth thee how the rude Matter of an Epistle is to be informed with the spritefull Vivacity of Phrases, and Apt Coherence of Periods? Where wilt thou prove an Arithmetitian, if not here, where thou art taught, that if thou add, or subtract but one word from the whole Number of an Epistle, thy Computation will prove false, and it utterly lose the Grace and Sweetnesse due unto it? If thou wouldst be instructed in the Tacticks, where wilt thou learne a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act way of ordering Men and disposing a Battle
<pb facs="7"/>
than here, where one displaced, puts all the rest out of order? Humanity cannot invent a more compendious way of Short writing, since Steno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy has here arrived to such Perfection, that when a Man has but writ his Name, hee has both Courted his Mistresse, Comforted the Sick, Defied an Enemy, and Obliged a Friend. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick I am sure, is here in her <hi>Auge,</hi> since our Syllogismes are so powerfull, that except a Man would confesse himselfe rude, and unreasonable, (and consequently no Man) he can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Argument. What Rhetorick is more pleasing than this, where servants and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are acquired in every page? What Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick more Harmonious than where we are so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous in teaching the true art of stopps, that when one only is escaped, the whole Aire is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Discord? I must confesse, our Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is an Antipode to Lilly (though Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more Compleat,) for wee doe not decline Words, but only Obsolecies, and Barbarismes: nor have wee more than two Conjugations, <hi>viz.</hi> to doe you service, and to revenge my selfe; by which we Conjugate all our other Verbs and Nouns be they what they will.</p>
   <p>Behold Reader, beyond thy Expectation, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Ars magna et Ultima,</hi> besides the Lul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian; another Panace or Curer of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases beside the Graecian; and another Castle of Knowledge beside Records Sphere; which if thou accept with a Willing mind, and good
<pb facs="7"/>
Intention, Ile deifie thee; but if thou attempt upon it with unwashed hands, or a Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Opinion, I defie thee; and so fare thee well.</p>
