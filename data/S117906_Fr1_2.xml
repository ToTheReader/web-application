   <head>THE EPISTLE TO the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bin (Christian Reader) in the chiefe of my desires, to seeke the peace of this church &amp; kingdome in which wee liue: to that end, being called to speak at a visitation vnto my brethrē. I chose to intreate of those words in the Psalme: <hi>O pray for the peace of Ierusalem: let them prosper that loue her.</hi> In the vnfolding of which, according to that measure of grace, that God had giuen me; I sought with all mildnes, to perswade those of my brethren (whose labours hath bin most fruitfull in the Lord) that for a Crosse
<pb facs="3"/>
and a Surplesse, they would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the worke of their God, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the people of their charge, of that blessed comfort which by their preaching they once receaued. At this I aimed, and their vntimely si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence (which after followed) I then greatly feared. Thus my loue to them, and the house of our God, imboldned me to speak, that which <hi>Cartwright, Beza,</hi> and other of reuerend memory, before had deliuered: that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to vndergoe those disliked ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, then for them to forsake their calling, to despise the flocke of Christ Iesus, ouer which the holy Ghost had made them ouerseers. For the question then was not (as some cōceaued) what in those ceremonies was conuenient; that was by our rulers before ouerru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but what in this case, was for vs, and Gods Church most expedient: whether with them to continue, the
<pb facs="3"/>
worke of our ministrie, or by our refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to yeeld cōformity to them, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the people of our charge, &amp; to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that holy functiō, vnto which God had called vs. This was the question; to this, not only for the better satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men, but of our God; wee were to answere. And although thou see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest to the world for thy excuse, to lay the cause and blame of this thy silence vpon thy rulers; because they will not permit to thee the exercise of thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie, except thou submit thy self vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those their imposed ceremonies: yet because thou art to answere, not so much for thy rulers and their doings, as for thy selfe and thy doings vnto thy God; enter into the chamber of thy conscience, there seriously consider, whether (the Magistrate commāding these) it be better for thee, to forsake these together with thy ministrie; or with these, (although with thy distast
<pb facs="4"/>
and some dislike) to continue thy bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed labours in the crosse of God. This is that, on which wee should especially looke, what vpon their command is best beseeming vs to doe. O let Gods glory and the good of his Church, so farre as it may be, euer weigh with vs. I doubt not but that thou wilt say, so it shall euer be with thee: but yet thou repliest, thou maiest not doe euill that good may come thereof; that God will haue his glory sought by such meanes which he approueth: this that is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is not that which God approueth, nay it is euil. This thing is in questiō, &amp; many (thou knowest) haue laboured to proue that they are not euil, that they are not such which God hath disallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I am not now to reasō this matter, I refer thee vnto that which hath bin writen. Only now summō thy self vnto the iustice seate of thine owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (and all preiudice and affection
<pb facs="4"/>
set apart, all regard of men, &amp; respect of thy former speeches and doings laid aside) I pray thee, in that light that God hath giuen thee, answere to thine owne soule, whether these rites seeme to her to be simplie euill; or whether shee doth not repute them in a sort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. If vpon this summons, thy conscience telleth thee that they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill;<note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1</note> I do not perswade thee to sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy conscience; to thee that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putest them to be euill, they are euill. Yet let not thy conscience preiudice the liberty of thy Christian brother, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do thou condemne the persons of other as euill and corrupt; which in their obedience to these, are not of the same mind and conscience with thy selfe: for thou maiest be deceaued, and God may shew his truth to them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer true must bee that oracle of truth,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>

<pb facs="5"/>
enuieth not, loue doth not boast itself, is not puffed vp, disdaineth not, seeketh not her owne, is not prouoked to anger, thinketh no euill.</hi> By our cognizance of loue, let it be knowne to whom we appertaine: let vs not forget of what spirit we are, but according to the rule of the Apostle, <hi>If it bee possible,</hi>

      <hi>as much as in vs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, let vs seek to haue peace with all men.</hi> For when wee seeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue the writings and speeches one of another, and to enforce another mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in these then was intended, or the letter beareth: when our mouthes are full of raylings, and bitter spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and our persons are become vile one to another: when we make it our studies by misreports and false sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted slanders, to make one the other o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the world, &amp; leaue in our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings remēbrances of our shame: where is that true loue, the very grace of
<pb facs="5"/>
Christians, which with griefe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth her brothers falls, and seeketh to hide and couer his shame? Where is that spirit of Christ? of meekenes, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and humility? by which, and not by fiery and reproachful speakings, the world was first conuerted to the faith. Where is that true zeale of Gods glory? that tender care of the weake brethren? that desire to stoppe the mouthes of the slaundering Papists, and scoffing Atheists? Alas these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely, galfull, and malice-shewing speeches, as darke clouds obscure the truth of Christs Gospel; these as thorns in their eyes wound the consciences of the weake, making them to thinke and say that such bitter waters cannot flow from the professors of Gods truth; these make <hi>Gath</hi> and <hi>Askalon</hi> of the vncircumcised to reioyce, and giue great aduātage to their close-followed cause. These stirre vp our vnseasoned
<pb facs="6"/>
affections, that whilest wee seeke with contumelie to returne that was ill spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, wee giue new occasions to heare worse. These are not the weapons of our spirituall warfare, with which our <hi>Dauids</hi> men beloued of God, should fight the battails of their Lord. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ô my brethren, although wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not accord in one tune, and with that same mind acknowledge these impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ceremonies: yet let vs not forget the spirit, peace, and loue of Christians; let vs not giue way to our hastie affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: but rather let vs endeuour, to seeke the truth by such meanes, and in such a manner, as the word of truth prescribeth: so will God giue a blessing to our endeuours, and we shall find af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our long and many disagreeings, Gods blessed peace and comfort in our soules. The which God giue vs in these our daies to see, to the good of his Church, and glory of his great name. <hi>Amen.</hi>
