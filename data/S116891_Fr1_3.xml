people, and men of inferior Fortune; The other due to persons
of better birth, and generous disposition. For as the former by
paines, and parsimony do onely labour to become rich; so th' other
by Military skil, or knowledge in Ciuill gouernment, aspire to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and humane glory: whereof this Booke chiefly entreateth, and
enformeth all Gentlemen and Souldiers, not onely what commendations and prizes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to valorous desert, but likewise what penalties and punishments appertaine to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie,
and Armes abused. Therewith also is discoursed what dignities, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
degrees, accompany Martiall merit; What order hath bene obserued in publique
Combats, and princely Triumphes, both ancient and moderne; What places are due to
Noble personages, aswell men as women; And to some others also according to their sex,
age, Office, or place of Seruice, with diuers other things, whereof worthy Gentlemen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be enformed. This worke with much labour compiled, and not without great
cost and care now Imprinted, is according to order by learned censure allowed, and by the
Honourable approbation of the right Noble Earle of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> the most ancient,
and most Honorable Commander in Armes of this kingdome, and chiefe Knight of the
Order, fauourably admitted and recommended. The imitation of whose vertue, and
valour, and the excellent actions of other worthy men mentioned in this Booke, may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
incite all yong Gentlemen, to employ their time in study of Morall, and Military
vertue; Thereby, to become seruiceable to their Prince, profitable to their Countrey,
and worthy of all Honourable estimation, and aduancement.</p>
