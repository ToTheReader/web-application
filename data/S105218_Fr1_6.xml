   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit in the Epistle prefixed to M. Iewell, I haue (Christen Reader) saied so much, as maye in greate parte suffise to instruct and prepare thy Attention to the reading and vnderstanding of this Returne of Vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes &amp;c: yet, to thentent that before thou enter to perusing thereof, thou maye all thinges thouroughly be instructed, I haue thought good shortly to laye before thee, the Cause of this our Enterprise: the Order and maner of our present writing: the Matter principally contayned therein: and the profit that hereof maye be looked for.</p>
   <p>Touching the first it is not vnknowen to all those that any thinge haue trauayled in perusing such bookes, as of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te haue come forthe touching matters in religion controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sious, neither what Challenge was published at Paules Crosse of late yeres, neither what Answer hath bene made thereunto, nor last of all what Replie hath come forthe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that Answer. The Replie is knowen to be greate, estemed to be lerned, and thought to be such a piece, as the party impugned shall neuer be able to answer. VVhat an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the party can make, it shall in the Reioynder appeare. But for one man to answer the whole, and that stitche by stitche (as the Replier requireth) bothe the time woulde be so longe, that many a soule in the meane might perish, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="17"/>
by that lewde piece of worke, and also the booke woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de be so greate that fewe woulde bye it, fewer peruse it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ot one amonge a hundred reade it ouer. It hath bene thought good therefore of those that in Truthes cause loue to take payne, that for better expedition, many sett vpon it, though eche one did but a litle. The Answerer hath not bene ydle, as by his Reioynder it wil wel appeare. Yet other mens pennes he coulde not staye, euery one to folowe, as Zele pricked forwarde,<note place="margin">
         <hi>D. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the 7. booke.</hi>
      </note> One hath confuted an Article of the Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plie: an Article amōge the rest most importāt. An other hath taught vs to <hi>Bevvare of M. Ievvel.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>M. Rastel.</hi>
      </note> I haue thought good to Iustifie the Vntruthes, which it hath liked the Replyer to charge vpon his Aduersary all alonge his Replie. To this I was moued by diuerse reasons.<note place="margin">
         <hi>The Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of the setting forthe of this Retur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne &amp;c.</hi>
      </note> I euer thought (as in the processe afterwarde I sawe it fell out) that the weakest par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes through out the Replie, should be those, where such Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes were noted. For I thought not, nor any man els I tro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we wil thinke, either that the Replyer hath so litle witt as not to espie, which partes were most lykely to be Vntrue, and there to score vp his Vntruthe (the proper Badge in dede of this Replyers Cognysance) either that he owed any such good wil to his aduersary (whō by that Inuentiō he minded for euer to deface and discredit) as that he would dissemble and winke at great faultes, and note only certayne small es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes. These weaker partes therefore being proued stronge and good, I thought the residewe of the whole Answer shoulde nede at al no defence: but might stande for true, as
<pb facs="18"/>
being passed ouer by the Replyer without any note of Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthe. For as in a brokē nette, the holes being sowed vp, the whole net is good and wil serue wel againe: so it semed me, these presumed Vntruthes being redressed or discharged, the whole Answer might goe for good, godly, and true. By this meanes therefore going through the Replie, a compendyous waie was founde, shortly and yet sufficiently bothe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende the former Answer, and to satisfie this Replie. And this lo was one and the first Cause that moued me to (deuise this Returne. An other Cause (which perusing a longe the Vntruthes as they stode in the Margin of the Diuisions I es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied) was this. The Replyer in all these foure Articles, the former halfe of his Replie, hath noted for Vntruthes, bothe the principall Matters treated and proued in the Articles, and also the Conclusions thereof, as not yet proued. I sawe therefore that in Iustifying these Vntruthes it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to enter the Replie: to labour the principall Matters: and to proue, that all thinges were wel proued. This is in effect to answer the whole. For, other small matters nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so waighty, as the Replyer woulde cauille at them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so weake as he coulde finde any Coulour of Vntruthe to sett vpon them, might well for breuities sake, in a full and perfect Reioyndre be omitted. This therfore I haue done, and by this the Replyer maye thinke him selfe suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently answered, in this former halfe of his Replie.</p>
   <p>Howe, in what Order and maner, and howe farre I ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue this done, it shall nowe appeare. I do first laye forthe the
<pb facs="18"/>
wordes of D. Harding printed in a seueral letter,<note place="margin">
         <hi>The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and maner of setting forthe the same.</hi>
      </note> vpon and aboute the which, the Replier hath noted the Vntruthe. Then foloweth īmediatly the Vntruthe and the nūber the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof noted by the Replyer, worde for worde, as it standeth in the Margin of his Replie vpon the text of D.H. After in an other distinct letter, foloweth the Iustifying and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of the Vntruthe, whereby the Replyer is Rechar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the Vntruthe vpō him Returned, and he proued a Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underer. VVhen occasion serueth, as when some principall Matter contayning doctrine and concerning the state of the Questiō occurreth, whereby the Reader maye be edifyed, the whole text of the Replie cōcerning that matter is inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to euery parcel thereof Answer is made. In the first Article I haue done this only in two places, cōtayning the ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry substaunce of the Article, as I shal anon declare. All the other Vntruthes I Iustifie shortly without entring to the text of the Replyer. Thus I haue there done bicause D.H. hath him selfe made a full and perfit Reioyndre to this first Article. In the Seconde Article, as the Vntruthes there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, require very seldom such labour, but may shortly be Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, so haue I not often entred the text of the Replie, but only aboute the Principall matters of the Article, whereof I shall speake anon. In the thirde and Fourthe Articles, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Fourthe, I haue not lefte any whit of M. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welles Replie, were it neuer so longe and tedyous, vnanswe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, in such places as Vntruthes were noted. VVhat princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Matters I haue after this sorte in these foure Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb facs="19"/>
treated, and discussed, it remayneth nowe to declare.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>The Prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipall Mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and contayned therein·</hi> Fol. <hi>21.</hi> &amp; seq.</note>In the first Article, the Vntruthe noted against the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly externall Sacrifice of Christes Churche, I haue persecuted at large and touched M. Iewelles Replie therein. This I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue done at large and abundatly, bicause the grounde of this Article, which is of priuat Masse standeth hereupon. For a daily externall Sacrifice on the priestes parte being necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and yet the people not bounde by any lawe or precept dai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to communicat, it remayneth most necessary, that in Case none will Receiue, the priest maye and ought to Receiue alone, seing without Receiuing the Sacrifice maye not be celebrated. And thus priuat Masse, which is the sole Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the priest, is founde not only lawfull, but necessary. In the last Vntruthe in like maner touching the place of Chrysostom, M. Iewelles whole Replie is answered, priuat Masse is expressely proued out of Crysostom, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer forced by all reason to Subscribe.</p>
   <p>In the seconde Article, concerning the very questyon of the Challenge,<note place="margin">Fol. <hi>43.</hi> b <hi>44.</hi> a.</note> the Replyer altereth it and enlargeth it, and entreth a newe Action, confessing secretly that in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer he is Guilty. The groundes of the Question, as that Christ is wholy receiued vnder eche kinde. and that the Commaundement of Christ. <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth not to the laye people, but to pristes only (for these being graunted, there is neither Inconuenience, neither the breache of any Cōmaundement committed in receiuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Fol. <hi>41.</hi> a. fol. <hi>44.</hi> a. &amp; seq.</note>One kinde) are bothe treated and proued in two seueral
<pb facs="19"/>
Vntruthes of that Article, and the Replyers text in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter point answered.</p>
   <p>In the thirde Article it is proued against Vntruthes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the contrary, bothe that we at the first Receiuing of the Faithe in our Nation,<note place="margin">Fol. <hi>56.</hi> b. <hi>57.</hi> b. &amp; seq.</note> and that the East and VVest Church within the first <hi>600.</hi> yeres had their Churche Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the Greke and Latin tounges, which the Common people vnderstode not. VVhereby at the beginning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer is forced by all reason to Subscribe. VVhat other spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Matters in this Article are treated, and howe farre I haue entred the Replyers text,<note place="margin">Art. <hi>3.</hi> fol <hi>134.</hi> a.</note> bicause at the ende of the same Article I haue allready particularly declared, I thinke it not nedefull here to repete.</p>
   <p>In the Fourthe Article these principall matters are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re especially treated and discussed by occasion of the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes noted.<note place="margin">Art. <hi>4.</hi> fo. <hi>7.</hi> &amp;. seq. <hi>9.</hi> &amp;. seq.</note> First howe Iohn of Constantinople vsurped the Title of vniuersall Bishop, in what sence he vsurped it, and howe the holy Pope Gregory abhorred it.

The greate Cōtrouersy touching a (anon of the Nicene Coūcell for the Popes primacy forged (as the Replyer saieth) by Pope Zosinius is againe a freshe deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the lōge lying text of the Replyer in that behalfe thouroughly answered,<note place="margin">Fol. <hi>50.</hi> e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>eof. The next Vntruthe forced me to discouer a great number of textes of holy Scripture racked, wrested, and corrupted, partly in generall by all protestants, partly by the Replyer him selfe in this Fourthe Article. VVherein many other pointes touching the Popes primacy (the matter of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle) by the waie are opened. The <hi>.106.</hi> and <hi>107.</hi> Vntruthes occasioned me to enter to the Replyers text touching Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales to Rome.<note place="margin">Fol. <hi>71.</hi> &amp; seq. to the leafe. <hi>111.</hi>
      </note> There it is proued against all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and Obiectiōs of the Replyer, that Appeales to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me were decreed by the holy Councels, practised by the holy and lerned Fathers, namely of Athanasius and S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom two of the greatest patriarches after the B. of Rome, and two of the most lerned Fathers of the greke Churche. Last of all that such Appeales doe necessarely importe a Soueraine Authorite of the Pope ouer the whole Churche. Item that no Appeales can be remoued from the Pope or made to the Emperour in causes ecclesiasticall, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer laboureth in vaine to proue. It is proued also at large in this Article, by occasion of Vntruthes noted to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that the Pope erreth not in faithe: that he hathe all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb facs="20"/>
bene ouer the bishops of the East, that the Pope Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth bishops,<note place="margin">Fol. <hi>111 117.127.135.158.167.107.</hi>
      </note> that he Cōfirmeth and Approueth al Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councelles and without him none can be confirmed: that he Restoreth bishops and Patriarches vniustly depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to their Churches againe: that he Recōcileth them vpō penaunce after Excōmunication: last of al that all doubtes and questions of greater Importance haue bene Remoued to him. Al this by the Practise of the first <hi>.600.</hi> yeres. And in eche of all these Matters the whole text of the Replyer is answered lyne by lyne and stiche by stiche. In fine it is proued against the Replyers Vntruthes,<note place="margin">Fol. <hi>175.</hi> e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> seq.</note> and against his whole text thereupō, bothe that the Bishop of Rome was Called, Saluted and Intitled Vniuersal bishop in the Chalce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dō Coūcel: yea and that of the Bishops and Councell it selfe: and also that many waies and oftē he hath bene called He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad of all Churches,<note place="margin">Fol. <hi>193.194.</hi>
      </note> and bishop of the Vniuersall Church. By the meanes whereof the Replyer is forced by good and expresse euidence, either to reuoke his ouerbolde Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, or els to come to the Booke and Subscribe. And thus much of the principall matters especially treated and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the processe of these foure Articles.</p>
   <p>VVhat profit of all these Matters thus debated, maye of thee be looked for (gentle Reader) thou mayest soone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieue considering only this one Case. D. Harding in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, treating first most of these Matters, bothe hath vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red such good lerning as he founde in other Catholike wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, treating before of the same in latin: and also by his ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and priuat study beside hath added much thereunto, M.
<pb facs="21"/>
Iewell hath in his Replie partly vttered such escapes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the Authorites alleaged, as commonly of the Latin writers of his secte are vsed, partly and that most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath aleaged beside against the Truthe all tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> he coulde finde in other, or hath read him selfe. He hath, I saie, saied for him selfe, as much and more then coulde honestly be saied. He hath opposed, Argument<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, Allegations, reasons and Authorytes for the Contrary parte: As if he did not Replie against an other, but treate him selfe freely and freshly of the matter. By this meanes in these two bookes (the Answer of D. Harding, and the Replie of M. Iewell) bothe partes haue saied their minde, the one for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faithe: the other not only against the Catholike faythe, but also for his owne secte and opinion. I haue bene therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re driuen in persecuting the text of the Replies, not only to defende the Catholike, but also to answer the heretike: not only to vpholde our owne groūdes and to repayre them with newe defences, against the Replyers newe assaultes, but much more to ouerthrowe the Aduersaryes groundes and foundations which he opposeth and setteth vp afresh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Truthe. I haue done therefore herein a thirde and newe labour in most pointes not before done of any. By perusing whereeof, thou shalt (gentle Reader) be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, not only howe to maintaine the Catholike doctrine, but also howe to ouerthrowe the heresy: not only to see the groundes of the Catholike faithe established, fortified and confirmed, but also to beholde the fickle foundations of the
<pb facs="21"/>
Lutheran and Caluinian Religion (touching the pointes here treated) battered, shaken, and ouerthrowen. Brefely thou shalt see in the person of M. Iewell and of his maner of reasoning, that the foundation of his and his felowes Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligiō, especially against their dewe Obedience to the See A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike, standeth vpon Ignorance of the stories, falsifying of the doctours, of councelles, of the lawes,<note place="margin">
         <hi>His Vntru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thes in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se to</hi> .562.</note> and of other good Authors bothe olde and newe. For hereof loe, Arise the hundreds of Vntruthes committed by this Replyer in the treating only of these principall matters aboue specified and in fighting only against the weakest and vntruest par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of his aduersaryes Answer. If our purpose had bene, to haue gone alonge his whole Replie and to haue persecuted his text vpon other partes of the Answer, not so noted with Vntruthes, and therefore of all lykelyhood the more True partes, the Stronger, and the lesse able truly to be reproued, this Replyer then should tel by the Thousandes, and might go for a Pinner for his Numbers of Vntruthes. But of his Dealing in the Epistle prefixed to him, it hath bene saied sufficiently. To returne to our matter I saie.</p>
   <p>If the Argument of these other three first Articles do lesse delight, as being in dede of lesse importaunce, yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider I beseche thee (gentle Reader, if thou shortly desire to be informed which waye to take) and diligently peruse the Fourthe Article of this booke. Namely in such places whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re M. Iewelles Replie against Appeales made to the Pope, against the Confirmation of Generall Councelles, and of
<pb facs="22"/>
Bishops that were doubtefully Ordred, against the Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of bishops depriued, the Reconciliation of bishops ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and against the Authorite of the Pope ouer the East Churche is examined, answered, and confuted. For in those places it shall appeare, bothe with what shiftes, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, Inconueniences, and open Vntruthes the allegatyōs of D.
