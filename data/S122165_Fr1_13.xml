      </gap> I confesse haue escaped, some by the Printers ouersight, some through defects in my selfe to performe so great a Worke, and some by meanes of the greatnesse of the Labour, and that I was constrained to seeke after my liuing, being void of friends to beare some part of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. The rather therefore accept this at my hands (louing Countrey-men) as a token of my good will; and I trust that the best and well minded wil not rashly condemne me, although some thing haue passed worthy reprehension.
