   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>DEare Reader, <hi>though so great bee the force of Happines to drawe all men to seeke after it; that there is not to bee found, any one so lost or forlorne, as publickely to professe, that he loueth afflictions and griefes; as they are vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and paines: yet such is the pride and obstiancie of many, that rather then they wilbe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced to bee men of euill lines, they will defend that to be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, which they loue, and not that which is Happines indeed: and so heartily louing carnall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and sensuall life, vnder false pretexts, of</hi> Libertie of the
<pb facs="7"/> Gospel, Iustification by Faith onely. Assurednes of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. <hi>haue put</hi> Content <hi>and</hi> Happines <hi>in sensualitie of life, and not to be discouered, that they are Hogges (as</hi> Horace <note place="margin">Hor. lib. 1 Epist. 4.</note>
      <hi>saith) of the Heard of</hi> Epicures, <hi>doe craftily colour their Carnall libertie, vnder the vaile of</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>and so perswade as many as will beleeue them.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>First that abstinence, or fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from meate, drinke, and sleepe, at certaine times, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luther in lib. liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiana. Caluin. lib 4. Inst. and their folowers.</note>
      <hi>certaine dayes, is superstition, contrary to the worde of God, and the libertie of their Gospell, so that they cannot bee happy without the libertie of eating, drinking, and sleeping, as much as they will, and when they will.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Secondly, that it is not possible to liue Chaste, so to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luth. in lib. libert. christiana</note>
      <hi>and Happines, according to</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>their Doctrine, it is necessarie</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cal. lib. 2 institut. cap. 7. &amp; their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</note>
      <hi>that they haue alwayes a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Thirdly, that man hath no freewill, or power to resist the putting in practise of his euill</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luther in lib deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uo arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio. Calu. lib. 2. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. cap. 2 &amp; in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doto Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilij Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentini. and their followers</note>
      <hi>thoughts, suggestions, or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall desires; whether they bee of theft, fornication, adulterie, or heresie, &amp;c. Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that according to their Doctrine, they cannot be happy without the libertie of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fornication, adultery, theft, and preaching whatsoeuer sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of the deuill, or thoughts shall arise in their mindes &amp;c. Since as they say, they haue not Freewill, or power to resist them, or doe otherwise, and hee was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer esteemed happy, who was bound to obserue, that which was aboue his power and might.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>And accordingly to this,</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <hi>they teach, and preach for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that all the actions of men are of their owne Nature mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sinnes, worthy of euerlasting paines, as well the best as the worst: that all sinnes are equall: that euill thoughts not consented vnto are mortall sinnes, and that as grieuous mortall sinnes, as if they had committed the fact: Whereupon they inferre that it is not possible to keepe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God, or merite any thing by well doing, and so craftily colouring their Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme vnder the pretext of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they seeme to their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, neither to deceiue, nor bee deceiued in their opinions, or practise of Happines; but by this craft preserue their credits, and liue without suspition of wretchednes; and yet take to themselues libertie to doe, what</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <hi>their Flesh or concupicences doe desire, without respect either to God or man, more then the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse, not to incurre the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and pennalties of Penall Lawes: Insomuch as that they haue put</hi> Conscience <hi>(which in Catholicke times, men vsed to carry in their hearts, and soules) into their neighbours eyes; that if he see them not doing amisse, to accuse them to a Iudge, &amp; bring them within the compasse of some penall Lawe, all is well;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cal lib. 3 inst ca. 14. Melāct. in locis anni 1521. tit. de pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. Cicero de leg.</note>
      <hi>In the sight of</hi> God, <hi>their best, and worst workes, are of their owne nature (as they say) all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually mortall sinnes; And he who</hi> feareth nothing but a Iudge, and a witnes <hi>(as</hi> Cicero <hi>a Heathen man well obserued)</hi> What will not he doe in the darke?</p>
   <p>
      <hi>And this policy, these Libertines</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/>
      <hi>haue borrowed from</hi> Epicurus, <hi>a heathen Philosopher, who harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly louing carnall libertie, and sensuall life; not to be of all men contemned, and accounted as a beast, would not in plaine tearms defend publickely:</hi> That man had no other happines then sensuall life, <hi>but coloured his Lasciniousnesse vnder pretext of Religion, and taught for truths:</hi> That the Soule of man was mortall: and that after death there was no reward for good deedes, <hi>and so by denying of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite for good workes, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment condigne to wicked deedes (with the</hi> Lutherans <hi>and</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenistes <note place="margin">English Creed Art. 11.</note>
      <hi>of this age) he founded his Sect, Happines, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vpon the groundes of Faith onely, without merite for good workes, or exercises of vertue: and by this craft, did what his</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/>
      <hi>concupiscences desired, and yet preserued his credit, of being a Philosopher; and found many followers in all ages: Insomuch as St.</hi> Augustine <hi>(before his Conuersion to our Catholicke Church) if he could haue belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the</hi> Epicurian <hi>Articles, had made himselfe of the Sect of the</hi> Epicures, <hi>as hee saith in these wordes:</hi> Nothing did call me, from the deepe gulfe of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">August. lib. Conf. 8. cap. 16</note> pleasures, but the feare of death, and the Iudgement of God to come, which (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the diuers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions I held) neuer departed from my brest: And I did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with my friends, <hi>Alipius,</hi> and <hi>Nebridius</hi> of the ends of good, and euill: and <hi>Epicurus</hi> had caried away the prize in my minde, had I not beleeued that after death, there did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
<pb facs="10"/> a life of the Soule, and places proportionable to our merits, which <hi>Epicurus</hi> would not beleeue. <hi>So S.</hi> Augustine.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>And from this Epicurian Doctrine of Protestants, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of their Gospell, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth their aboundant fruites, and workes of the Flesh; which are so copious, that as their owne Authors doe testifie;</hi> In <hi>Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
      <note place="margin">Richard Iefferie in his Serm. printed 1605. page 31.</note> was neuer more drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, In <hi>Italie</hi> more wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp;c. In <hi>Iurie</hi> more hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, In <hi>Turkie</hi> more impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, In <hi>Tartarie</hi> more iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then is practised generally in <hi>England.</hi> The people (of <note place="margin">Stubbes in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory before his Booke of good Workes.</note> England saith another of their Authors are) in most places dissolute, proude, enuious, malitious, disdainfull, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, ambitious, carelesse of good workes. <hi>So these two</hi>
      <pb facs="10"/>
      <hi>English Protestant Authors; yet the one affirmeth</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">Iefferie</note>
      <hi>that hee spoke what he had plainely seene</hi> in the course of some trauels, <hi>and the</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">Stubbes</note>
      <hi>other what hee had found in trauelling</hi> the whole Realme round about. <hi>And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the testimonies of these two, is the Lamentation of the</hi> Puritans, <hi>in their milde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, alleaged in Mr.</hi> Powels <hi>Booke, of thinges indifferent, saying:</hi> What eye so blinde, that it doth not gushe out with teares, to behold the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of our supposed glorious Church, I meane the great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, the Superficiall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, the fearefull blasphemies, and swearings in houses and streets, &amp;c. The dishonour of Superiours, the pride, cruelty, fornications, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries, drunkennes, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes,
<pb facs="11"/> vsuries, and other like abominations, &amp;c. O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde and pitty, the wofull and lamentable estate of our Church in these thinges. <hi>And with this agreeth the testimonie of their Apostle</hi> Luther, <hi>saying:</hi> The world by this Doctrine <note place="margin">In Postil. super E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uang: Domini. Aduentus</note>
      <hi>(of Protestants)</hi> is dayly made worse: <hi>Againe in the same Postile:</hi> In so bright a light of the Gospell <hi>(of Protestants)</hi> men are more couetous, more craftie, more vniust, more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, more froward, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they are much woorse, then they were before in the Papacie. <hi>Againe:</hi> Before time when we were seduced by the <hi>Pope,</hi> euery man did willingly follow good works, and now no man, saith or knoweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, but how to get all to himselfe, by exactions, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
<pb facs="11"/> theft, lying, vsurie, &amp;c. <hi>Againe:</hi> It is <hi>(saith hee)</hi> a wonderfull thing, and full of <note place="margin">In Serm. coni. Ger. Fer. 5.</note> scandall, that from the time, in which the pure Doctrine of the Gospell was first called to light, the world should dayly growe worse. <hi>Of this</hi> Henry <hi>the eight, after hee was a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant lamented, saying:</hi> I am sory that the Readers of the worde of GOD, follow it in <note place="margin">Fox Act. 1 pag. 1124</note> dooing so faintly, and coldly. For of this I am sure, that Charitie was neuer so faint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, and vertuous and Godly liuing, was neuer lesse vsed, nor God himselfe amongst Christians, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lesse reuerenced, honored, and serued. <hi>And with this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of K.</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 8. <hi>agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the testimony of</hi> Fox, <hi>saying:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Fox con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderat. 4.</note> To rip vp all our deformities
<pb facs="12"/> in particular, I meane not heere; neither need I, the same being so euident to all mens eyes, that who cannot see, our excessiue outrage in pompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Aoparell, our carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and vnchaste demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, without feare of God, our carelesse securitie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Conscience, as though there were no Iudgement to come! our studdy vpon this world, as if there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heauen? <hi>And the same also affirmeth</hi> Caluin, <hi>saying:</hi>
      <note place="margin">In cap▪ 11 Dan. 5. 34</note> Ampugst the small number of those, who haue withdrawen themselues, from the Idolatry of the Papists; the greater part is full of treachery, and craft, they counterfeit indeed great zeale, but if thou looke into them, thou shalt finde them full of deceit. <hi>Againe:</hi> There
<pb facs="12"/> is scarsely to bee found the <note place="margin">In com. 2 Pet. 1. 2.</note> tenth <hi>(Protestant)</hi> who hath for any other end, giuen his name to the Gospell, <hi>(of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants)</hi> then that hee might with greater libertie, flowe in all Laciuiousnes. <hi>Whereupon</hi> Andreas Musculus, <hi>another</hi>
      <note place="margin">In libro de nouis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo die.</note>
      <hi>Protestant saith:</hi> If we would confesse the truth: then are wee compelled to witnes this of vs Gospellers, that there are not to bee found in the whole world, men more gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to whooring, vsurie, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening, and deceite then we. <hi>Againe:</hi> the thing it selfe doth speake, and truth doth compell vs to confesse, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">In the same book</note> against our wills) that now men are become worse, and more irreligious, more ingrate, more vnfaithful, more shamelesse, and that greater
<pb facs="13"/> wickednesse, and sinnes, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee found in the whole world, no not amongst the Turkes truly, or the Iewes, or Pagans, then in those places, where the worde of the Lord <hi>(of Protestants)</hi> is most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently preached. <hi>Againe:</hi> I am compelled to say, because <note place="margin">Muscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetia Christi.</note> it is true, that there are not to bee found, no not among the heathen, Iewes, or Turkes, men more selfe-willed, in whose mindes the sparkes of all vertues are extinct, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whome sinne is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted nothing: then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the professors of the Gospell <hi>(of Protestants)</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whome the Deuill al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together loosed from his chaynes, and in free libertie doth florish; And that I may in few words tell all, it is euen
<pb facs="13"/> so, and this is the estate of vs <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that if any be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to see a great multitude of Knaues, Athists, Vsurers, and Coseners, hee must goe to some Citty where the Gospell <hi>(of Protestants)</hi> is preached, and there he shall finde of this sorte of men, by multitudes, <hi>and repeating almost the same wordes in another place, he saith:</hi> The case standeth thus with vs <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that if any bee <note place="margin">Musculus Domi. 1▪ Aduentus</note> desirous to see a great table of Knaues, of persons turbulent, deceitfull, coseners, vsurers; let him go to any Citty where the Gospell is purely Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and he shall finde them there by multitudes; for it is more manifest, then the day light, that there were neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ethnicks, Turkes, and other Infidels, more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled
<pb facs="14"/> and vnruely persons, with whome all vertue, and honestie is quite extinct, then are among the professors of the Gospel. <hi>And</hi> Iacobus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas <hi>another Protestant saith:</hi> The other part, and multitude <note place="margin">Andreas adu. 11. Luc.</note> of <hi>Germans</hi> doe giue libertie indeede, to the Preaching of the worde: But there is not perceiued an amendment of manners amongst them, but horrible Epicurisme, &amp; beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life is seene amongst them, in their conuersations, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of body, desires, &amp;c. In stead of fasting they attend wholly to feastings, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings night and day. <hi>And</hi> Melancton <hi>a Protestant saith:</hi> The thing it selfe doth speake <note place="margin">Ad cap 6. Math.</note> that in these Countries <hi>(where the Protestant Gospell was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched)</hi> almost all their studies
<pb facs="14"/> are imployed, in sumptuous preparations for banquets, &amp; drunkennesse, and exceeding great cuppes, &amp;c. Such barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnes is in the people, that the most part perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, if they should fast one day, the night following they should dye. <hi>So these Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of the fruites of their owne Doctrine.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Of the comming of these</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, Libertines, <hi>and</hi> loose li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, <hi>three of the Apostles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied saying:</hi> In the last daies <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 1.</note> shall approch perilous times, and men shalbe louers of thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, Couetous, Haughtie, Proude, Blasphemous, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to their Parents, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, wicked, without affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, without peace, accusers, incontinent, vnmerciful, with out benignity, Traytors, stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,
<pb facs="15"/> puffed vp, and louers of voluptuousnes, more then of God, hauing an apparance indeed of pietie <hi>(euery one his Bible)</hi> but denying the vertue thereof, <hi>the keeping of the Law. Againe:</hi> In the last dayes shal come mockers in deceit, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 3</note> according to their owne concupicenses. <hi>Againe:</hi> my dearest bee mindefull of the <note place="margin">Iud. 1.</note> wordes, which haue been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before by the Apostles of our Lord Iesus Christ, who told you, that in the last times shall come, mockers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne desires, walking in impietie. These are they which seperate them selues, Sensuall, hauing not the Spirit of God, <hi>whose fruits are</hi> Charitie, Ioy, Peace, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22</note> Benignitie, Longanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Goodnes, Mildenes, Faith,
