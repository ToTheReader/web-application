   <head>The Printers to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He dedication of this work having been made by the Authour to the <hi>Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie</hi> onely, how should we now presume to interest any mortall man in the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of it? Much lesse think we it meet to seek the recommendation of the Muses, for that which himself was confident to have been inspired by a diviner breath then flows from <hi>Helicon.</hi> The world therefore shall receive it in that naked simplicitie, with which he left it, without any addition either of support or ornament, more then is included in it self. We leave it free and unforestalled to every mans judgement, and to the benefit that he shall finde by perusall. Onely for the clearing of some passages, we have thought it not unfit to make the common Reader privie to some few particularities of the condition and disposition of the Person;</p>
   <p>Being nobly born, and as eminently endued with gifts of the minde, and having by industrie and happy education perfected them to that great height of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, whereof his fellowship of Trinitie Colledge in Cambridge, and his Orator-ship in the Universitie, together with that knowledge which the Kings Court <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>d taken of him, could make relation farre above or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie. Quitting both his deserts and all the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities that he had for worldly preferment, he betook himself to the Sanctuarie and Temple of God, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rather to serve at Gods Altar, then to seek the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb facs="3"/>
of State-employments. As for those inward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements to this course (for outward there was none) which many of these ensuing verses bear witnesse of, they detract not from the freedome, but adde to the honour of this resolution in him. As God had enabled him, so he accounted him meet not onely to be called, but to be compelled to this service: Wherein his faith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>full discharge was such, as may make him justly a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to the primitive Saints, and a pattern or more for the age he lived in.</p>
   <p>To testifie his independencie upon all others, and to quicken his diligence in this kinde, he used in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie speech, when he made mention of the blessed name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to adde, <hi>My Master.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Next God, he loved that which God himself hath magnified above all things, that is, his Word: so as he hath been heard to make solemne protestation, that he would not part with one leaf thereof for the whole world, if it were offered him in exchange.</p>
   <p>His obedience and conformitie to the Church and the discipline thereof was singularly remarkable Though he abounded in private devotions, yet wen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> he every morning and evening with his familie to the Church; and by his example, exhortations, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements drew the greater part of his parishioners to accompanie him dayly in the publick celebration of Divine Service.</p>
   <p>As for worldly matters, his love and esteem to them was so little, as no man can more ambitiously seek, then he did earnestly endeavour the resignation of an Ecclesiasticall dignitie, which he was possessour of. But God permitted not the accomplishment of this desire, having ordained him his instrument for reedifying of the Church belonging thereunto, that had layen rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated almost twenty yeares. The reparation whereof,
<pb facs="3"/>
having been uneffectually attempted by publick col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, was in the end by his own and some few others private free-will-offerings succesfully effected. With the remembrance whereof, as of an especiall good work, when a friend went about to comfort him on his death-bed, he made answer, <hi>It is a good work, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>f it be sprinkled with the bloud of Christ:</hi> otherwise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hen in this respect he could finde nothing to glorie or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>omfort himself with, neither in this, nor in any other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hing.</p>
   <p>And these are but a few of many that might be said, which we have chosen to premise as a glance to some parts of the ensuing book, and for an example to the Reader. We conclude all with his own Motto, with which he used to conclude all things that might seem to tend any way to his own honour;</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Lesse then the least of Gods mercies.</hi>
