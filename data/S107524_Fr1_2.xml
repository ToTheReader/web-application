      <hi>To the right worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Maister FRENCH, Maior of the Towne of</hi> Cambridge <hi>and the rest of the hearers of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish commonly called S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Grace and all good <hi>things.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian friendes, so soone as God gaue me a calling to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come your teacher; I bethought mee which might bee the fittest course and carriage of my Ministrie, both for your best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and mine owne discharge: and after a little deliberation, I easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued of three thinges. 1. to call you
<pb facs="3"/>
to a loue, and a cheerefull frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the holy exercises of Religion in the house of God; by which as by a praeface I entered into my labours, and this from the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.</hi> Psal. 84. 10. 2. to teach you how to behaue your selues being <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent before God.</hi> from the example of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Act. 10. 33. 3. to preach Christ vnto you; which by Gods mercy I haue also performed out of <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon following frō <hi>ver. 33.</hi> to <hi>44.</hi> Wherin I haue <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">

      </gap> intreated of the most fundam<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>al points of our Christian Religion: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoring in all these to approue my heart vnto the Lord, and my desire of your profiting euen to your selues. Of the first of these I haue here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you a further view and account; the other two depend one vpon the other, &amp; containe a labour of longer time; besides that the eye of our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath seene what a surfet &amp; lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="3"/>
this our age hath taken of sound <hi>practical diuinity:</hi> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely thus much I haue presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for your sakes to publish, to the purpose that each of your families might haue a coppy for the helping of your memories; not intending any further view of clearer light. But if the Printers haue ouer-intreated me to make the benefit (as they tearmed it) more common; then I shall desire of such as for whome these thinges were not principally prepared, the forbearance of any curious censure, seeing it was plainly fitted and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto a plaine auditory, and not intended to behold such an open light. Wherein yet it may afford this vse, that being a subiect in which I haue obserued none going before me by way of treatise; it may yeeld both occasions and groundes to some more able instrument to inlarge and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne so necessary and so profitable
<pb facs="4"/>
an argument. Which heartily I wish; the rather, because in these desolate daies of ours, these <hi>beauties of Gods house,</hi> are by so many men, &amp; so many meanes obscured, as that nū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers giuen-ouer to Atheisme and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, are bold not onely to moue (which were too much) but strongly defend that our Saboth is either not to be kept, or not so straightly: that either our Sermons neede not to bee heard or not so frequently: &amp; that to walk according to the light here shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, at least so <hi>accurately</hi> &amp; strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">

         </gap>.</note> as the Apostle prescribeth, is too much precisenes: the which with sundry other disguised conceites of vayne men, if they shall preuaile so far as they threaten, surely our <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thels</hi> in shorte time will become <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thavens;</hi> our houses of God, dens of theeues, and the voice of our Church will be no other then that of <hi>Nao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi.</hi>

      <hi>for why should yee call me so, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord hath humbled mee, and the almighty hath brought mee vnto aduersity,</hi> how glorious a worke thē would it be to ioyne in the preseruing of the beauty of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Iesus Christ?</hi> and that not by any artificiall paynting of the face of this chaste spouse (for that is fitter for the <hi>Romish</hi> Harlot) but by a plaine manifestation of her owne face and natiue beauty out of the word, which preferreth her beauty before that of the <hi>Rose of the field,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 1</note> and the <hi>Lilly of the vallies,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that the <hi>Lilly among the thornes</hi> doth not so surpasse in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as <hi>she doth among the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> Surely such a glorious worke as this shal not want a glorious reward. But to returne to you y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hearers, these briefe notes being properly yours, to you they are of right directed as a testymony of my loue and inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

vnto you: the which (if the Lord had thought meet) I desirously would haue still testified by voice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, rather then by this my writing: by which I recommend these few lessons to your Godly learning, and my self vnto your praiers.</p>
