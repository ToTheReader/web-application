   <p rend="italic">IN obseruing (sir) this last yere your order &amp; condition of doing, I founde the custome and course of your vertues nothing inferiour to the cōmon opinion of the same. Wherof as I proued peculiarly in my self by many means &amp; times, but most by a ciuile cōuersation of your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie during the best part of the sommer, so I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cōpt my selfe no lesse vnworthy of such benefite passed, than vnmete eftsoones to vse or partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate with the like, if such det be not discharged by some thankefull argument of good will, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with matter of myne own indeuor, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the qualitie of my talēt. And albeit I haue at tymes heretofore protested vnto you simply my seruiceable &amp; vnfained zeale (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I hope you doubt not) yet me thinkes, with the nature of a barren soyle yelding no fruite, the same might seeme no lesse vnprofitable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, than imperfecte in my selfe, if it be not approued with some absolute and vnfayned shewe, and that in the publyke eye of the worlde, in whiche respect I haue presumed to lay afore you this little Translation, a worke neyther improper for the purpose of good doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
<pb facs="3"/> nor impertinent to the profession of a true Christian, and for the mater, it discouereth a a most perfect Methode or plot, to discerne the principall pointes of our Religion, with certein speciall places of Scripture toward the ende, to induce the church to vnitie, and the people to imbrace the league of charitie left vs by Christ as well in the example of himselfe, enduryng sundry sortes of villanous reproches, as in the president of his Apostles and Prophetes, who suffered with greate pacience the barbarous disposition of the enimies to their religion.</p>
   <p rend="italic">This as I culled out amongst other, as a worke resembling your owne vertues, so in the often reading it, I doute not you shall finde a happie confirmation of iudgement in good things, the same as the Apostle sayeth, being one chiefe and principall frute of knowledge, and therfore moste necessarie that we acquaint our myndes with godly exercises and meditations of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, praying you lastly to let it receyue youre protection, to the ende our countrey and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian neighboures, by youre meane the rather, may plentifully participate in the benefite of the same, wherin also I accompt my trauaile sufficiently aunswered, if this become thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="3"/> to you, in sort of an earnest peny or first of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of my good will, reseruing notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to giue a better shewe hereafter, as tyme with quiet leysure shall assist me. And so God giue you a good new yeare, and confirme vs all in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feare.</p>
