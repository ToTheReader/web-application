   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough for no other cause,<note place="margin">The cause and occasion of handling these things: and what might be wished in them for whose sakes so much paine is taken.</note> yet for this; that posteritie may knowe wee haue not loosely through silence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thinges to passe away as in a dreame, there shall be for mens infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation extant thus much concerning the present state of the Church of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished amongst vs, and their care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full endeuour which would haue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the same. At your hands beloued in our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ (for in him the loue which we beare vnto all that would but seeme to be borne of him, it is not the sea of your gall and bitternes that shall euer drowne) I haue no great cause to looke for other then the selfesame portion &amp; lot, which your maner hath bene hitherto to lay on them that concur not in opinion and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with you. But our hope is, that the God of peace shal (notwithstanding mans nature too impatient of contumelious maledictiō) inable vs quietly and euē gladly to suffer al things, for that worke sake which we couet to perform. The wonderful zeale and feruour wherewith ye haue withstood the receiued orders of this Church, was the first thing which caused me to enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, whether (as all your published bookes and writings peremptorily maintain) euery Christian man fearing God, stand bound to ioyne with you for the furtherance of that which ye tearme <hi>the Lords Discipline.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="5"/>
I must plainly confesse vnto you, that before I examined your sundrie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations in that behalfe, it could not settle in my head to thinke, but that vndoubtedly such nūbers of otherwise right wel affected &amp; most religiously enclined minds, had some maruellous reasonable inducementes which led thē with so great earnestnes that way. But when once, as near as my slender abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie would serue, I had with trauell &amp; care performed that part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles aduise &amp; counsel in such cases, whereby he willeth to <hi>try al things;</hi> and was come at the length so far, that there remained onely the other clause to be satisfied, wherein he concludeth that <hi>what good is must bee held:</hi> there was in my poore vnderstanding no remedie, but to set downe this as my finall resolute perswasion; <hi>Surely the present forme of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment which the lawes of this land haue established, is such, as no lawe of God, nor reason of man hath hitherto bene alleaged, of force sufficient to proue they do ill, who to the vttermost of their power withstand the alteration thereof:</hi> Contrariwise, <hi>The other which instead of it we are required to accept, is only by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror &amp; misconceipt named the ordinance of Iesus Christ, no one proofe as yet brought forth, whereby it may clearely appeare to be so in very deede.</hi> The explication of which two thinges I haue here thought good to offer into your owne hands: hartily beseeching you euen by the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Iesus Christ, whome I trust ye loue; that, as ye tender the peace and quietnesse of this Church, if there bee in you that gracious humilitie which hath euer bene the crowne and glory of a christianly disposed minde, if your owne soules, hearts and consciences, (the sound integritie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of can but hardly stand with the refusall of truth in personall respects) be, as I doubt not but they are, things most deare and precious vnto you, <hi>Let not the faith which ye haue in our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> be blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <hi>with partialities,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ia. 2.1.</note> regard not who it is which speaketh, but waigh onely what is spoken. Thinke not that ye reade the wordes of one, who ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himselfe as an aduersary against the truth which ye haue alreadie embraced; but the words of one, who desireth euen to embrace together with you the selfe same truth, if it be the truth; and for that cause (for no other God hee knoweth) hath vndertaken the burthensome labour of this painefull kinde of conference. For the plainer accesse whereunto, let it bee lawfull for mee to rip vp to the very bottome how and by whom your Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was planted, at such time as this age wee liue in began to make first tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thereof.</p>
   <p n="2">
      <pb n="3" facs="5"/>2. A founder it had, whome, for mine owne part,<note place="margin">The first esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of new discipline by M. Caluins industry in the Church of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua: and the beginning of strife about it amongst our selues.</note> I thinke incomparably the wisest man that euer the french Church did enioy, since the houre it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed him. His bringing vp was in the studie of the Ciuill Lawe. Diuine knowledge he gathered not by hearing or reading so much, as by teaching others. For though thousands were debters to him, as touching knowledge in that kinde; yet he to none but onely to God, the author of that most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed fountaine the booke of life, and of the admirable dexteritie of wit, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the helpes of other learning which were his guides: till being occasioned to leaue Fraunce, he fell at the length vpon Geneua: Which Citie, the Bishop and Cleargie thereof had a little before (as some doe affirme) forsaken, being of likelihood frighted with the peoples sudden attempt for abolishment of popish religiō: the euent of which enterprise they thought it not safe for themselues to wait for in that place. At the comming of Caluin thither, the forme of their ciuill regiment was popular, as it continueth at this day: neither King, nor Duke, nor Noble man of any authoritie or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer them, but officers chosen by the people yearely out of themselues, to order all things with publique consent. For spirituall gouernment, they had no lawes at all agreed vpon, but did what the pastors of their soules by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion could win them vnto. Caluin being admitted one of their Preachers &amp; a diuinitie Reader amongst them, considered how dangerous it was that the whole estate of that Church should hang stil on so slender a thred, as the liking of an ignorant multitude is, if it haue power to change whatsoeuer it selfe listeth. Wherefore taking vnto him two of the other ministers for more countenance of the action, (albeit the rest were all against it) they moued, and in the end perswaded with much adoe, the people to bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by solemne oath, first neuer to admit the Papacie amongst them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and secondly, to liue in obedience vnto such orders concerning the exercise of their religion, and the forme of their ecclesiasticall gouernment, as those their true and faithfull Ministers of Gods word had agreeablie to Scripture set downe for that end and purpose. When these thinges began to bee put in vre, the people also (what causes mouing them thereunto, themselues best know) began to repent them of that they had done, and irefully to champe vpon the bit they had taken into their mouthes, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that they grew by meanes of this innouation into dislike with some Churches neare about them, the benefite of whose good friendship their state could not well lacke. It was the manner of those times (whether through mens desire to enioy alone the glory of their owne enterprises, or else because the quicknesse of their occasions required present dispatch,)
<pb n="4" facs="6"/>
so it was, that euery particular Church did that within it selfe, which some fewe of their owne thought good, by whome the rest were all directed. Such nūber of Churches thē being, though free within themselues, yet smal, commō conference before hand might haue eased them of much aftertrouble. But a greater inconuenience it bred, that euery later endeuoured to bee certaine degrees more remoued from conformitie with the Church of Rome, then the rest before had bene: whereupon grew maruellous great dissimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, and by reason thereof, iealousies, hartburnings, iarres and discords amongst them. Which notwithstanding might haue easily bene preuented, if the orders which each Church did thinke fit and conuenient for it selfe, had not so peremptorily bene established vnder that high commaunding forme, which tendered them vnto the people, as things euerlastingly required by the law of that Lord of Lords, against whose statutes there is no exception to be taken. For by this meane it came to passe, that one Church could not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse &amp; condemne another of disobedience to the wil of Christ, in those things where manifest difference was betweene them: whereas the selfesame orders allowed, but yet established in more warie and suspense maner, as being to stand in force till God should giue the opportunitie of some general cōference what might be best for euery of them afterwards to doe; this I say had both preuented all occasion of iust dislik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> which others might take, and reserued a greater libertie vnto the authors themselues of entring into farther consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiō afterwards. Which though neuer so necessary they could not easily now admit, without some feare of derogation from their credit: and therfore that which once they had done, they became for euer after resolute to maintaine. Caluin therfore &amp; the other two his associats stiffely refusing to administer the holy Communion to such as would not quietly without contradiction and murmur submit themselues vnto the orders which their solemne oath had bound them to obey, were in that quarell banished the towne. A fewe yeares after (such was the leuitie of that people) the places of one or two of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters being fallen voyde, they were not before so willing to be rid of their learned Pastor, as now importunate to obtaine him againe from them who had giuen him entertainment, and which were loath to part with him, had not vnresistable earnestnes bene vsed. One of the towne ministers that sawe in what manner the people were bent for the reuocation of Caluin, gaue him notize of their affection in this sort. <hi>The Senate of two hundred being assembled,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Epist. Cal. 24.</note>
      <hi>they all craue Caluin. The next day a generall conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. They crye in like sort againe all: VVe will haue Caluin that good and learned man Christs Minister. This,</hi> saith he, <hi>when
<pb n="5" facs="6"/>
I vnderstood I could not choose but praise God, nor was I able to iudge otherwise, then that this was the Lordes doing,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luc. 20.17.</note>
      <hi>and that it was maruellous in our eyes,</hi> and <hi>That the stone which the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders refused, was now made the head of the corner.</hi> The other two whom they had throwne out (together with Caluin) they were content should enioy their exile. Many causes might lead them to bee more desirous of him. First, his yeelding vnto them in one thing, might happily put them in hope, that time would breed the like easines of condescending further vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. For in his absence he had perswaded them, with whome he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to preuaile, that albeit himselfe did better like of common bread to bee vsed in the Eucharist, yet the other they rather should accept, then cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trouble in the Church about it. Againe, they saw that the name of Caluin waxed euery day greater abroad, and that together with his fame their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy was spread, who had so rashly and childishly eiected him. Besides it was not vnlikely but that his credite in the world, might many wayes stand the poore towne in great stead: as the truth is, their ministers forrein esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation hitherto hath bene the best stake in their hedge. But whatsoeuer secret respects were likely to moue them, for contenting of their mindes Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin returned (as it had bene an other Tully) to his olde home. He ripely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered how grosse a thing it were for men of his qualitie, wise and graue men, to liue with such a multitude, and to be tenants at will vnder them, as their ministers, both himselfe and others, had bene. For the remedie of which inconuenience, hee gaue them plainely to vnderstand, that if he did become their teacher againe, they must be content to admit a complet forme of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which both they and also their pastors should now be solemnely sworne to obserue for euer after. Of which discipline the maine and principall partes were these: A standing ecclesiasticall Court to be established: perpetuall Iudges in that Court to be their ministers; others of the people annually cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen (twise so many in number as they) to be iudges together with them in the same Court: these two sorts to haue the care of all mens manners, power of determining all kind of Ecclesiasticall causes, and authoritie to conuent, to controll, to punish, as farre as with excōmunication, whomsoeuer they should thinke worthy, none eyther small or great excepted, This deuise I see not how the wisest at that time liuing could haue bettered, if we duly consider what the present estate of Geneua did then require. For their Bishop and his Clergie being (as it is said) departed from them by moonelight, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, being departed; to choose in his roome any other Bishop, had beene a thing altogether impossible. And for their ministers to seeke that themselues alone might haue coerciue power ouer the whole Church, would perhaps
<pb n="6" facs="7"/>
haue bene hardly construed at that time. But when so franke an offer was made, that for euery one minister there should be two of the people to sit and giue voyce in the Ecclesiasticall Consistory, what inconuenience could they easily find which themselues might not be able alwayes to remedy? Howbeit (as euermore the simpler sort are, euen when they see no apparant cause, iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous notwithstanding ouer the secret intents and purposes of wiser men) this proposition of his did somewhat trouble them. Of the Ministers themselues which had stayed behinde in the Citie when Caluin was gone, some, vpon knowledge of the peoples earnest intent to recall him to his place againe, had beforehand written their letters of submission, and assured him of their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance for euer after, if it should like him to harken vnto that publique suite. But yet misdoubting what might happen, if this discipline did goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde; they obiected against it the example of other reformed Churches, liuing quietly and orderly without it. Some of chiefest place and countenance amongst the laitie professed with greater stomacke their iudgements, that such a discipline was little better then popish tyrannie disguised and tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them vnder a new forme. This sort, it may be, had some feare that the filling vp of the seates in the Consistorie, with so great a number of lay men, was but to please the mindes of the people, to the ende they might thinke their owne swaye somewhat; but when things came to triall of practise, their Pastors learning would bee at all times of force to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perswade simple men, who knowing the time of their owne President<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to bee but short, would alwayes stand in feare of their ministers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall authoritie: and among the ministers themselues, one being so farre in estimation aboue the rest, the voyces of the rest were likely to be giuen for the most part respectiuely with a kinde of secret dependencie and awe: so that in shewe a maruellous indifferently composed Senate Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call was to gouerne, but in effect one onely man should, as the Spirite and soule of the residue, doe all in all. But what did these vaine sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises boote? Brought they were now to so straight an issue, that of two thinges they must choose one; namely, whether they would to their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse disgrace, with ridiculous lightnes, dismisse him, whose restitution they had in so impotent maner desired: or else condescende vnto that demaund, wherein hee was resolute eyther to haue it, or to leaue them. They thought it better to be somewhat hardly yoked at home, then for euer abroad dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited. Wherefore in the ende those orders were on all sides assented vnto:<note place="margin">An. D▪ 1541.</note> with no lesse alacritie of minde, then Cities vnable to holde out lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger are wont to shewe, when they take conditions such as it liketh him to offer them which hath them in the narrow streightes of aduantage. Not
<pb n="7" facs="7"/>
many yeares were ouerpassed, before these twice sworne men aduentured to giue their last and hotest assault to the fortresse of the same discipline, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishly graunting by comon consent of their whole Senate, &amp; that vnder their towne seale, a relaxation to one Bertelier whom the Eldership had excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; further also decreeing, with strange absurditie, that to the same Senate it should belong to giue finall iudgemēt in matter of excōmunication, and to absolue whom it pleased them; cleane contrary to their owne former deedes and oaths. The report of which decree being forth with brought vnto Caluin; <hi>Before</hi> (sayth he) <hi>this decree take place, either my bloud or banishment shall signe it.</hi> Againe two dayes before the Cōmunion should be celebrated, his speech was publiquely to like effect, <hi>Kill me if euer this hand do reach forth the things that are holy, to thē whom</hi> THE CHVRCH <hi>hath iudged despisers.</hi> Whereupon, for feare of tumult, the forenamed Bertelier was by his friends aduised for that time not to vse the liberty granted him by the Senate, nor to present himselfe in the Church, till they saw somewhat further what would ensue. After the Communion quietly ministred, and some likelihood of peaceable ending these troubles without any more ado, that very day in the afternoone, besides all mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, concluding his ordinary sermon, he telleth them, that because he neither had learned nor taught to striue with such as are in authority, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (sayth he) <hi>the case so standing as now it doth, let me vse these words of the Apostle vnto you, I commend you vnto God &amp; the word of his grace,</hi> and so bad them hartily all <hi>A dew.</hi> It sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that the readiest way which a wise man hath to conquer, is to flie. This voluntarie and vnexpected mention of sudden departure, caused presently the Senate (for according to their woonted maner they still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued onely constant in vnconstancy) to gather themselues together, and for a time to suspend their own decree, leauing things to proceed as before, till they had heard the iudgement of foure Heluetian Cities concerning the matter which was in strife. This to haue done at the first before they gaue assēt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any order, had shewed some wit &amp; discretion in thē: but now to do it, was as much as to say in effect, that they would play their parts on stage. Caluin therfore dispatcheth with all expedition his letters vnto some principall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor in euery of those cities, crauing earnestly at their hands, to respect this cause as a thing whereupō the whole state of religion &amp; piety in that church did so much depend, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> God &amp; all good men were now ineuitably certaine to be trampled vnder foot, vnlesse those foure Cities by their good means might be brought to giue sentence with the ministers of Geneua, when the cause should be brought before them: yea so to giue it, that two things it might
<pb n="8" facs="8"/>
effectually containe; the one an absolute approbation of the discipline of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua, as consonant vnto the word of God, without any cautions, qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ifs or ands; the other an earnest admonition not to innouate or change the same. His vehemēt request herein as touching both points was satisfied. For albeit the sayd Heluetian Churches did neuer as yet obserue that disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,<note place="margin">Ep. 166.</note> neuerthelesse the Senate of Geneua hauing required their iudgement concerning these three questions: First, <hi>after what manner, by Gods commaundement, according to the Scripture and vnspotted reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, excommunication is to be exercised:</hi> Secondly, <hi>whether it may not be exercised some other way then by the Consistorie:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>what the vse of their Churches was to do in this case:</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was returned from the sayd Churches, <hi>That they had heard alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of those consistoriall lawes, and did acknowledge them to be</hi> godly <hi>ordinances</hi> drawing towards <hi>the prescript of the word of God, for which cause that they did not thinke it good for</hi> the Church of Geneua <hi>by innouation to change the same, but rather to keepe them as they were.</hi> Which aunswer, although not aunswering vnto the former demaunds, but respecting what Maister Caluin had iudged requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for them to aunswere, was notwithstanding accepted without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reply: in as much as they plainely saw, that when stomacke doth striue with wit, the match is not equall. And so the heat of their former contentions began to flake. The present inhabitants of Geneua, J hope, will not take it in euill part, that the faltinesse of their people heretofore, is by vs so farre forth layd open, as their owne learned guides and Pastors haue thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to discouer it vnto the world. For out of their bookes and writings it is that I haue collected this whole narration, to the end it might thereby appeare in what sort amongst them that discipline was planted, for which so much contention is raised amongst our selues. The reasons which mooued Caluin herein to be so earnest,<note place="margin">Quod eam vrbem videret omnino his frenis indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere.</note> was, as Beza himselfe testifieth, <hi>for that he saw how needfull these bridles were to be put in the iawes of that Citie.</hi> That which by wisedome he saw to be requisite for that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was by as great wisedome compassed. But wise men are men, and the truth is truth. That which Caluin did for establishment of his discipline, seemeth more commendable, then y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which he taught for the countenancing of it established. Nature worketh in vs all a loue to our owne counsels. The contradiction of others is a fanne to inflame that loue. Our loue set on fire to maintaine that which once we haue done, sharpeneth the wit to dispute, to argue, and by all meanes to reason for it. Wherefore a maruaile it were if a man of so great capacitie, hauing such incitements to make him desirous of
<pb n="9" facs="8"/>
all kind of furtherances vnto his cause, could espie in the whole Scripture of God nothing which might breed at the least a probable opinion of likelihood, that diuine authority it selfe was the same way somewhat inclinable. And all which the wit euen of Caluin was able from thence to draw, by sifting the very vtmost sentence and syllable, is no more then that certaine speeches there are which to him did seeme to intimate, that all Christian Churches ought to haue their Elderships indued with power of excommunication, and that a part of those Elderships euery where should be chosen out frō amongst the laitie after that forme which himselfe had framed Geneua vnto. But what argument are ye able to shew, whereby it was euer prooued by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin, that any one sentence of Scripture doth necessarily enforce these things, or the rest wherein your opinion concurreth with his against the orders of your owne Church? We should be iniurious vnto vertue it selfe, if we did derogate from them whom their industrie hath made great. Two things of principall moment there are which haue deseruedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him honour throughout the world: the one his exceeding paynes in composing the Institutions of Christian Religion; the other his no lesse industrious trauailes for exposition of holy Scripture according vnto the same institutions. In which two things who soeuer they were that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him bestowed their labour; he gayned the aduantage of preiudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, if they gaine said; and of glorie aboue them, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented. His writings published after the question about that discipline was once begunne, omit not any the least occasion of extolling the vse and singular necessitie thereof. Of what accompt the Maister of sentences was in the Church of Rome, the same and more amongest the Preachers of reformed Churches Caluin had purchased: so that the perfectest diuines were iudged they, which were skilfullest in Caluins writings. His bookes almost the very Canon to iudge both doctrine and discipline by French Churches, both vnder others abroad, and at home in their owne Countrey, all cast according vnto that mould which Caluin had made. The Church of Scotland in erecting the fabricke of their reformation tooke the selfe same paterne. Till at length the discipline, which was at the first so weake, that without the staffe of their approbation, who were not subiect vnto it themselues, it had not brought others vnder subiection; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne now to challenge vniuersall obedience, and to enter into open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with those very Churches, which in desperate extremitie had bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieuers of it. To one of those Churches which liued in most peaceable sort, and abounded as well with men for their learning in other professions sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, as also with diuines whose equals were not elsewhere to be found;

a Church ordered by Gualters discipline, and not by that which Geneua ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: vnto this Church, the Church of Heidelberge, there commeth one who crauing leaue to dispute publiquely, defendeth with open disdaine of their gouernement, that <hi>To a Minister with his Eldership power is giuen by the law of God to excommunicate whomsoeuer, yea euen kings and princes themselues.</hi> Here were the seedes sowne of that controuersie which sprang vp betweene Beza and Erastus about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of excommunication, whether there ought to be in all Churches an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership hauing power to excommunicate, and a part of that Eldership to be of necessitie certaine chosen out from amongest the laity for that purpose. In which disputation they haue, as to me it seemeth, deuided very equally the truth betweene them; Beza most truly maintaining the necessitie of excommunication; Erastus as truly the nonnecessitie of layelders to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters thereof. Amongest our selues, there was in King Edwards dayes some question moued by reason of a few mens scrupulositie touching certaine things. And beyond Seas, of them which fled in the dayes of Queene Mary, some contenting themselues abroad with the vse of their owne Seruice booke at home authorised before their departure out of the Realme; others liking better the Common prayer booke of the Church of Geneua translated; those smaller contentions before begun were by this meane somewhat increased. Vnder the happy raigne of her Maiesty which now is, the greatest matter a while contended for was the wearing of the Cap and Surplesse, till there came Admonitions directed vnto the high Court of Parliament, by men who concealing their names thought it glory inough to discouer their minds and affections, which now were vniuersally bent euen against all the orders and lawes wherein this Church is found vnconformable to the platforme of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neua. Concerning the defendor of which admonitions, all that I meane to say is but this: <hi>There will come a time when three words vttered with charitie and meeknesse, shall receiue a farre more blessed reward, then three thousand volumes written with disdainefull sharpnes of wit.</hi> But the maner of mens writing must not alienate our hearts from the truth, if it appeare they haue the truth: as the followers of the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor do thinke he hath, and in that perswasion they follow him, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then himselfe doth Calvin, Beza, and others, with the like perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that they in this cause had the truth.

If it be graunted a thing vnlawfull for priuate men, not called vnto publique consultation, to dispute which is the best state of ciuill Policie (with a desire of bringing in some other kind then that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they already liue, for of such disputes I take it his meaning was;) if it be a thing confest that of such questions they cannot determine without rashnesse, in as much as a great part of them consisteth in speciall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and for one kind as many reasons may be brought as for another; is there any reason in the world, why they should better iudge what kind of regiment Ecclesiasticall is the fittest? For in the Ciuill state more insight, and in those affaires more experience a great deale must needes be graunted them, then in this they can possibly haue? When they which write in defence of your discipline,<note place="margin">The author of the petition directed to her Maiestie p. 3.</note> and commend it vnto the <hi>Highest</hi> not in the least cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning manner, are forced notwithstanding to acknowledge, that <hi>with whom the truth is they knowe not,</hi> they are not certaine; what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty or knowledge can the multitude haue thereof? Waigh what doth mooue the common sort so much to fauour this innouation, and it shall soone appeare vnto you, that the force of particular reasons which for your seuerall opinions are alleaged, is a thing whereof the multitude neuer did, nor could so consider as to be there with wholly caried; but certaine generall induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are vsed to make saleable your Cause in grosse: and when once men haue cast a phancie towards it, any slight declaration of specialties will
<pb n="13" facs="10"/>
serue to lead forward mens inclinable and prepared minds. The methode of winning the peoples affection vnto a generall liking of <hi>the Cause</hi> (for so ye terme it) hath bene this. First in the hearing of the multitude, the faults especially of higher callings are ripped vp with maruellous excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding seuerity and sharpnesse of reproofe; which being oftentimes done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth a great good opinion of integritie, zeale &amp; holinesse, to such cōstant reproouers of sinne, as by likelihood would neuer be so much offended at that which is euill, vnlesse themselues were singularly good. The next thing hereunto is to impute all faults and corruptions wherewith the world aboundeth, vnto the kind of Ecclesiasticall gouernement established. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as before by reprouing faults, they purchased vnto themselues with the multitude a name to be vertuous; so by finding out this kind of cause, they obtaine to be iudged wise aboue others: whereas in truth vnto the forme e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of Iewish gouernement, which the Lord himselfe (they all confesse) did establish, with like shew of reason they might impute those faults which the Prophets condemne in the gouernors of that common wealth; as to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish kind of regiment Ecclesiasticall (whereof also God himselfe though in other sort is author) the staines and blemishes found in our State; which springing from the root of humaine frailty and corruption, not only are, but haue bene alwaies more or lesse, yea and (for any thing we know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) will be till the worlds end complained of, what forme of gouernement soeuer take place. Hauing gotten thus much sway in the hearts of men, a third step is to propose their owne forme of Church gouernement, as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soueraigne remedy of all euils; and to adorne it with all the glorious titles that may be. And the nature, as of men that haue sicke bodies, so likewise of the people in the crazednes of their minds possest with dislike and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment at things present, is to imagine that any thing (the vertue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they here commended) would helpe them; but that most, which they least haue tried. The fourth degree of inducements, is by fashioning the very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; conceipts of mens minds in such sort, that when they read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they may thinke that euery thing soundeth towards the aduancement of that discipline, and to the vtter disgrace of the contrary. Pythagoras,<note place="margin">Arist. Metaph. lib. 1. cap. 5.</note> by bringing vp his Schollers in the speculatiue knowledge of numbers, made their conceipts therein so strong, that when they came to the contemplation of things naturall, they imagined that in euery particular thing they euen beheld as it were with their eyes, how the elements of number gaue es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and being to the workes of nature. A thing in reason impossible: which notwithstanding through their misfashioned preconceipt, appeared vnto them no lesse certaine, then if nature had written it in the very
<pb n="14" facs="11"/>
foreheads of all the creatures of God. When they of the family of loue haue it once in their heads, that <hi>Christ</hi> doth not signifie any one person, but a qualitie whereof many are partakers; that to be <hi>raised</hi> is nothing else but to be regenerated or indued with the said quality; and that when separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them which haue it from them which haue it not is here made, this is <hi>iudgement;</hi> how plainely do they imagine that the Scripture euery where speaketh in the fauour of that sect? And assuredly the very cause which maketh the simple and ignorant to thinke they euen see how the word of God runneth currantly on your side, is that their minds are forestalled and their conceits peruerted before hand, by being taught that an <hi>Elder</hi> doth signifie a lay man admitted onely to the office of rule or gouernement in the Church; a <hi>Doctor</hi> one which may only teach and neither preach nor admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the Sacraments; a <hi>Deacon</hi> one which hath charge of the almes boxe and of nothing else: that the <hi>Scepter,</hi> the <hi>rod,</hi> the <hi>throne</hi> &amp; <hi>kingdome</hi> of Christ, are a forme of regiment, onely by Pastors, Elders, Doctors and Deacons: that by mysticall resemblance mount Sion and Jerusalem are the Churches which admit, Samaria and Babylon the Churches which oppugne the said forme of regimēt. And in like sort they are taught to apply al things spoken of repairing the wals and decayed parts of the city &amp; temple of God, by Esdras, Nehemias, &amp; the rest: as if purposely the holy Ghost had therein ment to foresignifie, what the authors of admonitions to the Parliament, of supplications to the Councell, of petitions to her Maiesty, and of such other like writs, should either do or suffer in behalfe of this their cause. From hence they proceed to an higher point, which is the perswading of men cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous &amp; ouer capable of such pleasing errors, that it is the speciall illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Ghost, whereby they discerne those things in the word, which others reading yet discerne them not. <hi>Dearly beloued</hi> saith S.

Otherwise
<pb n="15" facs="11"/>
how can it be but that some other sinewes there are from which that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of strength in perswasion doth arise? Most sure it is, that when mens affections do frame their opinions, they are in defence of error more earnest a great deale, then (for the most part) sound belieuers in the maintenance of truth apprehended according to the nature of that euidence which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture yeeldeth: which being in some things plaine, as in the principles of Christian doctrine; in some things, as in these matters of discipline, more darke and doubtfull, frameth correspondently that inward assent which Gods most gracious Spirit worketh by it as by his effectuall instrument. It is not therefore the feruent earnestnes of their perswasion, but the soundnes of those reasons whereupon the same is built, which must declare their opinions in these things to haue bene wrought by the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.11.</note> and not by the <hi>fraud</hi> of that euill Spirit which is euen in his illusions strong. After that the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the common sort hath once throughly apprehended the Spirit to be author of their perswasion concerning discipline, then is instilled into their hearts, that the same Spirit leading men into this opinion, doth thereby seale them to be Gods children; and that as the state of the times now standeth, the most speciall token to know them that are Gods owne from others, is an earnest affection that way. This hath bred high termes of separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene such and the rest of the world; whereby the one sort are named <hi>The</hi>

      </gap>rethren, <hi>The</hi> godly, and so forth; the other, worldlings, timeseruers, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of men not of God, with such like. From hence, they are easily drawne on to thinke it exceeding necessarie, for feare of quenching that good Spirit, to vse all meanes whereby the same may be both strengthned in themselues, and made manifest vnto others. This maketh them diligent hearers of such as are knowne that way to incline; this maketh them eager to take and to seeke all occasions of secret conference with such; this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them glad to vse such as Counsellors and directors in all their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings which are of waight, as contracts, testaments, and the like; this maketh them, through an vnweariable desire of receiuing instruction from the maisters of that companie, to cast off the care of those verie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires which do most concerne their estate, and to thinke that then they are like vnto Marie, commendable for making choyce of the better part. Finally, this is it which maketh them willing to charge, yea often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times euen to ouercharge themselues, for such mens sustenance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, least their zeale to the cause should any way be vnwitnessed. For what is it which poore beguiled soules will not do through so powerfull incitements? In which respect it is also noted, that most labour hath bene

Apter they are through the eagernes of their affection, that maketh them which way soeuer they take, diligent in drawing their husbands, children, seruants, friends and allies the same way; apter through that naturall inclination vnto pity, which breedeth in them a greater readines then in men, to be bountifull towards their Preachers who suffer want; apter through sundry opportunities which they especially haue, to procure encouragements for their brethren; finally, apter through a singular delight which they take in giuing very large and particular intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, how all neere about them stand affected as cōcerning the same cause.

A ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie strange thing sure it were, that such a discipline as ye speake of should be taught by Christ and his Apostles in the word of God, and no Church euer haue found it out, nor receiued it till this present time; contrariwise, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernmēt against which ye bēd your selues, be obserued euery where through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all generations and ages of the Christian world, no Church euer percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the word of God to bee against it.

All this is done for fashions sake onely, for ye complaine of it as of an iniury, that mē should be willed to seeke for examples and paternes of gouernment in any of those times that haue bene before. Ye plainly hold, that frō the very Apostles times till this present age wherein your selues imagine ye haue found out a right patern of sound discipline, there neuer was any time safe to be followed.

the drift and purpose of you all is not one. The chiefest thing which lay refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers yawne for is, that the Cleargie may through conformitie in state and condition be Apostolicall, poore as the Apostles of Christ were poore. In which one circumstance if they imagine so great perfection, they must thinke that Church which hath such store of mendicant Friers, a Church in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect most happy. Were it for the glory of God, and the good of his Church in deede, that the Cleargie should be left euen as bare as the Apostles when they had neither staffe nor scrip; that God, which should lay vpon them the condition of his Apostles, would I hope, endue them with the selfesame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which was in that holy Apostle, whose words concerning his owne right vertuous contentment of heart, <hi>As well how to want,</hi>

      <hi>as how to abound,</hi> are a most fit episcopall emprese. The Church of Christ is a body mysticall. A body cannot stand, vnlesse the parts thereof be proportionable. Let it therefore be required on both parts, at the hands of the Cleargie, to be in meannesse of state like the Apostles; at the hands of the laitie, to be as they were who liued vnder the Apostles: and in this reformation there will bee though little wisedome, yet some indifferencie. But your reformation which are of the Cleargie (if yet it displease ye not that I should say ye are of the Cleargie) seemeth to aime at a broader marke. Ye thinke that he which will perfectly reforme, must bring the forme of Church discipline vnto the state which then it was at. A thing neither possible, nor certaine, nor absolutely conuenient. Concerning the first, what was vsed in the Apostles times, the scripture fully declareth not; so that making their times the rule and Canon of Church politie, ye make a rule which being not possible to be fully knowne, is as impossible to be kept. Againe, sith the later euen of the Apostles owne times, had that which in the former was not thought vpon; in this generall proposing of the Apostolicall times, there is no certaintie which should be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, especially seeing that ye giue vs great cause to doubt how far ye allow those times.

What man is there of vnderstanding, vnto whom it is not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, how the way of prouiding for the Cleargie by tithes, the deuise of almes-houses for the poore, the sorting out of the people into their seuerall parishes, together with sundrie other things which the Apostles times could not haue, (being now established) are much more conuenient and fit for the Church of Christ, then if the same should be taken away for conformities sake with the auncientest and first times? The orders therefore which were obserued in the Apostles times, are not to be vrged as a rule vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally, either sufficient or necessary. If they bee, neuerthelesse on your part it still remaineth to bee better prooued, that the forme of discipline which ye intitle apostolicall, was in the Apostles times exercised. For of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ye faile euen touching that which ye make most account of, as being matter of substance in discipline, I meane the power of your lay-elders, and the difference of your Doctors from the Pastors in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. So that in summe, we may be bold to conclude, that besides these last times, which for insolencie, pride, and egregious contempt of all good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are the worst, there are none wherein ye can truly affirme, that the complete forme of your discipline, or the substance thereof was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. The euidence therefore of antiquitie failing you, yee flie to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of such learned men, as seeme by their writings to be of opinion that all Christian Churches should receiue your discipline, and abandon ours. Wherein, as ye heape vp the names of a number of men not vnworthy to be had in honor; so there are a number whom when ye mention, although it serue ye to purpose with the ignorant and vulgar sort, who measure by tale &amp; not by waight, yet surely they who know what qualitie and value the men are of, will thinke ye drawe very neare the dregs. But were they all of as great account as the best and chiefest amongst them, with vs not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding neither are they, neither ought they to be of such reckening, that their opinion or coniecture should cause the lawes of the Church of
<pb n="21" facs="14"/>
England to giue place. Much lesse when they neither do all agree in y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> opiniō, and of thē which are at agreemēt, the most part through a courteous induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, haue followed one man as their guide, finally, that one therein not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to haue swarued. If any chance to say it is probable that in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Apostles times there were layelders, or not to mislike the continuance of them in the Church; or to affirme that Bishops at the first were a name, but not a power distinct from presbyters; or to speake any thing in praise of those Churches which are without episcopall regimēt, or to reproue the fault of such as abuse that calling; all these ye register for men, perswaded as you are, that euery christian Church stādeth bound by the law of God to put downe Bishops, and in their roomes to erect an eldership so authorized as you would haue it for the gouernmēt of each parish. Deceiued greatly they are therfore, who think that all they whose names are cited amongst the fauourers of this cause, are on any such verdict agreed. Yet touching some materiall points of your disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, a kind of agreement we grant there is amongst many diuines of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches abroad. For first to do as the Church of Geneua did, the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in some other churches must needs be the more willing, who hauing vsed in like maner not the slow &amp; tedious help of proceeding by publike authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but the peoples more quick endeuor for alteratiō, in such an exigent I see not well how they could haue staied to deliberat about any other regimēt thē that which already was deuised to their hands, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which in like case had bene takē, that which was easiest to be established without delay, that which was likeliest to content the people by reason of some kind of sway which it giueth them. When therfore the example of one Church was thus at the first almost through a kind of cōstraint or necessitie followed by many, their concurrence in perswasion about some materiall points belonging to the same policie is not strange. For we are not to maruell greatly, if they which haue all done the same thing, do easily embrace the same opinion as cōcerning their owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Besides, mark I beseech you that which Galen in matter of philosophie noteth, for the like falleth out euen in questions of higher knowledge.<note place="margin">Galen. Clas. 2. lib. de cuios{que} anim. peccat. notitia atque medela.</note> It fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth many times with mens opiniōs, as with rumors &amp; reports. That which a credible person telleth, is easily thought probable by such as are well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of him. But if two, or three, or foure, agree all in the same tale, they iudge it then to be out of controuersie, and so are many times ouertaken, for want of due consideration; eyther some common cause leading them all in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="22" facs="15"/>
and to haue spred it selfe from hand to hand, they all are in force but as one testimony. Nor is it otherwise here where the daughter Churches do speake their mothers dialect; here where so many sing one song, by reason that hee is the guide of the quier concerning whose deserued authoritie amongst euen the grauest diuines, we haue already spoken at large. Will ye aske what should moue those many learned to be followers of one mans iudgement, no necessitie of argument forcing them thereunto?<note place="margin">Petit. to the Q▪M.P. 14.</note> your demaund is answered by your selues. Loath ye are to thinke that they whom ye iudge to haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as sound knowledge in all points of doctrine, as any since the Apostles time, should mistake in discipline.

The reason whereof is, for that as dead flies putrifie the oyntment of the Apothecarie, so a little folly him that is in estimation for wisedome. This in euery profession hath too much authorized the iudgement of a few. This with Germans hath caused Luther, and with many other Churches Caluin, to preuaile in all things. Yet are we not able to define, whether the wisedome of that God (who setteth before vs in holy Scripture so many admirable paternes of vertue, and no one of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out somewhat noted wherin they were culpable, to the end that to him alone it might alwayes be acknowledged, <hi>Thou onely art holy, thou onely art iust</hi>) might not permit those worthy vessels of his glory to be in some thinges blemished with the staine of humaine frailtie, euen for this cause, least wee should esteeme of any man aboue that which behoueth.</p>

Neither wish we that men should do any thing which in their hearts they are perswaded they ought not to doe, but this perswasion ought (we say) to be fully setled in their harts, that in litigious and controuersed causes of such qualitie, the will of God is to haue them to do whatsoeuer the sentence of iudiciall and finall decision shall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, yea though it seeme in their priuate opiniō to swarue vtterly from that which is right: as no doubt many times the sentence amongst the Iewes did seeme vnto one part or other contending; and yet in this case God did then allow them to doe that which in their priuate iudgement it seemed (yea and perhaps truly seemed) that the lawe did disallow▪ For if God be not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of confusion, but of peace; then can he not be the author of our refusall, but of our contentment, to stand vnto some definitiue sentence; without which almost impossible it is, that eyther wee should auoyd confusion, or euer hope to attaine peace. To small purpose had the Councell of Ierusalem bene assembled, if once their determination being set downe, men might afterwards haue defended their former opinions. When therefore they had giuen their definitiue sentence, all controuersie was at an ende. Things were disputed before they came to be determined; men afterwardes were not to dispute any longer, but to obey. The sentence of iudgement finished their strife, which their disputes before iudgement could not doe. This was ground sufficient for any reasonable mans conscience to build the dutie of obedience vpon, whatsoeuer his owne opinion were as touching the matter before in question. So full of wilfulnes and selfeliking is our nature, that without some definitiue sentence, which being giuen may stand, and a necessitie of silence on both sides afterward imposed; small hope there is that strifes thus far prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will in short time quietly end.

Nor is mine owne intent any other in these seuerall bookes of discourse, then to make it appeare vnto you; that for the ecclesiasticall lawes of this land, we are led by great reason to obserue them, and ye by no necessitie bound to impugne them. It is no part of my secret meaning to draw you hereby into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, or to set vpō the face of this cause any fairer glasse then the naked truth doth afford: but my whole endeuour is to resolue the conscience, and to shew as neare as I can what in this controuersie the hart is to thinke, if it will follow the light of sound and sincere iudgement, without either clowd of preiudice or mist of passionate affection.

Ye tell vs now it is not your meaning. But what meant your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten threatnings of them, who professing thēselues the inhabitants of mount Sion, were too loth to depart wholly as they should out of Babylon?

Will ye blame any man for doing that of his owne accord, which all men should be compelled to do that are not willing of themselues? When God commandeth, shall we answer that we will obey, if so be Caesar will graunt vs leaue? Is discipline an Ecclesiasticall matter or a Ciuill? If an Ecclesiasticall, it must of necessitie belong to the duty of the Minister. And the Minister (ye say) holdeth all his authority of doing whatsoeuer belongeth vnto the spirituall charge of the house of God, euen immediatly from God himselfe, without dependency vpon any Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.

Your lawes forbidding Ecclesiasticall persons vtterly the exercise of Ciuill power, must needs depriue the Heads and Maisters in the same Colledges of all such authoritie as now they exercise, either at home, by puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the faults of those, who not as children to their parents by the law of Nature, but altogether by ciuill authority are subiect vnto them; or abroad, by keeping Courts amongst their tenants. Your lawes making permanent inequalitie amongst Ministers a thing repugnant to the word of God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force those Colledges, the Seniors whereof are all or any part of them Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters vnder the gouernment of a maister in the same vocation, to choose as oft as they meet together a new president. For if so ye iudge it necessary to do in Synods, for the auoyding of permanent inequality amongst Ministers, the same cause must needs euen in these Collegiate assemblies enforce the like. Except per aduenture ye meane to auoid all such absurdities, by dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing those Corporations, and by bringing the Vniuersities vnto the forme of the Schoole of Geneua. Which thing men the rather are inclined to looke for, in as much as the Ministery, whereinto their founders with singular prouidence haue by the same statutes appointed them necessarily to enter at a certaine time, your lawes bind them much more necessarily to forbeare, till some parish abroad call for them.

And perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture considering, that although they were many, yet long warres would in time waste them out; they began to thinke whether it might not be that God would haue them do for their speedie an mighty increase, the same which sometime Gods owne chosen people, the people of Israell did. Glad and faine they were to haue it so: which very desire was it selfe apt to breed both an opinion of possibilitie, and a willingnesse to gather argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of likelihood that so God himselfe would haue it. Nothing more cleare vnto their seeming, then that a new Jerusalem being often spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in Scripture, they vndoubtedly were themselues that newe Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and the old did by way of a certaine figuratiue resemblance signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what they should both be and do.

appointment, his commandement, his will and charge. Which thing is the very point in regard whereof I haue gathered this declaration. For my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose herein is to shew, that when the minds of men are once erroniously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that it is the will of God to haue those things done which they phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; their opinions are as thornes in their sides, neuer suffering them to take rest till they haue brought their speculations into practise: the lets and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of which practise their restlesse desire and study to remoue, leadeth them euery day forth by the hand into other more dangerous opinions, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times quite &amp; cleane contrary to their first pretended meanings: so as what will grow out of such errors as go masked vnder the cloake of diuine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, impossible it is that euer the wit of man should imagine, till time haue brought forth the fruits of them: for which cause it behoueth wisedome to feare the sequels thereof, euen beyond all apparant cause of feare.

That <hi>things doubtfull are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered in the better part,</hi> is a principle not safe to be followed in matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the publique state of a common weale. But howsoever these and the like speeches be accompted as arrowes idly shot at randon, without either eye had to any marke, or regard to their lighting place: hath not your longing desire for the practise of your discipline, brought the matter already vnto this demurrer amongst you, whether the people and their godly pastors that way affected, ought not to make separation from the rest, and to begin the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of discipline without the licence of Ciuill powers, which licence they haue sought for, and are not heard? Vpon which question as ye haue now deuided your selues, the warier sort of you taking the one part, and the forwarder in zeale the other; so in case these earnest ones should preuaile, what other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell can any wise man imagine but this, that hauing first resolued that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for discipline without superiors are lawfull, it will follow in the next place to be disputed what may be attempted against superiors which will not haue the scepter of that discipline to rule ouer them? Yea euen by you which haue stayed your selues from running headlong with the other sort, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what notwithstanding there hath bene done without the leaue or liking of your lawfull superiors, for the exercise of a part of your discipline amongst the Cleargy thereunto addicted. And least examination of principall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therein should bring those things to light, which might hinder and let your proceedings; behold for a barre against that impediment, one opinion ye haue newly added vnto the rest euen vpon this occasion, an opinion to exempt you from taking oathes which may turne to the molestation of your brethren in that cause. The next neighbour opinion whereunto, when occasion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, may follow for dispensation with oathes already taken, if they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be found to import a necessity of detecting ought which may bring such good men into trouble or damage, whatsoeuer the cause be. O mercifull God, what mans wit is there able to found the depth of those daungerous and fearefull euils, whereinto our weake and impotent nature is inclinable to sinke itselfe, rather then to shew an acknowledgement of error in that which once we haue vnaduisedly taken vpon vs to defend, against the streame as it were of a contrary publique resolution! Wherefore if we anie thing respect their error, who being perswaded euen as ye are, haue gone further vpon that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion then ye allow; if we regard the present state of the highest gouernour

placed ouer vs, if the quality and disposition of our Nobles, if the orders and lawes of our famous Ʋniuersities, it the profession of the Civil, or the practise of the Common law amongst vs, if the mischiefes whereinto euen before our eyes so many others haue fallen headlong from no lesse plausible and faire beginnings then yours are: there is in euery of these considerations most iust cause to feare, least our hastines to embrace a thing of so perilous consequence, should cause posterity to feele those euils, which as yet are more easie for vs to preuent, then they would be for them to remedy.</p>

      <note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all.</note>9. The best and safest way for you therefore my deere brethren is, to call your deeds past to a new reckening, to reexamine the cause ye haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand, and to try it euen point by point, argument by argument, with all the diligent exactnesse ye can; to lay aside the gall of that bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse wherein your minds haue hitherto ouer abounded, and with meeknesse to search the truth. Thinke ye are men, deeme it not impossible for you to erre: sift vnpartially your owne hearts, whether it be force of reason, or vehemency of affection, which hath bred, and still doth feed these opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in you. If truth do any where manifest it selfe, seeke not to smother it with glosing delusions, acknowledge the greatnesse thereof, and thinke it your best victory when the same doth preuaile ouer you.</p>
   <p>That ye haue bene earnest in speaking or writing againe and againe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way, should be no blemish or discredit at all vnto you. Amongst so many so huge volumes as the infinite paines of Saint Augustine haue brought foorth, what one hath gotten him greater loue, commendation and honour, then the booke wherein he carefully collecteth his owne ouersights, and sincerely condemneth them? Many speeches there are of Iobes, whereby his wisedome and other vertues may appeare: but the glory of an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous mind he hath purchased by these words onely,<note place="margin">Iob. 39.37.</note>
      <hi>Behold, I will lay mine hand on my mouth; I haue spoken once, yet will I not therefore maintaine argument; yea twice, howbeit for that cause further I will not proceed.</hi> Farre more comfort it were for vs (so small is the ioy we take in these strifes) to labour vnder the same yoke, as men that looke for the same eternall reward of their labours, to be ioyned with you in bands of indissoluble loue and amity, to liue as if our persons being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our soules were but one, rather then in such dismembred sort to spend our few and wretched daies in a tedious prosecuting of wearisome contentions▪ the end whereof, if they haue not some speedy ende, will be heauie euen on both sides. Brought alreadie we are euen to that estate which Gregorie Nazianzene mournefully describeth, saying.</p>

      <hi>where I may scape from this cloudie tempest of malitiousnesse, whereby all parts are entred into a deadly warre amongst themselues, and that little remnant of loue which was, is now consumed to nothing. The onely godlines we glory in, is to finde out somewhat whereby we may iudge others to be vngodly. Each others faults we obserue, as matter of exprobration, and not of griefe. By these meanes wee are growne hateful in the eyes of the Heathens themselues; and (which woundeth vs the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>e deeply) able we are not to denie but that we haue deserued their hatred. With the better sort of our owne, our fame and credit is cleane lost. The lesse wee are to maruell if they iudge vilely of vs, who although we did well, would hardly allow therof. On our backs they also build that are lewd, and what we obiect one against an other, the same they vse to the vtter scorne and disgrace of vs all. This we haue gained by our mutuall home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissentions. This we are worthily rewarded with, which are more forward to striue, then becommeth men of vertuous and mild dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi> But our trust in the almightie is, that with vs contentions are now at their highest floate, and that the day will come (for what cause of despaire is there) when y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> passiōs of former enmitie being allaied, we shal with ten times redoubled tokens of our vnfainedly reconciled loue, shewe our selues each to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards other the same, which Ioseph and the brethren of Ioseph were at the time of their enteruiew in Aegypt. Our comfortable expectation and most thirstie desire whereof what man soeuer amongst you shall any way helpe to satisfie, (as we truly hope there is no one amongst you but some way or other will) the blessings of the God of peace both in this world and in the world to come, be vppon him moe then the starres of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in number.</p>
