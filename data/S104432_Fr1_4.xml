   <head>❧ THE PREFACE vnto my countrey men of Englande.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T IS</hi> not vnknowen to the christian reader that the deuil, as he is the continuall aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary of mankynde, so cōtinually at al times and seasons, he laboreth by wonder full &amp; sundry craftes, to ouerthrowe &amp; extinct the Euangelicall doctrine, the only comforte and stay of man: and to wery the faythefull folowers of the same.</p>
   <p>¶ In the firste buddynge tyme of Christ his churche, lorde, with howe many afflyctions was the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded: with howe many waues of sundry persecutions, knocte and bet at? with howe many tourmentes &amp; deathes tryed? Agaynst which, the
<pb facs="6"/>crueltie of Princes: The peruerse maliciousnesse of the Iues: The impious rage of heretikes, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the whole world with al kynde of deuelysh engines and malicious policies, had as ye wolde say, made insurrection. And although Annas and Cayphas reigne not styll, Nero and Diacletian are not euer, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shall Iesus Christ, and suche as faythfully beleue in him, suffre persecution to thende of the worlde: as Paul doth wytnes. And in this present tyme, what daūgerous tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedyes hathe Satan styrred vp: what straunge &amp; perilous heresyes hath he reysed among the people of God? Who seyng the great follye, the habundaūce of iniquitie in these dayes among the people, doth not, or laugh hertely with Democritus, or bitterly lament with Heraclitus, of which men I haue read in Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb facs="7"/>wryters, that thones facion &amp; custome was, euermore to laughe: thothers to lament and weepe at al thynges cōmonly practised amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the people of their tyme. If they bothe were nowe liuynge, they wolde, I suppose, euen dye, the one with laughyng at the foly, the other lamētyng the great iniquitie of the people: of bothe there was, neuer more plenty, as is in our tyme. For my parte, I can rather lament and sorrow with Heraclitus, the present state of this worlde, then otherwise laugh with Democritus, For what hert in whiche remayneth any sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle of honesty and godlynesse, wold not rue the great impietie of these dayes, wolde not bewayle the wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of this tyme: Wherin it is to be seene (to speake nothynge of Anabaptistes, Libertines, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyonistes with other a nōbre, which
<pb facs="7"/>are presentlye riefe amongeste the people) that call into doubte and question, whether Christ be comen or not: Yea, &amp; some without doubt, question, or controuersie moued at all, feare not impiously to auouche, teache and affirme, that our only Iustice &amp; peace, our only pathway to euerlastyng lyfe, our only Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and Sauyour, our onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piciacion for synnes, Iesus Christ, is not true god, but a mere creature, a passible man only.</p>
   <p>What more worthye Democrites laughters, or Heraclites teares, then suche outragious follye, suche vnbrydled iniquitie? And is this an easye persecution, a small greefe trow ye, to the faythful Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the right beleuers of Iesus Christ, and fauourers of his holye worde, that contrary to so many and mighty testimones of the scriptures,
<pb facs="8"/>after the most glorious bloodshed. &amp; slaughter of so many godly Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, for corroboracion of the same: After so great vnitie vniuersally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued in Christ his Churche, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng this hygh truthe of his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, it shulde be nowe denyed, that he is true <hi>GOD,</hi> equall in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie to the father: Howbeit there was no other lykelyhood, but that suche monstruous metamorphosye shulde happen. I remembre the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neke Diogenes, who passyng by the house of a certayne lauysh and ryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous persone, where vpon the dore it was written: <hi>This house is to be solde.</hi> Yea of my fayth {quod} Dyoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. I espyed very wel and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyde in my mynde, that by reason of thyne vnmesurable surfetyng, thou wolde at laste, spue vp some whole house. Euen so, of suche dissolute ryotyng, such vnmeasurable gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundyng
<pb facs="8"/>and daungerous surfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of the people, in all abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion, vyce, and vncleannesse, as haue ben in these later times practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed amongest them: to the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deuastacion of Christ his vyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde, prophanacion of the pure &amp; vnspotted religiō, antiquacion of al honest, godlye and decent Ordres: what els was there to be loked for, but that some of them wolde at last euomet and spue forthe some suche monstruous portent, &amp; prodigious matter, of long tyme not hearde of before: so abhominable, filthy, and stynkynge, that no true Christian myght abyde the hearyng, sauour, or syght therof. Were we not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fictētly instructed by the scriptures, that towardes thende of the world, heresies shuld opteyn a great stroke emongest the people: We myghte iustly wondre to see so many straūge
<pb facs="9"/>scismiks and opinions in these oure dayes sprong vp, and so manye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the same. But beyng re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued by Goddes woorde, that they shalbe, let vs not wondre either that they are, or for that so manye be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with them: Whiche are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent &amp; permitted, that the fayth of man in hauing temptacion, shuld haue also probacion.</p>
   <p>The greatest wondre is, to se such nombre of heresyes so nygh home, so manye infected with them within this Ile of England: Within En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande I saye, where euerye man, euery womā pretendeth to be a gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peller, euery boye, eche gyrle tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; exercised in readynge the holy Scripture of Iesus Christ.</p>
   <p>A hygh name, a noble trayne, and most godly exercise, If we matched them (gentle frendes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen) with godly mynde &amp; good
<pb facs="9"/>affection to practyse and folow that which we reade and heare of Gods true worde, in our life &amp; behauiour. But our tongue soundeth muche in tune: our phrase is Lorde Lorde, &amp; the lord knoweth, our maners gear all togyther oute of tune, our lyfe nought nought: We beare it in our hādes, we se it w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> our eye, we here it with our eares, we rolle it vp with our tonge: but our cōuersacion &amp; ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng sauour nothyng therof at all, but daily worse, &amp; worse experience proueth. If it be no mater of wōder, that we thus wander yet in such dar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kenes, which haue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lyght amongst vs: that we be thus spotted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with so many sores of perilous heresyes, which cary about with vs the glasse of knowledge: that we be thus far out of square, which haue the streyght rule, and right square at hande: What wonder is it, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

      <hi>Miseria nostra magnus</hi> est. Our miserye is the great: meanyng it by Pompei, who was called gret Pompei: So thā ye mought haue
<pb facs="10"/>sayde? <hi>Miseria nostra Papa est:</hi> Our misery is the Pope, the great pompe of the worlde. Now he beynge disclosed what he is with all his tric<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes: his false forged powre abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and discharged: who hath nowe bewytched you, who now, <hi>Miseria nostra</hi> (gentle brethren) that in the bryght day ye canne not see. In the playne pathe ye canne not walke without fallyng, that hauynge the true square and streyght rule, your lyues square not, your workes all croked out of frame and rule.</p>
   <p>That Noble Henrye, Kynge of Kynges, now dissolued &amp; dwellyng with Christ: That heuenly Iosias I say, dyd much for you, what tyme not without great traueyle &amp; study, not withoute tirannicall hatred of forrein powers therby procured vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he brought home that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable lyght, that pleasaunt foode
<pb facs="11"/>of soulles, and gaue it eche of you in your handes. What tyme ye were yoked to the Popes bulles, he vnyoked you, and pulled your nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes out of that miserable bondage. Where you were lynked to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng pardons, he purchased a free pardone vnto you of them all: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where ye were nouseled in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrye, and trayned in worshippyng stockes and stones, he cared to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge suche blockes oute of youre way: where you were grosly fedde vpon the marry she of mans tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions: he studyed to acquaynt you w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the fine diet of christes true word &amp;c. Thus good &amp; gracious Lorde was he vnto you in procurynge and grauntyng: How faithfull and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest subiectes proue ye in receiuyng and exercisyng so precious and riche treasures: What perfection haue they wrought in you. I can not say
<pb facs="11"/>the truth without your gret shame: But seeynge ye be not ashamed of shamefull doynge, blame me not, if I be not a shamed to do you to wyt thereof.</p>
   <p>Then ye were halfe blynde, and nowe ye see nothyng.</p>
   <p>Then stockes and stones were in your eye, and nowe God is oute of your hertes.</p>
   <p>Then ye sought pardones in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for youre synnes, and nowe ye synne without repentaunce in your hertes.</p>
   <p>Then ye kepte a grose dyet, and nowe you surfet inordinatlye in all abhominacion and iniquitie.</p>
   <p>Then ye were not in the ryghte way, and now ye are to to farre of.</p>
   <p>Then dydde ye stomble amonge cloddes and brakes, and now ye fal doune right euen in the playn path.</p>
   <p>Finally then ye had muche zeale
<pb facs="12"/>without all knowledge: and nowe ye haue muche knowledge without all zeale. Then knew ye least, and folowed most: and nowe ye knowe most, and followe least.</p>
   <p>What a monstruous metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosie: what a straunge alteracion of maners is this? Who hathe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wytched you now my frendes? what euyll ghoste: What wycked spirite hathe benūmed you of your wittes now. <hi>Nemo leditur nisi a serpso:</hi> No man is hurt but through him selfe: it was a wyse and true sentence of Tullye. The euyll ghoste of your owne selfe, loue, pride &amp; ambicion: The wycked spirit of temeritie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte, and rashnesse, all togyther possessyng your hertes, hathe thus bewytched you, not to obey &amp; folow the truthe: wherby in steade of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, ye are become Antichristīas: for true Gospellers, ye proue Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babtistes,

This is true that I say, and I am lothe to say it, wolde God it were false, &amp; I proued a lyer: but reporte of some is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, proufe by experience can not lye? I se it daily more &amp; more true, and I am sorye for it in my hearte, because I loue you. Other heare it and laugh at the same in their myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, because they hate you. It is a good matter for your enemyes to reioyce, &amp; for your frendes to weepe at: It is glad tidynges to the one, and heauy newes to thother.</p>
   <p>And as we exceede in all hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and blasphemous opinions: so retayne we also all vnclennesse, all fylthynesse of lyfe emongste vs.</p>

Many of you haue done your partes well: but many againe of you haue, and do verye leudely behaue youre selfes, rather lyke to rauenynge wolfes, then faythfull pastors: Rather lyke to sowe sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, to make vprores amongest Gods people, then sincerely to shew forth the true worde of God, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardyng, as it appeareth by youre doynges, whether the soules com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto youre charge, synke or swymme, go with you to the deuyll, or without you to GGD. I haue hearde often your vayne and vndis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create talke, with myne eare. I see daily your corrupt conuersacion of lyfe, with myne eye, my tonge can
<pb facs="16"/>not dissemble it. But better to late, my frendes, then neuer. Tourne your bokes a new: lerne your office in them more earnestly: and expresse the same to vs in your liuyng more effectually. Remembre that if ye be called spirituall for nought, yet wer you made Pastors and Ministers for somwhat. Ye haue a charge com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted vnto you from God, by the mouth of Paule: Learne, marke, &amp; beare it well away. If ye fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do it, your rewarde is, <hi>Immar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cescibilis gloriae corona.</hi> But if ye be founde necligent and slouthfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, that through youre necli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencye and deceytfulnesse, Goddis Agricolacion goe not forwarde: his buyldynge ryse notte: hys sheepe straye into perdicion, death shalbe your salarye, dampnacion your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, and their blood shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred at your handes. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
<pb facs="17"/>is great, let ir prouoke you: the payn is horrible, let it feare you: do, &amp; haue thone assuredly: do not, and mysse not thother vndoutedly.</p>
   <p>As Psylly therefore be not onlye hurte of venemous serpetes them selfes, but also do sucke out the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from other that at stynged with them: so your parte &amp; offyce is, not only to regarde that your selfes be not hurte and poisoned with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous styng of Satan: but also to cure and heale other that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der youre charge, with holsome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, godly example of lyfe, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinually practysed amongest them: and to kyll the stynge of Satan in them: to sucke out his poyson from their soules, with the mighty worde of God, by dailye and sincere prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng, &amp; inculcatyng it into them. And do it I saye sincerely, soberly, discretely withoute all counterfey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng,
<pb facs="17"/>all dissimulation: for clokyng wyll not helpe, dissimulacion canne not serue: The hyghe Iudge seethe clearely, euen the secretes of youre heartes, though ye coloure &amp; iuggle neuer so craftely. The fyshe called Mugyll, hydeth his head, wenyng that then all his bodye is also well hydden. The Woodcocke lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise clappeth his byll to the groūd, thynkīg that then he is safe ynough &amp; not seene. But I wolde none of you to proue so folish as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fish Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill, so wyse as the Woodcocke, as to beleue, that by hidyng your head oy byl, by dissemblynge and colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable practyses ye can not be seene, and discerned who ye are. Though the worlde be somtyme deceaued by suche pollycies: yet the eyes I saye of God, be euer cleare. Ye maye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde a tyraunt, by chaungyng the place or countrey, but him ye canne
<pb facs="18"/>not auoyde; which is euery where, &amp; seeth euery both thought &amp; deade.</p>
   <p>ANd ye that are by Goddis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointmēt hearers, be not slack of your part in your vocacion &amp; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: be obedient vnto your heades &amp; teachers, &amp; that for conscience sake. Paye to euerye of theim their dew with good wyll, be it tribute, honor, feare, loue or reuerence: S. Paule requireth no les at your hādes: and his warrant to Tymothe, touchyng your dutye, conteyneth no contrary lesson. Ye haue the holye and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Testament of Iesus Christ in your handes: If you be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt in your dutye, the greater is your faute: if ye know it and folow it not, who shall excuse you.</p>
   <p>It greeueth me to see such daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous deuision, so great disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as is presently in force emongst you: it is a vehement presumption,
<pb facs="18"/>&amp; sure token, that ye haue wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously abused that comfortable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Gods sweete worde. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherof is, to make such as doo acquaynt them worthely with it, les proude, lesse vicious, lesse dishobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, lesse contencious, lesse mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, lesse couetous. But in that ye are more in all, and lesse in none: it appeareth, ye dyd more proffytte therin, when ye had lesse knowledge therof. Ye haue hearde, reade, and searched it, I denye not: but youre lyfe proueth that he haue read it as if ye read it not, your eye not single: Ye heare it, as if ye hearde it not, your intent not pure: Ye searche it as though ye searched it not, your mynde vngodlye. And this is the occasyon that ye receaue so smalle profit &amp; fruit therof: for he that seeth your conuersacion, heareth of your behauors, sercheth your dooynges,
<pb facs="19"/>shal fynde you in all, far wyde from yor professyon. And no meruell, ye sought not for it. Many of you are mighty talkers: iolye braggers, gret questmōgers, al that ye sought for. For as in one and the same field the Bee dothe ensue the floure: the gote, the steme or stalke: the swyne, the roote: the foure feeted beastes, the fruite: Euen so in the scriptures dyuers is your intent: some of you seeke matter of talke: some, straūge oppinions: and some proufes and arguments to maintayne your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes &amp; mad imaginacions be they good or badde: some, the knowledge onlye: some, the waye to liue well: and fewe seeke after that waye. It is the best parte, and the least parte of you haue ensued it. And after this sorte, readyng and serchyng the scriptures, what meruell is it if ye he gyuē into wronge and corrupte
<pb facs="19"/>sence: whiche soughte not after the pure &amp; ryght vndecitandyng therof: If so many scismyckes and heresies be sprong among you, which so irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently, so vnworthely presume to abuse the reuerent &amp; worthy woorde of God. For as to them that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer charged with wyne, theire eyes oftē tymes dasell whē thei perswade them selues to see manye thynges, where in deede they see but one.</p>
   <p>Lykewyse suche as doo so rashlye &amp; vnaduisedly with vnpure mynde &amp; vngodly intent reade and serche the scriptures of God, doo forge &amp; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen many straunge sentences there vpon, perswadynge them selues to see many thynges therein, where in deede they see not one therof: so he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye headed be thei with pride, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, couetousnesse: so daselyng ar their eyes with selfe loue, pertinacy &amp; disdainfulnesse. But good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treimen
<pb facs="20"/>remembre the great care and trauell of the most redoured prince, or he coulde: the loue that he wolde bring it vnto your hādes: forget not that it is a hygher matter then the booke of Rodynhoode: Consyder what commodytie ensueth by the righte vse therof. Deceaue not the louyng exdecracion of so hygh and fatherly a Prince conceyued of you, do not frustrate his traueil and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? Prouoke not Goddis ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce vpon you, dooe not abuse his holye worde: Spoyle not your louies from suche heauenly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable treasures and comforte, do not tourne it into our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fucion. And frame your selues yet at lengthe worthelye to vse this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Margatete: put on a single and a doues eye, which seeth only heauenly thynges. Let your heartes be inflamed with hote desire
<pb facs="20"/>towarde it. It doth not vouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe vulgarelye to be loued, after a commen sorte to be affected: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth a thirsty mynde, a hungrye and greedye stomake, but after it, a lone: And at the fyrst entraunce in to it, ye must laye a parte all pride, vainglory, and disdainfulnesse oute of your heartes. For although the Courte of Goddis woorde be veray large and ample, loftye and hyghe: yet the doore wherein ye must enter, is veray lowe: and none can enter into it, but such as are lowe, humble and meeke of spyrite. And it is a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten token that ye haue good successe in that Courte: and that ye are well in fauour with the high Lorde ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if you daily proue more &amp; more mylde, meeke, sobre, humble, and lowlye of heart.</p>
   <p>Suche only dothe he reteygne in fauour: to suche only he vouchsafe
<pb facs="21"/>to talke in that his holy worde, and disclose his high &amp; secrete misteries: whiche are shutte vp vnto the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaunt &amp; proude. It reioyseth the ploughmans hert to behold the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of his grayne or corne rather to hange downewarde then to stande bolte vp right: because he knoweth perfectly them to be lodē, these void of good fruyte</p>
   <p>The high plowghman Christ, coueyteth to see the same in you: to whom ye shall be an acceptable and fruytfull heruest, if your heades be not cocked vp with vayn glory, self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue, and pride, but bowed downe with all humilitie and meekenesse.</p>
   <p>If it proue not so w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> you, thynke not that ye haue any whyt proffeted in his worde. For as Menedemus was accustomed to saye that manye sayled to the scole of Athens, which at beginnyng seemed to them selfes
<pb facs="21"/>sapient: soone after became Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, that is, studious of sapiēce: Anone Rethoricioners: And finally Idyotes and vnlerned: Euen so, if ye worthelye entre the scoole of this Heauenly Philosophye, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly proffyt therin: where before ye seemed in your owne conceyte to your selffes ioyly men, gay felowes, and as well seene as the best doctor of them all: ye shall quyckly be out of this conceyte with youre selfes: Euery day ye shalbe lesse arrogaūt, lesse proude: euery houre challenge lesse knowledge vnto you: and say with Socrates finallye: <hi>Hoc scio quod nihil scio:</hi> This know I, that I know nothynge: and this is to knowe all. Reade it therfore with all humblenesse, w ith all mekenesse of herte, with pure entent, a nd godly purpose, to thende ye may proffytte therin: proffytte therin, that ye may
<pb facs="22"/>knowe your dewtye dewe to God &amp; the worlde: And knowyng it, haue ye prompt wyll, ready hande, sweete foote, to mynde, practyse, and folow the same to thuttermost.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>FINALLY</hi> if anye remayne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest vs quycke as yet &amp; ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely mēbres of Iesus Christ, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne we styll: Be we not discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted for any thing wee see. There are many heresies, no wondre: there haue ben more. Many are infected with them, why not: therfore they are permitted, to tempte &amp; proue the wytte of man. Let not all this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue vs from our standing: but for asmoche the weakenesse of man gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth might to heresies (they of them selfes beyng of no force and myght) and the deuyll there cometh onlye &amp; preueyleth, where faythe is feble to withstande and resyst: see we stande sure: see our house be euermore well
<pb facs="22"/>warded with the stronge and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitrable bolte of faythe. It is no wondre (as I haue sayde) that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resyes are: it is a greater occasyon of wonder if we be found so slender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouided and so yll appointed, as not to be able to repell and keepe of so weake an enemy. For if we arme our selfes with vnwaueryng faythe in Iesus Christ, no dout we shall be stronge &amp; of power sufficient to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate our aduersarye the deuyll his intent: who daily laboureth by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry pollicies to discharge that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable weapon from vs, to thende he mought enter our holdes. He is verye craftye &amp; politycke, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tempteth vs with many fayre &amp; flatteryng meanes, &amp; all to deceaue and intrappe oure simplicitie, that we wold forsake the holsome grayn of the hyghe Lorde, and lay hande vpon his dampnable Zizan. And
<pb facs="23"/>as Hyena the beast dothe immitate the voyce of man, Yea, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to call some one by name, to the ende that the same called furthe, he maye deuoure: The lyke pollicye Satan vseth to ketche vs in hys snare: He inuiteth vs vnto him by many fayre names, and entieth our heartes with manye goodly promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, &amp; to none other ende, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure vs, bothe body and soule.</p>
   <p>But wee are well warned of this crafty tyraunt: it were much shame to be vnarmed at any tyme agaynst him. He hath sent emongst vs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a stout and craftye whelpe nowe a dayes, to make away for him, that he may enter into our holdes I say: some of them appearynge vnto vs lyke them selfes, that is deuellyshe, without cloke or semblaūce of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse, and these can not begile vs. But some agayn transfigurate, and
<pb facs="23"/>fascyoned into Angelles of lyghte, &amp; suche may muche preuayle in their maisters quarell, with suche as are wauerynge, doubtfull, and weake in the faythe of Iesus Christ, oure high Capitayne. But resyst wee them manfully: feare we not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto them, as the people Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niensis aunswered vnto the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setours of Brute: whiche treated with them to yelde vp their Cytie in to the handes of theire Capitayne Brute:<note place="margin">Valer, Mar. ii. 6.

Lysymacus, by reason of a vehement drythe &amp; thristynesse, was compelled to yelde him self vnto the Scythes: And after that he hadde drounken the colde water: Good God, sayt he: <hi>Quem breuis volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis</hi>

   <p>Euen so must we vse oure aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saryes, the deuyl and the wylde bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes his ministers, not only that we be not hurte of them: but also that we be aduaunteged by them: as the more vehemently to be sturred vp to the studye of Gods comfortable worde, the more strongly to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm med in the faith of Iesus Christ:

This oure late Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian therfore not long synce was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore serten of the Counsell &amp; dyuers other Learned men, for his opiniō, by whose procurement I know not.
<pb facs="29"/>And deliuered the same his opinion with his prouffes in writyng to the lord Archbishop of Caūterbury be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng therunto at length required, as in the begynnyng of his writyng he confesseth. Wherof dyuers copies came into diuers mens hādes: And one was sent to me, from a frende of myne: who required me to peruse the same, and to let him dnderstand what I thought of it. To whome I dyd eftsones restore it incontinēt, writyng vnderneth the same for my answere to my frendis demaunde, nothing els but <hi>Vae hoi per quē venit scādalū tantū.</hi> Then being of mynd neuer to haue sayde one worde more vnto it, Yet I thought it veray ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and expedient, that so blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous &amp; perilous opinion shuld be confuted by some man, and that with speedye expedicion: In consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracion the people nowe a dayes
<pb facs="29"/>for the most parte, be so good of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, that nothyng is to harde for them to learne: especiallye if they heare of any new lesson not taught, or herd of a long tyme before: Then nothyng cometh a mysse vnto them, nothyng to harde for them to learne and beare away, althoughe, it be in deade neuer so muche agaynst God the Father, and his natural Sonne Iesus Christ. But in this behalfe I was in maner carelesse: for remē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brynge what a ioylye multitude of fresh writerse there ar in these daies, I thought this geare coulde not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape vnlooked on, But, seeyng in other trifelyng matters of no effect &amp; importauunce to speake of in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of this: they are so readye with their confutyng, bookes, bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes, and pleyes. In so weyghtye a cause as this is, I reckened they wold not be seene slacke or necligēt,
<pb facs="30"/>but out of hande, with all celeritie and speede withstande it. How be it reckeners without their hoste muste recken twyse, I haue hearde saye. Hytherunto, not one of them haue sayde one worde vnto it, or by mirth, pley or ernest game, that I cā heare of: what they wyll, I knowe not.</p>
   <p>For my parte at begynnynge I thoughte nothynge lesse then to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte anye suche enterprise, as I haue nowe taken in hande: partely because I haue not exercysed me self in the lyke before tyme, and chieflye for that I suspected much my wytte and connyng: therfore I supposed beste for me, hauynge neither exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyse ne connynge to dwell in myne olde silence and not to mell especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this matter, beyng of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaunce and hygh difficultye, far aboue my compasse and reache.</p>
   <p>Besyde this, I pondered the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="30"/>sent condicion of this worlde with me selfe, I thought in suche hurlye burlye, in so great tumultes, the voyce of such one shuld not be herd: For if the wordes of Ecclesiasticus are true, that the voyce of the wyse is hearde in quietnesse, it booted not to speke in so vnquiet a time as this is, (I thought) and of such matter. And to helpe forwarde, the saiynge of the Prophet came euē in the nick to my remembraunce: <hi>Intelligens, in tempore illo tacebit: .i.</hi> The wise wyll keepe silene in that tyme.</p>
   <p>All this notwithstandyng, when I coulde not perceyue or here tell, that any had taken in hande to improue and confute this most daungerous &amp; blasphemous opinion: Charitie whiche seeketh not any priuate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentacion or pleasure at any tyme, but euermore couetyng to vanquish the difficultie of all tymes &amp; seasons
<pb facs="31"/>vehementlye prouoked me to vtter some parte of my mynde in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: Wherunto the chyldren eke whiche were in Babylon, dyd not a lytle (as me thought) encourage &amp; hexten me forwarde, whose example enstructeth vs, that we ought with free courage and good heart, chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to witnesse the truth, although the whole worlde were agaynste it: which euen out of the myo burnyng fyre sange merely Psalme to God: not regardig the multitude of them which despised the truthe: but satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed them selfes beyng. iii. in nōbre.</p>
   <p>Wherfore neither my small exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, nor my slender knowledge, ne yet the aboundaunce of Iniquytie (which kepeth reuell now a dayes) haue defased me: But my hope fixed in the helpe of the Holye Spirite, I haue not kycked agaynst the spurre of Charitie, nor haue spurned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
<pb facs="31"/>the zeale and oue whiche I beare towarde my Countrey, bothe a lyke togyther prickynge me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde herto: But haue most wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyngly, I wotte not how happely, shewed forthe the truthe touchynge this mater of Christis Deuinitie.</p>
   <p>Besechyng the Christen Reader, if I haue not satisfyed thy expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion in all poyntes, yet wyll good to my good wyll, and beare with my weakenesse: sufficient it is and ynough to wyll well in highe maters, writers sayen: the matter is hyghe, my wyl is good, accept thone for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sake, <hi>Valete.</hi>
