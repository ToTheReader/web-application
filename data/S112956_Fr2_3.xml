   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>GOod Reader, some dutifull respects, not any desire to be in Print, haue mooued me to publish these exercises. I must confesse that it is an enterprise at this time, beside my profession, and therfore do the more earnestly craue thy fauorable acceptation, which must proceed of thy kind disposition not of my desert. I make this sute especially to the better aduanced in the studies of Diuinitie, whom me thinks I heare to say: Sowter to thy slipper; If they and the rest shall do me this fauour: it will incourage me to imploy my small talent with better profite heerafter; otherwise as I shall be hartily sory that I did not expresse my bounden dutie to that vertuous Ladie in some other action, so from hencefoorth I will content: my selfe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and presume to displease no man else with my simple en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuors. This let me likewise craue, and obtaine of thee, that thou wilt impute the imperfections which thou shalt find in this pamphlet, to my long discontinuance in good studies, &amp; to the want of those helps wherewith I might haue better polished the same. The Carpenter may roughly hew with his axe, but cānot carue without some finer tooles: the Smith may fashion with his hammer, but cannot make his worke smooth &amp; seemely without his files, and yet bad is the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship that fitteth not some place. The countrymans eie that hath not seene the deckings and ornaments of Courtlie pallaces, contents himselfe with the sight of bare wals; and to those whose mouths are not acquainted with delicacies, grosser meats neuer seem vnsauery: To such I hope these my poore exercises will be acceptable in honest simplicitie: and to the rest, in friendly curtesie. Farewell.</p>
