      <salute>Right Honourable,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Socrates</hi> his Schollers brought euery one rich gifts to him in token of thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, among the rest,<note place="margin">Sen. de ben. lib. 1. cap. 8.</note> hee had one called <hi>Aeschines,</hi> whose hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affection was as great to him as any of the rest, but hee wanted meanes to giue: whereupon he spake thus; I haue nothing, O <hi>Socrates,</hi> to giue vnto thee worthy thy selfe, but that one thing
<pb facs="3"/>
which I haue in my possession I freely giue, namely, I giue my selfe vnto thee. When I call to minde, the many and noble fauours receiued from your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I wish I could expresse my thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes in a more reall manner then my ability will permit; but hauing nothing worthy your selfe, with <hi>Aeschines</hi> I giue my selfe to your Lordships seruice. At this time I offer this poore mite of my weake endeauours to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Patronage; A worke not fit the Presse, neither did I intend (had I not bene encouraged to it by your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours approbation of it, in hope it may redound to the publike good,) euer to haue published it. Such as it is, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>ex mero motu,</hi> out of a hearty desire of Gods glory, and my Countries safety. It meets with the security and iniquitie of the time; and if it may
<pb facs="3"/>
rowze vs from the one, or the other, or both, I shall thinke my time well bestowed. A double respect makes it due vnto your Honour: First the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, my particular obligation; because my labours in the Gospell being first countenanced, and daily encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by your honour, you may of right challenge this, as the first fruits to bee offered vnto you. Secondly, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of it; because your Lordship (as I attendant in your Honourable house can witnesse, being daily acquainted with your wishes and praiers) follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the steps of your loyall and thrice renowned Father, desire nothing more, then the furtherance of Gods glory, the safetie of his roiall Maiestie, and wellfare of your Countrie; all which, and nothing else this aimeth at: It is all my praier, all my desire. Thus
<pb facs="4"/>
ceasing further to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship at this time, with my daily and heartie supplications to the Father of mercies, for your selfe, together with your second-selfe, your religious Lady in whom you are happy, beseeching him long to continue that blessed knot, with asmuch happines as euer he bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> or <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebekah;</hi> and to multiply all those blessings on you which <hi>Iacob</hi> wished to his deareling <hi>Ioseph;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gen. 49. vers. 25.</note> heauenly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings from aboue, and earthly blessings from beneath, blessings of the breasts, and of the wombe, I commit you to his mercifull and blessed protection.</p>
