   <p>¶ In the end of which prayer he sayth / I will sacrifice with the voyce of thankesge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge and paye that I haue vowed / that sauinge cometh of the lorde. For verely to cōfesse out of the herte / that all benefites co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me of God / euen out of the goodnesse of his mercie and not deseruinge of oure dedes / is the only sacrifice that pleaseth God.

<pb facs="14"/>
Jewes coude not repent: when the heathen Niniuites repented at the bare preachynge of Jonas rebukinge theyr synnes with out any miracle at all.</p>
   <p>¶ Why? For y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Jewes had leuēded the spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rituall law of God and with theyr gloses had made it all to gether erthie ād fleshly / and so had sett a vayle or coueringe on Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses face / to shodowe and darken y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> glorious brightnesse of his contenaunce.

   <p>¶ To smyte father ād mother was synn: But to withdraw helpe frō them at theyr nede / for blynde zele of offeringe / vn to the profytt of the holy phareses / was then as meritorious as it is now to let all thy kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne chose wheter they will synke or sweme / while thou byldest and makest goodly fun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>daciōs for holy people which thou hast cho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sen to be thy christe / for to sowple thy soule

   <p>¶ It was greate synne for Christ to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le the people on the sabboth daye vn to the glorie of God hys father / but none at all for them to helpe theyr catell vnto theyr awne profett.</p>
   <p>¶ It was synne to eate wyth vnwashen handes or on an vnwashen table / or out of an vnwashen dish: but to eate out of that purifyed dysh that which came of brybery / theft &amp; extorsion / was no synne at all.</p>
   <p>¶ It was exceadynge meritorious to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke many dyscyples: But to teach them to feare God in hys ordynaunces / had they no care at all.</p>
   <p>¶ The hye prelates so defended the ryght of holy church ād so feared the people with
<pb facs="15"/>
the curse of God &amp; terreble paynes of hell / that no man durst leaue the vilest herke in hys gardeyne vntythed. And the offeryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge and thynges dedycat vn to God for the profitt of hys holy vycars where in soch estymacion and reuerēce / that it was moch greater synne to sweare truly by them / thē to for swere thy selfe by God: what venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce then of God / and how terreble and cruell damnacion thynke ye preached they to fall on thē that had stolen soch holy thī<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? And yet sayth Christ / that ryght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesnesse ād faith in kepynge promise / mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and indyfferent iudgement were vttur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troden vnder fote and cleane dispysed of those blessed fathers / whych so mightely mayntened Arons patrimony ād had mad it so prosperous ād enuironed it and walled it aboute on euery syde with y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> feare of god / that noman durst twech it.</p>
   <p>¶ It was greate holynesse to garnysh y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> se pulchres of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> prophetes &amp; to cōdemne their awne fathers for sleynge of them: and yet were they thē selues for blinde zele of their owne cōstituciōs / as ready as their fathers
<pb facs="16"/>
to sle whosoeuer testified vn to them / the same trueth which the prophetes testified vn to theyr fathers. So that Christ cōpa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth all the rightwesnesse of those holy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes vn to the out warde bewtye of a paynted sepulchre full of stench and all vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clennesse wythyn.</p>
   <p>¶ And finally to begyld a mans neyboure in sotle bargeninge and to wrappe and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pase him in with cauteles of the law / was then as it is now in the kingdome of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe.
