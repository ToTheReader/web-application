   <head>❧The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Euing thee to vnderstand (Christian Reader) the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest power of God in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the inestimable mercy and long sufferance of vs most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable creatures, who from tyme to tyme proueth whether we will flye from our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and frowarde vsage of lyfe or no, and seyng no amendmēt ceaseth not, but forthwith pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs: yea, and at the length geueth vs ouer vnto our owne wretched will, and beyng so deuoyd and frustrate from all hope ioy and triumphant glory, we are assured as then of nothing but euerlasting death and endelesse sorrow. Therefore I wishe all faithfull christians to foresée and so to prouide in tyme, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther popishe Antichrist, nor any rable of false vsurped powers shall once be able to spurne or kicke against the veritie and true professours of the same. The holy apostle S. Iames speaketh ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry louingly vnto all suche as geueth their mindes to godly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and study, saying these wordes. <hi>My brethren counte it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioy when ye fall into diuers temptations, forasmuch as you know how that the trying of your faith bringeth pacience, and let patience haue her perfect worke, that ye may be perfect and sounde lacking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Herein the apostle sheweth vnto all men, that by patience we must moderate our selues, as if the enemy shew rigorousnes ortiranny, winne him by patience, but vse no superbitie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengemēt, but yeld the cause vnto god, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which iudgeth rightly, and he will in tyme be a defence vnto all such oppressed. <hi>Vir du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex animo inconstans est in omnibus vijs suis,</hi> a waueryng mynded mā is vnstable in all his wayes. But most happy is that man that endureth in temptation, for when he is tried, he shall receiue the crowne of life which the lord hath promised to those which loue him, and erre not my dere brethren. Euery good gift
<pb facs="3"/>
and euery perfect gift is from aboue, and commeth downe from the father of light, with whome is no variablenes, neither is he chaunged into darkenes. Of his owne will begate he vs wyth the worde of lyfe, that we should be the first fruites of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so that as long as we obey his preceptes and be zealous furtherers of his gospell, and alwayes continuing, then shall all such doers be assured of most happy saluation. Herein is plainly shewed vnto all, the estate of euery degrée by order of picture and signification, to the intent, that therby euery christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may the better sée the disordred abuses which daily raueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest vs, and also the state of obedience by euery picture in like sorte signified, that thereby euery Christian may the better beware the deceiuable suggestions of Sathan, that neither par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don nor mumming, massinges or any other popish ceremonies, can any thing auayle as touchyng saluation: for if it were so, then Christes death was in vayne, and of none effect. Take hede therfore &amp; cleaue betyme to Christ &amp; his doctrine, &amp; leaue of frō such superstitiō &amp; faynings of men, &amp; vse the counsail of the holy apostle S. Iude, which sayth: <hi>Similiter &amp; hi carnē quidē macu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lant dominatorem aut spernūt maiestates aut blasphemant.</hi> Likewise these dreamers defile the flesh, despise rulers, &amp; speake euill of them that are in autoritie. But these speake euill of those they know not, &amp; what thynges they know naturally, as beasts which are without reason, in those thinges they corrupt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Woe be vnto them, for they haue followed the way of Balaam for lukers sake, and perishe in the treason of Chore. These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their owne lustes, whose mouthes speake proude thinges. They haue men in great reuerence because of aduauntage. But ye beloued, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the wordes which were spoken before, of the apostles of our Lorde Iesus Christ, how that they tolde you that there should be beguilers in the last tyme, which should walke in their vngodly lustes, these are makers of sectes fleshly, hauing no spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, pray therfore dearely beloued, that God so roote out al such enemies which kicke against the truth of his gospell, &amp; so arme
<pb facs="3"/>
your selues with the armour of God, considering that Sathan is moste busiest and full of rage in this oure tyme, as Saincte Iohn in hys reuelation dothe manifestly expresse: That we all being armed with godlines may bee able to resist in the day of our triall, and to be found vigilant watchemen aspectyng the great and second commyng of our Lorde Iesus Christ. In the meane season applying our mindes to the study of vertue, may be rich and plentifull in righteousnes and hope of saluation. And for that your myndes among many and earnest pensiue and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful studies might be reuiued also in vertue. I haue put forth vnto your gentle considerations this my simple trauayls, which in perusing you shal well espy to be in effect as I haue named it.</p>
   <p>This christall glasse wherein we may learne godly reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whose brightnes shineth not to the beholders therof in this world, a light to euery christian man, but in the world to come a most precious and euerlasting brightnes in endles felicitie.</p>
   <p>As I sayd, a manifest shew of all couloured abuses that raigne in euery state, and set in the frame of most plentiful &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian examples. The substaunce wherof is the perfect glasse of godly reformation, beautified with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall sight of all celestiall vertues, right fruitfull for euery man to cary, and most nedefull for this our present tyme. Thus gentle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I bid thée most hartely farewell in him that liueth for euer.</p>
