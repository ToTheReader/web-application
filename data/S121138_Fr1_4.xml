   <head>THE COPPY OF MASTER
DOCTORS LETTER SENT
to me with his booke.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Race and peace. There was brought to me
in August last an answere made to my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
preached at Chippenhame the 28. of
February by your selfe, which for that I was
then riding to London, I laid vp in my studie
till my returne. At which time examining
it: I found that you had indeauored to answere some part of
my sermon: and some things you left vnanswered. Hereupon
I had thought to make no replie. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he: I vnderstoode,
that speeches were blazed abroad that neither I could, nor
durst answere it: I entered into a resolution either to defend
my self or els to recant, to stay the sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eches of the multitude.
And therefore to satisfie your request haue made a replie,
wherein I haue proued my former reasons to be firme &amp; v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>controleable,
and your answer to be weak &amp; vnsufficient: for
that you disagree with Dauid, Esay, Ezechiel▪ Mathew, Pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
Paul, yea Christ himself, as it shal appeare in the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
It is an easie matter to set your selfe against M. Hil.
But it is not so easie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> mater to set your self against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and Apostles, and Christ himselfe. Hee vvill say to
you as he said to Paul, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>.
Wherefore I pray you, if you vvill proceed in this conference
to lay downe the vvhole as <hi>I</hi> do: and consider vvhat, vvhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>,
and vvhere you vvrite. You write of an article of our faith,
vvhich must be confirmed by Gods word. If therefore it shal
<pb facs="9"/>
appeare, that you haue gainsaid the Apostles vvordes and
meanings: vvho vvill beleeue you for an orthodoxall tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher?
you write in the most perrillous times. When therefore,
the Papists shall see your deceiptfull handling of Gods word,
they vvill reioice at it. Lastly, you vvrite against an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
imbraced in the Church of England alwaies, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by our learned synod, and convocation in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Therefore you must assure your selfe, that you cannot
cary this cause away without weightie, &amp; irrefragable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
I receiued also the last of November, an answere in
Latine. I vvill at successiue houres frame by Gods grace,
an answer to that. In the meane season, you may peruse this,
and see by this replie, vvhat good successe you may promise
your selfe, and your friends in the other. Thus desiring
God to direct this conference, and al other our
labours to his glorie, I end. </p>
