                 <title>A new handling of the planisphere : diuided into three sections. In the first is a plaine and sensible explication of the circles of the sphere, and such termes as appertaine vnto the doctrine de primo mobili ... The second sheweth how vpon any plaine ... hauing one circl diuided into degrees, and crossed vvith tvvo diameters at right angles, most conclusions of the astrolabe may for all latitudes or countries be readily and exactly performed onely vvith ruler and compasses. In the third, being a supplement organicall, is contained the making of certaine easie instruments for the perfecter working the former conclusions, as to know what degrees and minutes be in any circumference giuen ... Pleasant and profitable generally for all men, but especially such as vvould get handines in vsing the ruler and compasse ... vvithout being at the charge of costly instruments. Inuented for the most part, and first published in English by Thomas Olyuer</title>

   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing the matters here entreated of admit no eloquence, but must in plaine attire be simply offered to the view, though I could (gentle Reader) I would not flourish with thee, in pleading for my selfe or this treatise: therefore referring all to thy friendly censure, I will spend this voide paper in aduertisements for the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and easier performing of that which is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</p>
   <p>The fittest matter, whereupon you may worke these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions following, will be a plate of brasse, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, Pritchet, Pointer or Steele, wherewith you must draw your lines, would be either of the same substance, or els Iron rather than Steele: for if you make not your strokes verie deepe, by rubbing the plate with a wet Pumice, you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily take all out when you will, and thereby also tarrish or darken it in such sort, that you may presently at your ease, and very exactly draw, and worke vpon it againe.</p>
   <p>When you begin to practise, it will helpe very much to work one conclusion by it selfe, and to note the lines, as you draw them, with the characters, that are named in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar construction: but when you are something perfect, this shall not neede.</p>
   <p>You may also, hauing a quadrant diuided, make any paper serue the turne for these purposes. Opening your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe to the distance of 60. degrees, at that distance discribe a circle, and subtending foure times in it a line equall to that line, which subtendeth the quadrants circumference,
<pb facs="4"/>if you ioyne the opposite points, it shall be crossed with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular Diameters, then transferring the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences giuen or found from the quadrant to the circle, or from the circle to the quadrant, you may finde the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of any circumference as well, as though your circle were diuided into degrees.</p>
   <p>Where you desire exactnes, you must rest neither on this way, nor on the instrument in the beginning of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond section, but vse that quadrant which you are taught to make in the beginning of the third section, by it you may know the iust content of any giuen circumference in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and minutes exactly, and let this be a generall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for all conclusions.</p>
   <p>I haue barely set downe the constructions without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, as the fittest for their capacities, whose good I specially aime at: yet is there nothing here propounded that hath not demonstratiuely been examined: and for experimentall triall the working by these conclusions may be compared with tables calculated for the same purpose, which, if handines and diligence be vsed, will agree.</p>
   <p>Since my writing of the second section, I haue found how the conclusions therein omitted may bee perfectly wrought without the helpe of any <hi>Elleipsis,</hi> and all contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within the compasse of the limbe: but at this time I thought not good to adde them.</p>
   <p>Thus much (gentle Reader) I thought meete thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest be aduertised of: and so desiring thee to pardon the escapes of my penne, if thou meetest with any, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee and thy honest studies to our Lords holie direction.</p>
