                 <title>The historie of foure-footed beastes : Describing the true and liuely figure of euery beast, with a discourse of their seuerall names, conditions, kindes, vertues (both naturall and medicinall) countries of their breed, their loue and hate to mankinde, and the wonderfull worke of God in their creation, preseruation, and destruction. Necessary for all diuines and students, because the story of euery beast is amplified with narrations out of Scriptures, fathers, phylosophers, physitians, and poets: wherein are declared diuers hyerogliphicks, emblems, epigrams, and other good histories, collected out of all the volumes of Conradus Gesner, and all other writers to this present day.

   <head>CONRADVS GESNERVS to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue now sufficiently in my Epistle Dedicatory expressed by what occasion I came vnto this worke, how much I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in it, to shew what fruits may be had out of it, and with how great study, both Kings, and Princes, as also many great and most learned men haue reuerenced the history of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the rest of which, I haue thought good to impart vnto the Reader in the beginning of my work, which I will seuerally propose: neither did it becomme to be more large in a dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beeing made vnto the principallest men of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. And because the greatnesse of the Booke before it be read of any man, may seeme to blame me to be too tedious, I will excuse it before I intreat of anything.</p>
   <p>Therefore first of all it is no maruaile though it be a great volume, in which I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to insert with diligent study, the writings of all men concerning all Foure-footed-liuing-beasts: and also the sayings of old and later Philosophers, Physitians, Gramari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Poets, Hystorians; and lastly of all kind of Authors: not onely of those which haue set foorth their workes in Latine, or Greeke, but of euery one also which haue set downe their works in <hi>Germany, France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>England</hi>: And most diligently of the sayings of those which haue written something of purpose concerning liuing creatures, but with the lesser care of other, which haue onely in the meane time remembred some sayings of the same, as Hystorians, and Poets.</p>
   <p>I haue put down also many proper obseruations, and haue gathred togither many things, nowe and then by asking questions, without reproach of any man, learned or vnlearned, Cittizens, or strangers, Hunters, Fishers, Fawkconers, Shepheards, and all kind of men. Also I haue not knowne any thing out of the writings of learned men, of many Nations, which they haue giuen to me, but I haue expressed the same. The formes also of euery liuing creature in this work, haue increased the volume, but chiefely the first Book (which is al Foure-footed-beastes liuing alike) hath out of measure increased it, because this kind of liuing creature, may be more familiarly known, and more profitable to man, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to those of our Nation or Countrie: And also many haue written little and reasonable bookes of each of them, as the horse-leaches of horses, in <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> and the later writers in other languages, and so forth.</p>
   <p>Also many haue declared diuers things concerning Dogges, and the bríngers vp also of cattle, and heards of Beasts, Goats, Sheepe, and Sowes, haue pronounced many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey obseruations, both in <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi> Some man may happen to say, that I ought not to make a Hystory out of all Bookes, but onely from the best; but I will not despise the writings of any man, seeing there is made no book so bad, from whence there cannot be some good sentence gathered out, if any man do applie his wit thereto. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I haue not ouer-skipped anie kind of writer, yet I did it not rashly, for I haue pickt out no few obseruations of good moment from barbarous and obscure writers in diuers languages, so that I would not be iudged a negligent person to giue credit to euery thing, nor arrogant or vnmoddest, to despise the studies or labors of any man.</p>
   <p>Those things truely which I thought were false or any way absurd, I either altogether
<pb facs="13"/>
omitted them, or so placed as I may conuict them: or if at any time I haue not done it, it was either thorough lacke of knowledge, or for some other cause, which fault I thinke is very seldome committed, (except it be in those thinges which doe belong to Physicke, where we haue related very often many things both false and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>perstitious, as happily an Amulet or preseruative against enchauntment is, and many other things which are of the same kind, that the good sayinges of learned men may be easily knowne) of the name of the Authour, and as much of euery thing as shall be thought worthy to be beleeued, let the Reader iudge, for I do not promise my owne Authority euery where, but am satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to recite the words and sentences of other writers. Wherefore I haue beene very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, least at any time I should omit the name of an Authour, although it were in small matters, and also those which were commonly knowne, because there should remaine no doubt or scruple of any thing: The words also and sayings of euery Author, shalbe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact together, if any man should be desirous to imitate or follow them.</p>
   <p>Therefore I haue been more copious, that I might not onely profit in the knowledge of words, but also haue sufficiently ministred a worke, or writing of words and speeches, for those which are desirous either to dispute, or write an Oration either in Greeke or Latine.</p>
   <p>But it could not be done more commodiously, that all things might bee written pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Latine, seeing that I haue recited almost in the same words certaine things taken out of those which were rude or barbarous; chiefely because if any thing should be obscure or doubtfull: but the rest which were written of them, I haue altered to a moderate vse of the Latine tongue; not because I could not doe it better, but rather because such an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution doth seeme to adorne such Authors. But those sentences which I haue writ or coppied out of good and Latine Authors, I haue not altered any thing of them.</p>
   <p>And truely of my owne stile, or manner of writing, I can say no other then this, that I haue had a great care, although I could not pronounce it eligantly and wisely, nor after the imitation of the auncient writers, notwithstanding I haue pronounced it competent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and plainely in Latine. Neyther was it ydlenesse to frame such a stile or manner of writing, seeing that I was most of al busied in those things, as wel mutable as innumerable and in a manner I haue written those things which if they had beene gathered together I had put to presse many yeares before.</p>
   <p>The cause why I did neglect it was the feare least any thing shoulde be left out, and not verie much to seeke more matter, but for the most part the inscription was the cause, and the order and care that I had, least any thing, should be repeated in vain: Moreouer also because that the Argument did not require a graue or excellent maner of stile or speech, but a manifest and meane style, and most commonly a Gramarian, that is to say, fit for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</p>
   <p>For I would not onely recite the words of the Authors, but oftentimes also where it was needefull, I did adde thereto the exposition or declaration; so that this volume may not onely be a history of liuing creatures, but also an exposition of the place of al those which haue written something of liuing creatures. For those which do vndertake to make any booke, must chiefely beware of two things, that the words and meaning of the Authour be declared and put together like places of the rest, the latter whereof I haue accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in this worke by great labour, because the sayings both of other Authours, as wel as of one, concerning the same matter in diuers places are compiled together, and it would be a matter of lesse value to declare in more words the words of the Authours, when they among themselues haue so diligentlie gathered together the places, that they must bring them to mutual light.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding if so be that it seemeth a worke to declare the wordes and sentences of the Authours; I haue done it for my owne helpe, and for others, and also in causes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in other sentences as they so cal them, yet it doeth happen that I am freed by their nature from too dark a stile, from euery affectation or curious desire, of that thinge which nature hath not giuen, I leaue that care to those with whome wordes rather then matter are entertained.</p>
   <p>But that I may repeat more copiouslie in few words their sayings, that this book may
<pb facs="13"/>
But that I may repeate more copiously in few wordes their sayings that this booke may not be to large, therefore first of all I will entreate of that which is perfected by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Authors, and afterwards of that which <hi>I</hi> haue sundry times added thereto, because of my owne declaration.</p>
   <p>This booke might be much shorter, if I had not touched the loue of learning, in which <hi>I</hi> confesse I haue been too tedious and although this my diligence may be vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to some, yet <hi>I</hi> hope it will bee pleasant and acceptable to the <hi>Grammarians</hi> and others, but truely it hath cost me great labour and many nightes watching. I call that the loue of learning whatsoeuer it is, that doth belong to a <hi>Grammarian,</hi> and diuersities of languages, prouerbs, or common sayings, semblables, tales, or fables, wherein bruite Beasts are fained to speake, the sayings of Poets, and lastly that which doth belong rather to words, then to the matters themselues.</p>
   <p>This and such like I haue done for the most part,<note place="margin">The Reader must note that all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>se following are spoken of his latin discorse</note> hauing made a seuerall Chapter of those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>nges which belong to euery liuing creature, euen to the eight or last Treatise, yet notwithstanding sometimes they haue got in by stealth in the former Chapters, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because I was inuited by a small occasion, and with a certaine desire of the same, to change my purposes and partly because that the light of the Authors should seeme to bring profit to the places fitly recited or openly reade, that else where, as well as in the second chapter, I haue oftentimes also alledged somewhat more of <hi>Grammarians,</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians, and other matters.</p>
   <p>In the third Chapter wherein I did entreat of the meates and diseases of liuing creatures, I oftentimes turned more copiously to entreate of the plantes by the which they were wholesomely nourished, or happily by the strength of the tast of them were hurt, or else killed: and after the same manner also in the first Chapter if there were any such rootes that the liuing creatures should perish by them throwne by the Hunters with some meate. But I haue professed and confessed in that loue of learning, that I was wont to name those plantes, and sometimes to write of many thinges which haue had their name after a certaine manner from some liuing creature.</p>
   <p>The seuenth Chapter entreateth of the remedies of liuing creatures, and of curing the hurts which they were wont to receiue by biting, or by a stroke, or by eating of meate. I do very often esteeme much of many thinges written in the desire of dignifieng medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall matters. It is seene where the places of Authors being depraued and renewed, haue allowed occasion of digressing. To be short, wheresoeuer any rare thing, or that which is declared to others did offer it selfe, which being vnfolded should seeme to dignifie and honor common learning, I haue beene alured contrary to my institution, for the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereof: For when as being a child I was educated in the Greeke and Latine studies of Gramer and conference, &amp; as yet being a young man had begun to profit therein: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till growne vnto full age, I came to riper profession of Phylosophy, especially natural and Medicinall, (although out of the same I haue not a little increased my loue vnto lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and made it more firme and solide, and very greedily haue exercised my selfe in reading of diuers matters) I could do somewhat more in the explications of matters and sayings, then I perswaded my selfe, the rude multitude would regard, especially in the age of inferiour students, and in the studies of those which are busied in other matters. Wherefore I haue written more freely and often more copiously of many thinges. I haue reprehended the ancient &amp; the later (not with any intent to obscure others, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage my owne,) but sincerly and simply, as much as in me lyeth that I might aduance common studies. But if no man doe disalow their bookes (whom in no order but as any thing which commeth into their mindes;) expound the wordes and sayinges of diuers Authors in both tongues, as among auncient Writers, <hi>Macrobius, Gillius, Cassidorus,</hi> and whosoeuer haue written diuers things, (many whereof I haue declared in the second part of my <hi>Bybliotheca</hi>:) and amongst the latter many others, as most especially <hi>Guilielmus Budaeus, Coelius Rhodiginus &amp; Chalcagninus, Polittanus, Erasmus Rotorodamus, &amp;c.</hi> but as it were best of all by desertes, whatsoeuer any good man or meanely learned doth thinke of them.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="14"/>I doe not see by what right this our labour may be dispraised, wherein many thinges truely spoken of by others, but disordredly, many thinges by me being first deliuered, I haue so orderd and disposed that in a manner euery thing may be set in his owne proper place. As for al the chapters which we haue set down are not only of them, but euery chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter hath his seuerall part and certaine order both the former and the latter, one Method and that continuall of the middle part being throughout the whole worke. And because sometime it did happen that something might seeme to be referred out of those, which I had directed into diuers other places, least I should be too tedious in repeating the same, and therefore for the most part I remitted it from one place, to one Author; vnlesse al the story might be repeated in few words.</p>
   <p>These and certaine other things (as the words of diuers Authors, and variety of stile) an vnequal, interrupted and a cumbersome worke, (as I may so call it) and (as some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance will obiect they haue stored it alike with dissolute marks or purposes: which fault though I should vnderstand, I haue notwithstanding refused to commit, whiles that it should so profit: but this shall bee, (howsoeuer blemished it is) much lesse, if any may ghesse with himselfe that I haue composed al these things not by that order that they shold be knowne by continuall seriousnesse of reading of studious men: but so to haue tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them that whatsoeuer any man shal desire concerning any beast, that being presently found he may read it by it selfe, and wel vnderstand it. Therefore if any man will vse this worke only at seasonable times, who hath vsed dictionaries and such like common books, he shal be able to do these things profitably but if he shall not remember the order in the prescribed manner, let him take counsell of the table Alphabeticall, which wee will pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish in the end of this our worke, but if nothing preuaile, in the meane time as we are all subiect to Censure through the Readers infirmity, the same in a manner, Pliny in the History of nature hath ordained: for in his Praeface to <hi>Vespasian</hi> he writeth; because wee must saith he) spare your labours for the common good, what may be contained in all my Bookes, I haue ioyned to this Epistle, and haue done my greatest endeuor with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentest care, that thou shouldest haue these Bookes not to bee read ouer againe, and thou by this shalt be the occasion that other may not reade them ouer againe: but as euery one shall desire any thing, that he may onely seeke that, and know in what place he may find it, <hi>Valerius Soranus</hi> did this before me in his books which he inscribed <hi>Epopcido<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> These things Pliny.</p>
   <p>They which desire to profit in this Art of Grammer, and to get the vse of some tong vnto themselues, who with a compounded Method (as they call it) deliuer their art from letters and sillables, to the sayings, and eight parts of speech, and last of all speech it selfe, and hauing come vnto the <hi>Sintaxis,</hi> doth desire the knowledge of art, in the meane time notwithstanding he doth not neglect the profit of Lexicons (wherein all sayings and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are numbred, far otherwise then in the precepts of art, where neither all things seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, nor in any good order are rehearsed) not that from the beginning hee may reade through the end, which would be a worke more laboursome then profitable, but that he may aske counsell of them in due season.</p>
   <p>In like manner he that is desirous to know the History of beasts, and will read it through with continuall seriousnesse, let him require the same of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and of other likewise that haue written, and let him vse our volume as a Lexicon, or as my owne <hi>Onomasticon.</hi> For it is not vnknowne vnto me that <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth teach in his booke, entituled the partes of beasts, that it maketh much (to the description of Phylosophy) and that it is more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so to write concerning beastes, that aswell the parts, as the effects might also be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led common to more, their History being vnfolded by certaine common places: First by prosecuting those things which are most common, and somewhat vnto things that are lesse common lastly by loking backe and descending into those things, which onely shall be proper vnto certaine kinds and vulgar shapes: for if in all beasts any man would seuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally consider the parts and effects, there will many things fall out by the way to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and inquired after, which (he saith) will be very absurd, and also proue too tedious. This discommodity, although I should well vnderstand, yet I would notwitstanding seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prosecute the History of beasts, which thing is to be handled in our time wherin the names
<pb facs="14"/>
of very many are not vnderstood, I should iudge would be more profitable, and I should thinke it lesse absurd, that somethings should more often be sought after, being ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the order of the same, that this work might rather serue for inuestigation then con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinuall reading: I haue not notwithstanding euen in al Beasts placed euery thing which is incident to euery kind, both for as much as certaine thinges are knowne to some men, as most common partes of Foure-footed-Beastes, as also if any man shall doubt in some thinges, he may refer himselfe into the places of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> wherein those things are handled generally: and perhaps we also at sometime or other wil according to the kinds and shapes of Foure-footed-Beastes discourse of somewhat more particular.</p>
   <p>And because I had determined, it was more commodious for a History to be made by vs concerning all Beasts, euen in that name or title which not Phisically, or onely Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophically, but Medicinally, &amp; also grammatically concerning one thing: Neither doth it want the exampls of learnedmen, for scarce the one or the other as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> &amp; <hi>Ruellius</hi> haue deliuered any thing concerning plants, according to that Method, which in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon parts and effectes hath manifested all plants of the earth, but very many haue descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed seuerall plants seuerally, and in times past out of our age (especially Physitians) <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellius</hi> for the most part laboured in both, (as <hi>Galen</hi> also) but onely in describing of apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
   <p>Indeede I confesse, that I could be far more briefe in many more things (although my purpose remaine) aboue all other thinges, euen that exquisite desire of my diligence had delighted me, when that same saying of <hi>Liuy</hi> came into my mind, in a certaine volume, beginning after this manner: Now sufficient glory was gotten for him, and hee could cease himselfe, vnlesse his mind should be daily fed with worke, although (as Pliny saith) the greater should the reward be for the loue of worke (which better became him not to haue composed it to his owne,) but to the glory of the Romaine name, and not to haue perseuered onely to please his owne minde, but to haue set forth the same to the profit of the people of Rome.</p>
   <p>I would haue you iudge, that I haue not kept back or stayed my course in these my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, not onely for fauoring my selfe, or getting glory to my selfe, (although <hi>Liuius</hi> did so) but rather to make the truth more plaine pertaining to Histories, or to the people of Rome: Notwithstanding I think that he spake more modestly, least if he should have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after that manner which Pliny doth require, he should be iudged to haue been more arrogant) as one which should foretell any thing to the worthyest people of the whole World, or any thing of the honor of the Conqueror of those Nations, he would say that they must come from him. Likewise although this worke (what soeuer it is) do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be done wholy for my selfe, but for the gouernors and rulers, of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and to the gouernors of the vniuersity or Academy, which haue fauoured mee euen from a Child of their owne liberality, and do still continue their fauor vnto me, and do exhort me to finish those things which I haue begun already: and if there should arise any fame or renowne from thence, it should chiefely light vpon them: Yet least I should be deceiued, I willingly hold my peace, and the rest I leaue to iudgement, whyther any thing may happen from this worke so praise-worthy and of excellent fame, and yet not vnworthye of praise, for to the Senate, and to the vniuersity I owe much time, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny names of worth to those most excellent men of learning, and other different ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
   <p>But least happily I be held too tedious, while I excuse the largenesse of the worke, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (by the way I haue handled some other thinges all vnder one) that I might shew certaine commodities arising from them, and also I might excuse our stile. I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede and go forward to the rest.</p>
   <p>And although from our foresayings it may be sufficiently manifested of our exceeding great labour, and also the greatnesse of the volume, as well as the variety and difficulty of things, therein expressed, may boldly speake for me, yet I will a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>e thereunto very many things if thereby the censures of learned men doe happen more reasonable, benigne &amp; fauorable, and doe aduertise and admonish me that I haue offended at any time, I will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<pb facs="15"/>
and follow their opinions, but for the Censures of vnlearned I little regard. For I haue endeuored my selfe with great and painefull labour, although they are not corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent in all thinges, that they may merrit pardon: and (as he saith) in a great worke it is thought lawfull to breake much sleepe.</p>
   <p>Pliny doth write that he hath finished his naturall or lawfull History from a hundered of choice or curious Authors, and hath added too very many matters, which either they haue not knowne, or afterwardes had beene deuised or inuented in their life time: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do wee doubt (saith he) but that there are many thinges which also we haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skipped.</p>
   <p>I desire also that the same may be vnderstood of this our volume, although it is not onely made ready and fit to me by a hundered Authors, but also by many others as you may easily count or reckon by the Catalogue of them, which I haue also set downe. But first of all what labour and paines it was to read all thinges diligently and with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, afterward to take and chuse thinges, to reduce and restore them to their owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againe: and againe confer and compare them while you are writing the worke, as if many should haue said one thing, being plainely expressed of Authors, and changed by other names: others stealing priuily by names suppressed.</p>
   <p>But how hard &amp; tedious a labour it is, so to confer the whole writings of Authors, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all of them as it were into one body, that nothing may bee omitted, nor any thing vnaduisedly repeated, no man doeth vnderstand, except he be learned: truely this doth so happen onely in comparing or conferring two or three bookes, but most of all in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of very many Bookes as we haue done: and that so diligently, as heareafter there shall bee little neede of looking into other Authors concerning those matters. But hee which will haue this volume ought to perswade himselfe that he hath all thinges concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those matters written at large, that is to say, one booke for a Library, one more excellent then many others. When <hi>Peeter Gillius</hi> before vs had done thus, but in few Authors; the Graecians (saith he) which haue written concerning Beastes, wee haue not only made Latins which was very easie, but also imitating <hi>Dionysius Cassius</hi> who translated <hi>Mago,</hi> we allowed both order and iudgment.</p>
   <p>But I should more iustly speake these things concerning our selues who haue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an order far more commodious, and haue conferred many more Writinges of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, both others (as I haue already said) as also for al the most part translated out of the Graecians, and from others, and from <hi>Gillius</hi> himselfe.</p>
   <p>Therfore I haue more often set down the Graecians sayings, where either the interpreters did seeme to erre, or the words or locutions did containe some rare or excellent things or peculiar to the matter. I haue also translated many my selfe, either that were not as yet translated, or that I would translate a Graecian saying discretly, and then dispute the matter with the interpreter. But of the Germans French, and Italians I haue translated certaine into Latine: I haue sustained much watchfull labour in reading, gathring, confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and writing ouer those workes and stories many yeares: which truely what and how many they haue beene, cannot easily be beleeued, vnlesse of expert men: although I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not easily see any man should assay the like matter, to bring into one vniforme body all the sayings of all writers, as many as could bee had of one argument: for I haue knowne certaine men who out of many things haue written some, out of all, none. Wherefore I can say that of my labours which <hi>Aristides</hi> spake concerning the elegance of the Citty of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which was, that no man except he which shall see it will be drawen to beleeue it: That which appertaineth to the stile, although in the precedent sayings I haue spoken certaine thinges incidently digressing from the matter, heere I will very priuately and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily adde some things.</p>
   <p>Therefore I haue vsed a meane phrase or speeche, in no mans wisedome too fine or curious, most chiefely for the causes aboue declared: For in those writinges wherein the knowledge of things is sought (as <hi>Massarius</hi> saith in the like argument) is not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of a famous or eloquent Oration, but to expresse a sound and perfect truth.
<pb facs="15"/>
But such workes are neither capable of wit, as I may say with Pliny, which was otherwise very meane or moderate to vse it: neither do they allow of excesse, either in Orations, or speeches, or wonderfull chances or aduentures, or diuers euents, or other pleasant things, or in any delectable or friendly things. Let the nature of things be declared in a barren or fruitelesse argument, that is to say the life of them, and this was base also on his part, by putting to many thinges with rusticall and strange denominations, yea also Barbarous, euen with the Praeface of estimation and reputation: And so far forth <hi>Plinius.</hi> But if that most learned man, and the most eloquent by the iudgement of all men, and which hath drawne or sucked out the cleanenesse or purenesse of the Latine tongue with Milke, and the vse of other commodities, and whereupon the desire of wit might much encourage him, being helped or pricked forward by <hi>Mecaenas</hi> his gouernor <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus,</hi> (of the penuriousnesse, and basenesse of the phrase, almost in the like argument) doth desire, to frame or make an excuse so much the more warily should I do this for many causes, which I will not expresse because I may not be to long. Wherefore some thinges are repeated heare and there in, diuers places of this worke, I gaue a reason euen before, truely because the order appointed of vs did so require, and the diuision of chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and parts in euery one of them, that it may not be written with negligence, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with exact, and curious diligence.</p>
   <p>But certaine things are repeated sometimes in the same place, which may seeme to be beside the purpose being known or perceiued; but if euery man would consider it distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he would easily vnderstand how little it weare either in matter or wordes: for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the peculiar or vulgar speech, or the eloquency of wordes did cause that <hi>I</hi> should do so, that it might haue that which might be imitated in speaking, if any man would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or endeuour, either to speake or write any thing of the same matter. Parentheses also do belong to the stile as the <hi>Grammarians</hi> call them, which are very many euery wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in the whole worke, and that for many causes: either because the reading or gathering is variable or vnlike, or the manner of writing did disagree, or because our correction or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was added thereto, or that <hi>I</hi> might translate it, or that <hi>I</hi> might fill or finish it if any thing should be wanting, or that <hi>I</hi> might adde thereunto that which might delight the eloquency thereof, or do somthing peculiar to the matter present, if the Latine should seeme not sufficiently translated of them: And lastly simply to a more intelligible vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of those thinges with which they are mingled. As much as belongs to the right forme of writing, I haue not alwaies written the same tearmes, or names after the same maner, but according to the Authors I haue very oftentimes changed, whose words I did rehearse or recite. This is of the stile and elocution.</p>
   <p>That which doe belong to these thinges, and to the truth and certainety of them, I do not promise my credit in very many of them, but yet am well pleased to put downe the names of the Authors, with whom let those thinges remaine. And truely the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of them do merrit faith or credite, which are fortified, or defended by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of many learned men, euen now in many ages, as also that in this fauour or benefit, very many of the Authors named of vs, and happily some of them are repeated not with any great fruite or profit, and yet are not to bee misliked. Therefore it is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee beleeued, if one matter may bee spoken in the same wordes of many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
   <p>I confesse that there are some vaine glorious things, but they are not many, (as <hi>Gillius</hi> saith in his translation of <hi>Aelianus</hi>) which we haue added or put to this worke, but they are recompenced, and amended with a great number of other graue and learned transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and as if Fathers and Grand-Fathers should delight of a Mold in the ioyntes or knuckle of their Children, that is to say, Fooles which do not weigh or valew other mens workes.</p>
   <p>As for slanderers I do not care: for those men are the best as <hi>Cato</hi> declareth, which are skilfull or experienced in true praise. Which thing if I haue not done to the full, and ample (also I vsed the same wordes which <hi>Massarius</hi> writ in his translation of Fishes) let not my study be blamed which truely is most vehement, and ardent in the same, because at this time I could do no more.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="16"/>Let the indifferent Readers iudge, how confused a matter I tooke vpon me to handle, neither did I euer thinke that I should haue brought it to so good a passe. But how much before time we haue done in helping or succoring good Arts, let others also do as much, which afterwardes haue clattered out of measure. For neither will wee beare an euill discontented mind, if they bring their helpes or labours of other skilfull men, to this exceeding great and hard labour which we haue vndertaken, and shall go beyond or excell vs.</p>
   <p>They report that <hi>Paedarotus</hi> that singular or excellent man, who when he was not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen in the number of three hundered men, which order did shew or represent dignity or estimation among the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> went away merry and laughing, and being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led backe againe of <hi>Ephorus</hi> the Historian, being demaunded why he laughed, answered: because truely I reioyced that our citty had 3. hundered Cittizens better learned then my selfe. Furthermore although I haue manifested hitherto almost al the writings of al things concerning Foure-footed-Beastes which haue come to my hands, and haue comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or compassed them in our workes or Stories: Notwithstanding for all that, I desired to haue some superfluous or vnprofitable Bookes heareafter of other things, but I neuer thought I should haue brought it passe; for it is equity and reason that all things should stand in their proper place and dignity, that all may profit which will, which thing I doe altogether desire.</p>
   <p>For somethings for antiquity sake do deserue, to be warily obserued, other some also for their Phylosophicall Method, and Method partaining to Logicke, or some matter differing from ours; othersome for eloqution, and othersome for all these causes, wherfore we haue principally obserued the Graecians, fauoring their language &amp; speech. There are some which haue published (saith <hi>Gillius</hi>) in their writings all the nature which is comprehended or contained in Foure footed-Beastes, as <hi>Aristotle, Pliny,</hi> and other auncient Writers: Moreouer the controuersie or labour of whom, I dare not say was manifestly finished or performed, although many excellent thinges were begun of them concerning foure-footed-Beasts. For truely me thinkes that such scrupelous Authors haue perfectly distinguished so many thinges of the signification and nature of Foure-footed-Beastes, that there is left no more roome in any place, for idle or negligent men to make a new discription or inuention. It is manifest also that <hi>Aristarchus</hi> and <hi>Solinus</hi> did no other thing in two and forty yeare, then marke and consider the maner and fashion of them, and so committed them to writing.</p>
   <p>It is a hard thing (as I may speake with Pliny) to offer or commit nouelty to olde or auncient things, and to giue authority to things not seene afore, and to giue credit to things decayed or growne out of vse, and to bring to light obscure or difficult thinges, and to giue reputation to thinges full of disdaine, and credit to thinges doubtfull: but to giue credit to the nature of all thinges, and all thinges belonging to their nature.</p>
   <p>Therefore I haue not desired to haue followed altogether that which is excellent and sumptuous. Truely the peculiar cause of them is in mens desires, who because they would please every one, haue esteemed or set more by painefulnesse passed ouer and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, then to help forward vtility or commodity newly found out. For what is more commendable from all the labour of learning, then to vndertake or enterprize so boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and commendable a charge, or businesse, then of renewing old and ancient things which were forgotten, or rather to restore things from Death, or ruine which were sould thereto, and to restore the names of things, and things by their names? Great fauour ought to bee giuen to those also which doe regard the common waies, and doe spread, stengthen, defend, clense, expounde, declare, pollish, or finish, make perfect, and lastly do so rule and traine them, that they may be tractable to all trauelers thereby; and to all labering beasts whatsoeuer they are, whose helpes we vse in Carts, or Waggons, and may performe and accomplish them without danger, or any impediment or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, although they cannot sustaine or beare all hinderances, yet almost the greater part of them. Neither doe they deserue little praise or commendations in learning, which haue so polished or trimmed vp some worke vndertaken for publike profit, that to the rest or remnant in the same argument, there shall be no complaint or little at all hereafter,
<pb facs="16"/>
of the difficulty thereof, which therefore if it be in my instruction, I shall be very glad, seeing that I did desire to follow it: if not, somthing that I haue performed on the great part is, that the learned men stirred vp in this businesse by vs, may not quit or absolue that which is left behind.</p>
   <p>Therefore most excellent and indifferent Reader, fauor ye this labour some, honest, pleasant, profitable, and variable worke: and giue the greatest thankes to God, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you that if you proceede any further in this mortall life because it doth not profit to bee idle, that you rather bestowe some time in the searching out of nature, and that you make a gratfull Solemnization and setting forth of Gods workes before any other things, which either labour or immoderate desire may set out to our exercises and endeuours, we may bee exercised also in holinesse and Godlinesse, and may communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and consvlt thinges requisite, with great labour and diligence to the Ages to come. Therefore in the meane time I beseech all good and painefull men, that if there be any of them which haue something to the finishing vp of this worke, to bring it, although it be of neuer so little moment, as are the shapes and formes of euery kinde of Foure-footed-Beastes, or Historyes, that is to say; whatsoeuer it is that can lead vs more amply to know the nature of them: or blaming those things in which we haue erred, which truely I which I am the man thinke there are many, yet I do not doubt but that they may wittily and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorably communicate with ours, and may as it were make famous this publique worke, being placed in the middle, which thing also is profitable and excellent to them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable to mee, and continually to all learned men heareafter. That there hath beene a partaker, or companion of this excellent worke he shall be in aduancement.</p>
   <p>If I shall be admonished of my error in few things, nay onely in one thing, I presently will correct it without enuy or mallice: or will put thereto some new matter, either to the second volume of the rest of Foure-footed-Beasts, or otherwise in the addition: And least I should seeme vngrateful to those which haue contributed or bestowed somthing to this, contrary to the loue which I should alwaies beare to them, if no other benefit shall be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to them, as our estate is but mean, yet at leastwise I will declare my mind in a frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commemoration to a number of their names in their Catalogue, by whom I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited.</p>
   <p>But if any, either through a destitute or forsaken occasion, or for any other cause or disposition, are forced to write or send somthing to vs, and also shall desire publiquely to correct some of our errors which we haue committed, which I know many can do graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and also learnedly, and I desire that they may doe it, &amp; entreat of them that they write learnedly and modestly, and to do it so, that the common wealth pertaining to learning, may rather aduance and premote him, then either to wrong his credit or renowne, or any cause of blaming or rebuking vs, as it becommeth men of courage, truely to see into it. I am alwaies ready to amend my own, from any iust correction or blame, but not depriue any man of his owne praise. For I hope (without offence be it spoken here) that this our labour or paines shall remaine to the worlds end, not through the merrit or desert of our learninge, (which is but small) but through our diligence, which hath ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together most diligently and exactly, so many and great labours and stories, from a number of Authors, as it were into one treasury or Store-house.</p>
   <closer>Farewell</closer>
