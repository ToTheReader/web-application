      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hilst we studie to be thankful in our particular, for the many fauors we haue receiued from your L.L we are falne vpon the ill fortune, to mingle two the most diuerse things that can bee, feare, and rashnesse; rashnesse in the enterprize, and feare of the successe. For, when we valew the places your H.H. sustaine, we cannot but know their dignity greater, then to descend to the reading of these trifles: and, vvhile we name them trifles, we haue depriu'd our selues of the defence of our Dedication. But since your L.L. haue beene pleas'd to thinke these trifles some-thing, heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and haue prosequuted both them, and their Authour liuing, vvith so much fauour: we hope, that (they out-liuing him, and he not hauing the fate, common with some, to be exequutor to his owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings) you will vse the like indulgence toward them, you haue done
<pb facs="6"/>
vnto their parent. There is a great difference, vvhether any Booke choose his Patrones, or finde them: This hath done both. For, so much were your L L. likings of the seuerall parts, vvhen they were acted as before they vvere published, the Volume ask'd to be yours. We haue but collected them, and done an office to the dead, to procure his Orphanes, Guardians; vvithout ambition ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of selfe-profit, or fame: onely to keepe the memory of so worthy a Friend, &amp; Fellow aliue, as was our <hi>SHAKESPEARE,</hi> by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offer of his playes, to your most noble patronage. Wherein, as we haue iustly obserued, no man to come neere your L.L. but vvith a kind of religious addresse; it hath bin the height of our care, vvho are the Presenters, to make the present worthy of your H.H. by the perfection. But, there we must also craue our abilities to be considerd, my Lords. We cannot go beyond our owne powers. Country hands reach foorth milke, creame, fruites, or what they haue: and many Nations (we haue heard) that had not gummes &amp; incense, obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their requests with a leauened Cake. It vvas no fault to approch their Gods, by what meanes they could: And the most, though meanest, of things are made more precious, when they are dedicated to Temples. In that name therefore, we most humbly consecrate to your H.H. these remaines of your seruant <hi>Shakespeare</hi>; that what delight is in them, may be euer your L.L. the reputation his, &amp; the faults ours, if any be committed, by a payre so carefull to shew their gratitude both to the liuing, and the dead, as is</p>
