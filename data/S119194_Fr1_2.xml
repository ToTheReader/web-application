some ten Weekes since, I Dedicated to your noble Patronage concerning our Foster Mother <hi>LONDON,</hi> enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>London Sicke at Heart,</hi> or, <hi>A Caueat for Run-awayes,</hi> hath much encouraged me to spend some of my best bestowed houres, in another kinde and Garbe of writing, yet to purpose and according as these dayes and times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: And my desires are, that I may shrowde these my Labours vnder the Banner of your protection, against all opposition. Be you therefore pleased (my Noble Martiall Patrons) to vayle me vnder the covert of your neuer vanquisht Ensigne, and then no other Colours shall daunt me.

I beseech you noble fellow Souldiers, to deigne them Courtesie, and kinde entertaynment; and let them know, that although they contemned and despised the very Name of one of vs, and would not vouchsafe so much as to looke vpon a <hi>Londoner</hi>: yet for Charities sake, doe you bid them Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.

Pardon me (braue Souldiers) if I answer for you; for I know the nature of a true Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, is to be pitifull and to shew mercy, where imbesilitie and weaknesse resteth. Therefore (noble Souldiers) you that
