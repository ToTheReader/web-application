   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVL S<seg rend="sup">r</seg> CONIER CLIFFORD KNIGHT. health and felicitie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>LYSSES (Right worshipfull) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing spent some time in the Court of Aeolus, where he was friendly entertained, desired at length to be dismissed: his sute was granted, and he sent away in Princely man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with all the windes tied vp in a bottle, to be commaunded as he thought best. He was not past a dayes iourney or two from the shore, but he went to wracke tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the misdealing of those, to
<pb facs="3"/> whose safe conduct he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himselfe, and by the winds was driuen backe againe to the coast of Aeolia. His weather bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten men, and himselfe being refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed as time &amp; place then serued, he set forward to Aeolus his Court, hoping to find such entertainment as he found before. Not daring so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly to enter in, he rested him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe at the Porter his lodge, where he heard these words:
<q>
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</q>
   </p>
   <p>It may be they moued his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a little, because they touched his former estate, yet hauing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conceite of others in that place he let them passe, and preased for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the presence of the King, sitting not farre off with his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie about him, to whom he spake
<pb facs="3"/> thus in humble manner:</p>
   <p>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. And that his request might the better preuaile, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his reason, (For it is not likely though his estate were bad, that he would craue any thing more then reason.) <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. But he was so farre off from finding his expected reliefe, that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to get him thence with these hot wordes to his cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</p>
   <q>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>.</q>
   <p>Such as Vlysses his departure was from the Iland Aeolia, such was mine from London Northward; such as his entertainement was at his returne, such was mine cōming thither againe. For miscarying in that voyage besides mine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="4"/> (I would say my desert were it not presumption) I found that of Horace to be true:</p>
   <q>
      <l>—<hi>Diffugiunt cadis,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Cum faece siccatis amici,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>
         <hi>Ferre iugum pariter dolosi.</hi>
      </l>
   </q>
   <p>Some said they could not, some durst not for feare, and some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered they would not helpe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire that losse, which the vnkind Northerne blast had inforced me to. VVhat should I do, or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing could I doe in this case, but that which Vlysses had donne before? <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. I suffered all, and bare it out, not lying still as a man carelesse, but knowing mine head and handes (vnder God) to be my best friends, I set them to their old occupation againe, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Mathematicall arts, and penning, or translating such books as I thought most conuenient for
<pb facs="4"/> that purpose, of the which this booke is some little part. And for so much (Right worshipfull) as I intended therein not onely your pleasure, but your profit especially among the rest, I am bold to make that intent knowne in dedicating it vnto your VVorship, &amp; crauing your fauorable acceptance therof, which if it please you to afford, you shall inuite me to a farther worke, and bind me not to be vnthankfull for your friendly fauour.</p>
