      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the great subscription vrged from the Pastors and ministers of the worde and Sacramentes in a great part of this land the last yeare, yee can not lightlie be ignorant. The causes of the same being either secrete, I cannot: or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to be published, I may not set downe. What the euent thereof wil be, God he knoweth: what it hath beene, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diuersitie of mans minde, diuerslie do men thinke thereof. For some are of opinion that much hurt thereby hath redounded to the Church of God, and they think not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse in diuers considerations: others, (again) wiselie do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that it hath made not a little vnto the glorie of God, and comfort of his seruants, as whereby a ful and perfect trial of men is had, &amp; diuers of the godlie notablie be deliuered from the manifold slanders, &amp; wicked surmises falslie raised of them through the secret, and subtil suggestions of Satan, and his members.</p>
   <p>For, to speake first of her Maiesties authoritie in causes Ecclesiastical, (and that to offend none of Gods children, but to the consolation of manie) of al that haue bine examined, what one hath denied the same? who but most willingly, and cheerefully doeth ascribe so much as the lawes of this land in euerie respect do giue vnto her highnes? Who but hath offered, as to subscribe, so to sweare vnto that article? Who but would suffer the losse, not of goods onely, but of life also, for the maintenance of the same?</p>
   <p>And although the Papistes do write, that to grant this vnto her maiestie, <hi>is lothsome and base flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie</hi>

   <p>As for the supremacie chalenged by the Pope, whom (as heretofore, so dailie, but most sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiouslie) theie cal <hi>The general pastor</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">Answer to the Execut. of Iustice c. 6. p. 131.</note>, yea, <hi>The common Father of al Christians, specialie of princes</hi>

   <p>And, to come vnto another Article concerning the booke of common praier, not one, that I know, hath refused simplie to subscribe vnto that neither. Though some denie not onlie that that forme, but that anie forme of publique, &amp; ordinarie praier is to be vsed in the Church, and think <hi>it papistical,</hi> and giue out that <hi>it doth but mocke the Lorde, and the Lorde loatheth, and spueth it out of his mouth</hi>

assertion? And the auctors too, who are theie? Not nightbirds? Not light hedded, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue persons? Not our professed and knowen enimies?</p>
   <p>It maie not be denied, but some do with-hold their pens from approuing that holie booke in euerie point by subscription: yet are there none, I trust, that proudlie contemne it, none that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfulie despise it, none but in the feare of God, and in pub. Churches alwaies, and onely doe vse it, and manie haue set their hands there-unto, and al, I doubt not but so would, were that which is offensiue, reformed; and that which is crooked, made streight; and that which is doubtful, made euident and plaine. Which things also are for number but verie fewe, and, therefore maie the more easilie be remoued: and remaine, for the most part, in the directions and rubricks, and therefore with lesse offence may be taken awaie.</p>
   <p>Neither doth anie minister of the word, that I heare, denie by subscription to allow the booke concerning the Articles, &amp; summe of our faith, but what lawes do exact, or enioine most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie haue theie offered to performe. And no cause is there whie we should not so doe: the auctors of the same do moue; the soueraigne authoritie, whereby it was established, and is vpholden, doth moue; but the necessarie, and al Christian doctrine there-in comprised, doth most of al moue vs, not onlie in heart to like thereof, but with mouth also, and euerie waie to praise it, and to glorifie the goodnes of God for the same. Our fore-fathers manie of them desired to see that, though it were but secretlie, and to the hazarding of their lands, goods, and liues, which in that booke we openlie and publiquelie to our vnspeakable comfort, and profit do see maintained.</p>
   <p>Besides, it is the badge of Eng. Christians whereby we are knowen to the vniuersal worlde not onlie to agree with al the godlie that haue bine or do liue at this present in the material points of religion: but also to disagree from the Iewes, Turks, Papists, Anabaptists, and al other prophane men. So that theie, or he which shal with-drawe his hand from allowing the same, maie vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentlie be suspected to be a contemner of the sacred auctoritie of this noble realme, and of the doctrine of Christ; a dissenter not onlie from al the godlie in this land, and therfore not worthie to liue among vs: but also from the true Christians who both haue liued heretofore, and remaine in anie reformed Church at this present time; and a fauorer either of the Iewish, or Turkish, or Popish, or Anabaptistical, or some vngodlie, and cursed opinion, or other.</p>
   <p>Theis things (one of the weakest of my brethren knowne I confesse, yet through confidence in our chiefe captaine Iesus Christ, whose al power is <note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 28, 18.</note>) I haue vndertaken to proue in two books or treatises: the former wherof is now before you, the other in good time, if so it please God, shal come abroad, In which aduisedlie looke, and yee shal perceiue, that the Religion established by the auctoritie, and professed of al degrees in this land, is neither a false religion, as the Papists do thinke, stil tearming it (how like Christians iudge yee) <hi>vngrateful haeresie</hi>

   <p>Besides, forsomuch as the Papists do not onlie thinke, but also giue-out, that we are at ferce contention among our selues, let them aduisedlie consider, either howe al the Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Europe do subscribe vnto our Articles, or we vnto their confessions, and then tel what our dissension is. It maie be they wil saie, al reformed Churches subscribe not to euerie of our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. But manie do, and none denie, I saie not anie of our Articles, but not anie one Thesis, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of anie Article common to al Christians. I grant some confessions be larger than other some are, and conteine more matter of Christianitie than others do: yet are theie not contrarie, no more than Athanasius Creed is contrarie to the Apostles, because it is larger; nor the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge is contrarie to the moral Lawe, because it is the summe of it; nor the Commandements, <hi>Loue God aboue al, and thie neighbor as thie selfe,</hi> are contrarie to the Decaloge, because theie are the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of that also. Occasions maie fal out that we maie be briefe, &amp; vpon occasion we maie vse mo words as errors be suppressed, or do spring vp. And it is to be wished, that as new errors peep out, so frō time to time new Articles by auctoritie were published, thereby to make it euident vnto the whole world both howe hurtfull theie be to the Church of Christ, and how we condemne them.</p>
   <p>Nowe, as the Papists cannot in truth saie, that we dissent from the godlie Christians liuing in other parts of the world: so maie theie not tel vs so odiouslie of diuision among our selues at home. For we, al of vs, allowe her Maiesties auctoritie in causes Eccles. and ciuil; we, al of vs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther simplie subscribe vnto the forme of pub. praier prescribed, or humblie (which libertie the lawe giueth) desire resolution in some fewe things; we, al of vs, iointlie both embrace the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the English Creed, and renounce al haeretical opinions contrarie there-unto; we, al of vs acknowledge the good things that we do enioie, and that the Church would florish much better, if that good lawes alreadie made were faithfulie put in execution, and the true discipline of Christ so greatlie, and so long wished <note n="q" place="margin">Booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon praier Tit.

And in this respect we maie tearme it an happie trial, that euen al the Papists maie learne how to credite them in things not so apparent, when they wil not blush to giue-out which in their conscience they knowe is vntrue. For, God be thanked, not the lesser parte, but euen al the Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Church, especialie which haue▪ bine tried, are on our side, and not on the Papistes, or else they dissemble so cursedly as no true Christian would to gaine the whole worlde.

For holding her Maiestie immediatly after Christ in her dominions ouer al persons the chiefe gouernour; the ordinarie seruice for a religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God; the Articles of our religion for the verie groundes of Christianitie, where-upon we must build or perish, what shal deterre vs from louing one another with a moste firme and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian loue? Shal pettie and trifling thinges of no waight, or of smal importance? yea, or anie thing else that can be conceiued in heart, or expressed by mouth or penne? God forbid. And in this holie vnitie we shal the more firmelie be rooted, doe wee turne our eies from beholding one another, and consider the vnquenchable malice of our capital enimies against vs, and the cause of the same. From the abundance of their malice, they cal the holie Ministers of Christ <hi>raskals</hi>

And theis infamous, yea blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous titles, theie attribute not vnto a fewe, but vnto al, euen from the poorest, and moste obscure Curate in the countrie, to the highest Praelate in the Palace. Nowe if thus they thinke, and write of vs in the time of their trial, what wil theie not tearme vs, if theie shoulde haue their wils? And theie which haue so litle respect of persons, and of gifts nowe, wil haue much lesse then. And the cause is neither for the Seruice which we haue in our Temples, which diuers Popes haue offered to tollerate euen as it nowe is without alteration (theie would neuer so do, we must think, were it either <hi>Schismatical, haeretical, or abominable,</hi> as our English of al the vainest Papistes do saie) nor for the diuersitie of our ceremonies, it is for our Faith, which is contrarie to theirs, and for their Supremacie, which we denie: yea, <hi>theie can beare al,</hi> themselues do saie <note n="z" place="margin">Answer to the Execut. of Iustice c. 7, p. 155.</note>, <hi>and turne all to good, so long as the true Faith, and substance of Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction be not destroyed:</hi> but seeing wee haue and do both oppugne the faith, and ouerthrowe the gouernement of the Church of Rome, therfore the vilest wordes that Satan, their spiritual father, can put into their hearts, be in most poisonful manner vomited forth to hurt vs.</p>
   <p>This being so, howe ought we to loue and make of one another, who are thus hated, and by reuilings persecuted, and that for one and the same cause at this present. If that daie which theie so long-for should, as either that or some other affliction in this world for our vnthankfulnesse, or a more intollerable at the general iudgement, which is neere at hand, shal come, it will not be to our griefe that we haue beleeued, preached, and professed the trueth which the Church of England at this daie doth hold, but that we haue not liued there-after, we shal repent; and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the Gospel of peace, haue yet bine contentious, we shal repent; and being seruants to one and the same Lord and master, haue not onlie railed vpon, but also beaten and pursued one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

we shal repent; and, being watchmen, haue not bine more vigilant and resident in our pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we shal repent; our negligence, our coldnesse, we shal repent; &amp; if we haue either kept-out of the Lord his vine-yard, such as both for abilitie could, and for their zeale would, either implant this faith in the ignorant, or confirme it in the learned; or to the certaine destruction of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and many others depending vpon them, either brought or kept in the idle, and idol shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, that shal we repent also, and that with teares.</p>
