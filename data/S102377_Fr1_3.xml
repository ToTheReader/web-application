   <head>The Preface to the
Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church is compared to
a Vineyard, God is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of it, his Ministers are
his Labourers, his people
his vines. Our great Maister God, giueth
his entertainement to none but labourers:
yet in this Vineyard are both loyterers and
lookers on. The true Labourers are they
who in that sacred profession faithfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
their best diligence. And these bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
ones shall receyue from God, this happy
sentence:</hi> It is well done, good &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
seruants,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 21, 23.</note> yee haue been faithfull in
little, I will make you rulers ouer much:
enter yee into your Maisters ioy.</p>
   <p>The loyterers are halfe labourers. These
are like the Scribes and Pharisees, that <hi>sitte
in</hi> Moses <hi>seate,</hi> but walke not in his stepps.
<pb facs="5"/>
And <hi>their voice is</hi> Iacobs,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 22</note>
      <hi>but their hāds
are</hi> Esaues: their words are holy, but their
workes are prophane, they can deliuer the
doctrines of the Gospell, but not liue in the
duties of the law. And to these will God
be terrible in the day of tryall, &amp; tell them
that though they haue cast out Diuels, and
done wonders in his name; yet he wil deny
them for his,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 22. 23.</note> &amp; bid them <hi>depart</hi> (because)
<hi>they are workers of iniquity.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The lookers on are of two sorts, they are
either <hi>nolentes,</hi> or <hi>non valentes.</hi> The
first sort are such as can, but will not labor
in their spirituall office; these are they that
loue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ase, and fat themselues with prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and then (like <hi>Acsops hen</hi>) they are
so fat they cannot lay, and like that rich
foole in the Gospel, that said vnto his soule,
<hi>Soule,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 19.</note>
      <hi>thou hast much goods layd vp
for many yeers, liue at ease, eate, drink,
and take thy pastime.</hi> But God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
such folly, and tell them that their life
is but a dayes length. <hi>For at night their
soules shal be taken from them,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Verse 20.</note>
      <hi>&amp; then
whose shall all those thinges bee that
they haue prouided?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The last and least worthy in Gods vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
<pb facs="5"/>
are such as neyther will nor can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the dutyes of their place. These idle
Priestes, are like Idoll Gods t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>at represent
those things which (indeed) they are not.
And to these will Christ say, as in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of the marriage:<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 12</note>
      <hi>Friends how came
yee in hither, which haue no wedding
garment?</hi> And doubtlesse it cannot but
bee a very desperate presumption to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
this charge without some conuenient
proportion of sufficiency. Now if any man
aske mee how came these thinges thus to
passe? I will answere with the Gospell. <hi>The
enuious man hath done this.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 28.</note> The Diuel
that wretch enuying the prosperity of the
Gospell,<note place="margin">Verse 30.</note> hath sowne his tares among Gods
wheate, which must grow vp together, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the day of the generall haruest.</p>
   <p>By this little of muc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, mayest thou vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
(Christian Reader) in what fashion
the world is now suted: the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, turning their eyes of care from
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> to looke to things of
this world, with affectation. But bee thou
perswaded, that whatsoeuer he bee, of what
estate, degree, or condition soeuer, that doth
not respect God, and the common cause of
<pb facs="6"/>
religion, more then his owne priuate, hee
may happly haue the name of a Christian,
but doubtlesse, he hath the mark of a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and God will both despise and iudge
him in the generall day. For in this case are
men disposed as <hi>Iobs</hi> cattell were: <hi>His
Oxen were plowing,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iob. 1. 14</note>
      <hi>and his Asses fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
So the better sort of men do euer tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
the common cause, but the worse their
owne particular onely, and therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a worse comparison then <hi>Iobs</hi> asses.
This knowledge haue I thought fitte to giue
thee by way of admonition, that thou mayest
pitty the common cause, and bee zealously
affected in thy self with a desire of thy own
reformation. God succeede thee in all thy
works of holines, and may it be his pleasure
that these poore labours of mine may bee
some cause of thy reducing. </p>
   <closer>Amen.</closer>
