      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S <hi>Seneca</hi> shamed not to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cite the worthy saying of the Poete <hi>Hesiodus,</hi> so I doubt not, but I may also (from so susscient authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as by <hi>Seneca</hi> him selfe in a certaine Epistle by him alleaged) partly seeme to ouerthrowe that most horrible monster Ingratitude, and thoroughly to displace so vnnaturall affection before he shall by entertainment in so simple an one as I, (not able to be thankful) cause any part of obliuion for the benefites that haue bene towards me in any part extended: For (as I remember) he sayth: <hi>Nullum efficium magis quàm referenda gratia, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarium,</hi> that no duetie is more necessary
<pb facs="4"/>
than rēdred thanks to those y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> haue mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred such ample benefits as some haue bestowed: and to render thankes (sayth he) with greater mesure than they vsed to receyue commodities. For as <hi>Cicero</hi> sayth <hi>Lib. 1. de officijs,</hi> If rendred thanks be due to suche of whome we hope to be benefited, howe muche more then is due to those by whom we haue had already profit? Which albeit that I of my self in euery point am moste vnable to do, yet good will of ouermeasuring (if possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were in me) shall not seeme vtterly to be absent, neither thinking that I can or am able to make any shewe of remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and for that my insufficiencie is such as it is, it might seme on my part but presumption to attribute any suche worthinesse vnto him, that is altogether voyde of desiring any such preeminence. Yet among diuerse and sundry practises that by my poore industrie I haue attēp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, consideryng that commoditie and frendly aide that your worship hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by your laborous trauaile toward that company, of which I am a mēber:
<pb facs="5"/>
and then waying my greate vnabilitie to requite in any way the least parte of your manyfold curtesies, I was dismay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to represent in this place any part of them, least I should séeme of the wise too gréede of cōmendation. But being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened with your fauourable beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and accustomed courteous lenitie imployed towards al men: and making bolde of your woonted good will, that is, (and euer hath bene) ready to accepte a simple thing proffered and fréely giuen, rather than to reiect &amp; cast off that which is meerely grounded of poore simplicitie, after I had perused the rable of my poore labours, founde among them this one, which then I was encoraged to dedicate vnto your gentlenesse, not for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse therof as concerning my labor, but cōsidering your worships minde of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tymes with serious matters to bée encombred both in carefulnesse toward the weale publike according to your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as also for the benefits of such poore men as I. Some thing therefore after your earnest businesse, to reuiue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
<pb facs="5"/>
your wearied minde with honest lerned and profitable mirth, I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to offer this my little labour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your learned eares, it being the first fruites of an vnproined orcharde, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng wherof, notwithstanding the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauerie sappe of sundry water boughes) may appeare both learned and fruitfull matter. And therfore I chiefly tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to translate the same oute of the french tong, as earst it was, for the like pleasure and pithinesse cause turned frō out of Latin into French, in which tong it was first (by a righte learned and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous man) written and inuented. In which deuise is contained a most perfect shew of horrible and bitter contentions in the most fertile region and countrey of <hi>Grammer,</hi> by variance that grew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte two high and mightie Princes, possessors of the same, the <hi>Noune</hi> and the <hi>Verbe. <hi>Nomen,</hi>
      </hi> with his Substantiues, and Adiectiues, Cōmons and Propers: with also the nobles of the house of mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culines, with the worthinesse of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie of Feminines, Neutres, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulles,
<pb facs="6"/>
and Epicines, the Heteroclites, with their noble Capitaines, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, the Defectiues, and Redundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, with his moste mighty brother the <hi>Pronoune,</hi> and his sworne stoute warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors the Gentiles. Agayne <hi>Verbum</hi> with his nobles, with the Participles, Modes and Tenses, with Gerundes &amp; Supins, in the great fielde of Coniunctions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending where they met for superiority in gouernement. Wherin although but spoke <hi>Allegoricè,</hi> or rather written by the figure <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> sheweth in part the troubles of a fained Common weale by intestine and Ciuile contention sprong vp in the same. With such pleasant <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphosis</hi> and ardēt Allegories the aū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poets vsed to beautifie their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, as <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> who vsed suche co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert fable against <hi>Philip,</hi> that required ten of the <hi>Athenienses</hi> Oratours) saying how the Wolfe persuaded and besought the Shephierdes to tie vp their Doggs, and so to ioyned with them in friendship. Which when the Shephierds had graū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Wolfe then as it were with a
<pb facs="6"/>
couered &amp; licensed crafty crueltie spoiled their flocks. So wrote <hi>Esope, Horace,</hi> &amp; diuers other, which although but in part as Fables, (as this after a sort is) is yet in some respect duly to be noted, as <hi>Saint Ambrose</hi> affirmeth, saying: <hi>Ei si fabula vim veritatis non habeat, tamenrationē ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, vt iuxta eam veritas manifestari possit:</hi> that is: Allthough a fable haue not the strength of the truth, yet hath it a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that by it the truth may be vttered. Such was the maner of philosophers, as <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> sayth, to allure mens min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to the vnderstanding of the trueth, which thing now as it is but fained, yet knowyng it to be deuised of so learned a man at the first, thought with my selfe, that those whiche had capacitie mighte reape some fruite of his trauellous toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. And agayne, supposing that if the same wer englished, some might the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slier gather the sense of the first author. Therfore as the Trāslater therof out of Latine did for the recreation of a noble personage labor in the same, so I for the pleasant profite of sundry of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
<pb facs="7"/>
men, so duely as I coulde after my president, turned it into Englishe. And therfore as first and chiefest (it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the first of my labours) I exhibite it to youre worship, not as a gifte (for any part of my deseruing) worthie to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: but by way of duetie offered, of mere good will, making you the patron of this my first enterprised attēpt: choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing rather to suffer the reproche of the wise and the curious carping checke of <hi>Momus</hi> and his mates, with the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious taunt of priuie parasites, than to séeme altogether obliuious of my dutie, and so be accompted ingratefull. Which poore and slender thing if it please your worship to receyue wyth a friendly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect at my simple handes: your fauora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble encouragement shall hereafter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me to finishe some greater effect to the benefite of my Countreymen (I meane such as are desirous to employe their labour in reading:) And in especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to manifest Gods doing in me, whō in the meane season I beséech to conduct and guide youre goodnesse forth in that
<pb facs="7"/>
well doing that he hath alreadie begon in you (in the suppression of godlesse ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, the very nourice of noughtinesse: the sufferance of which are the decay of Common wealthes, the corruption of youth, the breach of brotherhead and all true dealyng.) I ceasse to speake of such singularitie as all men shall sée ensue of your dayly endeuours, and of that due commendation that may be sayd of your Princely practise, that maynteyner of honest exercise: whereof right worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your worship is maister, being a most perfect president in that practise (I mean of that laudable auncient and noble sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Shooting in the Long bowe) for euery one to folowe in effect. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary vse wherof, howe néedefull it is to be looked to, howe beneficiall the vse thereof hath bene to this our countrey, how daungerous the neglecting thereof is, and howe hurtfull the lacke of vsyng the same of our youth in <hi>Englande</hi> hath bene, is too apparaunt. The almightie ease vs, whome I beséeche so to endue you with present consolation hoped for
<pb facs="8"/>
in Christe, in thys lyfe your dayes may be long: And that after this lyfe, youre lotte (as <hi>Dauid</hi> sayeth) may fal in a good groūd that is, in Lyfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting. Amen.</p>
