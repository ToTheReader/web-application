   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT WORSHIPFVLL,</hi> I stood obliged to the <hi>Stock</hi> you both sprang from, before I was able to apprehend what such obligation meant. Your worthy <hi>Mother</hi> was one of those that presented me to the <hi>sacred Laver,</hi> and that undertooke there in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. Shee answered there for me,<note n="*" place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap> Priusquam respondere possem: uti Iunius ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit. Psalm. <hi>119.67.</hi>
      </note> when I could not answer for my selfe; and did further also then seale up her free affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to me with a reall testimonie of her Love. Neither did her kindnesse towards me then and there expire; but as it was oft renewed in her life time, when occasion thereof was offered, so it ceased not untill her selfe deceased. Shee performed one of the <hi>first religious Offices</hi> for mee soone after <hi>my birth:</hi> and it was one of her <hi>last Pious works</hi> to remember me, among others whom she had performed the like <hi>Office</hi> for, at the time of <hi>her decease.</hi> Some <hi>monument</hi> of my thankfull acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
<pb n="256" facs="133"/> hereof being desirous to have extant, whom should I addresse it unto rather than your selves; the only two <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals</hi> now left of that <hi>Family?</hi> Being therefore moved to make publike two of my weake <hi>Discourses,</hi> containing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of two portions of <hi>Scripture,</hi> of some neare relation the one to the other; the one of them relating a memorable <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of the <hi>performance</hi> of that that is <hi>promised</hi> in the other, to wit, <hi>of Gods blessing</hi> of those with <hi>temporall</hi> things, that are carefull to looke after the <hi>spirituall:</hi> This of the twaine I chose the rather to present your <hi>Worships</hi>
      <note place="margin">The Worshipfull Companie of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdashers.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; partly, because at the motion of the one of you, being then <hi>Head</hi> of that <hi>worthy Societie,</hi> which I acknowledge my selfe also <hi>a debtour</hi> unto, it was by word of mouth at first delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and partly also, that it may helpe (for the best also, even<note n="*" place="margin">

The <hi>Worke</hi> indeed is growne much larger, than at first was delivered, by reason that a <hi>Question</hi> betweene us and the <hi>Romanists,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Mans merit,</hi> is therein now discussed, which was then but touched upon and pointed at onely; neither the streights of <hi>time</hi> admitting over-long <hi>discourse</hi> then, nor such matter of <hi>controversie</hi> so well befitting the <hi>occasion</hi> that then was. The rest, without any <hi>materiall alteration</hi> or <hi>addition,</hi> is the same for <hi>substance</hi> that then it was. Which recommending en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, as now it is, to your <hi>Worships,</hi> together with my <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Christian service</hi> to you both, and mine heartie <hi>Prayers</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for the <hi>well-fare, spirituall</hi> especially, of you and yours, with the rest of the <hi>Branches</hi> of that <hi>Family,</hi> wheresoever now transplanted, I take leave of you for the present, and rest</p>
