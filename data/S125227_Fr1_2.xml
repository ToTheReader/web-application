      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Od the auctour of all goodnes (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) hath diuerslie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed his manifolde gyftes on sondrie men: whearby, as in ending any great or effectuall enterprize many are called, some for learning sake, some for knowledge, sonne for experience, and some for strēgth to supporte y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> brunt of the chardge: which all tende to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ende, but to conclude the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with good effect. Euen so our sauiour Christ to saue man, (which is di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerslie bent to go astraye) hath sent fourth his seuerall instrumentes sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie wies to call him. Principallie by that inestimable Iuell his infallible worde, and the wourthye learned preachers of the same, nowe florishing? (God be praysed therfore.) Otherwies by men of knowledge, seen in the liberall Sciences,
<pb facs="3"/> and so couertlie correcting vice by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized sentences verie expediēt. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wies by some that hath through follie fallen into daungers, and by hys infinite mercy (their madnes perceiued) retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned▪ which do from their owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tell to fraile youth such daūgerous successe in their fonde attēptes: as some thearby: are perswaded, and leaue their precogitate purpozes. And otherwies by those that will boldlie begyn, foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie followe, and vnaduisedlie accomplish their intended enterprise: And thearby make them selues, through vntymelye Death or other myschiefe: terrible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to the rest. And all alludeth none other thing, but by persuasion, terrour or exāple, to knit y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> body of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church of god to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worthie bed therof, our sauiour Christ. I am no deuine: I wolde to God I were. To take vppon me the name of learned: I dare not. Of experience: age will not let me speake. But the tragical
<pb facs="3"/> history following, may wourke a terrour to all youth: rashlie and of themselfes tat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tēpt any thing. Note (louing frend) the matter succeding is of two English lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, both yonge, of lynage lyke substaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ynough, maried by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> parentes cōsent of equall troth in keping the honourable bedde of matrìmony vndefiled, what shold I saie? both vertuous &amp; louing: and yet their doinges not prospering. I must think good Reader, but I leaue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he was offended, bycause they both at first sight, rashly, vnaduised<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lie, vnknowen, and without frendes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, durst thrall themselues in the desire of vncleane lust (but I must terme it cleanelie, Cupides flama) and did not cal vppō God, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> metenes of the matche, nor saught parentes consent, till (had the same been neuer so vnmete) they must haue graūted. Or ells y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> loue grown from follie, and thought from loue, wold haue wrought the louers endes. If thou be a
<pb facs="4"/> parent, that reades this same, looke vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelantlie to thie fraile childe, least thear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by thou wourke thine owne sorrowe as in the ende of this historie. If thou be a childe, of what age soeuer thou be, thie Parentes or Guerdians lyuing, reade ouer the same, and think thine intent can be none bonester, then theirs that mynded chast wedlocke, thine entraunce no better, then by frendes con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent, thie succession no better thē to win honour in the defence of thie prince and contrie: but thy ende may be better, then accused for treasō, faltes, to receiue thie mortall wounde, or die, as he or she did. well, thinke that the falt was comytted at first because without the feare of god and frendes corsentes craued in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynning, they durst loue, and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfes contract maryage. And so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie, as the falt at firste was don: the punishmēt at last was wrought by hym that leaueth nothing vnpunished
<pb facs="4"/> which is not repēted. Beware the like. I haue promised to set at large, a thing of more effect, and greater moment: which shall not long be behinde. But this haue I begoon wyth, as with an instrument to whet my knyfe, to cut my pen cleane to cause it to wright the more pleasaūt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, playnelie, and profitablie to the. Accept my good will, and staie thie iudgemēt til thou knowe myne intent, and deeme the best till then.</p>
