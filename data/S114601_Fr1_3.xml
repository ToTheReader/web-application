                 <title>Ten sermons tending chiefely to the fitting of men for the worthy receiuing of the Lords Supper : VVherein amongst many other holy instructions: the doctrines of sound repentance and humiliation, and of Gods speciall fauours vnto penitent sinners, and worthy communicants ar largely and effectually handled. The six first, by I. Dod. The foure last, by R. Cleauer. Whereunto is annexed, a plaine and learned metaphrase on the epistle to the Collossians, written by a godly and iudicious preacher. There is also set before the sermons, a short dialogue of preparation: containing the chiefe points that concerne the worthy receiuing of the Lords Supper, taken for the most part, out of the sermons following: and collected into a method for the benefit and ease of those that desire direction in this matter</title>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>OOke not (good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to find in these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons an absolute dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of this subiect of preparation to the Sacrament: for that was not intended by the authors, but onely the excitement of their present auditors, as they saw occasion: whereby yet I doubt not but a Christian heart shall finde great furtherance in that worke of preparation.</p>
   <p>Furthermore let it please the Reader to bee aduertised, that the texts handled in this booke haue neither so many doctrines gathered from them, as the authors could haue done, nor so many vses enforced vpon the doctrines, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie such as were thought most meete for their present auditorie.</p>
   <p>In this which I haue done, I had as the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
<pb facs="5"/>so also the helpe of those that preached these Sermons following, for the reuising and perfecting of diuers things: yet so as their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure could afford and therefore what defects soeuer shall be found in the maner of penning, let them bee imputed to mee (if the Printer bee not faultie) not vnto them, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to put a finger, but not their whole hand to this worke.</p>
