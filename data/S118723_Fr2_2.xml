   <p>COurteous Reader, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute not unto my rashnes either the Title or Subject of this Booke, as if I undertooke to give instruction to those, from whom I ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the same: I had not writ it at first, but in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of my deare brethren, the Elders of the Church, unto the guiding of whom God hath called me: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the said Church being composed of many quarters, and it not being possible for me to be with them all, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie required, that they often
<pb n="274" facs="146"/> supplie my absence in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation of the sicke, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they required my assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance by this small Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, my purpose was to cause some few copies to bee printed to put into their hands, and by that meanes to give them that assistance with more ease, and with more conveniencie. But when it was further alleaged unto me, it might serve also for the use of others, either in regard of their obligation therunto, by the same charge, or for that they were so moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of their Christian zeale, imployed themselves in that pious and charitable dutie of visiting and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="275" facs="146"/> the sicke. And that moreover and besides the reason hereof would not bee unprofitable to any of the faithfull in particular, who even in his best health should ever prepare himselfe for sicknesse and death: I yeelded to make it publique with this word of informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I suppose will arme thy ingenuitie to acquit me of all blame. I doubt not but thou wilt excuse the plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the stile; having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect both to the nature of the subject, &amp; withal unto whom and for whom it was directed As for them that shall think good to make use of it, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to beare with the
<pb n="276" facs="147"/> length of it: Which I could not well avoid, as I desired, in a subject so fertile, and so hard to be contracted. This remedie there is for it, that this writing being composed of many disjointed parcels, and accomodated to the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry dispositions of the sicke, they may be contented to cull out of them sometimes one, sometimes another, as they shall be adjudged more for their purpose, according to the circumstances of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons they visit.</p>
