successe of your valeaunt enterprise: Neither hath this your loyall seruice to your Prince and Countrey at any time been vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, without a feruent and zealous affection towardes the Almighty, the cheefest and only beauty of all mans actions. Since thus (as I said) you may iustly chalenge for the good seruice you haue done in your youth, a place and time of rest and quietnesse in your greater yeeres, and that there is, in my fancie, no life so qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, so acceptable to God, and pleasant to an honest mind, as is the life of the Countrey, where a man, withdrawing him selfe from the miserable miseries, vanities, and vexations of this foolish and nowe tòtoo much doting world, may geue him selfe to the sweete comtemplation of God, and his woorkes, and the profite and reliefe of his poore distressed neighbour, to which two thinges we were chiefely created. I thought it good to send you here (as a token and testimony of my thankfull minde, for your sundry freend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippes and curtesies shewed vnto me) a rude draught of the order and maner of the saide Countrey lyfe, which you may vse (yf it please you) for your recreation: and afterwards (if so you thinke it meete) publish vnder your protection, to the commoditie and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of others. Fare you well in great haste, from Kingstone, the fyrst of Februarie. <hi>1577.</hi>
