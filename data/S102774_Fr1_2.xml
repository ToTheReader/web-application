   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HERE as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed your Honor to requyre a copy of my Sermon which I preached last in your Honors hearing, so far as my memory would serue me to repeate it: I thought it my dutie to satisfie your godly desire. Not that I count it worthye of longer remembraunce, in respect of any great skyl or diligence of myne shewed therein (althoughe in regard of the matter, I would it myght ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be forgotten) but because I acknowledge my selfe so much bound to your Honor, that whersoeuer I may perceiue that my poore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice may be accepted of the same, I would in no wyse be slacke to offer it, much lesse refuse to yelde it, when it pleaseth your Lordship so earnestly to require it. In which request, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the singuler good wyll that your Honour beareth toward me, moueth you to think bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

deede: Yet your godlye zeale to the glorye of GOD, and the detestation of Papistrie, may appeare to all men, as it is throughly knowen to those that daylye haue experience of your honorable disposition. VVherfore I addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my selfe to put in writyng, that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had vttered in speaking, obseruyng as neare as I could, not onelye the substance of matter, but also the phrase of wordes, which I then vsed, as by reading your Honor can best iudge. VVhich after I had sent to a friend of myne in London, to be written out, at my next repayre to the Citie, I found that it was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy committed to a Printer, who had vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to set it out in prynt. For which cause I thought good to set this Preface before it; most humbly beseeching your Honor to take it in good part, and for the delay of tyme to hold me excused, seing it shall come other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse into your Lordships handes, then of me at the first was purposed. The Lord of Lords encrease al honorable &amp; godly vertues in your Lordship, with prosperitie in this life to his diuine pleasure, &amp; after the course of this time ended, perpetuall ioy and felicitie.</p>
