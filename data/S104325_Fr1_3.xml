It was a mery world (quod y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> papist) before the Bible came forth in en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glysh, all thinges were good chepe and plentyful. Nay, nay, if these thinges wer reformed, &amp; euery man both spirituall &amp; temporal wer compelled by some lawe &amp; statute to serue but in one vocation, and one office, we shuld haue a golden world England wold become a paradise, God wold blesse vs as he hath promised both heauenly &amp; bodely. The redresse &amp; amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demēt of enormities in the cōmon weal, must come frō the magistrates, not by re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bels,
<pb facs="12"/>
for they are powers exalted &amp; ordei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned of God for thesame entent, who hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leth the body by the pollicie of the head, not of the fete. If not, we shal in stede of the comfortable promises of God be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied and ouerwhelmed with terrible plagues which he threatneth to the brea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kers of his lawe,<note place="margin">Deut. 28</note> as dearth, warre, discen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, vprores, insurrections, pestilence, straunge disseases. &amp;c. We haue a tast of these curses already, God hath bent his bowe, and let slyp some of his arrowes, (which be his plagues) long sith among vs, we may perceiue by that which hath chaunsed, what touch he wyll kepe with vs hereafter, and what is like to folow.</p>
   <p>O eternal God spare thy seruauntes, let not the enemies of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> truth haue suche cause to reioyse, suffer not hogs, filthy &amp; couetous men to roote and treade down thy vineyard any lenger, but hold vp the staffe of thyne enheritaunce: Let not the preaching of thy smete son encrease the damnacion of thy people, but doe thou drawe and turne them, worke their amē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement who holdest in thy handes the hartes of rulers and al mē. Al these enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities be the fruites of euil hartes, make them O God cleane hearted, that they
<pb facs="12"/>
may powre forth good fruites by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of thy holy spirit, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue your grace in good health and make your gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prosperous to you, to this Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and to the churche of God.</p>
   <p>So be it.</p>
