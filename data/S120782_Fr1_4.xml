         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, such hath been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall course of your manyfolde courtesies towards me, as that if I should not seeke in some, though not in semblable sort to requite them, I might iustlie be counted a man most vnthankfull, if vnthankfull persons deserue the names of men. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause mine abilitie is in no case such, as that I can in such sort, as willingly
<pb facs="6"/> I woulde make equall recompence for the same: I must content my selfe in such sort as I can to doe it. And therefore as one repaying shales for nuts, or shreds for whole cloth, I thought meete to present vnto your hands these my simple labours, being the first fruites of my slender knowledge in the French tongue, as a token and testimonie of my thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and duetie, which for good causes I owe vnto you both, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie in regard of that zeale of Gods glory wherewith it hath pleased him to inflame both your harts, and that in such sort as that you seeme to bee good meanes appointed of God to prouoke others. As touching the worke it selfe (right worshipfull) and the necessitie thereof, I neede not speake, seeing it hath pleased God that somewhat should be said as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by my verie louing brother M.
<pb facs="6"/> I. F. touching the necessitie &amp; times of the argument euen for these times whereto I referre you. And thus beseeching you most humblie to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this simple mite at mine hands, and to pardon my boldnes in presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to make you patronize so simple a worke, regarding mine own labours, I commit you to the tuition of the Almightie, beseeching him to worke farther in you a true zeale of his glorie, that you may zealously pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceed in that course of godlines which you haue begunne.</p>
