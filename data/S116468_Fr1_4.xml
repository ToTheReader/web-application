   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS infant received breath,
and being vnder your noble
Fathers roofe (my ever hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Master) and therefore as an
Aire-lover belonging to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitable
Fahricke, it properly prostrates
it selfe to you for a patronnesse. The
title of it saith ignorant Censurers (those
Critticall Momes that have no lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
but satirrick Calumnie) sounds
grosse, and ignare, expressing smal wit,
and lesse judgment, in the Author to
dedicate (A vow-breaker) under the


<pb facs="4"/>
protection of A Lady, of your Candor,
beauty, goodnes, and vertues: against
those foule mouthd detractors, who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as in their venemous hearts lay;
sought to villifie an unblaunchd Laune,
a vestall puritie, a truth like Innocence,
a temple of sanstitie, the Altar of reall
goodnes, against those brainles Momes,
I comply my selfe with <hi>Plinies</hi> naturall
similie of the <hi>Almond-tree:</hi> picke
of the Rind, cracke the shell, yet set the
kernell upright in earth, and by natures
helpe it regaines maturity and growth:
so have your noble vertues, even with
the Diamond eclipsed darknesse, and
from obscurity gaind greater lustre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
then when the two eldest sons of sin
Enuy, and Malice sought to obscure
them: but shee that hath not left the
earth, divine <hi>Astrea,</hi> sacred iustice, the
eye, and soule of the law, hath vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted


<pb facs="4"/>
those foule mouthd detractors: as
you are great in goodnes, so shine there
still, and let the Sun-raies of your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
ever yeild honored hatchments, &amp;
portments, to your most noble father, &amp;
his honored families, of whom you are a
principall Columne: continue ever in
that noble pedigree of vertues, which
your virgin purity hitherto hath justly
maintaind, heaven keepe you from faunning
parasites, and busie gossips, and send you a
Husband, and a good one, else may you neuer
make a Holliday for <hi>Hymen,</hi> as much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
as tongue can speake, penn write, heart
thinke, or thoughts imagine, ever attend on
you, your noble father, and all his families, to
whom I ever rest, as my bounden duty,</p>
