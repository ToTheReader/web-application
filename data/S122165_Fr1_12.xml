   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ristotle,</hi> a Prince amongst the Philosophers, writing in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks of the nature of mankind, saith, that man is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined and desirous ofscience. The which sentence doth teach vs, that all creatures (being vertuously giuen) doe striue to attain to perfection, and draw neare in what they can to the Creator; and this knowledge is one of the principall parts which doth concerne the perfection of vnderstanding: for of the same doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all such are generally inclined to know the meanes by the which they may conserue their life, health, and reputation. And although it be necessarie for man to learne and know all sciences, yet neuerthelesse the knowledge of naturall philosophie ought to be preferred, as being the most necessarie; and moreouer it doth bring with it a singular pleasure and contentment. The first inuentor of this knowledge was <hi>Chiron</hi> the Centaure, of great renowne, sonne to <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Phillyre:</hi> and others say that it was inuented of <hi>Apollo:</hi> &amp; others of <hi>Esculape</hi> his son; esteeming that so excellent a science could neuer proceed but from the gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, and that it was impossible for man to finde out the nature of Plants, if the great worker, which is God, had not first instructed and taught him. For, as <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, if any thinke that these things haue bin inuented by man, he is vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the workes of God. The first that we can learn of among the Greekes that haue diligently written of herbes, haue bin <hi>Orpheus, Musaeus,</hi> and <hi>Hesiode,</hi> hauing bin taught by the Aegyptians: then <hi>Pythagoras</hi> of great renowne for his wisedom, which did write bookes of the nature of Plants, and did acknowledge to learne the same from <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Esculape. Democrite</hi> also did compose bookes of Plants, hauing first trauelled ouer all Persia, Arabia, Ethiopia, and Egypt. Many other excellent spirits haue taken great pleasure in this science, which to accomplish haue hazarded their liues in passing many vnknowne regions, to learne the true knowledge of <hi>Elleborus,</hi> and other Medicaments: of which number were <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Crateua, Aristotle, Theophrast, Diocles Caristius, Pamphylus, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>, Hierophile, Dioscorides, Galen, Pliny,</hi> and many others, which I leaue to name, fearing to be too long. And if I may speake without partialitie of the Author of this book, his great paines, his no lesse expences in trauelling <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> for the attaining of his skill haue bin extraordinarie. For he was neuer content with the knowledge of those simples which grow in those parts, but vpon his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

      </gap> cost and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> hath had out of all parts of the world all the rare simples which by any means he could attaine vnto, not onely to haue them brought, but hath procured by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge to haue them growing in his garden, which as the time of the yeare doth serue may be seene: for there shall you see all manner of strange trees, herbes, roots, plants, floures, and other such rare things, that it would make a man wonder, how one of his degree, not hauing the purse of a number, could euer accomplish the same. I protest vpon my conscience, I do not think for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Plants, that he is inferiour to any: for I did once see him tried with one of the best strangers that euer came into England, and was accounted in Paris the onely man, being recommended vnto me by that famous man Master <hi>Amb. <pb facs="8"/> Pareus;</hi> and he being here was desirous to goe abroad with some of our Herba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists, for the which I was the meane to bring them together, and one whole day we spent therein, searching the rarest Simples: but when it came to the triall, my French man did not know one to his foure. What doth this man deserue that hath taken so much paines for his countrey, in setting out a booke, that to this day neuer any in what language soeuer did the like? First for correcting their faults in so many hundred places, being falsly named, mistaken the one for the other; and then the pictures of a great number of plants now newly cut. If this man had taken this paines in Italy and Germany, where <hi>Matthiolus</hi> did write, he should haue sped as well as he did: For (saith he) I had so great a desire euer to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish my Booke, that I neuer regarded any thing in respect of the publique good, not so much as to thinke how I should finish so great a charge, which I had neuer carried out, but that by Gods stirring vp of the renowned Emperour <hi>Ferdinando</hi> of famous memorie, and the excellent Princes had not helped mee with great sums of money, so that the Commonwealth may say, That this blessing doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceed of them than from me. There haue been also other Princes of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine which haue bin liberal in the preferring of this Book, and the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Elector of the Empire the Duke of Saxonie, which sent me by his Post much mony toward my charges: the liberalitie of the which and the magnificence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me I cannot commend sufficiently. They which followed in their liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were the excellent <hi>Fredericke</hi> Count Palatine of the Rhine, and the excellent <hi>Ioachim</hi> Marques of Brandeburg, which much supplied my wants: and the like did the reuerend Cardinall and Prince of Trent, and the Excellent Archbishop of Saltzperg, the Excellent Dukes of Bauare and Cleues, the duke of Megapolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Prince of Vandalis, the State Republique of Noremberg, the liberalitie of whom ought to be celebrated for euer: and it doth much reioice me that I had the helpe and reward of Emperors, Kings, Electors of the Roman Empire, arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes, Cardinalls, Bishops, Dukes and Princes, for it giveth more credit to our Labors than any thing that can be said. Thus far <hi>Matthiolus</hi> his owne writing of the liberalitie of Princes towards him. What age do we liue in here that wil suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all vertue to go vnrewarded? Master <hi>Gerard</hi> hath taken more pains than euer <hi>Matthiolus</hi> did in his Commentaries, and hath corrected a number of faults that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> passed ouer; and I dare affirme (in reuerence be it spoken to that Excellent man) that Master <hi>Gerard</hi> doth know a great number of Simples that were not knowne in his time: and yet I doubt whether he shall taste of the liberalitie of either Princ, Duke, Earle, Bishop, or publique Estate. Let a man excell neuer so much in any excellent knowledge, neuertheles many times he is not so much regarded as a Iester, a Boaster, a Quacksaluer or Mountebanke: for such kinde of men can <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, dissemble, make of trifles great matters, in praising of this rare secret, or that excellent spirit, or this Elixer or Quintessence; which when it shall come to the triall, nothing shal be found but boasting words.</p>
