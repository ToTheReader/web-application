The first, they indeuour by their false doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: the other, by their most perillous and endlesse practises. Insomuch, as of the troubles that are this day in the world, the Cardinall of Loraine seemeth to haue made a true confession e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the councell of Trent. <hi>For our sakes, brethren</hi> (saieth hee) <hi>is this storme risen, therefore cast vs into the sea.</hi> Indeede not for their sakes onely,<note place="margin"> Gentil. exam. concil.

Nowe the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or malice of our enemies must not discourage vs from doing our duty: but how much more they increase in number, so much the more diligent should we be: and their crueltie and malice should increase our courage against them. But in vaine doe wee withstand them with our tongues and pennes, if the Christian Magistrates doe not put to their helping hand: who haue also their du y to do in the church of God, as wel as they, to whom the ministery of the word is committed <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron,</hi> the prince and the priest were brethren, to teach vs what mutuall help the one of them must make to the other. Kings and Queenes (if they forget not their dutie) must be nursing fathers &amp; nurces to Gods church.<note place="margin"> Psa. 49.23.</note> They must cherish and norish it, they must loue and defend it.

      </gap> in scriptures commended vnto vs, as haue beene ready to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine trueth, set foorth Gods word, and regarded the sinceritie of the same: and haue on the contrary withstoode superstition, put downe idolatry, and compelled their people vnto the seruice of God, both according to the first and second table of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. And on the other side, it is left as a staine vnto the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of others, that they did not take away occasions of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and remoue such stumbling blockes out of mens wayes. If then we could in such a godly consent, as the Prophet <hi>Sophonie</hi> saith, serue the Lord <hi>with one shoulder,</hi> the ciuil magistrates,<note place="margin"> Zophon. 3.9.</note> by the sword, we by the word: they by correction (if neede re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) we by exhortations: they by punishments, we by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, remembring that both the one and the other must one day make an account of our stewardship, and answere for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults: then I doubt not but God would blesse our godly labors, with great increase of knowlege and godlines. But, as in the end of this treatise, I haue made some exhortation vnto magistrates, to consider of their dutie in this point, so haue I also thought it my part to maintaine to my power, Truth against Falshood euen Gods word against mens inuentions. And for this cause haue I taken this trauell, to set downe the summe of that that we teach, especially in such matters as are principally in question amongst vs: and on the contrary, what our aduersaries teach concerning the same. Which I thought to be necessary, because our doctrine is many times by the aduersaries slandered, especially before such as are ignorant, as though it were far otherwise than in truth it is. And that the truth more easly may appeare, what is taught by them and vs, he that listeth may see with little labor, euen as it were at one view both our opinions. Neither do I vndertake to set downe all that we teach concerning those articles, but onely the points that doe especially belong to the controuersies that are betweene vs. Then also haue I set downe the principall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereby they confirme their doctrines, and indeuour to confute them. Wherein especially I alleadge M. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reasons (though not alwayes) because he is accounted learned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest vs, and also commeth after others, so that he hath seene
<pb facs="4"/> what others haue, and hath taken out of them what he liketh. And as in all this treatise, my endeuour is to proue (I trust with some good effect) that the doctrine of the church of Rome is not catholike, so that it may the better appeare, I haue towards the end set downe an abridgement of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis,</hi> whereby I trust the meanest that seeth it shalbe able to iudge, how they make an vniust claime to the catholike religion. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I know my own wants, and could rather submit my selfe to be a scholer vnto many, than a teacher almost of any: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (I know not how) my minde giueth me, that this manner of writing may do some good, especially among the vnlearned that are desirous to be taught, I thought my duetie forced me to take this in hand, though I want many helpes and meanes that other haue. And, to whom should this my labour (such as it is) be due rather than vnto you, next after that place where I did sucke as it were my first milke of learning, and laid almost the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that knowledge (such as it is) that God hath indued mee withall? By your good liberalitie, I confesse my selfe to be the better inabled to do any good (be it neuer so little that I can do) in the church of God. To your Worships therefore I confesse this my trauell to be due, as a simple token of my sincere heart, which would haue yeelded a better remembrance, if my abilitie could haue affoorded it. And the rather do I dedicate this Booke vnto your W. Company, that you, seeing the meaning of bestowing your exhibition (which is to bring vp Labourers in Gods har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest, teachers in his church) to be in some part performed in me, who first in Oxford receiued your liberalitie, as I doubt not but you haue seene much more plentiful fruit in many other you may the more willingly continue your godly course, and not be weary of your wel-doing. Accept in good part (I pray you) this simple gift, and if you see in it but my desire to doe good, giue glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
