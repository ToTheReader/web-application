   <p>HAVING (RIGHT
honourable) aboue thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeeres since, printed
this shorte treatise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing,
being translated
and deliuered vnto mee
by Maister Foxe, whose iudgement and
faithfulnesse in the Lordes causes are, so
sufficientlye grounded among the faithful
both at home and abroade, as my pore te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
can nothing adde thereunto, naye
so much as I not only protect, but also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
my selfe in the fyrst printing hereof
vnder the same. And the euent hath yet
more made good his choyse in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
whilest that the same was euen desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
embraced of the christian readers,
and hath ben knowne to perswade in the
matter, it treateth of, some that be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
were farre wide from the truth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
For though the volume be very smal yet
doth it discourse a great poynt of our chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb facs="3"/>
faith, religion, and comfort, not only
very plainly and familiarly, but also moste
pithely and substantially, which to do can
not be but to the reader singularly fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Wherefore I haue nowe my selfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
of M. Foxe, of whom I fyrste re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
it, that it would please him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewe
the same, with such profitable addi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions
as to him should seeme meete for the
benefite of the godly reader, that yet once
more in my time I might publish the same
to Gods glory and the comfort of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Wherin I esteme my selfe much bound
vnto him for graunting my request. And
now (righte honourable) I thoughte my
selfe to haue a fit occasion aswell to giue
vnto your honor some duetiful remēbrance
of my thankefulnes for so greate kindnes
as I acknowledge to haue inioyed frō you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

the honour of God and the faithe of

thereunto, and encrease his heauly giftes
vpon you with daily encreases, euer preser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing
