   <p>To the right Worshipfull, wise, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Gentleman, Maister Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippe Sidney, Esquire, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gods grace, and all spirituall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singes.</p>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege (Right Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,) if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, if deserued dignitie, finallie, if anie excellent and spirituall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Nature (or rather of God) be sufficient to winne credite, and to purchase praise: then must this be a necessarie consequent, that where many gifts of Gods grace do ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie concurre and run together, there
<pb facs="3"/>
credite hath continuance, and praise possession. Such a one is he, who by no lesse labour then learning, and by no lesse learning then iudgement, not onlie attempted, but also finished (to his no small commendation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a worthie Gentleman, &amp; hauing enough in ciuill and politike affaires otherwise to bestowe his studie, &amp; his time,) this most profitable and true christian worke: which, though by reason of the manifoldnesse of the matter it be wearisome to reade, yet with such weight of wisedome, diuerse waies declared, that tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is so attenuated &amp; diminished: that (as a footeman, hauing farre to goe, maketh lesse accompt of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if the way be pleasant: and by the present viewe of cōfortable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, is so rauished with delight, that he thinketh not vpon the length of his iournie:) in this booke, things are so tempered, that (as the best saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="3"/>
being made of sweete and sowre, doe please the taste) the reader shall feele him selfe in such sorte affected, that albeit the perusing thereof shall seeme passing painfull, yet (circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances accordinglie considered, and point by point precisely pondered) it shall prooue exceeding fruitefull. Againe (Right worshipfull) as in building, not he which seeketh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be sumptuous then substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, but hee which endeuoureth to be both substantiall and sumptuous, deserueth most commendation: so in writing, not he which hunteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the finest phrase, &amp; sweetest style, neglecting (in the meane time) sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter, sauouring of iudgement: but hee, which hath the capacitie, both pithilie like a Logician, and pleasantlie like a Rhetorician, to leaue some proofe to the worlde of his witte and knowledge, is to bee had in admiration. In which thing,
<pb facs="4"/>
because hee is excellent, by whome this booke was written, it importeth more then I am able to vtter: which, (whatsoeuer it be) I leaue to the cē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the wise. And nowe (Right worshipfull) somewhat superficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to touch the work it selfe: which I may well resemble to the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of mans bodie: wherein as wee may see the wonderfull wisdome of God, in the creation of mortall man, howe he hath powred life into the principall partes, as it were into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine vesselles, and couered them with flesh, which I may boldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to clay, for the better preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and safe keeping of the same▪ howe cunninglie the whole body of man is builded and knitte together, with sinewes, veines, artires, liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, gristles, bones, muscles, &amp; such like: so in this booke, beeing but a manuell, the verie secrets of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe Church are so discouered,
<pb facs="4"/>
(which in the opinion of the Pope and his consistorie, is high treason, and vnpardonable,) that verie babes and sucklings may beholde their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations, and spitte at their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous practises, to them selues ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantageable, to the church of Christ offensiue, and to the glorie of God nothing more derogatorie. This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table booke therefore (Right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull) I haue presumed to publish abroade, vnder your patronage and protection, not doubting that it should want credite, if it were not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uershadowed with the countenance of some speciall personage: but for that your disposition being so vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as that you are a mirrour amōg men, &amp; your course of life so praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie, as that you may bee well thought a blossome of true Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: your worshipfull mind also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beautified &amp; inriched with such rare ornamentes, as that you among
<pb facs="5"/>
the rest, glister like a starre: therfore vnto your woorships handes haue I bin encouraged to present this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie booke, translated and printed at my proper costes and expenses, not in hope of anie extraordinarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, (which howe litle I thinke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, let him iudge that knoweth all thinges,) but that the Churche of Christ, being not yet growen to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect age &amp; strength, maie reape some speciall benefite by the same. And thus hauing laide open, verie blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, but plainlie, my simple (but yet honest) meaning, I committe your worship to the grace of God, which as it hath hitherto (no doubt) beene your direction, so I hope it shall, &amp; (God graunt) it may be your loades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to life euerlasting. Amen.</p>
