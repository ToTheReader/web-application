   <head>❧To my much esteemed friend, J. L.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou will wonder, I am sure (considering my profession, to see me become a Poet. And indeed I do almost maruell at it my selfe, knowing my selfe to want the two principal furtherances of Poetry: the one is natures instinct <note n="a" place="margin">They say, <hi>Poëta nasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> if a man be not, as it were, a Poet borne, hee shall neuer prooue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in that facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note>, which God in his holy prouidence hath denyed me: the other is a certaine retired freedom from all such businesses, which may breed distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note n="b" place="margin">Carmina secessū scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentis &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia quaerunt, Ouid. de Trist.</note> which my publike Calling, besides priuate encombrances, will not afford me. Yet notwithstā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, vpon this present occasion, I haue euen forced my selfe to this straiter course of Verse-making, though I know, that for mine owne case (hauing to deale in such a distempered and vnruly Subiect) that lesse-limited &amp; freer kind of discourse, which Prose alloweth, had bene more conuenient: Because the rules of Cadence, &amp; number (to which our English Poetry especially is cōfined) do many times so strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an vnaccustomed Practitioner, that he is in haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, either of obscuring the sence (which in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this nature were something dangerous) or of marring the Verse (which to the apprehension of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb facs="3"/>
common conceit were very ridiculous.) But howsoeuer I haue erred in the carriage of this verse, I hope, to you and to others, whose fauour, eyther because of their Iudgement, or their honesty, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, this shall excuse me: that meeting with our common Aduersary (who appeareth sometime in shape of a States-man, debating of Titles, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth affayres, <note n="c" place="margin">Witnesse the Quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libets, Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, &amp;c.</note> sometime as a Petitioner to the King and Parliament, <note n="d" place="margin">At the Kings first cōming, &amp; now since y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Parliamēt.</note> sometime as a plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perswader, <note n="e" place="margin">Bristowes Motiues, &amp; Bookes of that nature</note> sometime as a Restorer of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Text, to the natiue purity thereof,<note n="f" place="margin">Rhem. Test. and Grego. Martin.</note> sometime as a man of a very tender Conscience, giuing reasons why he cannot come to our Assemblies,<note n="g" place="margin">Howlet.</note> somtime as a Rayler at our gouernment, and an approuer of our open enemies; <note n="h" place="margin">
         <hi>The wardword.</hi> Quo teneam vultus mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantē Protea nodo.</note> that, I say, meeting with this time-seruing <hi>Proteus,</hi> in the fashion of a Rimer or Balladine, and crept in (as the maner of false brethrē is <note n="i" place="margin">
         <hi>Gal. 2.4.</hi> Similes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent labra lactucas.</note>) into both the hands and the heartes of many simply-seduced; I haue endeuored to make the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce like the lips (as the prouerb is) and to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion my selfe to him in versing, to whom I am sure (without wilful forsaking the playne truth of God, manifested in Scripture) I shall neuer be like in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing.</p>
   <p>The Seruice it selfe, which is heere sent vs in by this Runnagate,<note n="k" place="margin">He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth hee was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant.</note> is for substance agreeing with the rest of their Romish Cates, thogh (to say the truth)
<pb facs="3"/>
it hath come through the hands of a very homely and sluttish Cooke, by whom it is neyther seasoned with wit or argument, no, nor yet set forth after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good ordinary fashion: But it is euen a very Gally-mawfrey, of certayne naked and indigested Allegations (as it were the leauings and scraps of some other) without eyther order or proofe, as though euery Papist were a Pope, and euery word of his mouth an Oracle. Belike the Slouen thought it good enough for those, for whom it was proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; as indeed it is: for those which turne their eares from the trueth, and are giuen vnto fables <note n="l" place="margin">2. Tim. 4.4.</note>; and by some, vpon my knowledge (to whome, I feare me, God hath sent strong delusions, that they should beleeue lyes) it is highly magnified,<note n="m" place="margin">2. Thes. 2.11.</note> as a speciall Preseruatiue against supposed Heresie, and as a well-framed Sconce, which none of vs all is able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow.</p>
   <p>In regard whereof, knowing my selfe bound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others to contend earnestly for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Fayth, <note n="n" place="margin">Iude 3.</note> I haue vndertaken this which you here see. For my desire and true intent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it is best knowne to him which seeth in secret<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 6.4.</note>, and in his due time will make the counsels of all hearts manifest. <note n="p" place="margin">1. Cor. 4.5.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Touching the thing it selfe, how it is, and how well it is, I submit it to the censure of the godly-wise,
<pb facs="4"/>
praying them, that with their fauourable (if not allowance, yet at least) conniuence, it may passe to the vse of those, to whom it is intended: And among others, I haue directed it especially to you, in part of recompence for a great deale of kindnesse, entreating you to entertayne it with the like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of loue, wherewith it is offered. And so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching God to fill you with the fruites of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, <note n="q" place="margin">Phil. 1.11.</note> I commend you to his grace in Christ Iesus.</p>
