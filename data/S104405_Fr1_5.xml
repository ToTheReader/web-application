Great doubtlesse was the fauour and mercie that god shewed vnto Noe,<note place="margin">Noe.</note> by whom he saued the remanent of mankynde beinge but fewe in number. But much greater was the grace which he shewed to kynge Ferdinando vnder whom and by whose meanes he saued not onely the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dies but also the soules of innumerable millions of men inha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bytynge a great part of the worlde heretofore vnknowen and drowned in the deluge of erroure.<note place="margin">What god hath wrought by kynge Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando.</note> What shulde I here speake of Abraham the father of fayth whose promyses were great,<note place="margin">Abraham,</note> and he cauled the frende of god?

It were here superfluous to speake of Dauid whom Godde founde a man accordynge to his hartes desyre:<note place="margin">Dauid.</note> and yet maye it be doubted whether his plages and scourges were greater then his benefites?

A thyng doubtlesse so strange and marueylous that as the lyke was neuer done before, so is it perhaps neuer lyke to be done ageyne: so farre haue the nauigations of the Spanyardes excelled the vyage of Iason and the <hi>'Argonautae</hi> to the region of Colchos, or all that euer were before.

   <p>Furthermore Damianus a Goes,<note place="margin">Damianus a Goes</note> wryteth in his booke <hi>De de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploratione Lappianae gentis,</hi> that he was the fyrst that moued Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus to speake sumwhat hereof: And that he (Erasmus I meane) was determined to write a iust volume of this matter yf he had not byn preuented by death. Albeit (sayth Damia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus) in his booke entiteled Ecclesiastes, he dyd not keepe si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of so wicked an vngodlynesse, whiche surely is suche, that it may in maner make all Christian men (and especiallye such vnto whom god hath gyuen poure and knowleage) giltie of so heyghnous a crime,<note place="margin">To the christi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>an princes.</note> that he may take vengeance of them in the day of iudgement before the iuste iudge Chryst. Nowe therfore (sayth he) let the Christian Monarches take heede what accoumpte they shall make before the tribunal of Chryste at the laste day, when neyther fauoure, nor pardon, or flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie can take place to bee any excuse for the losse of so manye soules. And these be the very woordes of the woorshipful and lerned man Damianus a Goes, wrytten to the bysshoppe of Rome Paule the thyrde of that name, whom he further char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to looke diligently hereunto, as a thynge moste chiefely perteynynge to the office of Christian prelates.

Consyder with yowre selues if it were onely to get worldely ryches, howe redye and greedy yowe wolde bee to venture a greate deale to get a thyrde part, with owt castynge of any perell by lande or by sea, as the wyttie poet Horase hath in fewe wordes descrybed the marchauntes desyre and aduentures to obteyne rychesse.<note place="margin">The marchant</note>
