   <head>Of Humane Passions. The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Prouident <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> hath prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed certaine ends to all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of this Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, whom She hath clothed with certaine qualities and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements fit to inflame them with their <hi>Loue</hi>; So there is not any one in this world but doth endeuor by all meanes to attaine vnto those ends which are propounded. As the Sunne hauing bin placed in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to contribute to the birth
<pb facs="6"/>
and preseruation of Beasts and Plants; runnes continually from one <hi>Hemisphere</hi> to the other, to poure out the beames of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and light ouer all. So af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his example, there is not any other cause in all this great World, but is carefull to seeke and pursue her end, according to the motions which Nature hath ingrafted. But to make them c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>peable, it was necessary that the same Nature which hath prescrib'd them their ends, should also giue them as it were two wings to raise them vp: That is to say, it was needefull she should impart vnto them the knowledge, and ingraf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> in them the inclination and desire to pursue them. Desire alone were not sufficient, for that is fashi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Appetite; which is a blind power, and requires some
<pb facs="6"/>
light to guide and conduct it in its motions; Euen as they say the Whale, which hath a weake and heauy sight, hath need of a guide to conduct it through the waues of the Sea, lest that this great and weighty masse which she drawes after her, should strike against some rocke and be crusht in peeces. Neither were know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge alone sufficient, for that it proceedes from a faculty which being borne to giue light, doth necessarily presuppose another power, which doth receiue the beames of her light, and as we may say, suffers it selfe to be guided by that light. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to cause the King (being incited by the glory of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, or induced by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his courage) to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the sacke of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> or to repl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
      <pb facs="7"/>
in <hi>Palestina</hi>; it were not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that he knew where <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> stood, or in what part of the world <hi>Palestina</hi> were; but besides all this it were needfull, that with this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the heat and ardor to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him to so glorious a Conquest should breede a desire. As in old time to thrust on <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to vndertake the voyage of <hi>Persia,</hi> or of the <hi>Indies,</hi> it was not onely requisite this Prince should haue some knowledge of that st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tely Empire and of those rich Prouinces; But it was also necessary his generosity should beget in him a passion and will to conquer them. So as no man imbraceth any designe whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, vntill that knowledge be vnited with desire, and desire ioyned vnto knowledge. In this manner then if things knewe
<pb facs="7"/>
their ends and did not desire them, or if they desired them without the knowledge, they could not be drawne to endeuor to get them: For as much as through the want of those helps, they should be in danger to labor in vaine, and to lose all the paines of their pursuites. So as to effect it they had neede of knowledge and desire. The proofes hereof are seene in all the Creatures which make a part of this Vniuersall world. For leauing apart the Angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whose actions show suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently that their substance is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with an vnderstanding full of knowledge, and a will capable to frame diuers desires; if we will fixe our eyes vpon visible nature, we shall find that there is not any Creature, not onely among those that haue
<pb facs="8"/>
life, but euen among those that haue no soules, in the motions and course of whose actions this truth doth not appeare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate it selfe plainely. It is true, that in things which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible and without life, it is not necessary that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their ends should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in themselues, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and inclinations to attaine vnto them do reside; but it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth that they bee guided and conducted by a cause conioyned to their actions. And to returne to our last example, as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary (to draw <hi>Alexander</hi> to vndertake the voyage of <hi>Asia</hi> and the <hi>Indies</hi>) he should haue knowledge of the Prouinces, yet he might borrow this knowledge from those which had seene them, and obserued them▪ euen as blind men, who led by their
<pb facs="8"/>
guides go where their affaires do call them; euen so, although that naturall things which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are not indued with any knowledge, besides the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they haue vnto their end, haue yet some need to know it, to the end they may affect it and seeke it; yet hauing a desire▪ it imports not whether the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge be precisely in themselues, or that some other cause supplies this defect, and insinuates it selfe into this action to guide it. The reason whereof is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be depriued of knowledge, yet it hinders not the force of their motions; for that they are vnited to that great intelligence which knoweth all things, and cannot erre in her knowledge, but guides all the naturall causes to their ends by her wise prouidence. But these
<pb facs="9"/>
things haue alwayes neede of knowledge and desire, to put them into action, although that in regard of knowledge it is not absolutely necessary it reside in them, but it sufficeth that it be imparted vnto them by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and assistance of a more eminent cause. As for those which haue life, it may be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obserued in the course of their liues. But we must remember that the soule being the forme of liuing thinges, and naturall formes hauing this in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that the more Noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the perfection of that which is lesse Noble, as a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle comprehendes with a certaine eminency, all that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the composition of a Triangle; and as the formes of beasts containe the formes of the Elements; It followes that
<pb facs="9"/>
there beeing three degrees of <hi>Soules</hi>; that is to say, that which <hi>giues life,</hi> which is the lesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; that which <hi>giues sense</hi>; which is the second ranke, and the <hi>Reasonable</hi> which is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest of all; this <hi>Reasonable soule</hi> which is peculiar onely to <hi>Man,</hi> containes all the powers and perfections of the other, and can effect as much as all the rest together. By reason whereof man hath a <hi>Vegetatiue soule,</hi> which is common with plants; he hath the <hi>sensitiue,</hi> which he hath common with bruit heasts; But he alone is in possession of the <hi>Reasonable soule,</hi> whereby he hath nothing common with the rest of the Creatures. After this, either of these soules hath a number of powers befitting the operations which must arise. The powers of the <hi>Vegetatiue
<pb facs="10"/>
soule</hi> are principally those which nourish, which contribute to the growing and increase, and which serue to <hi>Generation</hi>: And those haue other powers for instruments to their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the <hi>power to draw, the power to retaine, the power to expell the excrements, the power to disgest the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,</hi> and others which <hi>Philosophers</hi> assigne vnto them.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, there is a power which is as it were the <hi>Queene</hi> of all the rest, to whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and conduct they referre all their actions: And that is the power of the <hi>naturall Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,</hi> the which (as wee haue sayd) is one of those <hi>two things</hi> necessary to accomplish the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Nature.</hi> According vnto these <hi>Lawes</hi> we see that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb facs="10"/>
we call <hi>Attractiue,</hi> drawes the nourishment vnto her, for that the <hi>Naturall Appetite</hi> doth presse and command her; and in like manner the power which they call <hi>Expulsiue,</hi> doth cast forth and expell those things which the same <hi>Natural Appetite</hi> doth abhorre; and so of the other <hi>Powers</hi> which are ordained to diuerse ends. But for that the <hi>Appetite</hi> which is blind and voyde of all <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> is not sufficient in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getatiue</hi> things to exercise their action, but withall it is requisite that they be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with <hi>Knowledge</hi>; it therfore happens that the <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue soule</hi> being not so Noble that among all her powers, there is not any one indued with <hi>Knowledge</hi>: the vniuersall <hi>Nature</hi> which prouides for all,
<pb facs="11"/>
supplies this defect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts by her <hi>Light</hi> the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Vegetatiue</hi> substances to their ends, and by the same meanes guides all the other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers which follow her motions in their actions. So as <hi>Nature</hi> knowing the substance fitting and proper for the <hi>Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> shewes it and instructs the <hi>Naturall Appetite,</hi> and ordaines that it shalbee drawne and disgested, and conuerted into <hi>Nourishment</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of the <hi>Vegetable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuidue</hi>; and the like may bee sayd of the other actions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doubtlesse liuings things dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>r not much from those that haue no life, And we must not obiect that <hi>Plants</hi> seeme to bee indued with <hi>Knowledge,</hi> for that they can distinguish a <hi>Iuic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi> which is proper for them, from
<pb facs="11"/>
that which is pernitious, the which seemes to bee a marke of <hi>Knowledge</hi>; for although there were <hi>Pilosophers</hi> which did a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute vnto <hi>Plants</hi> a feeling of things, which they sayd was lesse pure and lesse actiue then that of <hi>Creat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
            <desc>••</desc>
         </gap>es</hi>: Yet it is most certaine that the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Vegetatiue soule</hi> is too earthly, to bee fit for the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Sences,</hi> which require oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>Organs</hi> then those of the <hi>Plants.</hi> And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they draw vnto them good <hi>Iuice,</hi> and reiect the bad, it proceeds not from any <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> wherewith they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, but from their <hi>Naturall vertues</hi>▪ and properties, guided by that Soueraigne <hi>Intelligence</hi> which disperseth her care ouer al the <hi>Creatures</hi> how base and abiect soeuer: And it is also by
<pb facs="12"/>
her motion that the same <hi>Plants</hi> fly their <hi>Contraries,</hi> as the <hi>Vine</hi> shunnes the <hi>Bay tree</hi>; and that they shew such grace &amp; beauty in their workes, as we see in the <hi>Spring time</hi>; So as all these things bind vs not to beleeue▪ that they are indued with <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But let vs returne to our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and (leauing the <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue soule</hi>) ascend a degree higher, and come to the <hi>Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</hi> This as the more <hi>Noble</hi> hath in her selfe the possession of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and hath no need to borrow it, like vnto the <hi>Vegetatiue soule,</hi>

   <p>For the <hi>Eyes</hi> are onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to iudge of the difference of <hi>Colours,</hi> as betwixt <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Blacke,</hi> and neuer seeke to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

which are imprinted in her; yet for that she doth continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present vnto the <hi>Common sence</hi> the formes which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed vnto her, she may well bee sayd also to helpe to <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> These then are the three <hi>Interior powers</hi> capable of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> to the which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that some adde others, yet I wil hold with their opinion who not willing to multiply the powers without necessity, reiect them as superfluous, seeing the <hi>Imaginatiue power</hi> sufficeth to do all the offices which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed vnto them. There are then in the <hi>Sensitiue soule eight knowing faculties, fiue Externall,</hi> and <hi>three Internall</hi> as we haue shewed.</p>
   <p>As for the <hi>Appetitiue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> where the desires are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, there are but two, that is to
<pb facs="16"/>
say, the <hi>Concupiscible</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring <hi>power,</hi> and the <hi>Irascible</hi> or <hi>Angry power</hi>: The one of which without the other suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not for the health of the <hi>Creatures.</hi> For if the <hi>Lyon</hi> had no other inclination, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other spurre of desire then to runne after meate fit for his nourishment, doubtlesse the least difficulty and obstacle he should incounter, would hinder the pursuite of his prey; for that hee should be without any <hi>desire</hi> to surmount this difficulty, and so he should not be able to preserue his life for want of nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
   <p>In like manner men would bee daunted for the least crosses they should finde in the pursuite of any good thing, or in the auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>euill</hi>; and although the danger were not great nor vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<pb facs="16"/>
yet would they not dare to oppose themselues and incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: And so they would yeeld to these difficulties, and not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the obiects of their desires, how great soeuer their inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were to seeke them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prouident <hi>Nature</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent this inconuenience, besides the other powers, hath giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Sensitiue soule</hi> two <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscible</hi> and the <hi>Irascible</hi>; whereof this last, when as any difficulty ariseth and opposeth it selfe to the desire of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscible,</hi> comes presently to succour it; and inflaming the blood, excites <hi>Choler, Hope, Courage,</hi> or some other like <hi>Passion</hi> destinated and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make him surmount the difficulties which crosse the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the <hi>Soule.</hi> For
<pb facs="17"/>
that which concernes the powers of the <hi>Sensitiue soule,</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines none but the faculty mouing from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is disperst and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides in the <hi>sinnewes, Muscles</hi> and <hi>Ligaments,</hi> and which is dispersed ouer all the members of the <hi>Creature.</hi> This <hi>Power</hi> being commanded by the <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,</hi> doth presently exercise his office, seruing for an instrument to that part of the blood which for the great subtility and pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof hath gotten the name of <hi>Spirit.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To come now to the <hi>Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soule,</hi> it hath two principall <hi>Powers,</hi> the one indued with <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which is the <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi>; and the other capable of <hi>Desire,</hi> which is the <hi>Will</hi>; the which being blind as all the <hi>Appetites</hi> are naturally,
<pb facs="17"/>
she followeth in the pursuite of her obiects, the light of the <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> by reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of she is termed the <hi>Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Appetite,</hi> but more properly the <hi>Will.</hi> The office of our <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> particularly of that which we call possible, is to receiue, and in receiuing to know, and in knowing to offer vnto the will those kinds or formes, which are sent vnto it from the <hi>Imagination.</hi> It is true, that being a more <hi>Noble power</hi> then the <hi>Sensitiue,</hi> it cannot receiue those Images and formes, so materiall, grosse and <hi>sensible,</hi> as they are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their particular being, for that they are not proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the purity and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of her <hi>condition.</hi> By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof the <hi>Philosophers</hi> haue placed in our soules ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="18"/>
      <hi>power</hi> wonderfully <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> whose office is to purge and to clothe as it were with a new <hi>Lustre,</hi> all the Images or formes which are found in the <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> or fantasie; and by the meanes of this <hi>Light,</hi> to cause those formes which were <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, Sensible,</hi> and Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, to become so purified from these earthly conditions as they seeme <hi>Vniuersall,</hi> and so well proportioned to the purenesse of our vnderstanding, as they easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue the impression. Thus then the <hi>powers</hi> of all the three Soules concurre in man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Rationall,</hi> the which as more <hi>Noble</hi> then the <hi>Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> or <hi>Vegetatiue,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all their powers, and withall addes many things to their perfection. In the meane time, wee must consider that
<pb facs="18"/>
man hath no kind of command, neither ouer the <hi>powers</hi> of the <hi>Vegetatiue soule,</hi> whose acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are meerely naturall; nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer those of the <hi>Sensitiue soule,</hi> which are destinated to <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> as the <hi>Interior</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior sences</hi>; vnlesse it bee by accident, when as by a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his will; hee denies these powers the meanes which are necessary to put them in action; but hee may well haue power ouer those of the <hi>Sensitiue Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,</hi> which are proper to obey the discourse of reason, and the command of the <hi>Will,</hi> as ouer the <hi>Irascible</hi> and <hi>Concupisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To the end then that amidst the bond of the <hi>Intellectuall powers</hi> with the <hi>Sensitiue</hi>; and the communication, and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency which is betwixt
<pb facs="19"/>
them for the exercise of their functions, we may the better see how the lesse <hi>Noble,</hi> obey and serue the more <hi>Noble,</hi> and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their offices, wee must heere represent the <hi>forme.</hi> As soone as the <hi>Exterior sences,</hi> busied about the <hi>Obiects</hi> which are proper for them, haue gathered the formes of things which come from without, they carry them to the <hi>common sence,</hi> the which receiues them, iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of them, and distinguisheth them; and then to preserue them in the absence of their obiects, presents them to the <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which hauing gathered them together, to the end she may represent them whensoeuer need shall require, she deliuers them to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> custody of the <hi>Memory</hi>; from whence retiring them when occasion requires, she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<pb facs="19"/>
them vnto the <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,</hi> vnder the apparance of things that are pleasing or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom, that is to say, vnder the <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Euill</hi>; and at the same instant the same <hi>formes</hi> enlightned with the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and purged from the <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and singular conditions, which they retaine in the <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi> and insteed of that which they represented of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things, representing them generall; they become capable to be imbraced by the <hi>vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> the which vnder the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of things which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable or hurtfull, that is to say, vnder the <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Euill,</hi> represents them vnto the <hi>Will:</hi> the which▪ being blind referres it selfe to that which the <hi>vnderstanding</hi> proposeth
<pb facs="20"/>
vnto it: And then as <hi>Queene</hi> of the powers of the soule she or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines what they shall imbrace, &amp; what they shal fly as it pleseth her▪ whereunto the <hi>Sensitiue Appetite</hi> yeelding a prompt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to execute her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the which it neuer st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>aies, so long as it containes it selfe within the bounds and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der prescrib'd by <hi>Nature,</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all the powers and <hi>passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> ouer which shee commands, and sets to worke those which are necessary to that action, and by their meanes commands the mouing <hi>power;</hi> dispersed ouer all the members, to follow or fly, to approch or to recoyle, or to do any other motion which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. And shee obeying sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly if shee bee not hindred, moues, the whole body with the <hi>Organs</hi> which reside in the
<pb facs="20"/>
parts, and induceth them to fly or imbrace things according to the command which she hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
   <p>After this manner <hi>Man</hi> proceeds in his free <hi>operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> if he will obserue the order which he ought. The which I say, for that oftentimes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
