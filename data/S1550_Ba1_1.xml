   <head>THE CONCLVSION TO THE <hi>CAREFVLL READER.</hi>

   <p>HAVING thus shewed (carefull Reader) that no sect or sort of Protestants, or those that falsly pretend the reformation of the Catholique Romane religion in these our daies, haue any true Pastors or teachers, and namelie that those who now beare the names of Bishops in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are no true or lawfull Bishops, but meere vsurpers of that title, and consequentlie that all the inferiour Pastors, Preachers, or Ministers ordered or sent by them, haue no māner of lawfull calling or commission to preach or Minister Gods word, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to his people, but are such as the holie scriptures call false Prophets, theeues, robbers, and wolues, if thou hast but the least sense, care, or feeling of thine owne eternall saluation (which if thou shouldest loose, it were better for thee a thousād times that thou hadst neuer bene borne) thou wilt quicklie and carefullie prouide, that thou do not liue and dy a mēber or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessour of any one of those sects. For seeing it is a truth, both most euident in it selfe, and confessed by all Protestants of what pretended reformation soeuer, that where there are no true or lawfull Pastors, there can be no true church (the church being no other thing then the sheepe vnited with the Pastor, or the people with their Bishop) and further that where there is no true church there can be no true faith <hi>(the church being the house of God, the piller and ground of truth,)</hi> as witnesseth S. Paul.<note place="margin">1. <hi>ad Timoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>
         </hi> 3 14.</note> And yet further that where there is no true faith, there can be no true meane of Saluation (S. Paul also teaching that,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ad Hebr.</hi> 11.6.</note>
      <hi>without true faith it is impossible to please God:</hi>) These things I saie, being both euident in themselues, and confessed by all Protestants, thou canst not be so blind as to thinke that thou maist find thy saluation amongst any sect of Protestants, who are so euidentlie prooued to haue no Pastors. And so desiring in thee no other disposition to come to the true knowledge of the meane to saue thy soule, then only an effectuall desire to saue it, with a competent consideration of the points here brieflie deduced, I leaue thee to Gods most holy grace, who hath not only made
<pb facs="174"/> thee to his owne Image, but hath redeemed thee with the most pretious bloud of his only Sonne, and this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for any profit of his, or merite of thine, but for his owne goodnes, and that thou maist be a saued soule in his eternall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where I beseech God we may once meete.</p>
