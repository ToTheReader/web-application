      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Jr, this Discourse was brought to me in Latine by some of my good friends, who for that they could not pearce through the harsh and vncouth stile into the meaning of the Author, they prayed me to make the same more transparent by a version thereof into English: which J haue here done in a more explicate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and haue aduentured to recommend the same to your patronage, as a pledge of that affection, wherewith J doe much respect you. Only J beseech you, <hi>vt facias quod iam facis,</hi> that is, that you would aduance that foundation of learning and vertue, which you haue already laid: and that you would endeuour to couple together that rare

And if you shall please to accept this poore Peece in good part, you shall bind my care hereafter to present you with an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both worthier for the straine, and better su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with your qualitie.
