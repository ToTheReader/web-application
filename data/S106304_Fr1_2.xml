   <head>To all Ladies, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, and others, which loue true religion and vertue, and be deuoutlie disposed; Grace mercie, and peace, in Christ Iesus.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or a testimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the world, how I haue and doo (I praise God) bestowe the pretious treasure of time, euen now in the state of my virginitie or maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; lo heare I dedicate to all good Ladies, Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and others, who haue a desire to inuocate and call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the name of the Lord, a
<pb facs="3"/> small handfull of grose hearbs; which I haue presumed to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the garden of Gods most holie word. Not that there is anie vnpurenes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but that (peraduenture) my rudenes may be found to haue plucked them vp vnreuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and without zeale.</p>
   <p>Wherevpon of the learned I may be iudged grose and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; in presuming, without the counsell or helpe of anie, to take such an enterprise in hand: neuertheles, as GOD dooth know, I haue doone it with a good zeale, according to the weakenes of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and capacitie. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be not so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in taste, as they can find
<pb facs="3"/> out, to whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the spirit of learning: yet doo I trust, this small handfull of grose hearbs, holesome in operation and workeing, shall be no lesse acceptable before the maiestie of almightie God than the fragrant floures of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, gathered with more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
   <p>But without presumption I may boldlie saie, they haue not sought them with a more willing hart and feruent mind; nor more to the aduancement of Gods glorie, &amp; the desire of acceptation, than I haue doon. Which if I may obtaine, with the good iudgement and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of all my brethren and sisters in the Lord, I shall
<pb facs="4"/> thinke my time most happilie bestowed: for that thereby I did auoid idlenes, to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of almightie God; and haue gained those, whom I know not, as well strangers to me, as my acquaintance, to be my freends, that shall taste these grose hearbs with me.</p>
   <p>The Lord Iesus Christ, who moisteneth all his elect with his most pretious blood, giue vs all a sweete taste in him: whome I humblie beseech, from the bottome of my hart, to giue vnto those that are vertuouslie bent, a desire to increase therein; and those, which haue not yet reached therevnto, I praie the holie Ghost to inspire their hearts
<pb facs="4"/> from aboue, that they and we may be worthie to meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in the blessed king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our heauenlie father, which his deare sonne our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior Iesus Christ did purchase for vs; whose blessed name, with the liuing father, and the holie Ghost, be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and magnified now and for euer, Amen, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
