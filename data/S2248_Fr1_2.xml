   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, THE LORD ROBERT DEVOREVX, Earle of Essex and Ewe, Vicount Hereford, and Bourchier, Lord Ferrers and Chartly, Lord Bourchier, and Louaine, Knight of the noble Order of the Garter, Master of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Horse, and one of her Maiesties most Honorable priuie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell: grace and peace be multiplied.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a matter of great waight, and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie duety, Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, to consider wisely, and to iudge rightly of the workes of God, in the euent of thinges which happen vnto
<pb facs="3"/>men. For as it is written in the Psalmes:
<note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.17.</note>
      <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his waies, and holy in all his workes.</hi> And againe:
<note n="b" place="margin">107.43.</note>
      <hi>VVho is wise that hee may obserue these things? for they shall vnderstand the louing kindnesse of the Lorde.</hi> And againe:
<note n="c" place="margin">92.6.</note>
      <hi>An vnwise man knoweth it not, and a foole doth not vnderstand this.</hi> And seeing
<note n="d" place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36.</note> all thinges are of him, and thorow him, &amp; for him, and
<note n="e" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9.</note> in his owne might no man shall bee strong: but
<note n="f" place="margin">
         <hi>Psalm.</hi> 75.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33.11.</note> God is Iudge, hee maketh low, he maketh high; and that the counsell of the Lorde shall stand for euer, &amp; the thoughtes of his hart,
<note place="margin">Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in all things is to be obserued.</note> thoroughout all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: euery man ought carefully to regarde the prouidence of
<pb facs="3"/>God, in the thinges befalling to himself and others, which I find very fruitfully obserued by the holy seruaunts of GOD in the Scriptures. As Ioseph, when he sawe his Fathers house, in the time of the greate famine, to come into Egypt to buy foode, comforteth his brethren, who of enuie had solde him thither, with this obseruation, saying:
<note n="g" place="margin">
         <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.5.</note>
      <hi>Bee not sad, neither grieued with your selues, that ye sold me hither: for God did sende me before you, for your preseruation.</hi> And Dauid comforteth himselfe, and stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the rage of his seruaunt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the cursing of Shimei, by this consideration, saying,
<note n="h" place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.12</note>
      <hi>Jt may bee that God will looke vpon
<pb facs="4"/>mine affliction, &amp; do me good for his cursing this day.</hi> So Mordecai en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth Ester, to make sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the king (though it were contrarie to lawe, and in hazard of her life) in the behalf of the Iewes, who were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to die by wicked Haman: by such a wise collectiō among other wordes, saying:
<note n="a" place="margin">
         <hi>Ester.</hi> 4.14.</note>
      <hi>VVho knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdome for such a time?</hi> In like sorte, when I thinke vpon your honor, remembring what I haue heard of your noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that good Erle, in the time of his last sicknes, &amp; of his godly care ouer his children: compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereunto how God hath preserued you vnto this time,
<pb facs="4"/>what speciall fauour you haue attained before so gracious a Prince, in what an high &amp; waigh tie place you are set, &amp; in what yeares of your age these things are befallen you, together with the blessed giftes by which you are fitted thereunto: mine hart is touched with a comfortable hope, that the Lords grace wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king effectually in you, and his heauenly spirite directing you: you might be a worthie instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in faithfull and wise ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to her maiesty for the good of this common-wealth, &amp; the churches of Iesus Christ among vs. For if
<note n="b" place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 18.4.</note> Obadiah vnder wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Ahab, could keepe from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel, and feede an hundreth
<pb facs="5"/>Prophetes: and
<note n="c" place="margin">
         <hi>Iere.</hi> 38.8.9.</note> Ebedmelech could obtaine of that euill king Zedekiah, to deliuer Ieremie out of the dungeon, into which he was cast by the Princes with the kings consent: and
<note n="d" place="margin">
         <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.</note> Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah could apply the fauour he had with that heathenish King Artashasht, to the building of the walles of Hierusalem: who can tell? but that much more, such a noble man of Christian knowledge, aduanced by God into the fauour of so Christian and religious a princesse, may likewise performe some seruice of great importance, to the Church of God and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
   <p>And verily if God

<note n="i" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17.24</note> so to walke, as God hath distributed to euery man, as the Lorde hath called euery one, and therein to abide with God. Therfore

<pb facs="6"/>And Dauid,
<note n="l" place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.</note> though hee were a man after Gods heart: yet because he forgate his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement by God, &amp; his great benefits, and by deflowring his neighbours wife, &amp;c. disobeied God, and caused the enemies of God to blaspheme: was repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued sharply &amp; punished seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

      <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the eye of the Lord is vpon thē that feare him, and vpon them that trust in his mercie, to deliuer their soules from death, and to preserue them in famine.</hi> For this cause (right Honorable) haue I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to dedicate this small booke to your Honour, not onely because I am perswaded of your fauorable acceptation, but also that by mee being one among many, you might know what hope and expectation there is, among her Maiesties most faithfull subiects concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="8"/>you: that your yong yeres being sanctified, and (

And here I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie craue your Christian fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, to giue mee leaue to tell you, what the Lorde speaketh

      <hi>Be thou strong and of a most valiant courage, that thou mayst obserue and doe according to al the law, which Moses my seruant hath commanded thee: thou shalt not turne away from it, to the right hād, nor to the left, that thou maist prosper whither soeuer thou goest.

<pb facs="9"/>the profound works set foorth by rare and singular men, but as a little candle to bee placed in the midst of the house, to giue light to all them that are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And as in the worke of the materiall Temple vnder Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<note n="c" place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.2.</note> hewers of stones had a necessary vse: so this little book may bee some good helpe, to prepare the seueral members of the familie, for the skilfull buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that is, the
<note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.</note> faithful mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to be ioined as liuely stons in the spirituall temple of God. For as the Psalmist doth testifie:

<note n="g" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27.</note> God hath chosen foolish thinges of the world to confound the wise, &amp; God hath chosen weake thinges of the world to confound the mighty, &amp;c. And to whom should I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the booke of teaching the familie? but euen to him, whose houshold being well instructed, ordered, &amp; guided, may diuers waies doe good vnto many of all estates and degrees: yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to him, who knoweth verie well, how needfull a thing it is in regarde of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: which in troublesome
<pb facs="10"/>times doth find, that a Christian Prince cannot be sure of such a peoples faithfulnes, in dayes of triall: whose bellies being fedde with the fatte of the earth, haue mindes vnsetled; and for lacke of the knowledge of Christ, and the feare of God, are apt to go after the sway of time, and to bee led as beastes by the bellie, where most ease, gaine, &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure shall draw them. Therefore nothing doubting, but that your godly wisedom, and good knowledge of Christ Iesus, will graciously receiue any thing, that may be helpful to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion and godlines: I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this little booke vnto your Honour, with al humblenes and

Most meekely pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diuine goodnes to make you honorable in this world, in all pietie and Christian vertues, to the glory of his name, the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour of your Prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to the reioycing of all good christians: &amp; in the world to come, to bee partaker of his glory: who shall be glorified in his Saintes, and made maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in all that beleeue.
