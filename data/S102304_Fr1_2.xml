      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Pilgrime of <hi>Sion,</hi> having beene beaten with the stormes and tempests of a long persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beyond the Seas, after hee had learnt the sweetnesse, and tasted the goodnesse and Debonayritie, which makes your Nation and Nobility of <hi>England</hi> honourable, and recommendable to all the foure corners of the Vniverse, hee is at last arrived in your Ports and Harbours, to shelter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the waves and windes, which so
<pb facs="3"/>
cruelly had beaten and assayled him, as they would not permit him, either to feede, or rest. But casting anchor here in your Harbours, I finde that Fame hath infinitely wronged her selfe, in not having sufficiently discoursed, and published the excellencie of your goodnesse and merits: Shee seemes to be sparing of your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which are so justly due to you; For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath now made mee know a thousand times more therof, thē heretofore I heard or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, because I find so much benignity and goodnesse among you, and especially your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours house, that I should e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>teeme my selfe to be guilty of a base ingr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>titude, if I consecrated not the remaynder of my dayes to the honour of your service and commands; For I confesse, that this small Present, which I now present and proffer you, cannot counter vaile or equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize those sublime favours; whereby you have eternally made me your debter.</p>
   <p>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se Philosophers, which entreat and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of naturall causes, doe affirme, That the Sunne which makes the Raynebowe in the firmament, by the darting and defusion of his rayes, in a watry clowd disposed to receive it;
<pb facs="3"/>
doth there forme and ingender this diversity of colours so pleasing to our sight. Your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (my good Lord) is the Sunne of my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, and I am this clowd covered with the rayes of your favours, which makes all the world admire in me, the greatnesse of your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity, and the excellencie of your goodnes.</p>
   <p>But herein (notwithstanding) consists not my satisfaction, but rather your honour and glory, and as I desire to publish that, so I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise desire to finde this; For I cannot live contented, if I made not a publique acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of those many favours, whereby you have perfectly purchased and made me yours, and this Confession consisteth in the oath of fidelity and obedience, which I have sworne to the honour of your service, and to testifie the the immortality of my vowes, wherein with all possible humility I present you my selfe, and this small Booke to your Honours feete; A worke proportionable to my weakenesse, but meerely disproportionable to your Greatnesse.</p>
   <p>If I am any way guilty herein, your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is the true cause thereof; in regard it makes me beleeve that you will rather excuse
<pb facs="4"/>
my zeale, then accuse or condemne my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption▪ and I doe promise my selfe this hope, and flatter my selfe with this confidence, that your Honour will partly excuse this worke of mine, if it be not accuratly or delicately po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and that the will remayning where the power wants, is free and current payment with great and generous spirits.</p>
   <p>Some perchance may affirme and say, that I have discoursed &amp; treated those Matters with too much simplicity, which indeede is my onely intent and designe. Because my text and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> necessarily oblige and tye me thereunto, as also in regard I ever finde the easiest way to be the best, for that the thornes of Studie and Schollership, doe but ingage and ingulph our Witts in the labyrinth of insupportable length and languishment, and the which most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly when wee have all done and ranne tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, wee in the end finde but a Minotaur of doubts, and a pensive melancholy anxietie which devoures them. My Lord, I have no other designe or ambition in this my Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to pay this tribute to your Honour, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that your charities will cover my defects,
<pb facs="4"/>
and your goodnesse over-vayle and pardon my weakenesse and imperfections.</p>
   <p>And my Lord, it is with all manner of right and reason, that I consecrate and inscribe this small Worke of mine to your Honour, and place your Honourable name in the Frontispice thereof, as a bright Phare and relucent torch, which shall communicate and lend its lustre and light, to make it see and salute the world.</p>
   <p>And so my good Lord, I will seeke my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in the honour of your service; my incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations shall have no other centre, but the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of your commaunds. My vowes and prayers shall bee incessantly powred forth for your prosperities; and my Ambition shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver flye or soare higher, then to conserue the honour of your favours, and to be both to your Honour, and to the young Noblemen your Sonnes,</p>
