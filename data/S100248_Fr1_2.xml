Example, a thing much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented of all people, because it concerneth all, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how the thrice worthy and needfull faculties of Physick and Chirurgerie are abused, which farre exceed all other faculties, Divine precept excepted, for there is as much difference betweene this and all other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as betweene the body and the garment: if we cannot forbeare the builders of houses, much lesse the Repayrers of our sick, sore, and decayed bodies. If we build an house, we seek not to a Taylor, or a Weaver to do it, but to one skilfull in that Profession: if so, why do we seek to the Ignorant for health, which know not what Health is, nor how to preserve it, and being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, know not which way to help it? but we should not prize our health at so low a rate, being so precious a

jewell: For what joy have they in this life, which lye in extreame paines, miserie, and torment for want of health, who do not prize health before wealth, but now behold the intolerable abuse with an inundant deluge of over-whelming make-shifts or smoothing syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, fit to be unmasked, and repressed, worthy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niishment, being a rabble of idle droans swarming in all places of the Kingdome, practising Physick and Chyrurgerie, making it a fanctuarie of idlenesse to the dishonour of God, and great hurt to the people, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the vulgar sort; they being unable to distinguish the learned and expert from the ignorant Impostor, which lyeth lurking, watching a fit opportunity to seaze on some prey to maintaine a wicked and idle life: and not onely those male-kinde, of caterpillars, but also we have now a huge swarme of petticoat Physitians and Chyrurgians, being tatling gossips, who being frequent among sicke folks, and hearing the advice and counsell of the learned and expert physitian prescribing many fit things to his Patient, as diet, and also the making of julips, barley-water, broths, jellies, almund-milk, cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, and divers things necessarie for to comfort the sicke Patient. Hereupon these audacious gossips will give syrups, senae, Rubarb, Cassia, Manna, Aloes, &amp;c. and not onely clysters, but also strong purges, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and those no more fit for the disease, but by chance, than its possible for a Shoe-maker to make shoes fit for every mans foot upon one Last: If these learned faculties were so easily attained, as these idle wretches account them, surely they may well know, that men would never bestow so long time and great charges in studie, and learning to attaine the deepe knowledge
<pb facs="3"/>
herein, which they do for Gods glory, and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries good. How then dare this godlesse crue, offer to minister medicines from so slender a ground-worke? some of these get medicines by relation of others, or by reading many medicines in books which please their palates; having no ground to shew why this or that medicine is fit, but imagination onely, able to yeeld no reason how or why it should do good? I grieve to thinke that people should be so sottish to neglect the counsell and good advice of the wise, learned, expert, and skilfull Artists (that have searched out the very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of nature, to do good) to hearken to the subtle sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene-songs of Sycophants, whose eyes are as sharpe as Lynx, who is said to see an hundred miles: so are many of these as sharp set for gaines, and some for applause: how unworthy soever, these wretches swarme in every Towne and Village, and hereby they leave the counsell of the learned and expert, to follow and aske counsell of an Asse, which know not with what, nor how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any cure, but by great chance, as the blinde man shot the Crow; but if it happen a cure to be performed under their hands that brings no small applause of the vulgar, what a miracle there is done, truly I am also of that minde, indeed that it is a miracle that it had that successe, they being so unable to yeeld any reason how it came so to passe, which the learned and expert Artist can do: also these idle rabble will warrant to cure any thing they undertake to finger money be it never so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be done: it is the office of God, and not of man to warrant any, but its very frequent with these make-shifts and idle crue, to do all: the expert do not so, but use that which is fit, and leave the successe to the
<pb facs="4"/>
divine power, using his painfull diligence and industrie advisedly, and skilfully.</p>
   <p>I do not here taxe nor ranke among this rabble of Idlers, those charitable and well-disposed people, which in the absence of the learned or expert Physitian or Chirurgion, do give some comfortable things, whose vertues or helps they know by experience to do good in the like case, to comfort a friend or a neighbour till better help may be had, or in charitie to help the poore that have not wherewith to pay for their cure, leaving all other to the learned and expert in those worthy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, who know best how to deale with them rightly: and commonly these charitable people have this care, if they see their medicines prevaile not, they advise them that be able speedily to seeke better helpe, knowing that delayes breed danger. But the above-said wicked crue will never give them over so long as they can finger any undeserved reward, holding them on with false promises for money, and then leave them miserably to their fortunes when their money is gone: or left uncurable, which peradventure alone might at the first, or by the skilfull Artist have beene prevented, a thing sooner to be lamented then redressed. Also I know many of those well-disposed charitable people above-said chiefly in Chirurgerie (wherein the eye must direct the hand) do performe many very despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and dangerous cures by their experience, when many that make great shew with their painted sheath come short in their performance, that should shew better fruits: the cause I know not, whether neglect, ignorance or arrogancy shortē Gods blessing, not taking him along with them. God bids us begin with him first, and then
<pb facs="4"/>
what he hath promised to such, I need not to relate▪ Scripture saith, God hideth things from the wise and prudent, &amp; openeth them to babes &amp; sucklings: I accuse none, but let us all examine our selves fully, and in what we finde our selves defective, first seek to God for his grace and assistance, and then carefully with full resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diligence in our selves, seek to amend what we finde amisse in us, that God may blesse our endeavours, to his owne glory, the patients good, and our comforts. And thus praying to God that the well-doers may be protected, and that rabble of idle Syeophants and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors may be abolished, to Gods glory, and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries good, I do here abruptly cease.</p>
