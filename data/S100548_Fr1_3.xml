                 <title>The trve ancient Roman Catholike : Being an apology or covnterproofe against Doctor Bishops Reproofe of the defence of the Reformed Catholike. The first part. Wherein the name of Catholikes is vindicated from popish abuse, and thence is shewed that the faith of the Church of Rome as now it is, is not the Catholike faith, nor the same with the faith commended in the Epistles of St. Peter and St. Paul, and that confirmed by the testimony of the ancient Bishops of Rome, and other writers of that church.

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hov hast here, good Christian Reader, the first Part of the worke which I promised, <hi>The true ancient Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</hi> Thou maiest remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that in my answere to Doctor <hi>Bishops</hi> Epistle to the King, I challenged the name of <hi>Catholiks</hi> from the Popish abuse thereof, and shewed out of the true explication and vse of the word <hi>Catholike,</hi> that neither the Church of Rome can be called <hi>the Catholike Church,</hi> nor the faith of the Roman Church that now is can be called <hi>the Catholike faith,</hi> and therefore that very fondly, and by a
<pb facs="7"/> meere vsurpation they take vnto them the name of <hi>Catholikes.</hi> After this I entred by occasion to a comparison betwixt the new that is, and that that of old was the religion of the Church of Rome, consisting special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of three parts. In the first I shewed that neither the Epistle of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, which is the briefe of the religion which they at the first receiued, and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as I shewed out of <hi>Theodoret, all manner doctrine of faith,</hi> nor yet the two Epistles of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> whom they make the founder of their Church, doe containe any defence of the doctrine now taught at Rome, but doe teach only our religion. In the second I set downe sundry definitions and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the ancient Roman faith, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Bishops of Rome and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, that haue witnessed the doctrine of that Church, wholly consonant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that that we teach, and altogether impugned by the Roman Church that now is. In the third I declared that there were sundry heresies, condemned of old by the Roman Church, which the Church of
<pb facs="7"/> Rome now embraceth and defendeth. The points of this comparison I then set downe only positiuely, the occasion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no more, not respecting what cauilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the aduersary might bring for oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof; the matter being by that light that I gaue very cleare, that the Church of Rome is not now the same that it was of old. This matter I afterwards thought worthy of a larger treatise, and purposed when opportunity should serue a more full prosecution of it, thinking it would bee a great comfort and establishment to the consciences of many men, perhaps to some an occasion of better minde, when they should see in that Church of Rome, that now is such a plain repugnancy to that that of old was, which notwithstanding taketh vpon it impudently to haue beene alwaies the same, and to bee the only certaine rule and oracle of true faith. In this meane time Doctor <hi>Bishop</hi> fearing lest his silence should make his cause suspicious, and therefore thinking it necessary, whether right or wrong, to say somewhat, publi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

      <hi>A Reproofe of the defence of the Reformed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,</hi> setting vnder this title a Gorgons head to affright all men concerning me, as hauing <hi>abused Gods sacred word, mangled, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed, and falsified the ancient Fathers sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, so that whosoeuer hath any due care of his owne saluation, can neuer hereafter credit me in matter of faith and religion.</hi> Concerning which hideous outcry of my falsifications, I referre thee to <hi>the Aduertisement,</hi> which I haue added to my <hi>third part of the defence of the Reformed Catholike,</hi> where thou shalt see that as hee hath laied himselfe open, so I haue scourged him accordingly. But in that <hi>Reproofe</hi> of his, very little is it that hee hath said for iustifying what he himselfe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore written, not being able indeede to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any one point thereof: only he found somewhat whereof to cauill concerning my debating of the name <hi>Catholike,</hi> and the comparison which I made betwixt the old and new Roman Church, and thereof, as touching the matter of substance, he hath framed his booke. To this therefore I haue addressed my description of <hi>the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="8"/> Catholike,</hi> forbearing that more orderly course which I had intended, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this worke, and choosing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to follow him steppe by steppe, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I haue done; only beginning where hee commeth to the purpose, and leauing all his vagaries and affected discourses to be more briefly touched in the end of all. Of this worke I haue yet finished but only one part, wherin I haue at large discouered their vaine ostentation of the Catholike name and faith, and shewed plainely that the Romish religion now accordeth not with <hi>S. Pauls</hi> Epistle to the Romans, no, nor with his other Epistles, which <hi>M. Bishop</hi> calleth to assist him, because he findeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to helpe him in that Epistle to the Romans. In all which I haue beene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, gentle Reader, to giue thee satisfaction by the cleare testimony either of some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Bishops of Rome, or of some other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously approued and commended in that Church. Being now required a seruice of another kinde, so that I cannot yet goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the rest, I haue thought good to
<pb facs="9"/> publish this in the meane time. If I haue promised any thing in this that is not here performed, expect it in that that is to come. Assist me, I pray thee, with thy prayers vnto almighty God, by whose grace I hope in due time to supply that that is wanting now▪</p>
