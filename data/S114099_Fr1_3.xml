   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as much (gentle Reader) as nothing is more necessary and profitable to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, yea more plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sing to God: then is the faithfull prayers of his elect. And because all in the church, haue not like measure of knowledge: to know eyther for what: or after what manner to pray, I haue thought it good for the benefit of such weake ones, to set forth this exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lordes prayer: which is the absolute for me of all holy prayers, the doctrines I haue drawne from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meaning of the wordes, as they are set downe in the holy Hebrew of S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes</hi> gospell, vsing no curiositie in method: but handling euery word as it lyeth in order in the text, which is the
<pb facs="6"/> plainest, and easiest, for the capacity of the simpler sort, that can be: And for their better vnderstanding how to pray, I haue prefixed certaine circumstances of prayer, which are seriously to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of euery one that will pray aright. Lastly to the end of the Lordes prayer, I haue added a table, shewing thee the agreement of the Lordes prayer with the ten commaundementes. And whereas in reading, thou shalt see this marke *. At the beginning of any sentence, looke on the margent, and it sheweth thee the writer, from whence that sentence was borrowed: and because that some may thinke my enterprise bould, yea and this my doing to be altogether needelesse, in as much as I haue but busied my selfe, with that which my betters haue both learnedly taught, and writ: the which notwithstanding, we still continuing in our security, and carelesnesse, thinking in
<pb facs="6"/> our prosperity, we shall neuer be cast downe: putting farre from vs the euill day, which amongst many, is the most desperate disease to the soule, that can be. Also considering with my selfe, the duty I owe to God, remembring, how euery one must giue an account how he hath vsed his talent: yea religion bindeth me to haue a louing care of the saluation of my brethren, and the duty and loue I beare to the church, wherein I liue, and of which I am a member: these and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more such like reasons, cause me to say, the loue of God in Christ Iesus constraines me to speake that I doe: and with the Apostles in the Acts, I cannot chuse but speake the things I haue heard and seene. Neyther gentle reader, let this worke seeme to thee superfluous, because some learned haue entreated of the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before, we see by lamentable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience how soone their learned labours
<pb facs="7"/> are forgot, and how seldome put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, therefore we cannot heare a good thing too often, nor learne it too well. And I beseech God for his sonnes sake to take the scales from our eyes, that our affections may be illuminated, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strengthened in the inner man: may the better discharge so waighty a duty as praier is. Read this booke, (christian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) with a single eye, not onely so much to know, as to practise: and to be penitent for that which hath beene amisse: and that humility, and meeknes, dwelling in thy soule, God may guide thy iudgement, and teach thee in his way▪ and that thou <note place="margin">
