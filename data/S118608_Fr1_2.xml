                 <title>Phraseologia puerilis, Anglo-Latina, in usum tirocinii scholastici. Or, selected Latine and English phrases : wherein the purity and propriety of both languages is expressed. Very usefull for young Latinists, to prevent barbarismes, and bald Latine-making, and to initiate them in speaking and writing elegantly in both languages. By I. Clarke B.D. and Master of the Free Schoole in Lincolne</title>

      <salute>Good <hi>Reader,</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>E pleased for thy better dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the use of this <hi>Pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilis Phraseologia</hi> to take notice,</p>
   <p n="1">
      <hi>1.</hi> That the English of each Latine phrase in the propriety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is printed together with the Latine, in the other columne of the same page, that so thou maist see and shew thy Scholars, the force of each expression: where some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also thou meetest with two Englishes to one Latine phrase, <hi>&amp; è contrà.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="2">
      <hi>2.</hi> That when thou hast caused thy Scholars throughly to reade over, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use both the Latine and the English Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation (which they must know is not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball or grammaticall) thou maist cause them to fold downe the columne, or lay a
<pb facs="3"/>
paper upon it, and by trying their memory, maist see where and when they misse in rendring and repeating the same, out of the English into the Latine, <hi>&amp; contrà.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="3">
      <hi>3.</hi> That I conceive it most profitable for the beginners, to learne all the phrases without booke, which done, let some one in a forme take the booke and appose his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in the same forme, and thou shalt see how they will with great emulation and delight ambitiously strive to answere.</p>
   <p n="4">
      <hi>4.</hi> That it will quite for cost, to cause them to <hi>construe</hi> and <hi>parse</hi> each phrase <hi>verbatim,</hi> for so they will soone perceive the absurdity of their owne base and bald translating <hi>verbatim,</hi> and will take paines to looke out for equipollent Latine expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for their English, <hi>&amp; contrà.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="5">
      <hi>5.</hi> That thou maist take here and there the English phrase, and compose some short continued speech or interloquutory Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, and make them strive to render it, in the idiome or propriety of the Latine phrase, which thou shalt soone finde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to benefit them in speaking and
<pb facs="3"/>
understanding the peculiarity of phrase in the Latine Tongue.</p>
   <p>And for some further light heerein, (if this suffice not) there be contrived se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Dialogues in the third Edition of my <hi>Dux Grammaticus,</hi> whereby thou maist bee fully instructed concerning the use of these elegant Phrases or fragments of speech, in making of Latines, wherein I make no question but thou shalt soone reape singular benefit, and by a neerer cut and more expedition, discover to thy Scholars all the elegancies of Grammar and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and beate them off from all barbarous and bald Anglicismes, or Latinismes, in speaking or writing; which how much it may conduce to the common good in the training up of Scholars in this way, I leave to the judicious to imagine: and to almighty God who doth please abundantly to blesse his painfull servants, and crowne their labours with happy successe.</p>
