   <head>The Argument.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>DIvine Poesie</hi> (the Secretary of Nature) is
sent by Fate to <hi>Indamora,</hi> Queene of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singa,</hi>
to signifie the time prefix'd was come,
when by the influence of her beauty (attended with
those lesser lights, her Contributary Ladies) the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Chast Love should be re-established in this Island;
which Temple being long sought for by certaine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians
(enemies to chast Love) intending to use it to
their intemperate ends, was by <hi>Divine Poesie</hi> hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in mists and clouds; so as the Magicians being
frustrate of their hopes, sought by enchantments to
hinder all others from finding it; and by this impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
many Nohle Knights and Ladies had been temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and mis-led. The fame of this Temple of Loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
quickly spread over all the Easterne world, enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a company of noble Persian youths, borderers on
India to travell in quest of it; who arriving, were by
the illusions of the Magicians, and their spirits of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Regions, almost seduced, as others had beene:
But <hi>Divine Poesie</hi> appearing, discover'd unto them
some part of the Temple unshadow'd, and prophecied
<pb facs="3"/>
of the time when <hi>Indamora</hi> and her traine should
arrive to effect this miracle; which though it seemes
somewhat hard Doctrine to most young men, yet these
being spirits of the highest ranke, forsaking the false
Magicians and their allurements, were resolved to
entertaine themselves to contemplate on this Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
untill the comming of the glorious Indian Queen.
At whose sight they being inspir'd with chast flames
might be permitted by their faithfull observance and
legitimate affections to enter and enjoy the privileges
of that sacred Temple. Then <hi>Divine Poesie</hi> sends
<hi>Orpheus</hi> her chiefe Priest in a Barque (assisted by
the Brachman<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and Priests of the Temple, who meet
him on the shores) to calme the Seas with his Harpe,
that a maritime Chariot prepared by the Indian Sea-gods,
might safer, and more swiftly convay them to
atchieve this Noble <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>dventure; after whose landing
having paid their Ceremonies by moving in harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
and numerous figures, <hi>Sunesis</hi> and <hi>Thelema</hi>
(which intimate the understanding and the will) joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
together, the true Temple appeares, and Chast
Love descends to invoke the last and living Heroe
(<hi>Indamora's</hi> royall Lover) that hee may helpe and
witnesse the Consecration of it.</p>
