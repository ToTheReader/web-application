   <head>THE PREFACE, OR INTRODVCTION: WHEREIN THE AVTHOR DOTH HVMBLY SVBMIT THESE his labours vnto the godly, and most iudicious censure of the right Reuerend Father in God, RICHARD VAVGHAN, Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie and Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> his very honourable good Lord.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Onorable, and right reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the mercie of <hi>God</hi> hath alvvaies abounded towards his Church, in giuing her <hi>Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scriptures,</hi> as a light that shineth in a darke place: so verie seldome haue there been wanting godly Prophets, who by diligent search haue so dressed these lights, that they haue shined to all that were about them, for their directions in the greatest mutations and difficulties. For the most part, vntill the time of the Apostles, this kinde of studie was so frequent and familiar, not onely to the good, but also to the bad; that many times it seemed <hi>Elisha</hi> was not dead,<note place="margin">2. King. 6.12.</note> that <hi>tolde the words which the King spake in his priuie chamber.</hi> Howbeit, though neuer Church had prophecies so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb facs="6"/> and plaine, as this of Christ hath vnder the Gospell; yet am I perswaded (I speake at your Lordships correction) that no age hath been so ignorant in the true vnderstanding of such as concerned their times, as (for of long after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles) the <hi>Christian</hi> Church hath been. For as all the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of the New Testament, which are many, haue been esteemed difficult: so this booke of the <hi>Reuelation</hi> hath been held impregnable.</p>
   <p>Now it is a part of <hi>S. Pauls apologie</hi> to the Elders of <hi>Ephesus:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 20.27.</note>
      <hi>I haue shewed you all the counsel of God.</hi> The diduction from thence, bindeth all the Ministerie to endeuour the like, aswell in Propheticall, as Dogmaticall Scriptures. I haue therefore somewhat laboured in this kinde, but principally in this booke; and that (all praise be giuen to the Father of lights) to mine owne satisfaction in such sort, as that many godly men haue desired to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in my contentment herein.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.32.</note>But the Scripture commandeth, that the <hi>Spirit of the Prophets be subiect to the Prophets;</hi> forbidding all to beleeue, or teach any thing, that will not endure the censure of the Prophets. The rather ought I to subiect that which I haue done herein, vnto your Lordships godly and learned censure, as a Father among the Prophets, because I haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in this kinde, in a different manner from the rest of the Interpreters. If your Lordship like it, I haue enough. If you correct me,<note place="margin">Psal. 141.5.</note> where I erre, though you smite me I will take it kindly, and when any shall say vnto me, <hi>What are these wounds in thy hands?</hi>
      <note place="margin">Zach. 13.6.</note> I will answere, <hi>Thus was I wounded in the house of my friends.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>For the better direction of your Lordships graue and learned censure, I will communicate some part of my thoughts herein: for mine affectation of breuitie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="6"/> reasons of consequence, haue caused me to suppresse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of good importance.</p>
   <p>When I first tooke the Booke in hand to studie it, I saw it was generally accused by friend and foe, for inextricable hardnes. But when I read the text, and saw the title to be a<note n="a" place="margin">cap. 1.1.</note>
      <hi>Reuelation,</hi> which is the<note n="b" place="margin">1. Sam. 2.17.</note> cleerest and plainest kinde of teaching, the<note n="c" place="margin">cap. 1.2.</note>
      <hi>Reader</hi> to be <hi>blessed,</hi> and the Booke to be<note n="d" place="margin">cap. 22.10.</note>
      <hi>vnsealed,</hi> I durst not obiect any difficultie to the Booke; but began to inquire how it came to passe, that it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted so hard.</p>
   <p>The <hi>phrase,</hi> though strange in appearance, is meerely propheticall. The <hi>method,</hi> though closely couched, is very Logicall. Wherefore the fault must be laid elsewhere, and not vpon the Booke, that it seemeth so darke and difficult.</p>
   <p>The reasons of the hardnes, vpon diligent considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I resolued were these, amongst others.</p>
   <p>First, the iudgements of men haue been of long so fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled with the doctrine, that the signes of the latter day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are come, that the Interpreters haue laboured to finde the accomplishment of the Booke in the stories past. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many things were not yet fulfilled, they knew not where they were when they tooke the booke in hand. They that in this age doe straine their wits, to see who can bring first newes of <hi>Christs</hi> last comming, besides that they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure this booke, they would haue vs to breake the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of <hi>Christ,</hi> when many shall say,<note place="margin">Luk. 21.8.</note>
      <hi>The time draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth neere,</hi> doth enioyne vs thus: <hi>Follow ye not them therefore.</hi> As also to violate the rule of the Apostle, which is, <hi>not to be troubled by any deceit,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2.1.2</note>
      <hi>as if the day of Christ were at hand,</hi> till <hi>Antichrist</hi> haue all things fulfilled vpon him, which are written in this <hi>Reuelation. S. Peter</hi> seemeth to giue the reason, when he sheweth that
<pb facs="7"/> the vntimely vrging of the last comming of Christ,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.3.4.</note> would be the mother of <hi>Atheisme.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when many doe vndertake to interpret the booke, they misse in the first foundation of their labour. For whereas it is most euident, that the booke is meerely prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, foreshewing the particulars of things present and to come; some of the Writers haue fled from this ground, vpon which onely there can be a safe building set vp, and haue laboured to make it <hi>Dogmaticall,</hi> containing certaine points of doctrine, handled before more largely and more plainly in the rest of the Scriptures: which cannot be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without some aduantage to the enemies of the truth; nor without some misbeseeming imputations to the holie Ghost, by whose direction the booke is written.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, many doe labour to make the booke an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Historie, from the birth, or preaching, or ascension of <hi>Christ:</hi> but mistaking the time when to begin, they put the whole storie cleane out of ioynt. Besides, by that proiect, they commit this absurditie, to say, that the things which were spoken and done in the eares and eyes of all men in the time of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> were in the time of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> so closely <hi>sealed,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cap. 5.3.</note> as that <hi>none in heauen, nor in earth, nor vnder the earth was able to open them, nor looke thereon.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, some of the Interpreters haue laboured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Seales, Trumpets and Phials to certaine numbers of yeeres: but seeing the text in many places doth giue vs the knowledge of the visions, by the onely diuersitie of the mutations which befall the Church; wee may not tie our selues to numbers, but onely where the text doth bound the mutations with numbers.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, when as godly men had truly found, that the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
<pb facs="7"/> and corruptions of the Church of Rome, are liuely described in some parts of the booke, they haue also laboured to applie all the texts to Rome, which doe containe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription and properties of the enemies of the Church. But because in the booke is also handled of other enemies; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that the booke is obscured by this course, the enemie is aduantaged that espieth our weaknes, and the propheticall spirit is very much preiudiced; which being more generall, is wronged by restraint.</p>
   <p>Sixtly, the Historians, who in the iudgements of all men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> are to be best helpes, first haue bin carelesse in setting downe the exact times of the occurrences, which they write of; so that somtimes it is worke more than enough to agree them. And then they haue rather consulted with their friends, than with <hi>S. Iohn</hi> for the heads of their obseruations. For the most of them doe labour rather to magnifie their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones, and to set a glasse vpon a faction, than to deliuer the truth. Hereby it commeth to passe, that hee that readeth most of them, shall be sure to finde much wearines to the flesh; howsoeuer he may happily here and there finde a wise and vpright sentence.</p>
   <p>Seuenthly, there hath been found no age, till of late, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> free from ostentation and selfe-loue, but that the leaders of the times haue made it as good as mortall, to reprooue the monstrous conditions of the time, which are liuely descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed here by the true interpretation of this booke: so that vpon paine of death it must be made to speake nothing at all, or any thing, rather than against the time, whatsoeuer be the truth.</p>
   <p>Eightly, some also haue not let to blaspheme this kinde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> of studie as phantasticall and curious; containing either verie little, or that which <hi>God</hi> hath put in his owne and
<pb facs="8"/> onely power; and that no doctrine can be enforced out of Scriptures of this kinde.</p>
   <p>Lastly, these things, together with the multitude of bookes to be read, (which neither pouertie can prouide, nor weaknes studie) and the want of due conference of this booke with the former prophecies, to whom it sendeth his reader, I take to be some of the effectuall reasons, which haue impeached the labours of many herein.</p>
   <p>It remaineth now that I giue an accompt how I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that the proiect, which I haue laid, is the onely true and easie meanes of vnderstanding the booke.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, the text doth say, that it serueth <hi>to shew the things,</hi>
      <note place="margin">cap. 1.1.</note>
      <hi>which must shortly be done.</hi> Whereupon I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>THE THINGS DONE ARE THE BOOKE.</hi> Wherefore of force it doth follow, that the visions may, and onely must, be enlightened, by the carefull application of <hi>ALL</hi> the Ecclesiasticall histories vnto them.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the things are shewed <hi>to the seruants of God.</hi> Then must <hi>the seruants of God</hi> tell vs what they haue seene, if we meane to know them. And so we despise the iudgements of them in this booke, which persecute the seruants of God, be they otherwise for learning as profound as the diuell.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>the time was at hand</hi> of the prophecie. For <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was to <hi>write the things which were in action,</hi>
      <note place="margin">cap. 1.9. cap. 1.19.</note> at the time of his writing, <hi>and the things which were to come afterwards.</hi> Wherefore, without all question, <hi>the booke was to begin when it was first published.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Vpon these three grounds I am bold to conclude, that <hi>The booke is a perfect Ecclesiasticall historie,</hi>
      <note place="margin">NB. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Reuelation.</note>
      <hi>shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the seruants of God, containing whatsoeuer is materiall in the Church, from the time of the being
<pb facs="8"/> of S. Iohn in Patmos, to the end of the world.</hi> So that nothing of importance can bee found in the <hi>Christian</hi> world, which may not be referred to some part of this booke, as to his proper head; from whence it is to receiue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie whether it be true or false; and also such due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and censure, that it must be esteemed to be good or bad, according as the booke doth iudge.</p>
   <p>Of which my assertion, I find not any of the Interpreters greatly to doubt; yet none of thē (that I know) hath attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to see, how he can make the text, and all stories of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance so to agree, that the collection of the mutations, with their causes and effects, may seeme worthie the holy Ghost. Wherefore, though I doe acknowledge my selfe euery way the most vnfit of all others; yet rather than it should be vndone, I haue thought good to gesse at it, as well as God hath ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me, with the small Librarie, and other meane helpes, which my poore estate would affoord me.</p>
   <p>Your Lordship may not looke here for a perfect <hi>Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> and interpretation of the whole booke; for that is a worke for a iust and full Commentarie, which here I promise not: but haue onely minded a generall disposing of the text for the storie: and therefore was not to be diligent, either in the preparations to the visions, or in the Scriptures not yet accomplished. What I thinke of the rest not greatly touched here, (as of the first fiue Chapters, containing the things which were in hand in the time of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that which was to follow; what of the <hi>sixt</hi> and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Phials,</hi> &amp;c. which import the confederacie of both religions, against the incursions of the <hi>Turkes;</hi> the great incredible and fearfull stirres that are yet to be betweene the <hi>Romanists</hi> and the godly; and of the diuision of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists among themselues; and what of the rest of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb facs="9"/> which containeth the golden and happie daies of the Church, and the new troubles which shall arise when <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist</hi> is cast into hell; of the precise computation of the time, of as many of these things as is to be made by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the text:) I hope it will not be looked for here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the nature of this Treatise doth not require it: yet happily, by the blessing of <hi>God,</hi> may hereafter appeare, if none doe better preuent me; which I much desire. That which I say my selfe, is, that by this proiect I haue bin able readily to reduce all stories of importance, to their certaine heads of the <hi>Reuelation:</hi> and to see the drifts and deuices of many writers, and some other persons, before I saw the particulars in themselues. And also to gesse trulie before hād of the future effects of some things, which, for any thing I could perceiue, were in mans reason to fall out otherwise.</p>
   <p>That which I haue done, I submit in the feare of <hi>God,</hi> not onely vnto your Lordship, but also vnto all such godlie Fathers and brethren of the Ministerie, who in the feare of <hi>God</hi> doe handle or regard his word. For the ignorant, as I doe much desire their edification; so I neglect their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. The scornefull reiections of the malicious and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie that neglecteth, and with scoffing cauils and railings maligneth whatsoeuer doth not make for his phantasie and partialitie, I esteeme as such reproofes, as I will weare for a garland. As for the harsh phrase and haste in translations, seeing I seeke matter, whether digested, or congested, the godly will excuse.</p>
   <p>That which I would first admonish the diligent Reader of, is this. The booke hath a double method. First is set down the drift of <hi>God,</hi> in disposing the things of the <hi>Church,</hi> in the manner which he hath done; and this reacheth from the beginning, to the end of the eleuenth chapter. Secondly
<pb facs="9"/> is shewed the drift of the <hi>Diuell</hi> in his proceedings against the <hi>Church,</hi> in the twelfth and thirteenth chapters, and part of the twentith chapter. The rest, to the end, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of such things, as were briefly touched in some former chapters. In my Treatise I haue for shortnes and cleerenes ioyned both the methods in one, and put the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations into the places for which they serue.</p>
   <p>The next thing I would admonish, is, that I haue diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Treatise into seuerall periods and chapters; not according to the chapters of the booke, but according to the diuersitie of the mutations. Thirdly, that in gathering of the stories, I haue not tied my selfe to the whole discourse word for word, for it would haue growne to too great a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, but haue briefed them for case. And where I thinke the Authors censure of the times doth agree with the text, I keepe it. Where the writer, by ignorance or partialitie, doth misse in his discerning, I take the briefe of the storie, and passe by his opinion, excepting in some very few places plain enough to be discerned. Furthermore, where the Historians in their bookes doe follow the succession of yeeres and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, I hold it sufficient to name the author, committing the reader to the easie direction of the yeere and person: but where any thing might seeme combersome to finde, I haue bin more plaine, giuing readie helpe to such as haue bookes of the same edition which I followed. Thus leauing my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not onely to the touchstone, but also to the test, I pray for your Lordships happines, and the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
