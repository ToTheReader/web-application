That which is past is shewed in a briefe ecclesiasticall historie, containing most of the mutations which haue befallen the Church, from the yeere of our Lord 97, vnto the yeere 1603. as they haue been shewed vnto S. Iohn in Patmos, and recorded by such historiographers as are of least suspected faith. Gathered by William Symonds, sometimes fellow of Magdalen Colledge in Oxford</title>

      <hi>there is but one God, one faith,</hi> &amp;c. So that though<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 9.24.</note>
      <hi>many runne at the price, yet but one obtaineth it.</hi> The great Question is among vs all, which side hath the <hi>true God, and true faith,</hi> and who shall get the price. In this contention none are so feruent as they who call themselues <hi>Catholikes,</hi> and follow the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and they who are called <hi>Protestants,</hi> and haue departed from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In so great opposition, it is certaine both parties are not right. Wherefore you that follow <hi>Rome,</hi> yet loue the truth, consider with me a little, how we may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, which of vs is out of the way, and thinke no scorne to turne into the right path when we haue found it. As for the rest, whom <hi>Antichrist</hi> hath deluded to stoppe their eares, like deafe Adders against good counsaile, and to open their mouthes to blasphemie, so that they crie <hi>all is but lyes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they heare, or reade a letter: as God hath prouided no sacrifice for their wilfull sinne; so I leaue them to him that<note n="c" place="margin">

   <p>It is confessed of vs all, that our Lord and Sauiour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> had the truth, and that he sent his Apostles abroad to preach the same; which they did in their sermone, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in their writings. Now it remaineth to be required, whether the Doctrine by them taught, and recorded in the scriptures be the onely, eternal, and immutable truth or no? Or that the Church may in time deuise more to bee added thereto, other differing from it, or some contrary vnto it, of like authoritie and reuerence? As for the <hi>Protestants</hi> they bind themselues to the written Word, as a sufficient Canon to walke by, acknowledging it to be<note n="d" place="margin">Reuel. 19.16.</note>
      <hi>the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not be so straighted, nor so subiect; but wil assume she goeth right, when she wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by her Traditions, which change with the times; as appeareth by their seueral and opposite decrees and institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So that she thinketh her selfe neuer out, whatsoeuer she doth in abolishing the former, and in deuising and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning such new articles, as the godly in the primitiue Church neuer knew, nor their fathers before them; vnto which also she holdeth all men are to be subiect on paine of damnation. For the decision of this great question: because it is obiected to the parties themselues that they doe not pursue their arguments with that patience as is required at the hands of <hi>Christians:</hi> let vs commit the moderation to such, as we all agree, were both truly <hi>Christians,</hi> (which was the<note n="e" place="margin">Act.</note> first name, that the Disciples were called by) and truelie <hi>Catholikes,</hi> which was the next title they tooke; Namely <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his fellowes: who though they spake in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother case, yet it appeareth by the waight of their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they would speake of our Question, were they at our Conference, in the same sort, as they did at <hi>Ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="4 letters">

      </hi> Creede (as the <hi>Papists</hi> doe from the faith and doctrine of the word of God) published in the raigne of <hi>Constantius, Flauius</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> being Consuls (as that of the Papists, is instituted by diuers Popes) the <hi>Catholikes</hi> that disliked it rose vp and said (as we also say to the <hi>Papists:) We came not together with you, because we were destitute of faith (for wee keepe that wholy which wee receiued from the beginning) but that if any did attempt any new thing of that matter, we might resist him.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>AThanasius</hi> (who especially disliked this innouation) wrote vnto his friends almost in these words, which, with changing but the names of the persons whom hee nameth, and are put in the margent, to the Papists, will be thus.</p>
   <p>What I pray you was wanting in the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> vnto the doctrine of godlines, that now they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the faith and should by name prefix the<note n="a" place="margin">Consuls.</note>
      <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councels</hi> (Which were in this present time) before the words which (forsooth) they haue set downe of the faith? For the<note n="b" place="margin">Vrsatius, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</note> Popish writers haue done that which was neuer done nor heard among christians. For where they wrote the things, which they thought were to be beleeued, they haue written<note n="c" place="margin">Consuls.</note> the <hi>Popes, Councels</hi> and places, moneth, and lastly the day, that it might be manifest to all wise men, that their faith had no beginning, before the beginning of the raigne of<note n="d" place="margin">Constantius.</note> such <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councels;</hi> yea that which is more, all of them hauing regard vnto their owne heresie, haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their owne sentences to writing. Moreouer when they pretend to write of the doctrine of the Lord, they haue named another for their Lord, namely<note n="e" place="margin">Constantius.</note> the <hi>Pope:</hi> For he hath opened vnto them a window vnto all their impiety. And when as they did denie the word of the Sonne of God, to be eternall (for so farre were these enemies of <hi>Christ</hi> cast into wickednesse) they haue named the<note n="f" place="margin">Emperor.</note> decrees of the <hi>Popes</hi> to be eternall. But perchance they catch an occasion
<pb n="265" facs="146"/> to name the<note n="g" place="margin">Consuls.</note>
      <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councels,</hi> by the example of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Prophets,</hi> who do set downe the time in which they liued. But if they shall dare to affirme so, they shall exceedingly bewray their folly. For albeit there be mention of the times in the prophecies of holy men, as in <hi>Esaiah</hi> and <hi>Hosea,</hi> which were in the daies of <hi>Ozias</hi> and <hi>Ioatham,</hi> &amp; <hi>Achaz</hi> and <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias:</hi> as in the prophecie of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> who liued in the dayes of <hi>Iesias:</hi> as in the prophecies of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> who flourished when <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> did raigne, and lastly as in other Prophets which prophecied in other times: yet doe none of them lay any first foundation of pietie and holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For it was before their times, and alwaies, and before the framing of the world which God by <hi>Christ</hi> hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for vs. And as for the times in which their faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan they did not designe (for before those times, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues were faithfull) but those were the times of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise pronounced by them. And the promise doth especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerne the incarnation of our Sauiour. That which was annexed thereunto did clearely demonstrate those things which should befall the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But in the times so noted the doctrine of faith (as I said before) had not his beginning, but the Prophets shewed in what times they liued, when they prophecied these things. But these our wise men, when they doe not write things done, nor forshew things to come, but doe write <hi>our faith was set forth;</hi> presently they annexe the<note n="h" place="margin">Consuls.</note>
      <hi>Pope, Councel,</hi> moneth and day. As godly men doe set downe the times of things done, as also of their ministerie; so those doe note the time in which their doctrine and faith began and was first insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted. And I would indeede they had committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their owne only faith; but now they make the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the doctrine of faith; and as though it had not been before, they attempt to dispute thereof. For they do not thus write. <hi>So wee do beleeue,</hi> but in this sort, <hi>The catholicke faith was set forth.</hi> Therefore the audacious attempt of this their institution, doth manifestly conuict their grosse folly; and the new instituted manner of their forme so described, doth euery way equall the heresie of the <hi>Arian.</hi> For so
<pb n="266" facs="147"/> haue they taught by their writings. <hi>Then began they to beleeue so,</hi> and from thence they determine to shew their faith. Not otherwise then it is in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> the Euangelist: <hi>There came forth an edicte of taxing.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk 1.</note> This edict indeede was not before, but from those daies it began, and was set forth by them that did write it. So when these did write thus: <hi>Now is the faith set forth,</hi> they do shew that their error was now lately deuised, and that before it was not extant. But if they shall adde the word <hi>Catholike</hi> (as the <hi>Arians</hi> did, and <hi>Papists</hi> do) they rush vnaduisedly into the wicked peruerse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the <hi>Cataphrygians,</hi> that according to their manner they also say, <hi>the christian faith is reuealed to vs, and it began of vs.</hi> And as those their <hi>Maximilla</hi> and <hi>Montanus,</hi> so they, for <hi>Christ,</hi> doe call<note n="i" place="margin">Constantius.</note> the Pope <hi>Lord.</hi> Now if in their times, and these<note n="k" place="margin">Consuls.</note> Popes the faith had his beginning, what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Fathers and blessed Martyrs, what of these whom themselues haue instructed and were dead before these<note n="l" place="margin">Consuls.</note> Popes? By what meanes will they raise them from the dead, that they may altogether roote out of their minds the things which they taught them, and engraffe into them the things which now they haue deuised and written? So absurd and senseles they bee, that they haue onely skill to forge counterfeit matters, which as they are foolish and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; so may they bee reprooued and refuted very easily. Thus much <hi>Athanasius</hi> would say to them as hee said to the <hi>Arians.</hi>
