And hauing compiled a treatise of friend ship, he pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out the same <hi>Atticus,</hi> a man full of friendship, to send the same vnto: alwai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> chusing pratrons according to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Not much vnlike vnto <hi>Luke</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist, who writing of the things of God, chose out <hi>Theophilus</hi> (that is a frēd
<pb facs="3"/> of God) as a most meet man to write vnto: So I hauing according to my weaknes written somthing of comfort, haue found none more meet vnto whōe to dedicate my writings, thā your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, at whose hands my self haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, as I must still acknowledge, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much comfort. For who ought to haue more interest in comfort, than the comforters? And what fitter patrones of comfort can a man imagin to find than the authors &amp; fathers thereof? For this cause therefore haue I made choise of your Worships, and of your brethren beloued in the Lord, as of all men most meet to commit these my writings vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And this the rather haue I done, as on the one side in regard of my selfe, to whom there is nothing more deare, or more due, than to recompence spiritual for temporall things: that you which haue sowne temporall, might (if there be any in mee) receiue from mee spirituall comforts: that thus you seeing a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest of your corne, fruit of your labor, comforts to spring of your comfort, &amp; mercies of your mercies, that is, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the treasures of the mercies of God, opened vnto you, for the mercifull
<pb facs="3"/> vse of your riches, might not think, that either you plowed the barren sand, or sowed in a reproued field, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth nothing but thorns or briars, is therefore (as some thought) neere to the fire: so on the other side, in a more especiall regard of your selues, to whom the Lord hath in a more plentiful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner opened the treasures of his hidden riches, insomuch, that you are filled therwith. I therefore haue laboured (it lieth in you, that I may say) I hope not in vaine, that you might also abound with spirituall and inward comforts. That thus you being comforted in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and comforted in soule, comforted outwardly, and comforted inwardly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in heauenly and earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, in the honest comforts of the flesh, and the glorious comforts of the spirit, might want nothing that might be for your sound comfort, especially for your spiritual comfort, without the which all earthlie comforts are vaine and fruitles. For what shall it profit a man to bee comforted in body, &amp; afflicted in soule? To haue the comforts of the flesh, and to want the comforts of the spirit? To liue as <hi>Diues</hi> deliciously, and be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<pb facs="4"/> in purple, if after this life hee should be tormented with <hi>Diues</hi> in that flame? What should it benefit a man to eat the fat, and drinke the sweet, to be fed with the kidneis of the wheat, to eat the honie of the rocke, the calfe of the stall, the Lambe of the fold, to drinke wine in bowles, to haue instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of musicke like vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> to stretch himselfe vpon his Iuorie beds, and after this life to haue fire &amp; brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, storme and tempest, for to drink: &amp; to haue his portion in that lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death? What shall it profit a man to haue <hi>Achabs</hi> life, with <hi>Achabs</hi> death? <hi>Hamans</hi> glory with <hi>Hāans</hi> shame? <hi>Dauids</hi> musicke, with <hi>Saules</hi> misery? <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> prosperity, with <hi>Cains</hi> aduersity? <hi>Darius</hi> his kingdoms, with <hi>Iudas</hi> hellish paines? Nay, how is it possible, that, that man should haue much comfort in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that hath none in soule? And what sound comfort can a man take in this life, euen in the middest of his cheare, his wife, and his women, his vessels of gold and of siluer, if he should with <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasher, Dan.</hi> 7. see the hand of God wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against him, that fearfull sentence,

<pb facs="5"/> with his milke, may heare those often cheerings and welcomes of the Lord, being at one table with him, saying; Eat oh my friends, drinke &amp; be drunken, oh my beloued: That so you may not see the hand writing against you vpon the wall, but fastened on the crosse: &amp; may not heare that fearefull voice; Thou fool, this night shall they fetch away thy soule from thee: but that comfortable saying of Christ; Sonne, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.

For euen this one bone to gnaw vpon, might occupy them so, that they should haue little pleasure or leisure, to eate of their dainty dishes: &amp; this one doubt of the mercy of God, might bee like vnto <hi>Damacles</hi> sword, which hanging ouer their heads, as by a horse haire, might make them to take little pleasure in the variety of their meats, in the points of musicke, in the beauty of their boies, in the loue of their womē, in the furniture of their table, &amp; in all other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. And howsoeuer the wicked are lulled asleepe in securitie, that they are

And therefore euen their life it selfe is vnpleasant, without the tast here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Insomuch, that they cannot rest in peace, vntill by the peace of God raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their consciēces, &amp; his loue shed abroad into their hearts by the holy Ghost, they are fully assured, that they are washed, they a e clensed, they are iustifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Knowing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these things, and the feare and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Lord, I wil not cease, during the time of my abode, to put you in mind (by those meanes that I can) of these things: that you may not rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, as the world doth, with earthly, but may aspire higher, seeking for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

<pb facs="6"/> malicious falsely couceiued against me, haue more preuailed with me than du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: so I doubt not, but that suspition &amp; disdain, vices too great to raigne in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages of worship, &amp; professors of the Gospell of God, shall find no place in your very raines. For both the good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that my selfe haue conceiued, &amp; the world receiued, cōcerning your sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie, will cleare you hereof, &amp; neither suffer you to entertain any such affectiō nor me to admit any such suspition. And now brethren, worshipful, &amp; beloued in the Lord, what remaineth, but that I shuld bow the knees of my soule, to the father of our Lord Iesus Christ, the God of all mercy, the Father of al comfort &amp; consolatiō, that according to the riches of his mercie, he would make you feele, and fill you with all spirituall comforts. That you may with glorying in the lord look for the hope of glory, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the mightie God, and our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior Iesus Christ; to whom with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the holy Ghost, three persons, and one God, immortall inuisible, and onely wise, be all glory, power, praise, &amp; dominion, now and euer, <hi>Amen.</hi>
