   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the observation of some anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Philosophers (who also prove it by divers good arguments) that all men, for the most part, have a naturall desire to <hi>immortality.</hi> But this we all know by common approv'd experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that <hi>Man that is borne of a Woman is of short continuance. He commethforth like a Flower and is cut downe, he flyeth also as a shadow and continueth not.</hi> Some therefore who knew not of any other world after this, in defence of natures wayes and providence, maintained, that she had in some manner satisfied the desire of man in making him <hi>generative. Nam quodammodo ipse putatur vivere, cujus progenies vivit, (For that man in some sort may be thought yet alive, whose progeny is living)</hi> as I may say in the words of <hi>Cassiodore</hi> with little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. But if there be any immortality in this,
<pb facs="5"/>
it can be but an immortality of the body, not of the minde, the best and chiefest part of man. The immortality of the minde (all that it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of in this world, which though it be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality properly, yet may certainely much conduce to allay the complaints of mortall men concerning their shortnesse of life) doth, as I conceive, especially depend from that <hi>Memoria praeteritorum,</hi> and <hi>Providentia futurorum, (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of things past,</hi> and <hi>Foresight of things to come)</hi> which the Latine Orator speakes of.</p>
   <p>As for the first, he certainly that knowes no more of the world (the time of a mans life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so short as it is) then what hath happened in his time, though he may be in yeares, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance very old in regard of his body, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his minde and knowledge, he can be accounted but a very child. Which is the very answer that an ancient <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priest and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary gave to <hi>Solon</hi> concerning the <hi>Grecians</hi> of his time: that they were all, the best and ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of them, but very babes and children. And his reason was, because none of them could say any thing of the state of their owne countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their owne and their fathers memory: whereas the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> out of their ancient holy Records, could tell them many memorable things, both concerning <hi>Greece</hi> in generall, and the state of their then famous <hi>Athens</hi> in particular,
<pb facs="5"/>
for many hundred, if not thousand, of yeares before. If therefore a man living in a place of note, can by his industry, out of undoubted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and Monuments (if such be the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the place, that it afford them) certainly finde, what have beene the severall both <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all alterations</hi> (as in respect of buildings, and the like) and <hi>historicall events,</hi> that have happened to it for divers ages before, and can derive the present times and places that he lives in, by a continuall series of chances and alterations from such or such a beginning, I doe not see (if know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be granted to be the life of the soule, as the soule is the life of the body) but he may reck on his yeares according to the proportion of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, accounting himselfe to have lived so many yeares, as he is able truely and historically to give an account of.</p>
   <p>Now for that other part of immortality, which is <hi>Providentia futurorum,</hi> even this hath such dependance of the former, as that he that is well vers'd in the knowledge of things past, may probably foresee what will happen in time to come. As for example; It was no difficult thing for one of the ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> (who lived in the dayes of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and was one of his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) having observed the course of the world, and what had already hapned to <hi>Greece</hi> it selfe, and to other places in that kinde, to foretell of
<pb facs="6"/>
old <hi>Greece,</hi> then flourishing, that the time would come when it should be the seate of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Barbarisme;</hi> as it is at this day. Vpon the same grounds of former ages experience, did ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ancients both foresee and foretel, above a thousand yeares before any such thing happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the discovery of a new world, in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable words of his:
<q>
         <l>—Venient annis</l>
         <l>Seculaseris, quibus Oceanus</l>
         <l>Vincularerum laxet, &amp; ingens</l>
         <l>Pateat tell us, Tiphysque novos</l>
         <l>Detegat orbes: nec sit terris</l>
         <l>Vltima Thule.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>As the knowledge of ancient things is pleasant, so is the ignorance as shamefull, and oftentimes exposes men to the scorne and contempt of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. <hi>Tully</hi> relates of himselfe, that being sent with authority to <hi>Syracusa,</hi> a <hi>quondam</hi> renowned City of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> for his owne private satisfaction, he enquired of the chiefest of the City about the sepulcher and monument of their famous <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes;</hi> who (through shamefull ignorance of their City-Antiquities) denyed that he had any. But <hi>Tully</hi> knowing the contrary by what he had read, and by good luck remembring some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine verses that mentioned some particulars of his monument, whereby it might be knowne from others, taking along with him those <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="6"/>
blocks</hi> (who, as ordinary worldly men, had no care but for their profit, no curiosity but for their belly) he repaired to the place, being neer the City-gates, where ancient sepulchers and monuments were most frequent, and so negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted (whereby you may judge of the temper of the Inhabitants) that they were almost all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne with thickets and bushes. But the place being cleered by men that were on purpose set on worke, he found at last by helpe of the fore said directions, the monument that he sought, with the very markes (a <hi>Sphaera,</hi> and a <hi>Cylindrus)</hi> and the inscription (though now halfe worne out, more through neglect then age) that he looked for. And so, to the great shame of that City, and the inhabitants thereof (noted abroad for their luxurious life and great excesse in all worldly things) concludes with these upbraiding insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting words: <hi>Ita nobilissima Graeciae civitas, quondā verò etiam doctissima sui civis unius acutissimi monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ignorasset, nisi ab homine Arpinate didi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisset.</hi> As if a man should scoffingly object to us here of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that he was faine to come out of <hi>Wales</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> of purpose to shew us the monument and place of buriall of some one of our famous <hi>Abbats,</hi> or renowned <hi>Archbishops,</hi> whose credit, and bounty, when living, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded much to the honour and benefit of the City.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>
For these and the like reasons, my thoughts and affections having ever much inclined to the search and study of <hi>Antiquities,</hi> (to which also my particular calling did in some manner leade me) I have more particularly, as bound in duty and thankfulnesse, applyed my selfe to the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the place of my birth and abode. And to me this was a sufficient motive why I should of all other places desire to know the antiquities and former estate thereof. But why any man else, that is an <hi>Englishman,</hi> should have the same desire, other reasons may be given, very considerable, if I be not much deceived; as first, the <hi>Antiquities</hi> thereof. <hi>Antiquities</hi> due and proper <hi>Epithete</hi> is, <hi>venerable.</hi> Now the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest which our City hath in that venerable badge and cognisance is not unknowne: it being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for one of the most ancient Cities in the Kingdome. <hi>Quiacivitas Cantuariae est una de antiquissimis urbibus Angliae,</hi> is no other language then is frequently found in the <hi>Charters,</hi> and such <hi>private Acts of Parliament,</hi> as (making that a maine motive to the grant) have conveyed any <hi>Favour,</hi> or <hi>Franchise</hi> to the City or Citizens. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the great <hi>fame</hi> and <hi>repute</hi> that it had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, for reasons that will appeare by this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise:</hi> and thereupon the great resort of strangers from all nations under heaven, (which in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie gave occasion to the proverbe of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury-tales)</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
to the number sometimes, as shall be shewed, of a hundred thousand at once. But the chiefe reason, in my judgement, ought to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause from thence first the faith of <hi>Christ</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated and derived unto other parts of the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> after the <hi>Saxons</hi> our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were become Lords and possessors of it. When the <hi>Romans</hi> had conquered <hi>Greece,</hi> they did not use them as they did other nations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by them subdued, but with all love and respect, <hi>Athens</hi> especially, which they had in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (say ancient <hi>Geographers</hi> of those times;) and, in token of their respect, suffered them to enjoy their ancient <hi>lawes, liberties</hi> and <hi>forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> as though they had not beene conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Tully</hi> gives the reason. <hi>Cum ei hominum generi praesimus non modo in quo ipsa sit, sed etiam à quo ad alios pervenisse putetur humanitas: certè iis eam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimùm tribuere debemus, à quibus accepimus.</hi> And doe not all piously-affected <hi>English</hi> owe so much honour and respect to the place, from whence the light of Christs glorious Gospell first shined unto their fore fathers, as to desire to be acquainted with the present and past estate of it?</p>
   <p>I have spoken of <hi>religion</hi> onely, but I might adde <hi>humanitatem, learning</hi> and good <hi>literature</hi> too. For with <hi>religion</hi> came <hi>learning:</hi> and in the dayes of <hi>Theodorus</hi> the seventh Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (if publike schooles wherein all good
<pb facs="8"/>
Arts and Sciences, <hi>philosophy</hi> especially, are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly taught and professed make an <hi>Vniversity) Canterbury</hi> was a <hi>famous Vniversity:</hi> yea, and was afterwards a patterne (as some have written and published) for the erection and foundation of a famous <hi>Vniversity</hi> in this land.</p>
   <p>This worke is chiefly collected from old <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts, Leiger-bookes</hi> and other <hi>Records</hi> of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, exhibited to me for the most part by the Treasury of our <hi>Cathedrall;</hi> which, as it exceeds most of the Realme, if not all, in beauty, state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and magnificence of building; so in this particular kinde of unvaluable treasure, is, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, inferior unto none. With the helpe of <hi>Spots History of Canterbury</hi> mentioned of <hi>Balaeus,</hi> and of <hi>Iohn Twine's</hi> collections of the Antiquities thereof spoken of by him in his <hi>Commentaries, de rebus Albionicis, &amp;c.</hi> could I but have gotten them, I should perchance have brought the work to more perfection: but with the helpes I have had, I have done my best endeavour that nothing might be strange or unknowne that carries with it any shew of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> either in the <hi>Church,</hi> (as the most eminent place of all) or in the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Suburbs</hi> thereof.</p>
   <p>If the <hi>Worke</hi> may not deserve thine acceptance (courteous Reader) for it selfe, let then the <hi>Authors</hi> love to <hi>Antiquities,</hi> his <hi>thankfull intentions</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>place</hi> of his <hi>birth, education</hi> and <hi>present
<pb facs="8"/>
abode,</hi> and the <hi>encouragement</hi> of <hi>worthy friends</hi> serve for his <hi>Apology.</hi> If otherwise it give thee some content, and mine endeavours prove accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto thee, I shall desire thou wouldest be thankfull to them, without whose <hi>helpe,</hi> as I had not beene <hi>able,</hi> so without whose <hi>encouragement</hi> I had neither beene <hi>willing,</hi> thus to have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured forth in publike, as namely Doctor <hi>Casau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> one of the Prebendaries of this Church, and <hi>Thomas Denne</hi> Esquire: to whom, for their great and ready favour and furtherance herein, I were conscious of much ingratitude and want of ingenuity, if I should not acknowledge my selfe exceedingly beholden. Such as it is I commend it to thy favourable acceptance, (friendly Reader) and shall adde no more but the best wishes and respects of</p>
