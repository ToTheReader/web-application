      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      <hi>Ohannes Sambucus,</hi> of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> a diligent obseruer, and lykewise searcher of antiquitie, neyther sparing expence nor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in that behalfe, and one that is woont to impart and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, his delyght and care with other men: More then two yeares since, dyd sende me a copy of <hi>Eunapius</hi> of <hi>Sardis,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gently, and was the first that mooued me to translate him into Latine: which labour I dyd not refuse, because I hoped the booke, that was so wel written by the Clark, should haue caused the lesse labour to the interpretour. The which being written out by the benefite of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie of Cardinall <hi>Farnesius,</hi> as he pretended (who, as they say, hath a study replenished with olde Bookes) was so mangled and hacked, and so full of infinite and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous faultes: that I well perceyued, I had neede of <note place="margin">Paeon. an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

And my many other businesse beside, might easily haue put me from my purpose, except I had pulled vp a good hart to continew, and determined to wrythe a clubbe of diffyculty from mine owne hande. Wherfore I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to gesse lyke a Diuinour, to drawe my coniecture into partes, and to supply: yet, with great precisenesse.

But sometime I had rather passe it ouer lightly, then to thrust in other mens noates: that is to say, mine own. But If I might get the <hi>Florentine</hi> Copie, which by the onely lyfe of <hi>porphyrius,</hi> printed there, I iudge more corrected &amp; full, I would trust my second trauaile should be better. Certainly, asmuch as laye in me, I haue brought to passe, that by this labour, I haue committed into the handes of the studious, an eloquent wryter, neuer heretofore seene abroade. Both speaking in his owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
