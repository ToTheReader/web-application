   <head>THE PREFACE OF THE AVTHOR TO the Reader.</head>
   <head type="sub">Wherein the manner and profit of this Worke is declared.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are two kinds of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions (gentle Reader) which are in controuersy betwixt the Catholikes and Protestantes; the one kind is of fact, to wit, <hi>Whether Luther was the Author, and beginner of the Protestants Church and Religiō; whether before him it were visible and had Pastours; whether he and the first Protestant Preachers were sent to preach Protestancy, and the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>e:</hi> The other kind of question is of Christs doctrine or law: For example, <hi>whether Christ taught good workes do iustify, be necessary to saluation, meritorious, and
<pb facs="3"/> such others.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Why a a question of Fact is handled rather thē of doctrin</note> At this present I treate not of this second kind of question, but only of the former and that for three causes. First the questions of Doctrine are innumerable, but the questions of Fact, few. And many haue handled them, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that most exactly, but these, few haue touched, and (for ought that I know) none of purpose hath hitherto written of the Authour of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, and in that manner as I intend to write. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly there are few questions of doctrine of that nature, that all other controuersies of faith depend vpon them; but the most questions of Fact are such, as if they be well decided, al other Controuersies of religion are at an end. Such kind of question this especially is, which now I handle, <hi>VVhether Luther were Author and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Protestant church and Religion</hi> For if it be made manifest, that he was the Author and Beginner of it, euery one will straihgt see that it is not Christs Church &amp; Religion, but Luthers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> deuise and inuention. Thirdly in questions of doctrine, or law, Protestants want not some pretext of Scripture (as neither any Heretikes wanted) and therfore diuers tymes they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to debate these kind of Questions, in which (as Tertullian sayth) <hi>they pretend Scriptures,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Prescrip. c. <hi>15.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>and with this their boldnes shake some, and in the dispute weary the constant, catch the weake, &amp; send away the midal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap> sort with scruple and dou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ts.</hi> But in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="3"/> of Fact they are destitute not only of al pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Scripture, vnles it be some most vaine, but also of all testimony of men and help of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and stand only vpon their owne sayinges, &amp; are conuinced by the testimonies of the whol world, and sometyme also by their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, and therefore are brought to debate these kind of questions no more willingly, then is a theefe to his tryall. Neither do they in these disputs either weary the constant, or catch the weake; but shew their owne weaknes and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes vnto all kind of men. And this is the cause why Ministers are so loath to dispute of the Church, because the Church, being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men, includeth many questions of fact, as of antiquity, succession, continuance, visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, mission, ordination of Pastours, and such like; in which points there is little colour, or shew on their part.</p>
   <p n="2">2. Fourthly, Protestants exact more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult poofes in questions of doctrine, then they can demand in matters of Fact. For in matters of Fact, wherof the scripture speaketh nothing, they must be content with testimonies of men, against whome no iust exception can be made, or they must refuse all triall of these kind of questions. But in controuersies of doctrine, they account those only to be lawfull proofes, which are taken out of the scripture. Neither
<pb facs="4"/> doe these satisfie them, vnlesse they be plaine &amp;<note n="(a)" place="margin">Melan. &amp; Brent. in Hospin. fol. <hi>107.</hi> Colloq. Ratisb. sess. <hi>11.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>expresse, and</hi> (as they say) <hi>word</hi>
      <note n="(b)" place="margin">Vorst. respons. ad Slad.</note>
      <hi>for word containe that which is in question, or at least be so pregnant and strong, that they</hi>

      </note>
      <hi>stopp all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ns mouths that they can gainsay nothing.</hi> For it is the common fault of Protestants, which S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin saith, himselfe was guilty of, whiles he was an heretike, that <hi>they will be as certaine of all things as that seauen and three make ten.</hi> Nay they yield not alwayes to these kind of proofs; For what can be sayd more expressy, more plainly, more literally, then the scripture saith, that man is iustified by workes, and not only by faith; that, that which our Sauiour gaue with his hands to his Apostles after his last supper, was his very body and bloud, and such like: &amp; yet the Protestants yield not to these kind of testimonies, but deuise figures and shiftes to delude them. Catholiques proofes in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies of doctrine are certainly Theological de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, because they are clearly drawne from the proper principles of Diuinity, to wit, from cleare words of God confirmed by the tradition of the Church and vnanimous exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fathers; which kind of proofe is as great and strong, as either Diuinity or law, or any Science whatsoeuer which is founded in words either doth affoard, or the nature of any law or science which is grounded in words (as
<pb facs="4"/> Diuinity is) can beare or affoard. And as the Philosopher saith well, it were starck madnes to exact any other kind of proofes of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, then the nature therof can affoard.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Eth.</hi> 1.</note> But because heretiques expound what words soeuer as they list, and litle set by the authority of the Church or Fathers, and the vnlearned hardly perceaue what kind of proofe is a Theologicall demonstration, &amp; such as Diuinity can affoard no greater, or which is the true sense of Gods word, or how great the authority of the Churh and Fathers ought to be; therefore with them, Catholiks proofs in points of doctrin, albeit in truth they be Theological demonstrations, take litle effect Wheras on the other side Catholique proofes in matter of Fact, are not only Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, but also (that I may so speake) Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall demonstrations, because they consist of one principle which is grounded not only vpon the foundations of Diuinity, to wit the word of God together with the expositiō of the Church and Fathers but also is manifest by the light of reason: which kind of principles these are, <hi>That Gods Church hath alwayes him: that it is one: that it is the auncientest of all Churches: that it is alwayes visible: hath alwayes Pastors,</hi> and the like: And of another principle, which may be tryed by our sense and experience, as that the foresayd properties agree neither to the Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb facs="5"/> nor to the Anabaptists, nor to any here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall company. And therfore these kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations moue euen the most obstinate heretiques, and are euident euen to the most ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and vnlearned persons.</p>
   <p n="3">3. And hence ariseth a fift cause of handling rather questions of Fact then of doctrin, because the fruit of debating those questions is reaped with more facility and of far more. For wheras few but diuines do themselues perceaue the true meaning of the testimonyes of Scripture wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the questions of doctrin are debated; as the true meaning of the law, few but lawyers thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues do see; all perceaue the meaning of those testimonyes wherwith the questions of fact are disputed,<note place="margin">Epist. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat. exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. cont. Baron.</note> who will affoard an attētiue eye to see, or eare to heare. And heer upō Casaubon wrote, <hi>that for to insinuate into the mind of the Reader any opinion now in controuersie, Baronius historyes are of greater force,</hi>
      <note place="margin">D. Flaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnie.</note>
      <hi>then Bellarmines disputes.</hi> And sayd also sometyme, as one most worthy of credit, who heard him, told me, that whiles he read Bellarmines disputations, he began to doubt of all Religion, but whiles he perused Baronius Annales, he felt himselfe by little &amp; little drawn towards Papistry: which thing might wel haue befallen him and such others, not because Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Bellarmine proueth lesse soundly, for the nature of the matter, the truth of Catholik Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb facs="5"/> in questions of doctrine, then Cardinall Baronius doth the same in questions of Fact, but because such is the nature of the testimonyes, wherewith the truth of Catholike fayth in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of doctrine is proued, that they are lesse euident then the testimonyes wherewith the Catholike truth in matters of Fact is proued, and also haue many thinges which seeme to be contrary and repugnant to them. Whereupon it falleth out that some hearing or reading con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies of doctrine disputed between Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes and Heretikes, and not being able of thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to discern betwixt truth &amp; shew of truth, either follow neither party, but become vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or Atheistes, or content with any shew of truth take that part to which any affection of their will doth draw them. Whereas none by hearing or reading controuersies of Fact, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not more confirmed in the Catholik faith or more auerted from heresy. And therefore Tertullian counsaileth vs,<note place="margin">Praescrip. cap. <hi>1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>.</hi>
      </note> not to dispute with Heretikes out of Scripture, by which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of doctrine are disputed, but aduiseth vs to appeale to antiquity, succession, and such like which concerne questions of fact.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Lastly, though the fruit of disputing both those kind of questions were equall, yet sith the Author, by order of nature, goeth before the thing whereof he is Authour, according to
<pb facs="6"/> the order of Nature we ought to intreate of the Author of Protestancy before we dispute of Protestancy it selfe. For (as well sayth Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian) <hi>nothing but God alone is without beginning which how much it goeth before in the state of all thinges so much ought it to go before in the handling of them,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lib <hi>5.</hi> cont Mar.</note>
      <note place="margin">Lib <hi>3</hi> cont Mar.</note>
      <hi>that the state may be knowne.</hi> And other where: <hi>Nothing is knowne before the beginning is knowne.</hi> Wherfore I will begin my first dispute concerning the Protestant Religion of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>of: Yet before I do that, I must set downe and determine what a Protestant, or the Protestant Church and Religion is, and what is necessary for one to be a Protestant, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the vncertainty of Protestants. And this much touching the matter which I haue made choice of to handle in this little worke and the causes thereof.</p>
   <p n="5">
      <note place="margin">VVhy proued only out of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</note>5. As for the manner wherwith I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to discusse this question of Fact, whether Luther was the first Author &amp; beginner of the Protestant Church, and Religion, I purpose to proue it only out of the confessions of Luther himselfe, and of the three sorts of Protestants, to wit, Lutherans, who professe to follow Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all points of doctrine; Sacramentaries, who notoriously dissent from him touching the reall presence of Christs body in the Sacrament; and our English Protestants, who differ from
<pb facs="6"/> both the former at least in discipline &amp; gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Church: because this kind of proofe out of their owne wordes I find to be both necessary and most effectuall with Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants. Necessary, because of this question of Fact, neither the Scripture,<note place="margin">Necessary.</note> or the Fathers say any thing, as also, because, seeing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants deny part of the scripture, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete the rest as they please, and will not stand to the sentence of the Church, Councels, or Fathers, account reason Sophistrie, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem me the testimonies of Catholique writers, they haue left nothing but their own cōfessiōs, by which we may dispure with them. And I pray God they do giue place to their own most frequent and most plaine confessions, and not delude them by voluntary and friuolous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations; for then hope may be, that there wilbe some end of these controuersies. At least we shall reape this profit by this labour, that by it shall be manifest to all, that either Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants will heare no testimony, admit no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no not their owne, which is a most eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent argument of a most desperat cause; or that they shall be condemned by their owne verdict &amp; sentence; or lastly that there can be no forme of speech so plaine, no words so cleare, no sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence so manifest, which they with their faig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned figures &amp; deuises will not wrest, frustrate,
<pb facs="7"/> and delude; which is in effect to disanull al kind of proofe which is taken out of words or testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies whatsoeuer. For I will bring so plaine testimonies of theirs, as plaine can scarce or not at all be deuised; I will bring so many, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues will require no more; I will bring so weighty, as themselues will demaund none more weighty; I wil bring them also most freely and often iterated and repeated; lastly I will bring not only those which indirectly and by consequence proue that which I would, but those also, &amp; that especially &amp; oftenest, which directly testify that which they are brought to confirme. Wherfore either they will not delude these words of theirs, or they wil delude all wordes whatsoeuer; And either they will not refuse these their owne testimonies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, or they will reiect all testimonies and iudgements whatsoeuer, which is in effect to confesse that their cause is most desperate and most worthy to be reiected and condemned of all.</p>
   <p n="1">
      <note place="margin">Most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall.</note>1. This māner also of proofe is most effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, for what can be of greater force to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince a man, then his owne iudgement and acknowledgement of the truth? Surely vnlesse a man will professe himselfe to be en enemy of truth,<note place="margin">By reasō.</note> and of the number of them who see good and follow bad, he must needs imbrace that
<pb facs="7"/> truth which himselfe confesseth. Experience also sheweth the same.<note place="margin">By expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</note> For when our Sauiour could neither by infinite miracles nor euident scriptures stop the mouthes of the Iewes, he so conuinced them out of their owne words, that (as the Euangelist writeth) <hi>they answeared him not a word nor from that day any durst aske him a question.</hi> And the Donatists,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Matt.</hi> 22.</note> when they made answeare to the Catholikes argumēts taken out of scripture, were so intangled in their owne fact touching the Maximinists as (sayth S.<note n="(d)" place="margin">In col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. <hi>3.</hi> diei c. <hi>11.</hi>

      </hi> And now we see, that Protestants are tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied at no sort of bookes so much, as at those, which are composed of their owne testimonies.

A third difference between our and the Protestants manner of proceeding in this kind of proofe is, that Protestantes often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes alleadge Catholikes testimonyes corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, mangled, and falsifyed; and sometymes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the obiections which they make against thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, insteed of their answeres, as Cardinall Peron not long since shewed Plessie to haue don before the French King,<note place="margin">conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at fountaine Bel-caue.</note> euen by the iudgment of Protestant themselues.

For I haue cited none in this worke which either I haue not seene with myne owne eyes, and for the most part haue quoted not only the bookes and chapters but also the leaues and pages, or if I haue wanted the booke, I haue cited them out of some good Author. The fourth difference &amp; that of great moment is, that the Catholiques,
<pb facs="11"/> whose testimonyes Protestants alleadge against is (if so be they were true Catholikes) were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready to reuoke and recall whatsoeuer they had written contrary to the catholik fayth, &amp; to submit all their wordes or writings to the censure of the catholike Church, which to be the mind &amp; disposition of all Catholiks, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants themselues confesse.

For either they are not contrary thereto, or if they be, they are already reuoked, recalled and disanulled by himselfe. But the mind and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of Protestāts is far otherwise, who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect not their opinions to the iudgment of the Church, but as they thinke that she may erre, so will they hold their opinions notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her sentence to the contrary; and therfore iustly may we produce their testimonies against their owne Church.</p>
   <p n="9">9. The fift difference, &amp; which is much to be noted, is, that Protestants alleadge Catholik witnesses in matters of doctrin, in which some
<pb facs="12"/> tymes by reason of the obscurity of the matter a man may chance to erre &amp; slip;<note place="margin">August. l. <hi>11.</hi> cont. Faust. c. <hi>5.</hi>
      </note> or els in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, as were in times or places far distant from them, so that themselues could not search the truth, but belieued the reports of others. Such a question is that of Pope <hi>Ioane,</hi> in which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants cite no Catholike author which liued not some ages after that time, wherin Pope <hi>Ioan</hi> is sayd to haue beene. Or if they produce any Catholike Author in any matter of fact, the truth wherof he might haue tried, either he is of no credit, or the matter is such, as it turneth to no preiudice of the Catholike faith. But we heer produce Protestants in a matter of fact, &amp; such a matter as they could most easily know. For what was more easy, then for Luther and his fellowes to try either then or euer since, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he first began, there was in the world any Protestant company, whether it were visible, whether it had Pastours, and the like? For who can thinke, that only the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant company could lye so close hid, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in all Luthers time or euer since, either the being, or the estate or condition, or place or Pastours, or any thing at all therof could be espied out of so many Arguses, which now in one whole age haue sifted all corners of the world to find it out? And besides, this is such a question of Fact, as vpon the decision therof
<pb facs="12"/> an end may be made of all cōtrouersies betwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Catholikes and Protestants. For (as I sayd before) if Luther be the Author and beginner of the Protestant Church, it is certaine, that it is not the Church of Christ, nor to be follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed of Christians,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but to be forsaken &amp; dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. To which I ad now, that if Luther himself &amp; such &amp; so many learned &amp; famous Protestāts as I haue cited, do by many wayes, &amp; so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confesse, that Luther was the Author therof, it cannot be doubted, but that he was in truth the Author of it. For I alleadge not men of small credit among Protestants, but such as are of greatest authority with them; nor a few, but many; nor of one nation alone, but of diuers, to wit, Germans, Italians, French, English, Scottes, Flemings and others; nor Protestants of one sort or sect, but of all three namely Lutherans, Sacramētaries and English Protestants. So that they could not beare false witnesse in this matter either for wāt of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, because they were many and learned &amp; of different countries, and most diligent in searching the matter, and the matter it selfe most easy; nor for want of good will towards the cause, because they were all most earnest Protestants. And to refuse the testimonies of such witnesses in a matter of fact, in their owne time, so easy to be knowne, and so diligently
<pb facs="13"/> searched of them, what other thing is it, then obstinately to refuse to know the truth of this matter so important to be knowne, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may be made an end of all contentions in Religion? Wherfore let Protestants say as they please,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that in questions of doctrine they will not depend vpon Luther, Caluin, or any one, or all their doctours together, but vpon the scripture alone: Neuertheles in matter of fact, wherof the scripture saith nothing, such as this is (for the Scripture telleth not what was the state and condition of the Protestant Church when Luther began, in what place it was, what Pastours it had, who saw it, and the like) either they must confesse, that they refuse all triall &amp; knowledge of so important a truth, or they must giue credit to the deposition of sufficient witnesses. And if euer men were or can be sufficiēt witnesses of any matter of Fact, Luther and those Protestants which here I produce, are sufficient witnesses of that which I bring them for to testify. And thus much touching the cause why I proue Luther to haue been the founder of Protestant Religiō only by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Protestants.</p>
   <p n="10">
      <note place="margin">Why so many Protestāts testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes are alleaged.</note>10. As for the reason why I alleadge so many Protestants, that is, that it many appeare, that it is not the priuate testimony of some one or few, but the generall consent of them all, or
<pb facs="13"/> at least the common sentence of many of them. And if I seeme to any Catholike ouer tedious in heaping vp so many testimonies of Protestants, I pray him to cōsider, that I write not this book to Catholikes to confirme them in the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke faith, who I know to that end doe not need the testimonies of Protestants; but that I write it partly to Catholikes, for to furnish them with store of Protestants testimonies to stopp their mouthes, and to shew them that they are right Heretikes, that is, condemned (as the Apostle speaketh) by their owne iudgement, to which end a few testimonies of theirs would not suffice. And therfore to such as intend this end the multitude of testimonies will not be troublesome. For who, that indeauoureth to vāquish most obstinate enemies, will complain of the abundance of good soldiers wherof he may make choice? And if I had rehearsed only some few testimonies, and named the places where the rest may be found, some would haue cauilled, as M. Iewel did against D. Harding, that I had cited dumbe witnesses. Besides, seing the iudgments of men are diuers, it may fall out, that what kind of testimonyes seem strong &amp; forcible to some, others acount but weake and litle to the purpose; and therfore it was behofull, that there should be as it were a store-house of Protestants testimonies, that euery one might
<pb facs="14"/> take what weapon he thinketh fittest for him, &amp; vse it against them. But especially I gathered these testimonies of Protestants for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants themselues, that by their owne mens iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement I might withdraw them from their errour. And therfore I was not so fearfull to bring too many for Catholikes, as carefull to prouide inough for Protestants. In which I could hardly offend by multitude. For as S.<note n="(p)" place="margin">
