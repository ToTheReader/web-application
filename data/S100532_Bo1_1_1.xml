   <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER, BY DOCTOR BISHOP.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, I meane not here to entertaine thee with many words: the principall cause that moued me to write, was the honour and glorie of God, in defence of his sacred veritie, then the imploying of his talent bestowed vpon me: as well to fortifie the weaker sort of Catholiks in their faith, as to call backe and leade others (who wander vp and downe like to lost sheepe, after their owne fancies) into the right way.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>I tooke in hand particularly the confutation of this booke, not only for that I was thereunto requested by a friend of good intelligence and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who thought it very expediēt: but also because perusing of it, I found it penned more schollerlike then the Protestants vse to do ordinarily: For first the points in controuersy are set down distinctly, and for the most part truly. Afterward in confirmation of their opinion, the chiefe arguments are produced from both Scriptures, Fathers and reason: Which are not vulgar, but culled out of their Rabbins,</hi> Luther, Peter Martyr, Caluin, Kemnitius, <hi>and such like, though he name them not. Lastly, he placeth some obiections, made in fauour of the Catholike doctrine, and answereth to them as well as he could. And (which I speake to his commendation) doth performe all this very briefly and clearly. So that (to speake my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion freely) I haue not seene any booke of like quantitie, published by a Protestant, to contain either more matter, or deliuered in better method. And consequently more apt to deceiue the simple: especially considering, that he withal counterfeiteth to come as neare vnto the Romane Church as his tender conscience will permit him, whereas indeed he walketh as wide from it as any other noueller of this age.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Wherefore I esteemed my spare time best imployed about the discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="2" facs="10"/> of it, being (as it were) an abridgement of the principall controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of these times, and do endeuour after the same Scholasticall manner, without all superfluitie of words, no losse to maintaine and defend the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike partie, then to confute all such reasons as are by</hi> M. Perkins <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for the contrary.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Reade this short treatise (good Christian) diligently, for thou shalt find in it the marrow and pith of many large volumes, contracted and drawne into a narrow roome. And reade it ouer as it becometh a good Christian, with a desire to find out, and to follow the truth, because it concerneth thy eternall saluation: and then iudge without partialitie, whether Religion hath better grounds in Gods word more euident testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from the purest antiquitie, and is more conformable vnto all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, good life, and vpright dealing (the infallible marks of the best Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) and spedily embrace that. Before I end this short preface, I must intreate thy patience to beare with the faults in printing, which are too too many, but not so much to be blamed if it be courteously considered, that it was printed farre from the Author with a Dutch composer, and ouer seene by an vnskilfull Corrector, the greatest of them shall be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the end of the booke.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Before the printing of this part was finished, I heard that</hi> M. Perkins <hi>was dead. I am sorte that it commeth forth too late to do him any good. Yet his worke liuing to poyson others, a preseruatiue against it, is neuer the lesse necessary.</hi>
   </p>

      <head>R. ABBOT.</head>
      <p>IF you had respected the glorie of God, <hi>M. Bishop,</hi> it should haue appeared by your respect to yeeld soueraigne honour and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the word of God. God is in heauen, and we are vpon the earth: we haue no knowledge of him, no acquaintance or dealing with him but by his word. Therein we seeke him, and find him; therein he speaketh vnto vs, and thereout we learne to speake to him. If we haue the word of God, God is present with vs; if we be without the word of God, God himselfe is absent from vs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by our honour and obedience to the word of God, it must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that we truly and sincerely intend and seeke for the glorie of God. Hereby it appeareth that you, <hi>M. Bishop,</hi> in this your booke, haue not fought for the glorie of God, but rather to glorifie<note n="a" place="margin">Extrauag. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. 12. Cū inter. in glossa Credere dominum Deum nostrum Papam sic non potuisse statuere, &amp;c. hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticum censere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note>
         <hi>your Lord God the Pope,</hi> as your Glosse of the Canon law most blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
<pb n="3" facs="10"/> hath stiled him. You haue in this worke of yours vsed all maner of vntruth and falshood, to vphold and iustifie his wicked proceedings against the word of God. Whatsoeuer God hath taught vs, whatsoeuer Christ and his Apostles haue deliuered, all is nothing if your Lord God the Pope, and your master <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his proctor generall, do say the contrary. Howsoeuer simply and plainly they speake, yet they meane not as they speake, if the Pope and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will tell you another meaning. As for your <hi>talent,</hi> we take it to be greater in your owne opinion and the opinion of your fellowes, then it is indeed. But whatsoeuer it is, you haue abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to the wrong of him that gaue it, not to edification, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, not to fortifie any in the faith, but to nourish and harden them that depend vpon you, in error and misbeleefe; not to leade any into the right way, but to intice men to<note n="b" place="margin">Prou. 2.15.</note>
         <hi>crooked wayes and leud paths,</hi> which<note n="c" place="margin">Ch. 7.27.</note>
         <hi>go downe to the chambers of death,</hi> and the end whereof is confusion and shame; not to withdraw men from fancies, but to draw them to other fancies, from fancies in conuersation, to fancies in religion; that so being fed wholy with fancies, they may perish in the end for want of true food. And indeed men that wander in fancies, are the subiect for your malice and trechery to work vpon. Many that liue in the oportunitie of the knowledge of Christ, yet neglect and despise the same. The light shineth into their eyes, and they regard it not: God offereth himselfe vnto them, and they say in their hearts, We haue no delight nor pleasure in thee. Therefore being emptie and voide of truth, they lie open to be filled with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and lies; and hauing vnthankfully withholden themselues from God, God by iust iudgement giueth them ouer to the hands of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors and deceiuers, that it may be verified which the Apostle saith,<note n="d" place="margin">2. Thess. 2.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>
         </note>
         <hi>Because they receiued not the loue of the truth that they might be saued, therefore God shall send them strong delusion that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue lies, that they may be damned which beleeued not the truth, but tooke pleasure in vnrighteousnesse.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Your friend of good intelligence and iudgement, that <hi>thought it very expedient</hi> that you should take in hand the confutation of <hi>M. Perkins</hi> booke, spake thereof haply as <hi>Caiphas</hi> did of the death of Christ, meaning it one way which was to fall out another way. I doubt not but it will fall out to haue bene <hi>very expedient</hi> which you haue done, because you giue hereby occasion of discouering your
<pb n="4" facs="11"/> false doctrine, and of iustifying the truth of Christ, which <hi>M. Perkins</hi> was carefull to maintaine. I doubt not but many by this occasion will take knowledge of your corrupt and trecherous dealing, your patching and shifting, your cosening and deluding of men, and will discerne the weaknesse and absurdity of that bad cause, which with glorious and goodly words you labour so highly to aduance.</p>
      <p>As for your commendation of <hi>M. Perkins</hi> booke, it is but the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of some vaine-glorious captains, who to grace their owne victories, do set out to the vttermost the aduersaries power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse, thinking their glory to be the greater, by how much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men shall conceiue the might and valour of them to haue bene whom they haue ouercome. You dreamed of a victorie here, and you thought it to be much for your commendation, that your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary should be deemed of as great strength as any is to be found amongst vs. But we would haue you to vnderstand, that the Church of England neuer tooke <hi>M. Perkins</hi> booke to be a warriour in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete harnesse, or a chalenger for the field, but onely as a captaine training his souldiers at home, where he wanteth much of that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and defence wherewith he should endure the brunt of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. He wrote it very schollerlike indeed, for an introduction onely to the true vnderstanding and iudgement of the controuersies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs and you, but knew well, that it wanted much that might haue bene added, to giue it ful and perfect strength. You haue taken hereof some aduantage, as you conceiue, and yet how pitifully are you distressed many times both to vphold that which he obiecteth for you, and to answer that which he alledgeth for vs. Now if for the compiling of his booke he bestirred himselfe as the Bee, going into other mens gardens for the gathering of hony into his hiue, yet he made no Rabbines of them, to take any thing for hony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it grew in the garden of such or such a man, but vsed carefull and aduised consideration of that which he wrote, esteeming the weight of his arguments and of his answers, that he might faithfully performe what he did vndertake. But far otherwise haue you dealt, <hi>M. Bishop,</hi> in your <hi>marrow and pith</hi> as you cal it <hi>of many large volumes contracted and drawne into a narrow roome.</hi> You haue made <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> specially your Rabbine, your <hi>magister noster;</hi> you take all vpon his, word; if he say it, you will sweare it: if he haue once written it, you will write it againe without any further examination whether
<pb n="5" facs="11"/> it be true or false. We are beholding to you for translating so much of him into English for their sakes that do not vnderstand the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> mocketh and abuseth you <hi>M. Bishop,</hi> as he doth euery one that giueth him any trust. He was a man of corrupt and euill conscience, wholy prostituted to Antichrist, and sold to his deceits, by which means he maketh you to ly many times when you do not thinke ye lie. For which cause I would aduise you, when you will write any more bookes out of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to make due triall of that which he saith. It may haply doe you good, to make you detest his fraud and falshood, and to hate that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which cannot be vpholden but by such meanes. There is cause you should so do, who from many large volumes can gather no better marrow, no sounder pith, then that which you haue sent vs for the <hi>marrow and pith of many large volumes.</hi> Your marrow is but dust, your pith is but rottennesse: there is nothing in your booke fit to satisfie the conscience of a man desirous to be instructed in the truth. It will I hope sufficiently appeare, that you haue neither grounds from the word of God, nor any approued testimonie of antiquitie, to warrant any man to embrace that which you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. He that readeth your booke as it becometh a good Christian to do, and conferreth it with <hi>M. Perkins</hi> booke and our defence thereof, to iudge without partialitie, I presume he will take you for a leud and naughtie man, impudent and vnshamefast, regarding onely to vphold a side, without any entire regard to learne or to teach the truth. In your <hi>postscript</hi> you tell vs that you are sorie <hi>M. Perkins</hi> being dead, that your booke commeth forth too late to do him any good. Whereby we conceiue, that you haue a good opinion of it, but we must tell you as touching doing him good in your sence, he was not a man so weake as to be moued with such a toy. Indeed if he had liued, we need not doubt but it would haue done him much good, and bene great ioy to him, to see that in the <hi>marrow and pith of many large volumes</hi> there should be so little mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of moment to be said against that which he had written, so little and so bad, as that we hope that your <hi>preseruatiue</hi> will become your owne poison, and the bane of that which you thought to strengthen thereby.</p>
