      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloved, in our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iesus Christ;</hi> It hath pleased almighty God to visite whole <hi>Christendome,</hi> and especially our own deare <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> but most neerely the greatest part of this Assembly, with a very heavie, but well-deserved afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and calamitie, in pulling downe by a never-lesse expected death, two of the chiefest Pillars
<pb facs="3"/> of his <hi>Church,</hi> two of the chiefest Patrones of true <hi>Religion,</hi> two of the chiefest Instruments of his <hi>Glorie;</hi> the two Royall Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in that moment of Time, when our hopes were at the best, that GOD by them would have saved His <hi>Israel.</hi> Wel, <hi>Beloved,</hi> Our unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable sinnes have most justly deserved this, and much more, and worse: yea, GODS mercie and goodnesse it is, that wee are not utterly consumed; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and pronounce from this our grievous losse and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that the wrath of the <hi>Almightie</hi> is kindled against the continuance of our sinfull cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb facs="3"/> it is most requisite, that with unfained repentance, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all resolutions of serving GOD more carefully then ever yet wee have done, we goe to meete the LORD, and to hold his hands from destroying us utterly. To this purpose now wee are met in the Vallie of (<hi>Bochim,</hi>) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to lift up our mournfull voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in lamenting and bewailing our incomparable losses, in the death of those two pious and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roike <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Champions;</hi> but to confesse our murthering sins unto the LORD, to repent and reforme our selues, to pray to GOD for a gracious pardon: and that thus reconciled, He would bee pleased with the dew of his
<pb facs="4"/> blessed comforts to refresh, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and cherish the Royall &amp; Princely <hi>Houses,</hi> and all the true hearted Friends &amp; Dependants of those deceased <hi>Worthies;</hi> that He would not reject, but in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie regard us; And besides to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue instruction out of His sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Word▪ how we are to frame our lives and courses in time to come, that the <hi>Almightie</hi> may heare our prayers, &amp; let his gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious face to shine againe upon our troubled soules. But because of our selues wee are altogether unable, to thinke one good thought, much lesse to speake or performe any good thing, let us joyn in humble petition to God the Father of our Lord <hi>Iesus
<pb facs="4"/> Christ,</hi> for the assistance of his <hi>blessed Spirit,</hi> that our hearts may be cleansed and sanctified, and his holy Word preached may bring fruit in us, to his glorie, and the eternall welfare and salvation of our poore soules. Almighty, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and &amp;c.</p>
