   <head>TO THE TRVLY-Religious M. Crashavv, <hi>M. Milward, M. Dauyes, M.</hi> Heling, with other worthy <hi>Citizens, my very good</hi> Friends.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen,</hi> Because you haue iust occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in your callings to deale often with Merchandise, I haue beene bold to call you a little from your Temporall, to a <hi>Spirituall</hi> Traffique: and haue sent you a Christian <hi>Nauigatour, bound for the Holy Land;</hi> who without question will giue you some relations of his Trauells, worthy two houres perusing. You shall finde a whole <hi>Sea</hi> sailed through in a short time; and that a large <hi>Sea,</hi> not a foote lesse then the World. You will say, the description lyes in a little volume: Why, you haue seene the whole world narrow'd vp into a small Mappe. They that haue beene said, after many yeares, at last to compasse it, haue not described all coasts and corners of it. Euen their silence hath giuen succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="65"/>
generations hope to find out new Lands; and you know, they haue found them. You cannot expect more of two houres discouery, then of seauen yeares. I leaue many things to be descried by others: yet dare promise this, that I haue giuen you some necessary directions for your happiest voyage. Ouer this <hi>glassy Sea</hi> you must saile, you are now sayling. <hi>Truth</hi> be your Card, &amp; the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> your Pilot. Your Course being well direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you cannot possibly make a happier iourney. The Hauen is before your eyes, where your Sauiour sits with the hand of mercy wafting you to him. You cannot bee <hi>Sea-sicke,</hi> but he will comfort, and restore you. If the Tempest comes, call on him with <hi>Peter, Lord saue vs;</hi> and he will <hi>rebuke the windes and the Seas;</hi> they shal not hurt you. <hi>Storme and tempest,</hi> winds and waters obey his voyce. What Rocks, Gulfes, Swallowes, and the danger (worse then that is called the Terror of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> the Pyrate; one plague which the Deuill hath added to the Sea, more then Nature gaue it) of that great <hi>Leuiathan,</hi> Satan; and other perils that may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger you, are marked out. Decline them so well as you may; and consider what Prouidence guides your course: this <hi>Sea</hi> is <hi>Before</hi> Gods <hi>Throne.</hi> Keepe you the Cape of <hi>good Hope</hi> in your eye: and what euer becomes of this weake Vessell, your <hi>Body;</hi> make sure to saue the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger, your <hi>Soule,</hi> in the day of the Lord <hi>Iesus.</hi> What is here directed you, shall be faithfully prayed for, by him</p>
