   <p>THou shalt here receive (Gentle Reader) a short
narration of a large matter, together with certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
taken at Nottingham, tending to the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of a marvelous work of God, latelie shewed among
vs; written (as it seemeth) by some frend of this cause, and of
the witnesses thereof: to staie if it maie be the malice of some,
and rashnes of others, who will not be reclamed from impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
or baselie esteeming of this glorious work, a greatter then
which, hath skarcelie bene heard of (saving performed in like
cases) eyther in our dayes, or in the dayes of our fore fathers for
manie yeares. Yf it were particularlie ād fullie discovered (as
we wish it might be) howe strangelie this William Sommers
came to be possessed by meanes of a witch in Worcester shire,
who sent a wicked spirit into him, witch he called Lucie: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
he was tormēted during his possession: howe the foule spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
raged, and the Lord Iesus prevailed at his dispossession:
howe he was subtillie tempted, ād estsoones repossessed: howe
extraordinarelie he hath caried himselfe since his dispossession:
howe the Devill hath busied himselfe against the servant of
Christ Iesus, who was the chife meanes of the dispossession:
and howe some persons trulie other wise fearing God, have
bene incredulous, some vppon one fansie, and some vppon an
other: speaking Iere. 23. 16. by vision out of their owne heart,
ād not from the Lords mouth: or els giving credit to this work,
and the witnesses thereof have not taken it to heart, much les
vouchsafed to visit, comfort, and releive them, or to vse some la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wefull
meanes, and mediation to our godlie Magistrates, (as
they should) in the behalfe of the men of God theyr brethren
whom God hath honoured to suffer for the testimonie of this
his holie truth: Yf (I saie) all these things were fullie disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and well weighed, doubtles a man must needes be asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and expect a rarer event of these things then can be yet
conceived. By the waie the providēce of our mercifull and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlie
father is to be wiselie observed, ād with greate humilitie
to be reuerenced, that he hath suffered this matter to becalled in
<pb facs="4"/>
question, and for so long time to be ventilated, and sifted into
as it hath bene. Doubtles, as we haue experience of our dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in apprehending, and profitablie meditating vppon other
maruelous acts of the Lord dailie shewed before our eies, so
if this work had not bene mightilie impugned, we should also
haue negligentlie slipped it ouer, and the residue of like nature
of late performed, without yeelding such due honour to God,
and to the powerfull exercises of prayer and fasting, as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth.
Albeit God thus turneth the rage of man to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
yet I would advise them who slaunder this work, ād perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the servāthes of God, without cause, to take hede least they
be found evē fighters against God. For he that sitteth in the
heaven sees their devises, and laughes them to skorne and
they, and all theyr conspiracies, plots slaunderingh, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velingh
shall consume like a snaile that melteth but this migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
work, seing it is of God, and was without question a deede
done according to the witnes giuen vnto it, cannot be reversed
or destroied but mager the malice, and subtiltie of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
though M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dorrell should be consumed to ashes the truth
thereof shall breake forth as the light, and the glorie thereof
as a burning lamp. God hath lighted a candle, not in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but hath advanced it as it were on a candelstick in the
heart, or center of our land that the beames thereof might shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
forth, and give light to all the Realme. It is not in theyr
power (though it hath bene given out by a greate man among
them, that seeing they have taken it in hand they will have the
credit of it) altogether to eclipse, or whollie to hide it vnder abus
hell when they have had theyr swinge but a litle, they wilbe
ashamed of theyr owne follie. Nowe till the time appointed be
expired, let all faithfull hearted men beware, least they take
Gods name in vaine by baselie esteeming of this mightie work
or beare false witnes against theyr neighbours, in crediting
lying rumours against those men of God who doe nowe, or
hereafter shall suffer in this holie cause. I praie, consider with
me a litle these circumstances, and procedings, and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlie
<pb facs="4"/>
judge wihth whom the right standeth. M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dorrell and
M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Moore who are nowe imprisoned for giving testimonie to
this truth, have bene both of them for manie yeares aproved
godlie ministers, just, and simple hearted men, fearing God,
of good reputation among the best Christians, and painfull
preachers where they lived. God hath marvelouslie blessed
theyr joint labours in dispossessing seven persons together in
Lamashire: which is so notorious, and free from challenge, as
the enimies to this Action of Nottingham dare not once to call
yt into question. The Papists take knowledge of the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
and dispossession in Lamashire: but they would fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
have vs beleyve that theyr seminarie Preists were the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
actors: Yea this phansie hath takē such impressiō in them,
that some of them have not doubted to saie, if it can be proved
that M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Moore, and M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dorrell did performe that work, they
would disclayme theyr religion, and imbrace ours. They that
have accused, and prosecuted, against M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dorrell be men
that have blasphemed the Scriptures, Popish persons, and
knowen enimies to the preaching of the Gospell. The wrath
of God is allreadie gone forth against one of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dorrells gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attest
enimies, namelie M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Sale Officiall of Wesson whose
child is latelie vexed whith an evill spirit: bycause (as his wife
reporteth) he hath bene adversarie to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dorrell. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedings
against him, and others have bene verie violent. He
was put to silence by the Arch-Bishop of York whithout
fufficient cause warranted by lawe: ād as if this had bene too
litle to be deprived of the vse of his ministerie, and of his live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihode,
having a wife, and five children: he was called before
the Commissioners of Canterburie province: ād without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
or examining his cause was sodainlie cōmitted. Brought
before the seate of justice: they who at the same time gave gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
audience to Papists. Arrians, Atheists, and blasphemers,
would not permit him to speake anie thing almost in his owne
defense: but (as though he had bene the most dānable wretch
in the world) before anie conviction exceedinglie reviled him.
<pb facs="5"/>
Iudges became parties, pleaders, and accusers: Some stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that anie should be present as witnesses to their doings:
They would not suffer one of the depositions to be read before
them: the Commissioners, and deponents, were contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouslie
rejected: charge given that no copies of the depositiōs
should be divulged. Committance was threatned to diverse,
onely bycause they tooke acquaintance which M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Moore.
saying none ought to be countenanced, that was disgraced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them. M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dorrell having but one copie of the depositions,
he delivered it vnto them for theyr satis-faction, and though
they gave him promise that it should be returned, when his
wife required it, they menaced her to Bridewell. There hath
bene running to the court to forestall the Lords, and Ladies of
honour, and to hinder the preferring of petitions in M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
behalfe to the right honorable Lords of the privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.
And bycause Thomas Darling a boie of Burton vppon
Trent of the age of 15. Yeares, or thereabouts had bene dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
by prayer vppon advise taken from M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dorrell, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by a booke published some yeares agoe): in hatred of
M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dorrell the bookes were called in, and the printer impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
as if he had published a fined matter. M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Bainbridge,
a Gentleman of good reckoning in Darbie shire was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Bishop of London to shewe his opinion touching
the sayd Darling, he answered it was the common voice of
the countrie, which he beleyved to be true, that he was in deede
possessed, and dispossessed: the Bishop told him in great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
but that if he had not heard well of him, he would clap him
in prison for so saying. Thus having delt whith the printer,
and M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Bainbridge, then he thought meete to examine the
matter: belike to see whether he had done well or not, thus to
determine, and then to heare. So he sent a Pursivant for the
boye of Barton. The Pursivant having receyved 40.<seg rend="sup">s</seg>. of the
boyes frends: the boye was kept in the Bishop of Londons
house: and committed to the tuition of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Harsenet who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telie
had bene vomited out of Cambridge for his erroneous
<pb facs="5"/>
opinions. None of the boies frends might be suffered to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
vnto him. He was allured by promises: terrified by thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atnings:
as that he should be hanged as the Burgonion was
whom they shewed vnto him, hāging at Londō, all a daie long
for a murder: Also that he should be whipped, and laid in
Newegate. He was close prisoner in a chamber two dayes,
the boie of Nottingham appointed for his keeper, who with
the prophane serving men were alwaies skorning at him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a straunger among them: letters were contrived in Mr
Dorrells name vnto him willing him to acknowledge a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeyt
possession: and letters were returned by him whereyn
he protested the truth, and would not in anie sort be removed
from it. All this was practized to heape shame, if it might be
vpon Mr Dorrell: but when they percived that the power of
God in the boie was stronger then the malice of Satan, they
let him goe: but I doe not heare that the 40. shillings was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
restored. Not finding anie help herein to prove M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
a practitioner in conterfeyting whith this boye of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
a Commission was directed to five persons in Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
(Satan could not have wished better): that is to the
verie same men who have persecuted M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Dorrell at Nottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gham,
York, and London ever since this matter came in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
This was to encounter the former depositions taken by
vertue of a Commission awarded from York as is set forth
in this treatise. It fell out that Robert Cooper the Clerk of
S<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Maries in Nottingham caused the 94. Psalme to be song
before these Commissioners sate in Commission, which being
done of purpose, or vnawares, (I knowe not) but sure it is,
it so galled them, bycause it describeth the like practizes of old
as they nowe had in hand, that the poore man was fetch vp
to London for this heinous fact. These proper Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
refused such as were willing to justifie the truth vppon
theyr othes, they picked out whom they listed, and wrote
what pleased them▪ When they were to examine M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Aldridge,
and his Curate they caused them to sweare that they would
<pb facs="6"/>
not reveale vnto anie others the things whereof they should
be deposed. What goodlie stuffe they have returned, time and
malice will make knowne vnto vs. Yet all this being not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to obscure, and suppresse the work of God, if anie man
about Nottingham doe saie that Sommers was possessed,
and dispossessed, he is threatned to be bound to the good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
Behold and wonder at the violence of these men. Doe
ye thinck that if they had a good matter in hand▪ they would
be halfe so zealous. O Lord, (if it be thy good will) open theyr
eies, and turne theyr hearts that they maie see and comprehēd
this great and wonderfull work wich thou hast done among
vs, that the faith of vs all maie be strengthned, our loue to thee
and thine Embassadours increased▪ Satan confounded, and
our sinfull liues amended to the great praise of thy holie name
and our everlastin comfort in Christ Iesus. Amen.</p>
