      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His present Treatise, which here I meane to publish and diuulge, I first writ and penned in the Spanish tongue, with an intention to haue benefitted herein my owne Nation, and such as were in a way, to embrace Gods sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and trueth; which notwithstanding could take no effect, by reason I wanted fit meanes and conueniencie, to print it in the Spanish: and then on the other side, some speciall friends both mooued and perswaded me, to Translate it into English, and publish it in my owne name, for the better satisfaction of this Noble and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Nation, both in regard of what they may feare and doubt of in me, as also in regard of what I desire to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, and make knowne &amp; impart to this whole Nation; That as God hath vouchsafed me the singular grace and fauour, to discerne and embrace the trueth of this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall Church and Doctrine; so I hope, the same mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and grace, will euer be ready at hand, to fortifie and strengthen me against all humane debilities, that if iust occasion be offered, I may most constantly perseuere in the same to the end, and be prepared (if God so ordaine) to seale and confirme it with my dearest blood. And though there haue beene some, who after their illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="4"/>and profession of this Tructh, haue with the dogge, returned to their vomite; yet the like ought not to bee censur'd and iudged of all: For <hi>Iudas</hi> his being wicked and a reprobate, were no iust reason to condemne the rest of the Apostles; and so though one English-man should be the occasion of the vntimely death of another, yet were it no reason hereupon, to beare a generall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the whole Nation: Wherefore, it must needs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue either a weake, or depraued Iudgement, by the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie of one, to presage and expect the like from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Considering, that though there haue beene some, who haue reuolted, yet many likewise there haue beene, who haue perseuered constantly euen to death. From whom, being good men, we should rather presume of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers stabilitie and perseuerance, then from the other to conclude ill of all, by reason of the errour and leuitie of some: Since Christian charitie <hi>(quae non cogitat malum)</hi> obligeth vs to the same: and in that it is onely God, who affoords the speciall grace of perseuerance (euen as hee was the Authour of a good beginning) whose power is no lesse amongst Italians and Spaniards, then it is ouer other Nations; and who alone is able, and willing, <hi>ex la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidibus, suscitare filios Abrahae:</hi> whereunto let me also an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexe this farther, (that I may modestly affirme somewhat in behalfe of my owne particular nation) very fewe Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards at any time haue beene found, (I speake of those that are learned and vnderstanding) that euer renounced the Christian faith, which they haue once entertained and embraced, as it may most apparently be auerr'd and proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by many zealous and learned men, which haue beene and dayly are tormented, and exposed to the fire by that cruell and tyrannicall Court of the Spanish Inquisition, for maintaining and defending Christian verity and truth,
<pb facs="4"/>so fearefull and terrible a death, together with the iniury herein done both to themselues and their friends, hauing no power to shake their constancie, in a Religion which they haue professed and vndertaken. That this is true and infallible, it may be obserued in more then a fewe Churches of <hi>Spaine,</hi> wherein many <hi>Sanbenitos</hi> are han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp (which are not like those <hi>Sacci benedicti</hi> in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, imposed vpon true and deuout penitents, but rather <hi>Sacci maledicti</hi>) which are certaine written Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, wherein are registred the death, and punishment of such good Christians, whom they haue exposed to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull and shamefull death for this Religion, which they terme <hi>Caluinian,</hi> or <hi>Lutherane.</hi> And were it not for this bloody and cruell proceeding of the Inquisition, the Pontificall Religion would at this day be soone banisht out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in stead thereof, by Gods assistance and furtherance, true Religion planted and established; as Doctor <hi>Yllescas</hi> plainely auerres: while he much laments and grieues, for the small number of Christians at this day. In <hi>Spaine</hi> (saith he) what should we now haue been, if thirteene yeeres since, the diabolicall conspiracies of <hi>Cazalla</hi> and <hi>Constantino</hi> had not beene discouered.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Yllescas</hi> enlae prefacion y ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumento sobre el vlt. lib. de la historia Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical, y Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica.</note> These infernall conspiracies, whereof this Authour speakes, were (to the great heart-griefe, both of himselfe and all other Papists) the pure and sincere profession of true Christian Religion. This <hi>Cazalla</hi> (of whom this Author so infamously reports, euery one speaking as hee is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) was a Doctor of Diuinitie, of singular vertue and vnderstanding, who in the yeere 1557. was burnt in <hi>Vallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolid,</hi> for the Protestant Religion, together with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, brothers, and sisters, and a Knight of speciall good quality, called <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> as also the Marques of <hi>Poza</hi> sonne, and many others, were exceedingly afflicted and
<pb facs="5"/>persecuted: the house, whither they vsed daily to repaire to heare the word of God, was rased downe, and sowed with salt, that it might neuer be reedified: and in the middest of this house,<note place="margin">This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne I haue seeene with mine owne eyes.</note> they set a marble pillar, for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall, that there faithfull Christians (whom they call <hi>Hereges Lutheranos</hi>) were woont to assemble. <hi>Constantino</hi> also was a Doctor of as profound and great learning, as <hi>Spaine</hi> in many ages had brought forth. Hee was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher and Confessor to that renowmed Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and by this meanes, if he had affected it, he might haue risen to very eminent dignities; but all this he reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and contemned, (as a man that made no account of these worldly honours) and went to <hi>Seuilla,</hi> where he was taken by the Inquisition, and dying there, his body was afterwards burned by order of the same Inquisition. His followers (whom this Author specifies) were very rare men, both for their learning and liues, who opposed themselues, and in Pulpits publikely preacht against the tyranny, doctrine, and proceedings of the Pope, and the Inquisitors; explaining sincerely to the people, the trueth of Christs sacred Gospel, to such wonderfull benefit and emolument of all the faithfull, that in the same time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue eight hundred were taken and imprisoned for this cause, by the Inquisition, onely within the compasse of the Citie of <hi>Seuilla.</hi> Some of them were rich people, and of very good quality, both men and women; among which number, was <hi>Don Iuan Ponce de Leon,</hi> brother to the <hi>Counte de Baylen,</hi> and cousin to the Duke of <hi>Arcos,</hi> a Gentleman questionlesse of singular pietie and integritie; and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Ioana,</hi> wife to the Lord of <hi>Higuera,</hi> whom, presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her child-bearing, the Inquisitors expos'd to a torment called <hi>del Burro,</hi> in the castle of <hi>Triana,</hi> and the torment was so great, that she died thereof: for the cords pierced
<pb facs="5"/>euen to the marrow bones of her armes, her thighes and legges; and in this her affliction and torment, they caried her backe againe to prison, in a maner dead, she vomiting blood out of her mouth in great abundance, her very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes being rent and torne: in the end, some eight dayes after these torments, she died, hauing no body neere, or about her, no not so much as a damosell, who a few dayes before, was cruelly handled and tormented as her selfe was. Many of this number thus imprisoned and taken, were afterwards burned, which they did, by twentie and twenty at a time; the rest were most barbarously and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely entreated; the house where they congregated was defac't, and vsed after the same maner as that of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalla</hi> was in <hi>Valladolid.</hi> Let the courteous Reader peruse that religious and learned mans worke, <hi>Cyprian de Valera,</hi> in his peculiar Treatise of the Authoritie of the Pope, where he relates these persecutions more at large: And to a booke entituled, <hi>Inquisitto Hispanica,</hi> written first by a Spaniard in Latine, &amp; afterwards translated into English, where both these, and many other sorts of torments are described, wherwith they persecute the faithfull in <hi>Spaine.</hi> But that which hath been deliuered, shall suffise me at this time: whereby it may appeare, that if it were not for the strictnesse of that rigorous Inquisition, there would excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many and faithfull good Protestants, daily manifest and reueale themselues; and yet notwithstanding the same, and all their cruelties vsed, there are in many parts some: all which may iustly excite a charitable and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable construction of those, that leaue those Kingdomes, and repaire into other Dominions, that they may there, with all Christian liberty, truely worship and call vpon Gods holy Name. And let none be ready to reproach vs (as many vse to doe) with a Bishop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> or some
<pb facs="6"/>other famous Impostor, and subtill Spie; for God forbid we should all be made of the same metrall: for as the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish prouerbe saies, <hi>Todos los dedos de la mano, no son yguales;</hi> There's difference betwixt one man and another. Besides, the many and singular commodities we haue beene ready to leaue and forsake in our owne Countreys, and the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable troubles, pouerties, discontentments, and distasts that we meet withall in forreine parts, yeeld no weake nor slender testimony, that God doth graciously intend to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the good worke he hath already begun in vs. And in my opinion, a man hath no reason to forbeare the doing of good to another, in that he is fearefull and mistrustfull of his doing ill; because in this case we ought not so much to respect the person whom we benefit, as him, for whose cause we are moou'd to any commiseration or pity; and this is God. Neither in like maner, is it a good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable course, for the attracting and bringing of a man to any good, and to abett and vphold his perseuerance therein, to draw backe our hands from his reliefe and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; for this were enough in them vnstable, and not inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and habituated, in afflictions and calamities, to make them murmure with the Israelites in the wildernesse, and to cry out againe after the fleshpots of Egypt: Although for my part, I am confident by Gods affistance and grace, notwithstanding all worldly contrarieties, that I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer consent or yeeld to so odious a Renunciation, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I thanke God, well instructed and prepared and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, and hope so to continue in this maine point and master-peece of Christianitie, that, <hi>per multas tribulatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; calamitates, oportet nos ingredi regnum Dei.</hi>
