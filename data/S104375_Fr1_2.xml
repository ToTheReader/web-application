         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>row for our youth, that it be we instructe and brought vp in the true feare of God, &amp; after
<pb facs="3"/> suche a godly sorte y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it myght liue in all vertue, godlynes &amp; honestie. And it is a thyng whereunto not onely the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the heathen, but also our owne naturall reasō, day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience, &amp; the loue of the comon wealth ought lawfully to moue and enforce vs. For asmuche as we dayly fele and perceiue right euidently, what incōueniēce doth insue, where youth is neglecte &amp; not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And agayne what a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, comfort &amp; cōmoditie it is vnto an whole comon wealth, where youth is well brought vp in godly learnyng &amp; exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and exercised in vertue &amp; holynesse. This I saye, myght be sufficient to styrre vp and to kindle our heartes toward the
<pb facs="3"/> right institucion &amp; bryngyng vp of youth, although we wer but very heathen. But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we are christian men and women, and through out sauior Christ become the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, therfore the most holy worde of God &amp; the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our sauior Christ, ought moste specially to allure &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs vnto this moste holy and necessary office. For fyrst it is euident ynough by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes what an high charge our sauior Christe geueth vs ouer youth. Math. xviii. &amp; .xix. and Marke. x. Where, by his hertye and louyng imbracyng of them, he declareth manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that no seruice can bee more acceptable vnto him, than that whiche is spent about them, to
<pb facs="4"/> bryng and induce them vnto him. Lykewyse howe earnestly doeth S. Paul commaund all parentes to bryng vppe theyr children in nurture and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion? Ephe. vi. and Collo. iii. For the whiche cause, all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue a speciall commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God to be obedience vnto theyr fathers &amp; mothers, because they ought to be vnto them, as the very deputies and officers of God, in continually exercisyng them to the glorye and honor of God. And howe highly almyghtie God regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ryght institucion of youth, we may learne out of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> old testamente sufficiently, and specially out of the .xviii cha. of Genesis. Wheras God, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng vnto the faythfull Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<pb facs="4"/> his mynde and purpose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste Sodoma &amp; Gomorra sayeth these woordes. <hi>I knowe, sayeth the Lorde, that his children shall kepe the wayes of the Lorde, and do that thyng whiche is ryght and iust, that the Lorde may suffer that thyng to come to passe vnto Abraham, whiche he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised hym. &amp;c.</hi> This holy sentence of God ought to be alone suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient vnto a christen man (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is by faythe a childe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham) to moue hym to apply all indeuour and studye to the christen educacion of youth. For here we haue a singulare comforte &amp; a sure promyse, that if we be founde true &amp; faythfull towarde these gyftes of God our children, than wyll God daily encrease &amp; augmente hys grace towarde vs, and enduce
<pb facs="5"/> vs into further knowledge of his godly wyll, to the glory of his name, &amp; welth of our sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. And beside this, God ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth strayght commaundemēt by expresse woordes in diuerse places that we shoulde in no wyse neglecte our youth. As in the .vi. and .xi. of Deu. where God commaūded Moses that all menne shoulde teache theyr children and childrens children, his lawes &amp; commaūdemētes. Lykewise, through the {pro}phete Dauid, God speaketh these wordes in the .lxxviii. Psalme. <hi>The lord hath made a couenaunt with Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and hath geuen Israel a lawe, which their posteritie and heires should knowe, and tell it vnto their children, that they might also put and fixe their hope and cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fidence vpō God, and kepe his comaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and not for get his workes. &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>By this we must nedes confesse and knowledge that it is an high thyng, by god our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the moste requisite &amp; speciall poyncte in a christen cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregacion, that the chyldren be well taught and instructe in the wayes of the Lorde, and in the couenaunte whiche God hath made with theyr fathers and theyr posteritie for euer in our Sauyour Christe. For by this meanes only they must learne to knowe God, to be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded of his mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towarde them, to put all theyr truste and confidence in him only and to loue and feare hym. And this foundation once layed, they shall afterwarde frame and buylde theyr whole lyfe vpon thesame, and learne
<pb facs="6"/> all humblenes, obedience, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, vertue and godlynes, in worde and dede, and dayly be more inclyned and bente to the true religion and knowlege of God, and euermore increase &amp; goe forwarde in thesame. And thus the whole common welth shall receyue comforte and ioy by them: And they in processe of time, shall learne to instructe their chyldren in the Lorde, in lyke maner. And thus there shall neuer waxe any nettels, thistles or wedes in this tillage of the Lorde, nor they shall not perishe through our negligence.</p>
   <p>For God suffereth vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in this worlde, (&amp; taketh vs not away immediatly after we haue atteyned to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of hym) for no nother
<pb facs="6"/> cause, but that we should helpe &amp; further other vnto thesame, that the glory &amp; perfite religion of God myght also bee planted &amp; waxe in our children &amp; poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytie. And surely the negligence of men in this behalfe hath hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been the chefe cause of so many and dyuers heuy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues of God. As Christe doeth manyfestlye declare where he sayth: <hi>Woo vnto hym that offendeth</hi> (or hindreth) <hi>youth. &amp;c. It were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for hī that he wer cast into the sea with a mylstone about his necke and drowned.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Wherfore all they that wyll auoyde this woe, let them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all that study and care with most earnest zeale and indeuor, that their youth be wel instruct and brought vp.</p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p>For this can no man denye, that the very occasion and grounde of all the mischiefe and wycked dissolutenes that reigneth in the worlde at this daye, is, that the bringing vp of youth is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor diligenter regarded. Where subiectes are not so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto their heades and rulers as they ought to be, it is moste specially in suche places where the institucion of youth hath been neglecte. Likewise where parentes are vnreuerent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly intreated of their children, it is through the sufferaunce of God for a punishemente vnto them for so euill and negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brynging of them vp in theyr youth. And what hath been the cause of the heuy blindnesse and ignoraunce in the worlde, in the
<pb facs="7"/> trwe relygion and seruice of God, of the manifold ydolatry &amp; supersticion, other than the lacke of the ryght &amp; true insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucion of youth? Wherfore yf we will auoyde the wrath and indignacion of God, &amp; all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>er of inconuenience, let vs apply more studie &amp; diligence that our youth maye be better brought vp in the knowledge and feare of God, that in theyr younge and tender age they maye learne the prynciples of Christes religion and of our christen fayth. Which shalbe a meane to a voyde all the incō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniēce aboue rehersed. And if we do not this, let vs loke for no nother but y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> theyr bloude, perisshing through our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, shall be straitly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of our handes. And not
<pb facs="8"/> onely of parentes, but also of all suche as haue any cure and charge of youth, as Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters in theyr scholes, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours and ministers in theyr cures. These should bee the speciall instructours of youth. These shoulde beate into chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens heades the chiefe poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten doctryne. As are, the .x. Commaundementes, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tycles of the fayth, the Lordes prayer, the institucion of the holy Sacramentes of Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tysme, and of the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lorde, and laste of all, the institucion of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall or churche disciplyne and exercise of brotherly correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, &amp;c.</p>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <p>These poynctes beeyng fyrste taught vnto chyldren by theyr parentes woorde for woorde, (whiche is the office and duty of all christen parentes to do,) a playne and symple vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, might afterward bee taught them eyther in the schole by the scholemaisters, or els in the churche by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoures and ministers, geuyng them euery Sunday one shorte article or question to learne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petyng it distinctlye twyse or thryse, and requiring it of them agayne the nexte Sunday, and than to gyue and repete vnto them in lyke maner another, vntyll the whole Catechisme, be learned out, and than begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng agayne.</p>
   <pb facs="9"/>
   <p>If but one houre were thus spente euery Sonday of euery pastour and minister in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the youthe in the churche before the face of the whole pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryshe, or of euery scholemaister but once a weke, (theyr paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes earnestly warning and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng theim to learne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membre what is taught them) we shoulde fele w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>in one yeare, what infinite profite shoulde come thereof, and within fewe yeares we shoulde haue a flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysshing common welth: This doeth God moste straytely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of vs, and we had neuer suche occasion vnto it as we nowe haue, consideryng howe earnestly our moste christen ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, the Kynges moste excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Maiestie, his ryght woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
