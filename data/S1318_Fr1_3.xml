   <div type="excerpt_from_preface">
      <p>THis Epistle was written by the author vnto two maydens that were before
purposed out of zele to have suffred death for the confession sake of the
Christiā ceremonies, which as he saith in divers places of his works, are no
more but outward meanes set forth by God &amp; his ministers to direct people to the
inward righteous life of Christ in the spirit;) supposing therin that they should
rightly have obeyed &amp; fulfilled the cōmandemēt of Christ, who willeth vs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
our own lives for his sake. But vpon better consideration therof, through the
grace of God, and these distinct godly testimonies and reasons, (both touching that
point and divers others) herein conteyned; their mindes as it hath bene repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some of that followship wer altered herin to an other vnderstanding of the
matter, and they did willingly indevour themselves afterwards, to follow his
good counsel.</p>

      <p>THe drift of this Epistle / being (at the best) to
disswade from the pacient and cōstant witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the truth of Christ / especially in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ordinances of the gospel and open profession
of the same, Under a colour of inward and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
confession / and service of God in the holy Ghost
it shal not be amisse to look a little into the sleights
of Satan / wherby (as it seemeth) he hath deceived / 
and would stil deceive the simple; and to shew the
weaknes and insufficiencie of the reasons alleged
in this Letter: as also to manifest / how the outward
obedience of the body / must be conjoyned with the
inward of the mind and spirit; and the external or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of Christs testament professed and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
if we would have the spirit and life which is
of God. And howsoever <hi>H. N.</hi> accounteth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of the gospel but <hi>ceremonies;</hi> yet in that
he confesseth them to be <hi>outward meanes set forth by


<pb facs="4"/>
God, to direct people to the inward righteous life of
Christ in the spirit,</hi> he manifesteth himself to be but
a seducer / in perswading the <hi>two maydens</hi> not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
death for the confession sake of them: seing the
outward meanes of mans salvation and of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Christian life / is to be stood for vnto the death / 
as in handling the particulars shal by Gods grace
appear. And if by the authors counsel / those daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were drawn (as here is insinuated) from their
outward confession &amp; suffring affliction for the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Christ / against the Romish Antichristian
doctrines &amp; ceremonies; their faith was but weak / 
they forsook the inward righteous life of Christ in
the spirit / and their mindes were perverted to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
evil vnderstanding. If also they assented to other
points of <hi>H. Ns.</hi> heresies / and folowed his corrupt
counsel: then were they led<note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 6. 7.</note> captive / (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
sayth / ) being simple women / laden with synns
and led with divers lusts. From which
estate / God keep al his people / &amp;
direct their feet in the
wayes of life
&amp; peace.</p>
