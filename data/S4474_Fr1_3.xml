   <head>AN ANSVVER TO MASTER <hi>RAI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOLDS</hi> PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by his gouernours to make this answere,<note place="margin">pag 3.</note> as he saith, or els of his owne accord tooke the matter in hande without commission of any superior au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, I take it to be a thing of small regard, both in respect of himselfe, and of his worke, and also of those his superiours, to whose direction he professeth to haue committed himselfe, and all the giftes he hath. Onelie this thing I cannot beleeue., although it be no more materiall, then the other, that he was so loth to take vpon him this buisines, as he pretendeth. For if we consider not onelie the manner of his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wherein appeereth as great malice against the trueth of God, as shameles railing at Christs gospell, and professors thereof, as notable pride, presumption, and hardnes of hart, as euer hath done in anie enemie heretofore; but further also how necessarie it was for him, being a Renegate, and of a Minister and Pastor of a Church become
<pb n="2" facs="10"/>sodenlie a seminarie Priest, &amp; therefore liuing in great suspicion▪ mongst his fellowes, to approoue by some publike testimony his vnfeigned conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to their synagogue, we shall not easilie be persuaded to thinke there was in the man such vnwillingnes in this matter at the first, as he would haue vs to suppose. But as vaine decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are commonlie wont to excuse themselues with pretense of being loth to attempt so waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a matter, that they maie seeme somewhat vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to doe the thing, which in truth they doe moste willinglie and studiouslie, so <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> could not deuise a more commodious beginning of his declamatorie preface, then a protestation of lothnes to write that, which anie man maie casilie iudge he went about with all his will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie, and habilitie.</p>
   <p>And that you maie the rather imagine he was forsooth verie lothe to take this matter in hand, he can shew you diuerse reasons, that made him so loth: and yet the true reason, that ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede to haue hindred his course, he toucheth not, that herein he was to set himselfe against the knowen truth, to write against his conscience in open maintenance of wicked heresies, to fight for Antichrist against the Lord, and finallie to commit the sinne, that either in propertie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the greatest of all, or commeth neerest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. One reason was, he saith, because he sawe manie in that societie, <hi>as willing and more hable to vndertake, and dispatch a greater matter then that.</hi> As willing <hi>Master Rainolds?</hi> whie? then haue you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled before in telling vs you were vnwilling: now by your owne confession you were willing
<pb n="3" facs="10"/>enough, but there were manie also in your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as willing as you. Whereof surelie we haue no doubt, that you are all moste wilfullie bent, and earnestlie disposed to doe what harme anie of you possiblie can to the Church of England. As for your knowledge and habilitie to performe against vs anie notable enterprise, we haue no care, we stand in no feare of you, we knowe what pith is in the strongest of you. And for your selfe, <hi>Master Rainolds,</hi> I am of opinion, that you maie truelie take the garland from your owne head, and giue it rather to manie others of your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
   <p>Another reason he faineth to be,<note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> for that he <hi>thought it some iniurie to Catholikes to dispute against that sauage and barbarous paradoxe,</hi> namelie that the Pope is Antichrist. What iniurie could this be thought done to your Catholikes, <hi>Master Rainolds,</hi> to write in defense of your Pope, and prooue him not to be that Antichrist, then which a greater pleasure can no man doe for him, and for his Church, it being apparant, and so of manie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians beleeued, that he is indeed no other, then the verie Antichrist himselfe? In which respect perhaps your conscience tolde you, that if you opposed your selfe against this trueth, therein should you offer iniurie to your Pope, and Pope-catholike brethren, whome the same so specially doth concerne.</p>
   <p>You saie I know not what Antichrist is,<note place="margin">Contrae Sander. pa. <hi>6.</hi> in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio.</note> against whome I write, and that sometime I <hi>make Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ to be the wholl Catholike and vniuersall Church, wherof the Pope is head:</hi> which to be a pregnant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth, he that looketh one the place, may see.
<pb n="4" facs="11"/>Haue I saied, the Pope is head of the Chatholike vniuersall Church? or the Catholike vniuersall Church is Antichrist? what will you be ashamed hereafter to write, that in the first entrance write thus vntruelie without shame? and yet hauing your selfe auouched so notorious an vntruth, you dare make mention of <hi>Lucians</hi> true historie, which booke, as may seeme, you haue not onelie read ouer with diligence and delight, but also translated into English, &amp; propounded vnto your selfe as worthie of your imitaion. For to giue you that praise, that of due belongeth vnto you, <hi>Lucian,</hi> if he liued, could hardlie coyne more pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vntruthes, or scoffe more kindelie at Christ and his gospell, then you haue done.</p>
   <p>A greater reason was, he saith, for that he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred to deale with heretiks,<note place="margin">pag. 5.</note> who passe al other in pride and ignorance, and of all heretikes, he maketh vs of England to be the worst. Indeede true it is that heretikes for the most part are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate &amp; past amendment, &amp; therefore a great wearines &amp; vexation of minde is it to maintaine contentions, and disputes with them, whereof in the end small profit doth redound. But this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of hereticall wilfulnes nothing toucheth vs, who by Gods grace are far from al kinde of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, and hold no other doctrine then that which the Prophets and Apostles, and Iesus Christ him selfe haue taught vs, &amp; which is plainly contained in the bookes of canonicall scripture, from which if labouring to disswade vs you cannot preuaile, no maruell is it. And in defending the same, we are content to be esteemed of you contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, proude, ignorant, and as you list. We are
<pb n="5" facs="11"/>not so much in loue of your society, nor seeke your fauour and commendation so greatlie, that we will ioine in vnitie with you against the Lord, his trueth, and Church. If you thinke we are proud, tell vs wherein our pride consisteth. If in that we will not yeald vnto you, nor giue ouer mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Gospell, pardon vs, <hi>Master Rainolds:</hi> modestie in the Lord is an excellent vertue, but the modestie that betraieth the trueth of God is accursed. Other pride (I doubt not) we are as cleare from, as your selfe or anie of your fellowes. And for ignorance, we may thinke it was some spice of pride in you to obiect it vnto vs, who for anie thing that appeereth haue no cause to brag of such knowledge, or to chalenge more to your selfe, then you may safely graunt to an other. For tell vs what learning is, wherein it consisteth, and howe it maie be gotten? Vnles you haue some speciall meanes, and as it were some secret waie to attaine vnto it, which others haue not, I see not why we should thinke that you haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a greater measure of learning and wisdome, then others who haue vsed as great indeauour as your selfe. And what the matter should be, I know not, that you are sodenlie become so learned and that we haue lost all learning. But were you as learned as euer anie was, or could be, your learning shall not be hable to hurte the cause, that we defend: your learning shall in the end deceiue you: and you that now boaste of your knowledge, shall then be ashamed of your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. To knowe Christ out of his worde, is true knowledge, sound learning, and perfect wisdome.</p>
   <p>Certaine examples you rehearse of our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="6" facs="12"/>assertions, onelie thereby to make our cause seeme odious to the simple: but the reasons of our assertions you pretermit, which is your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sleight, continuallie to tell your readers that such and such opinions we holde, and not to shew the maner, nor to remember or answere our reasons. Wherein I desire the reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how vntruelie <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> hath char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me with a wicked heresie, that in this man he maie beholde the conscience of a Papist. He setteth downe for one of my sayings, that <hi>Christ is not begotten of the substance of his father:</hi> a slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der moste manifest, in a matter of greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I haue not writen thus, no, I neuer thought thus. I abhorre with my hart all such blasphemy against the Person of our sauiour Christ. But in the meane time what hath this slaunderer deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? Let the reader equallie iudge betweene him and me, and by triall hereof esteeme more indifferentlie of the rest of his malice.</p>
   <p>Now the greatest cause of all that made him so loth,<note place="margin">pag. 7.</note> was, he saith, because he found in our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine no staie or certentie, which yet, if it were true, should haue ministred vnto him greater will and courage, forsomuch as the doctrine that standeth vpon no certaine staie is easilie disproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and ouerthrowen. But in trueth <hi>Master Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> perceiuing our doctrine to be grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles which maie not be remooued, and knowing we will not yeald to mens doctrines and inuentions whatsoeuer, differing from the holie scriptures, but rest our selues whollie vpon the written word of God, I thinke he was indeede somewhat dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
<pb n="7" facs="12"/>as great cause was he should, being sure his engines could not preuaile against the same.</p>
   <p>And what greater steadfastnes in religion can be required, then to holde Gods word, which we professe to be the ground, whereon we build our faith? If you can shewe, wherein we swarue from it, we will not refuse your instruction. But saie not nowe we are vnstaied, when as you knowe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie our selues whollie vpon the worde, vnles you will denie Gods word to be a certaine rule and staie of doctrine. We plant not our religion in mans iudgement &amp; vncertentie of Traditions, in vaine ceremonies and deuises, as you doe, but in matters of faith and religion we depend vpon God, whoe in the scriptures of the olde and new Testament hath deliuered to his Church one cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine, vniforme, and perfect doctrine, to which we adde nothing, from which we take nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, in which we settle and ground our selues. But let vs heare how <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> can prooue, that the Protestants haue no certaine faith. For this he hath propounded to himselfe to declare especiallie in this preface. And I desire the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie readers to marke his proofes, which shallbe I trust to their comfort, and confirmation in the truth.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First he obiecteth diuersitie of iudgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs,<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> concerning the Princes supremacie in matters Ecclesiasticall, wherein is no such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as he pretendeth, if he listed rightlie to vnderstand the case. The title of supreme head of the Church hath bene misliked by diuerse godlie and learned men, and of right and properlie it onelie belongeth to the sonne of God, and may
<pb n="8" facs="13"/>not be communicated vnto anie man whosoeuer. And therfore neuer did our Church giue that title in such wordes vnto the Prince, not yet did the Prince euer chalenge the same, and so herein is no dissension. For the Princes lawfull supreame authoritie in procuring for the Church a good and peaceable estate, in defending of the same, by maintaining Gods true religion &amp; worshipp against heretikes and schissmatikes, in remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of manifest abuses, and disorders, in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the ministers of the Church, according to their offices and vocations, to execute their duties faithfullie, in punishing them, if they be found negligent, &amp; al this with assistance of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and learned Ministers of the Church, by that absolute and immediat commission, which euery souereigne Christian Prince hath receiued from the Lord God, being not subiect to anie foraine power of Priest or potentat, this also all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants confesse, with full consent therein, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Popes Antichristian supremacie, who contrarie to Gods worde chalengeth a sole &amp; supreame gouernment ouer al Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; Churches in the world. Is this now a good proofe that Protestants haue no certentie in their faith?</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondlie,<note place="margin">pag. 11.</note> touching baptisme, <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> thinketh he hath found some contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the communion booke, which affirmeth that by baptisme children are regenerate, and wherein the Minister exhorteth the people not to doubt, but Christ will giue to the Infants bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, eternall life, and betweene the disputation
<pb n="9" facs="13"/>in the Tower of London the second daie,<note place="margin">

      </note> wherein the doctors teach, that al those who are baptize<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> are the sonnes of god. If your eies were matches, things that are but one, would not thus appeere double vnto you. Babtisme is the sacrament of new birth, wherein our adoption by Christ is sealed vnto vs, and we are made the sonnes of God, as manie as beleeue, both sacramentallie, and spirituallie: the vnbeleeuers onelie sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentallie. Wherefore this is not so to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as though whosoeuer is baptized, shall therefore be sure to haue eternall life. For <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was baptized, and yet condemned: and so also manie moe besides notwithstanding their baptisme, shalbe excluded from fellowship with the Saints in Gods kingdome. So that to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized proueth not necessarilie assurance and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentie of life euerlasting in all persons. Why then might not the Doctors be bolde to saie, that baptisme of it selfe hath not this force to make anie the childe of God, &amp; that in baptisme none can be made the children of God, if they be not his children by election? For doubtles he that commeth to be baprized, vnles he be one of Gods elect, can not in baptisme receaue the gift of adoption, which onely belongeth to those that are predestinate and elect: and election is not begone in baptisme, but was before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Againe, betweene the communion booke and me, <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> hath noted a manifest dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,<note place="margin">pag. 12.</note> as he thinketh. The booke hath sett downe an order of priuate baptisme, and I finde
<pb n="10" facs="14"/>fault with womens baptisme. It is sufficient for answere to you, that priuate baptisme is one thing, and womens baptisme is another. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate baptisme hath bene sometimes maintained and vsed in the Church, but womens baptisme was neuer allowed in any tolerable state thereof, neither doth the communion booke make anie mention of women, nor doth giue any authority to women, to minister baptisme. And therfore reproouing and disalowing of baptisme to be done by women, I haue not thereby spoken any word against our communion booke. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning necessitie of baptisme, wherein you would fasten vpon me some suspition of Anabaptisme, I graunt baptisme is necessary, if it may be had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christs ordinance and institution, so that the contempt thereof is damnable: but not in such sorte necessarie, as that the lacke thereof without contempt shal bring a man into the state of condemnation. If you will thrust out of Gods kingdome all that are not baptized, you shall take awaie from the Lord manie of his deare children, whome yet he will not deliuer ouer to your cruell iudgement, and power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The communion booke appointeth not a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of cōfirmation.<note place="margin">pag. 13.</note> But yet there is an order for confirmation of children, which (for anie thing I know) is in all communion bookes the same. Shewe vs what fault you finde with vs for it, and answere shall be giuen you: sure I am in respect hereof you haue no cause to complaine of our vncertentie in the faith.<note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note>
   </p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> About the article of Christs descension into
<pb n="11" facs="14"/>hell, I graunt, there hath bene some diuersitie of iudgements, yet so as the trueth of that article is confessed of all. The manner of his descension may be doubted of by many protestants, but your opinion that Christ in soule descended into hel to fetch vp the soules of the faithful deceased before his passion, is generallie improoued. <hi>Caluine</hi> saith not, that Christ was damned aliue in soule vpon the Crosse, as you foully slaunder him; but that Christ, taking vpon him selfe our sinnes and punishments, suffered in minde those paines of hell for a time, which we otherwise should haue sustained for euer. Deny this, and denie the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God to be satisfied, which taketh awaie al hope form vs of escaping the torments of hell, and being throughlie reconciled with the Lord.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Christs diuinitie acknowledged in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion booke no protestant euer denied.<note place="margin">pag. 14.</note> As for <hi>Caluins Autotheisme,</hi> as you fondly terme it, I haue answered if you can. And if you list to read more of this matter, I referre you to that which <hi>Lambertus Danaeus</hi> hath written against <hi>Genebrard</hi> and <hi>Iordane</hi> of Paris concerning the same. Our doctrine in this behalfe is no other, then hath bene the catholike doctrine of Christs Church euermore. In labouring of malice to blaze a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade some heresy of <hi>Caluine,</hi> your selues are now become defenders of heresy against the blessed Trinitie. For tell me, <hi>Master Rainolds,</hi> if the substance of the Godhead be the same in the sonne and the father, and the substance of the father be God of it selfe, must not the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the sonne be of it selfe?</p>
   <pb n="12" facs="15"/>
   <p> But you confessing in words Christ to be God, in denying him to be God of himselfe, take his diuinitie from him indeed For God is of himselfe God, by propertie of his owne nature and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: which in denying, you are proceeded as farre, and somewhat farther, then the wicked Archeretike <hi>Arius.</hi> I could turne you ouer to your owne schoolemen, and bid you to striue against them,<note place="margin">In Centil. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus. <hi>62.</hi> Quod Christus secundùm exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentiam diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam non est filius Des.</note> letting <hi>Caluine</hi> alone. Looke vpon <hi>William Ockam</hi> a famous schooleman, who was not affraid to publish this position amongst his hundred diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie conclusions, <hi>That Christ according to his diuine being is not the sonne of God:</hi> which how he expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, there maie you see: but if <hi>Caluine</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in such termes, whoe could haue staied the outragious cauilling of these men?<note place="margin">Pag. 15. &amp;c.</note>

      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Taking of armes by some, and standing in the field for maintenance of Gods holie religion, &amp; safetie of their owne liues, <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> vrgeth against vs grieuouslie, which yet toucheth not the matter in hand, concerning our vnsteadfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in doctrine, but serueth onelie to procure en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie. Sturres and tumults for matter of Religion he rehearseth, that haue bene in <hi>Germanie,</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> as though it were sufficient for their condemnation that they once resisted, and did not by and by admit whatsoeuer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was offered either to Gods trueth, or to themselues, contrarie to promise, to othe, to publike edicts, to lawe, whereby they were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to doe, as they did. More of this matter will I not answere, being of an other nature, and cleered long since from crime of rebellion, not onelie by iust defense of their doing, but also by
<pb n="13" facs="15"/>the proclamations and edicts of princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>

And of all this what can <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Rainolds</hi> conclude against the vnitie and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentie of our profession? what alteration hath bene in the Church of God in times past, we may reade not onelie in gods booke, but in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call histories. Sometime religion prospered wel, and florished, especiallie the Prince being godlie, and zealous to promote the same: sometime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine superstition, heresie, idolatrie mightelie preuailed, the Prince being an idolater or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike. Yet notwithstanding the truth of gods word &amp; Religion remained one and stedfast, howsoeuer the outward state of the Church or common wealth was diuerslie changed. And if at the first when the Lord began to worke some reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in this Church, perfection in euerie point was not foorthwith attained and established, no
<pb n="15" facs="16"/>maruel is it, considering both the greatnes of the worke, and the malice of manifolde enemies that withstoode the same. Yea if in our communion booke alteration hath bene, according as to the Church seemed moste conuenient, yet that was not in substance of Doctrine, but in matters of ceremonie, neither can you charge vs more for changing our communion booke, then we can you for changing and reforming your Missales, your Portasses, your Breuiaries, &amp; a number such other bookes, euen of late yeares, in dailie and publike vse of seruice amongst you As for Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptistes, Atheistes, Puritanes, the familie of loue, our Church and Religion vtterly condemneth to the pit of hell: and if there be such amongst vs secretlie, so haue there alwaies bene heretikes &amp; wicked persons in the Church, and in respect of them our Religion is no more to be accused, then the good corne may iustlie be condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause together with it manie tares and weeds spring vp, and cannot be auoided.</p>
   <p>Further <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> saith,<note place="margin">pag. 22.</note> if he should note the difference betweene our Protestants and those of other nations, he should neuer make an end. But let him note, what him list, and make an end when he please; greater difference shal he not finde amongst the true professors of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and Churches reformed, then may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the children of God. When such bitter dissension was betweene the East and west Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, about the daie of Passeouer, and the same continued so manie yeares with great offense &amp; alienation among the faithfull, yet they ceased not for all that to be still the Churches of Christ.
<pb n="16" facs="17"/>Neither is it euer to be hoped for, that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect concord shall be among the professors of Christs religion, that they shall all agree moste iointlie together in the trueth, or in euerie parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular point thereof. Your vnity although it be not so intire and generall, as you would haue it thought, yet if it proceeded of knowledge of the trueth, and faithfull submission with hartie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the same, it deserued great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation: but springing from such fountaines, as it doth, of brutish ignorance, and feare in the moste, of vaine ambition, worldlie pleasures, and filthie couetousnes in the chiefest, though it be through corruption of mans nature mighty, yet the causes being marked, it appeereth to be but carnall, tyrannicall, and diuelish. For this moste wicked persuasion being once imprinted in mens harts by the subteltie of Sathan, that all men must obey the Pope, whatsoeuer he teach and commaund, without examination, or resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, vpon paine of eternall damnation, an easie matter is it vpon this foundation to raise vp and maintaine any vnitie whatsoeuer. And although this worldlie prouision for keeping of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie be not amongst vs, yet through Gods grace and blessing al Churches reformed agree sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in all articles of faith, that are substantiall and necessarie to saluation, and shall so doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ende.<note place="margin">pag. 25.</note>

For as they are grounds of all true doctrine, so are they onelie grounds; and as in matter of faith ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments ought principallie to be drawne from them, so such arguments onelie conclude ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarilie, as euen your owne Thomas of Aquine doth directlie confesse.<note place="margin">Thom. <hi>1.</hi> part. <hi>1.</hi> qu. artic. <hi>8.</hi> ad. <hi>2.</hi>
      </note> Traditions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles are but deuised &amp; forged things, which you make your second heade, and therefore no staie for a man to settle his conscience vpon.

If you cannot satisfie this demaunde, as you cannot indeede, how may you then make any reckoning of that, whereof you haue no certaine knowledge? how can you without falling builde your faith vpon fantasies, such as they are? The Apostles doctrine we haue in writing: other traditions of the Apostles we receiue none for our beliefe.</p>
   <p>Concerning the catholike Church, which is your third head, we reuerence and loue it as the spouse of Christ: but we know that her due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is, to hearken onelie to the voice of Christ her husband, and that she hath no authoritie to adde so much as one iotte to his worde, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie waies to dissent from it.

<pb n="20" facs="19"/>that in the sayings of those, who are all of them subiect to errour, there is no stable and steadie ground to build our faith vpon, lest perhaps we build vpon error, in steade of trueth, vpon the sand, and not vpon the rocke.

   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> And therefore moste false is it, that you say our <hi>Diuinitie resteth vpon these fathers,</hi>

We vse not to alledge for proofe of any doctrine, Thus saith <hi>Caluine, Bucer,</hi> or other: but thus saith the Lord, thus saith the Prophet, thus saith the Apostle, thus the Euangelist, thus is it written in the scriptures, thus we reade in some booke of the olde or new Testament.

Of all that you saie, make your conclusion, and then shall appeere, how emptie and barren a declamor you are.</p>

      <hi>a man woulde thinke their martyrs testimonie should be irrefragable.</hi> And thinke you then the argument to be so sure and necessarie, that is drawen from authoritie of a martyr? will you graunt this reason to be inuincible, <hi>A marttr hath saide it, therefore it is true?</hi> what say you then of <hi>Cyprian</hi> the martyr, of <hi>Iustinus</hi> the martyr, of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> the martyr, who notwitstanding their blessed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, are knowne to haue maintained opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions against the trueth?

      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Lastlie concerning wholl Churches reformed,<note place="margin">pag. 32.</note> what can you, <hi>Master Rainolds,</hi> conclude against vs? In matter of discipline greate difference heretofore hath bene amongst the Churches East and West, Greeke and Latine. If then some such be in our reformed Churches, can you thereof truelie gather, that therefore they are not the Churches of Christ? Tell vs what you

   <p>Next <hi>Master R.</hi> reckeneth vp sundrie Popes, that are amongst the Protestants in stead of one true Pope:<note place="margin">pag. 33.</note> which I know not whereto it serueth, but onelie to shewe that the protestants haue so great detestation of the Pope and his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that they cannot endure in anie profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour of the Gospell, anie small shadowe of such Lordelines, as the Pope vsurpeth ouer the Church. Your true Pope, whereof you speake, is as much as a true Antichrist, of whome the scriptures haue foretolde. The name, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the authoritie all Protestants abhorre, and accurse to the prince of darknes, from whence it came.</p>
   <p>Againe he is in hand with generall Councels, and saith it is impossible,<note place="margin">pag. 34.</note> that euer we should once imagine how anie Councell amongest vs should be gathered. His methode is according to his matter, confused, and disordered, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and iumping from one pointe to another, like a wilde bucke vpon the mountaines. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we haue not a Pope, as you haue, yet by Gods grace generall Councels maie wee haue, if Christian princes that professe the gospell will iointlie take vpon them the care thereof. And generall Councels haue bene assembled and helde many hundred yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Pope by such a name was euer knowne or heard of in the world, and so may they againe both Christianlie and generallie be held, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your Pope with all his proude cleargie were returned from whence they came. That
<pb n="23" facs="20"/>hitherto no such Christian Councels haue bene gathered, it maie be imputed to the generall troubles in all Christian countries, and to the aduersaries, that haue bene raised vp by your Pope and his Cardinall satrapes, to hinder, as much as in them laie, all meanes, whereby a Christian generall Councell might be gathered. Howbeit if a generall Councell cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, to be celebrated with quietnes, there is no doubt notwithstanding, but that the Lordes cause maie without it daylie more and more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, as it hath done heretofore in times moste persecutions.</p>
   <p>To the section that followeth, containing onelie a recapitulation of these former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,<note place="margin">pag. 34. &amp;c.</note> I haue no nede to make any further answere.</p>
   <p>Your complainte against vs, for refusing all grounds of disputation,<note place="margin">pag. 38.</note> how vaine and vntrue it is, hath bene shewed. The onelie true and certaine grounde of religion and of all disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the same, which is the authoritie of God reuealed vnto vs in his holie worde, we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, we holde, we rest vpon it: which forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as you haue fullie tried to be against you, so that you cannot thereby approoue one article of your popish faith, nor disprooue anie doctrine that we maintaine against you, therfore despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion driueth you indeede to refuse this grounde as insufficient, and to seeke other grounds, of which we haue noe warrant in Gods worde. And although it please you for this cause to raile at vs, and saie we are worse then the heretikes of olde time, yet we know that rhe auncient godlie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="24" facs="21"/>in confuting all heretikes vsed onelie argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawen out of the scriptures, and plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie taught that by no other weapons an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike can be put to flight. I knowe they charge them oftentimes with the iudgement of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, successions of Bishops, determination of Councels, name of Catholikes, not as though this were a necessarie conuiction of it selfe, but thereby the rather to induce them, to beleeue the doctrine to be true, which they see from the first planting thereof in the Church to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. Your case is nothing like, seeing you haue onely the bare title without the thing, and as it were the emptie casket without the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
   <p>But for so much as you accuse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s for casting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie the grounds of Diuinitie, I desire euerie Christian man to weigh with himselfe, what ground it is, wheron al your religion and Church standeth. First the scripture must not be scripture in any other sense, then as the Pope will expound it: so that the scripture being the meaning of the scripture, and the meaning of the scripture being the Popes exposition, hereof it followeth that the scripture is nothing els but the Popes interpretation. So likewise in Traditions, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Councels, Churches, if any thing dissent from the Popes vnderstanding and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is reiected, abolished, condemned, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally all faith, all religion, all Diuinitie of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists is onelie the Popes sacred will and pleasure. Now then this being their owne certaine resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would gladlie be enformed, how by the same a man may be assured of any faith, it being
<pb n="25" facs="21"/>further also agreed and confessed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that the Pope maie fall into heresie. Then who seeth not that their ground being shaken, &amp; their staie failing, all that is builded and vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thereon is clean ouerthrowne? If they saie, the Pope falling into heresy, forthwith ceaseth to be a Pope, I demaund whoe they are that must iudge the Popes cause, and giue sentence against him? And if the Pope be obstinate, and teaching heresie, and therewith infecting the world, will notwithstanding stoutly stand in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense of his doctrine, and will keepe his chaire, what shift haue you then, or what can you doe against him, seing he is your Pope, your head, your author and founder of all your faith? Thus a man going with you along, and comming to the end of all, findeth no staie, but must wander still, as in an endles Labyrinth, wherein he shall at last languish and perish euerlastingly.</p>
   <p>That you wish we would be content to yealde to the verie scriptures themselues,<note place="margin">pag. 40.</note> doubt you not, <hi>Master Rainolds,</hi> thereof, but we are most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to yealde vnto them: if ye would be as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the controuersy might haue thereby, and by other good meanes, an end. But your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence telleth you, scripture will not serue you, and therfore in a word you deny the wholl bodie of the scriptures. Thinke not (good reader) that herein I haue spoken rashly without reason, I know what I speake, and thy selfe considering the matter aduisedlie wilt saie as much. For in making an olde rotten translation, (as I may boldlie call it, being compared with the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall word of scripture, although otherwise I
<pb n="26" facs="22"/>giue to it that reuerence, that the antiquity ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of deserueth) full of wants, faultes, errors, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sightes, imperfections, and corruptions of all sortes, as in this booke hereafter (god willing) thou shalt perceaue, to be the authenticall word of God, and denying the originall faithfull text, which <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets, the Apostles, the Euangelists did write, to be the worde of God, what do they els but plainlie as it were with one dash of a penne cancel the wholl sciptures? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in maiest thou see what conscience these men make of scripture, that do cast awaie the verie authenticall text and bookes of holie scripture, preferring before them a homelie latine tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, which, besides it is such as I haue said, no man can tell from whence, or from whome it came. And this forsooth is their scripture, coined and canonized of late in the councell of Trente, and neuer before: and other scripture haue they none.</p>
   <p>Hitherto <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> treatise hath bene generall of the English Protestants,<note place="margin">pag. 41. &amp;c.</note> now he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth leaue of the reader to descend and applie the same to his aduersarie, whose booke he is to examine: and first he noteth the fashion of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes alwaies to haue bene to inuade the chiefe pastours of the Church. What heretikes haue vsed commonlie to doe appertaineth nothing vnto vs: we could no otherwise doe, but when we espied the wolfe deuouring the flocke, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ sitting in the temple of God, giue warning thereof to all, crie out against him, and call him by his proper name, the verie Antichrist of whom <hi>Saint Paul</hi> to the Thessalonians, and the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="27" facs="22"/>in other places doe mean. This hath bene the iudgement of al reformed Churches from the beginning, and wilbe to the ending of the world. And although <hi>Sanders</hi> hath taken great paines in this behalfe to prooue their Pope to be no Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ (for then all were vtterlie lost) yet how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle he hath by his demonstrations preuailed, the godlie reader maie easilie iudge by the answere set forth, which <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not orderlie and thorowlie disprooue, carpeth at some partes thereof in the residue of this his preface.

<pb n="28" facs="23"/>supposing this were true, that <hi>Saunders</hi> meaneth, notwithstanding his demonstration holdeth not, being taken from the authoritie of men, from whome no demonstration in diuinitie can be drawen. This is the summe of this answere which <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> accuseth of Antichristian arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, seing the fathers write according to the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall faith and tradition, as he saith. But how may it appeere, <hi>Master Rainolds,</hi> that the Apostles taught or deliuered such a faith vnto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches concerning Antichrist? if this faith be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their writings, tell vs in what booke, in what place, in what wordes. If in secret tradition, we admit no profe (as you know) from such vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and blinde traditions. And if you your selues oftentimes doe dissent from the fathers, giue vs also the same libertie of dissenting from them vpon as good ground and iust causes as you haue anie. The fathers speake diuerse times not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tradition &amp; faith Apostolicall, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common receiued opinion, them selues in plain termes confessing that they speake but coniecturally: &amp; if there was not in that age so full and cleare knowledge of Antichrist, as at this daie, no maruell maie it seeme to wise men, for so much as nowe Antichrist is not onelie borne and bredde, but growne to a strong man, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie discerned and acknowledged, by all marks essentiall to be Antichrist. They forsawe him, we see him: they knew he should come, we know he is come: they feared him, we haue felt him: they geassed at him, we can point him out with our finger: finallie they might be deceiued, but wee cannot, vnles we will stop our eares, and close our
<pb n="29" facs="23"/>eies, and suffer our selues willinglie to be abused.<note place="margin">pag. 46. &amp;c.</note>
   </p>
   <p>In the second demonstration <hi>Doctor Saunders</hi> commendeth the Church of Rome by testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of writers, auncient and later; thereby to make vs beleeue, that seing it hath bene so highlie praised, it cannot therefore possiblie be the seate of Antichrist. Here I gaue <hi>Doctor Saunders</hi> a distinction betwene the elder Romane Church and the yonger. The auncient Church of Rome indeede was worthelie extolled and magnified of the fathers for constant keeping of the faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though euen then in that Church the egge was laide, whereof shortlie after Antichrist was hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: the distinction <hi>M. R.</hi> raileth at with all his mighte, but cannot disprooue with all his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it being euident in al histories, that after the daies of those godly fathers the Bishop of Rome was made head of the vniuersal Church, wherein he was publikely proclaimed to be the Antichrist, that should come: &amp; afterward continually both religion, learning, and good life died by litle and litle in that Church, as hath bene testified and complained of by infinite writers. So the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene that Church in former &amp; latter time is no lesse euident, then betweene a mans youth and doting age, if you consider all partes and properties of a true Church. And yet, saith <hi>Master Rainolds,</hi> if it be lawfull thus to answere. then shall no heresie euer be repressed, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fowlie, that heresie must be refuted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by scripture, which neuer changeth, but abideth for euer, though Churches varie both from others, and from themselues.</p>
   <p>In the third demonstration,<note place="margin">Pag. 50. &amp;c.</note> wherein <hi>Saunders</hi>
      <pb n="30" facs="24"/>affirmeth the succession of priests in the Romane Church, to be the rocke against which the gates of hell shall not preuaile, I denie the outwarde chaire or succession of bishops to be the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable &amp; inuincible Rocke, wheron the Church is builded; which is the sonne of God himselfe, the onelie foundation of the Church. For out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde succession is no more certaine in that Church, then in others; and it hath bene diuerse times broken of and discontinued by vacations and schismes for manie yeares together. If then the Church had bene builded vpon this totte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rocke of externall succession, at Rome, it had oftentimes bene dashed and ouerthrowen: but thankes be to God, the Church is builded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a surer rocke, then is the personall succession of your Popes, or els of anie estate of men in the worlde: and therefore, whatsoeuer becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of your Pope or of his chaire and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Church falleth not, but abideth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for euer. Your stories written in time of Antichristes tyrannie, what cause is there whie we should anie whit regarde them, the authors thereof being infected with the errors of the Pope, and daring not write for the moste parte otherwise then might well stand with his humor? And to all histories, that since the defection haue commended the faith of that Church, we oppose the worde of God, which plainelie conuinceth it of manifold and damnable heresies, besides we could alledge sundrie writers in all ages, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penlie haue reprooued the same.</p>
   <p>The former distinction concerning the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church,<note place="margin">pag. 25.</note> here <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> taketh in
<pb n="31" facs="24"/>hand to disprooue, and to shewe, that my para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox (as he calleth it) is impossible. First he saith I graunted the Church of Rome to haue bene pure, godlie, Christian, for sixe hundred yeares after Christ, which forsooth I neuer graunted (as he meaneth) that simply and absolutelie no manner of corruption in anie parte of doctrine had taken place therin: but onelie according to the state of those times, and comparison of that general apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie which afterward ensued. So your conceit <hi>M. R.</hi> that this alteration should whollie be wrought within the space often or twelue years, is so vaine &amp; childish, that nothing can be deuised more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and farther of from the purpose. No, <hi>M. Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi> notwithstanding Antichrist was not openlie aduanced in the Romane Church before <hi>Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> the third, yet was there in it no small prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for entertayning of him before that time through corruption of doctrine and manners in that Church: &amp; though it was in manie things corrupted before, yet had it also great sinceritie, which by little and little decaied more and more till Antichrist came, and was reuealed: and after Antichrist was seated there, yet was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all puritie lost by and by, but in continuance of time it fainted and languished, hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued deadlie poison, and no remedie being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided. Wherefore this roye of yours, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a vanitie of vanities fitte for such a vaine sophister as you are.</p>
   <p>But now because <hi>Doctor Saunders</hi> and <hi>M. Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> boldelie affirme that by testimonies of sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries no heresie was brought into the Romane Church, or anie chaunge of doctrine euer made
<pb n="32" facs="25"/>in the same, let me put them in minde briefelie,<note place="margin">Sigisb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>rt. Gemblacensis. in Chronico, Ann. <hi>1088.</hi>
      </note> that <hi>Sigisberius</hi> the moncke an Historiographer, mentioned by them both, expresselie chargeh <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seauenth and his successours, for maintaining and practizing not onely an error, but an heresie also, in taking vpon them authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to excommunicate the Emperour, and other ciuill Princes.</p>
   <p>This heresie hath euer since continued in that See, and is at this daie, by the Pope and his Popelings auouched: and therefore by confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their owne Historiographers,<note place="margin">Pag. 55.</note> some here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie hath taken place in the Church of Rome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to <hi>Doctor Saunders,</hi> and <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> proude assertion.</p>
   <p>That the Romane Church of later time, hath not chaunged the faith which the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romane Church professed, <hi>Master Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> promiseth now to prooue, by such testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as I must needes alowe for vpright, and sufficient. My selfe is the first: then Caluine, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Martyr, Illyricus: none of which euer dreamed of such a matter, as he taketh in hand to prooue by their confession. That I haue said the first Romane Church helde the purity of faith, nothing concerneth the later Church; &amp; in what sense I haue so saide, is before declared: not thereby to iustifie that Church in euerie particular doctrine, custome, or ceremonie, but onelie that the principall and substantiall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Christian religion were in it maintained against the heretikes of those times. Then that <hi>Caluine, Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
            <desc>•••</desc>
         </gap>.</hi> &amp;c. do graunt, that the primitiue Romane Church maintained and beleeued the
<pb n="33" facs="25"/>Popes supremacie, the sacrifice of the Masse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all presence and Priesthoode, is moste vntrue, as further in discourse of this booke shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere. And therefore the conclusion that of these premises should ensue, is like the vntimelie fruite, that ere it be ripe falleth downe to the ground.</p>
   <p>And as for the common place that followeth concerning the continuance of Christs vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Church,<note place="margin">pag. 57.</note> to what purpose doth it serue or what argument maie it afforde you? we beleeue and confesse to the comforte of our soules, that Christs Church hath continued, and neuer shall faile so long as the worlde endureth, and we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a profane heresie, to teach that Christs Catholike vniuersal Church hath perished from the earth at anie time. For this assertion (as you truelie prooue) shaketh the foundations of all faith and religion. But as you haue effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and inuinciblie by manifolde scriptures euin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that Christs Church can neuer be rooted out, and no man in the world can open his mouth against you herein, so if you had also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by like euidence of scripture that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vniuersall Church of Christ is nothing els but the outwarde succession of the Romane see, then had you prooued your matters soundlie, and confuted our opinion truelie, and proceeded orderlie. But hauing spoken much concerning the perpetuitie of Christs Church, which no Christian can denie or doubt of, you bring vs no text not reason to shew that Christs Church either is the Popes succession, or els dependeth vpon the same. For as touching externall shew
<pb n="34" facs="26"/>and succession of Churches the scriptures haue foretolde, that Antichrist shall seduce great and small,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.61. &amp; 13.16.</note> rich and poore, free and bonde, and that the Church shall flie into the wildernes, and there remaine, of al which no word could be true, if the Catholike Church were tied to the Popes Chaire, and the Popes Chaire were the rocke that can not be remooued. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this generall dispersion and flight of the Church vnder Antichrist, the Catholike Church shall for all that continue, although not in that outwarde strength and glorie, in which sometimes it hath appeered and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.</p>
   <p>Now this long discourse following, is visible,<note place="margin">Pag. 59. &amp;c.</note> and the Testimonies of <hi>Melancthon, Oecolampadius, Caluine,</hi> and <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> at large rehearsed to that purpose; all this argueth nothing els, but pitifull and grosse ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in this man, who not knowing what he auoucheth, or what he refelleth, yet laieth on such loade, as though with euerie blow he felled his aduersarie to the ground. The militant Church of Christ to be a visihle companie, who hath from the beginning of the world denied? or who could euer otherwise imagine, but that men, whosoeuer they be, are visible and maie be discerned? This therfore required not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie proofes as you haue brought, being liberall where no neede is: neither in this respect do we meane that there is an inuisible Church, by which we vnderstand the elect, the faithfull, the members of Christes mysticall bodie: who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they maie be seene outwardlie, in that
<pb n="35" facs="26"/>they are men, yet their election, their faith, their spirituall adoption and coniunction with Christ, in which respect they are truelie his Church, can not by outward sense be perceiued. The number of professors is visible, but the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the elect is not visible, that is, can not by sight and sense be tried, discerned, and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from all others. This is the meaning of that distinction, which you ought to haue knowen before you laboured to disprooue it. But if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon you to refute a thing, whereof you are ignorant, you faile shamefullie, and make your selfe verie ridiculous to your reader, it is no maruell, and you can blame no other then your owne selfe.</p>
   <p>For what conceite was this that you haue nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in your braine,<note place="margin">Pag. 64.</note> and vttered in this booke, that we should make the Church of Christ to be inuisible in such sorte, as you maintaine the bodie of Christ to be inuisiblie in the Sacrament, and hereupon note a wonderfull contradiction in our doctrine. I maie truelie saie your case is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, and so is theirs that depend vpon you, to be thus absurdlie and wilfullie blinded in matters of faith, and as it were to grope for light at noone daie, which sheweth in you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede a notable reprobation of vnderstanding, as a iust punishment of your Apostasie. The Church is not inuisible, because the men of whom the Church consisteth are inuisible (for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and elect in that they are men, are no lesse visible then the rest) but because the elect of God can not be perceaued and acknowledged, by outwarde sight of our eies. Of Christes bodie
<pb n="36" facs="27"/>you teach most falslie, that his verie true natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall humane bodie is in the Sacrament, yet that no sense can perceaue it to be there: which is to denie and ouerthrow the trueth of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie. Therfore you see (if anie facultie of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remaine in you) that betweene this doctrine <hi>The Church of Christ is inuisible,</hi> that is, <hi>not able by our eies to be discerned,</hi> and this, <hi>The bodie of Christ if it were present in the Sacrament bodelie</hi> (as you teach) <hi>should be visible,</hi> that is, seene with our eies, is not so much as a shadow or fancie of anie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
   <p>After all this <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> maketh a long discourse of <hi>Dauid George</hi> and <hi>Sebastian Castalion,</hi>
      <note place="margin">pag. 66.</note> of whome or for whome I haue for my parte noe neede to answere. <hi>Dauid George</hi> was a damnable heretike, and his heresies were by Protestantes not Papistes descried and refuted. <hi>Castalion</hi> you slaunder moste shameleslie in saying he denied Christ to be the Messias, as hereafter also in your booke you haue done. His preface which he writ to King Edwarde before his translation of the Bible, conteineth no such argument, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth whollie to another end, if you had either witt to see it, or good will to acknowledge it. Therein he disputeth that some part of those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses that are contained in the Prophets, and namelie concerning the great knowledge that should be vnder Christ, is not yet accomplished: his opinion of which matters I leaue to himselfe: but you haue not done well to charge him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truelie with so foule a blasphemie.<note place="margin">pag. 70.</note>
   </p>
   <p>As for the great straightes into which <hi>Caluine</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> disputing with the Iewes haue beene
<pb n="37" facs="27"/>driuen by reason of this supposition, concerning the Churches fall, I know not anie, seing they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer imagined anie such fall, as you doe. No the heauens shall sooner fall, then the Church: and therefore you mistake the matter whollie, and like an ignorant sophister make impertinent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses. The promises of almightie God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the largenes and beautie of his Church vnder Christ haue beene accomplished. The Gospell hath beene preached throughout the world, the Church hath spread it selfe ouer all nations, and neuer since hath it beene shut vp within the limites of one countrie and people, as the Synagogue was. But as the Prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde that the Church should be thus mightelie increased and multiplied, so the Apostles haue prophecied that in the Church should be a defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that Antichrist should sit in the Temple of God, and that the Princes and people of the earth should be drunken with the cuppe of his spirituall fornication and abhominations. As we confesse those Prophecies to be fulfilled, soe must we likewise acknowledge the truth of these, and thereby we are hable to stop the mouthes not onelie of Iewes and Turkes, but of all papists also, in this controuersie of the churches outward increase and decaie. Your monstrous railing in the next section I pretermit, beseeching God to open the eies of all Christians, and to giue them vnderstanding hartes, that they maie discerne Antichrist from Christ, falshood from trueth, and heresie from pure religion.</p>
   <p>But where you saie that there be many worse Antichristes then the Pope,<note place="margin">pag. 73.</note> and compare cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="38" facs="28"/>of your late Popes with some of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Superintendents, as you call them, in respect of their behauiour and conuersation of life, you still misconstrue the matter, and speake beside the purpose.</p>
   <p>Your Popes might haue vsed greater shew of ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nestie and godlines, then they haue done, &amp; yet be neuer the further of from their kingdome of Antichrist, which although it be much furthered and maintained by their pride, cruelty, couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and such other moste monstrous and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious demeanour, as they haue vsed these manie hundred yeares; yet it consisteth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie in that doctrine of Antichristianitie, which they holde, and by all possible meanes defend, most contrarie to the holie and Catholike religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ.</p>
   <p>And yet if your comparison were admitted, and the liues of those Antichrists throughlie exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it would appeere, that there haue not liued euer in anie state from the beginning of the worlde more wicked, vile, and abominable men, then haue bene the Popes of Rome for diuers hundred yeares together by testimonie of their owne histories. They haue in tyrannie exceeded <hi>Nero,</hi> in pride <hi>Nebuchadnezer,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, in other common vices, them that for the same haue bene moste infamouslie renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the world: wherein if anie professour of the gospell should resemble them, or come neare vnto them, it were a iust shame vnto their person, but yet no disproofe of their religion.</p>
   <p>Now <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> proceedeth to another pointe,<note place="margin">pag. 75.</note> namelie the want of religion and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="39" facs="28"/>which he saith I haue shewed in this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. A greauous accusation, in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to want religion, &amp; where greatest consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is required, to haue no conscience at all. But if you examine his proofe, then shall you easilie perceiue the cauilling spirit of this accuser, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you haue alreadie had, and shal hereafter haue most euident demonstration. The fault no dout is verie hainous, wherupon he frameth so sore an inditement, or els he a malitious enemie, that for no cause accuseth so bitterlie. If I haue not set downe euerie word of <hi>Doctor Saunders</hi> booke, doth it therfore follow that I did it of an irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or vnconscionable intent? What man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ing conscience or religion, would thus sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, seing for his life he can not shew, that I haue concealed or omitted the least moment of anie one argument, that I haue taken to answere in his booke? If then I haue cut of in one or two Chapters some parte of his words being long and tedious, for no other cause in the world, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to auoide prolixitie, what blame I haue therein deserued, I put it to the verdite of all indifferent, religious, and conscionable men to pronounce. These men in pretending to answere our bookes, maie deale as they lift, maie omit anie thing at their pleasure, maie sert downe no more then shall like them best: maie reporte things that were not written, and all this shall escape in them without reproofe: If we leaue out a few wordes, being nothing els but wordes, for cumbring out bookes and readers with multitude of vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie talke, this must be made a great crime, here is want of Religion and conscience, and
<pb n="40" facs="29"/>this must suffice to discredite all the rest with those, that will beleeue such subtill and slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous persuasions.</p>
   <p>The same practise he obiecteth also to <hi>Master Doctor Iewell,</hi>
      <note place="margin">pag. 75.</note> the late worthie Bishop of Sarisburie of blessed memorie, whoe yet I am persuaded hath dealt as faithfullie and sincerelie with <hi>Doctor Harding,</hi> as anie aduersarie hath euer done with another. In his <hi>Replie</hi> he hath printed <hi>D. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> wholl booke, omitting nothing from the beginning to the end, and made to all that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for maintenance of his seuerall causes, a moste learned and perfect answere, the which as yet was neuer refelled, nor neuer can be, I am sure. Now consider the dealing of <hi>Doctor Harding</hi> in his <hi>Reioynder,</hi> which besides it is made but to one onelie article of seauen and twentie, it hath in a hundred places omitted much, so as in truth not halfe the Replie is intirely repeated and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. In the defense of the Apologie he hath indeede abridged <hi>Doctor Hardings</hi> Confutation, being of such length and bignes as was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient wholly to be printed with the defense. But let them, if they can shew some argument dissembled or passed ouer in silence, in all that which in the impression is omitted. Which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as they cannot, it is no matter, though manie legions of such idle words, as he hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that booke withal, were suppressed and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And I praie you, how hath <hi>D. Harding</hi> beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him-selfe in his <hi>detection?</hi> Hath he done, as you accufe <hi>M. Iewel</hi> for not doeing? Nothing les. Then why should <hi>M. Iewell</hi> be accounted more worthie of blame, then <hi>D. Harding,</hi> hauing made
<pb n="41" facs="29"/>no other fault, then that wherin <hi>D. Harding</hi> hath much more offended then he?</p>
   <p>That I haue in those places omitted some wordes, I graunt, <hi>Master Rainolds:</hi>
      <note place="margin">pag. 77. &amp;c.</note> and the cause thereof I haue trulie declared. But tell me where is any part or proofe of <hi>Saunders</hi> demonstrations vnanswered. If you will examine what I haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to euerie one in order, you shall finde I haue not dealt any waies vntrulie or craftilie, as you would haue men think I did, but soundlie and sufficientlie disprooued, whatsoeuer he hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in any Chapter of those fourty demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, short or long. If you be angrie with me for not reciting all his wordes, and answering them particularlie, this vnderstand that I for my parte would rather grinde in a mill, all the daies of my life, then be bound to answere such infinite lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacitie, and garrulitie, as <hi>Doctor Saunders,</hi> and your selfe, and other your companions vse in your writings. You poure forth such floodes, or rather seas of words, that it is a moste intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wearines to wade therein, although daunger of drowning, or taking great harme there can be none. But as to answere your wordes is a thing most tedious, besides it is vnnecessarie, so your reasons againe are answeared with as great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, comforte, and facilitie. And if you thinke I haue not thoroughlie answeared euerie demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of <hi>Doctor Saunders,</hi> it is free for you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume or prosecute the controuersie, which no doubt at this time you would haue done, being thereto so specially by your superiors appointed, but that you mistrusted somewhat in your cause, and in your selfe. And although you promise some
<pb n="42" facs="30"/>thing shall follow hereafter, yet considering both the practize of Papists, and a prouisoe which here you make, I thinke we are to looke for litle more at your handes in defense of <hi>Saunders</hi> demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Their practise is, lest they might be thought vnhable to answere our bookes, to set forth some answere to a part, and then so dainlie to breake of with pretense of necessarie reason, and promise of proceading further at a more conuenient sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and yet neuer to performe anie such matter. So the defender of the Censure in the middes of his answere picketh a quarrell to make an end for that present, as though he meant at better leasure to finish the whol. But it rester has he left it then, and so is like to doe still. So <hi>Master Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> purposing perhaps some such matter, hath yet prouided aforehand, that if he faile in further answere, it shall not be taken in euill parte, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath restrained his promise with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, if he be not letted <hi>by those that haue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of his life and studies.</hi> It may be, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discreet men will suffer <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further, lest as of that, which he hath written alreadie, no great profit hath redounded to their cause, so in that which is to follow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Antichrist, he rather hurt them much, then helpe them anie thing at all.</p>

      <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> concludeth his preface with a certaine Aduertisement to the Reader,<note place="margin">pag. 84.</note> wherein first he noteth what kind of printes and editions he vseth of such bookes, as commonlie he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, not of the auncient fathers (for of them he alledgeth verie fewe) but of the late writers, with whose testimonies and sentences he hath fraugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="43" facs="30"/>his booke from one end to another. If anie man haue pleasure or purpose to peruse his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, therein he may be something holpen by this direction, which <hi>M. R.</hi> hath so carefully, though not much needfullie, gathered and prefixed before his booke. Albeit I thinke that not many Readers, of what iudgement soeuer they are in religion, considering how litle waight of matter is in those allegations, wil greatlie cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber themselues with seeking the impressions, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the volumes, and perusing the quotations, the labour being far greater, then the profit.</p>
   <p>Secondlie, he talketh much and dispureth to and fro by what name he maie call vs, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">pa. 86.</note> or Catholikes, or heretikes, or protestants, or Zuinglians, or Sacramentaries, whereof no dout there was great cause in this manner to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise the reader. You call vs indeede at your pleasure by such names as your maliciouse and railing spirites can inuent, sometime by one, and sometime by another. Christians and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes you will not haue vs named, reseruing that denomination to your selues, to whome notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of al professors of Christian religion the same doth least appertaine. For our partes, soe long as we are sure that the doctrine, which we follow, is the eternall word of God, and gospell of his sonne Christ, as we are by Gods grace most sure, seeing it is plainlie set downe in the holie scriptures of the olde and new Testament, we care not what you thinke of vs, or what you speake of vs, or by what names you reproche vs. If you blaspheme the doctrine of Christ, and call it heresie, not fearing or sparing the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="44" facs="31"/>it is no wonder if you reuile vs with all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious names that can possiblie be deuised. We tell you notwithstanding that if a Christian be he that beleeueth in Christ, according to his word; if Catholikes be they that professe the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall faith of Christ; we are truelie Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Catholikes, beleeuing soe, and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing so. <hi>Lutheranes</hi> we are not, <hi>Zuinglianes</hi> we are not, <hi>Caluinists</hi> we are not, because we mantaine not anie priuate or proper doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> or <hi>Caluine,</hi> no more then the faithfull ought in the primitiue Church to haue bene cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Paulines,</hi> or <hi>Petrines,</hi> or <hi>Athanasians,</hi> or by the name of anie other such minister of Christ. Be ye called diuersly, <hi>Franciscanes, Benedictines, Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes, Iesuites,</hi> and whatsoeuer other title ye can take vp: we are not greeued at the multitude and varietie of your names, who being in truth almost anie thing rather then Christians, delight in any name rather, then in the name of Christians. But to vs this one name is sufficient, and such as are equiualent therewith: we are content with it: we desire no other. As for the name of <hi>Protestants</hi> if you thinke it belongeth not to vs, giue it them whose it is: being not a name of Schisme or sect, it may as well be vsed, as the name of Catholikes: and for distinction sake onelie, being begon first at the diet of Argsburgh, we are enforced to vse it.</p>
   <p>Lastlie <hi>Master Rainolds</hi> protesteth his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to submit himselfe to the trueth,<note place="margin">pag. 92.</note>
      <hi>to defend a fault,</hi> or <hi>to correct it.</hi> This indeed is too great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie and readines, whereby it appeereth you are not resolued in your selfe, but can
<pb n="45" facs="31"/>be content to applie your iudgement and trauail in defense or reproofe of anie opinion, good or bad, true or false. Correct your faults <hi>Master Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi> but leaue of to maintaine them. I haue in this booke made them plaine enough both to your selfe and to others: you cannot but see them, God giue you grace to acknowledge them, to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, and, as you haue promised, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte them. You knowe that in this booke you haue wrangled without measure, you haue railed without shame, you haue committed as foule and notorious faults in reasoning, as anie man could doe: your Logike is naught, your diuinitie is worse, and your conscience, as it maie seeme, is worst of all. If there yet remaine in you anie drop of that simplicitie, which you professe, then giue ouer defense of such vntrueth, reforme your iudgement, and returne by repentance from whence you are fallen, If you continew in willful Apostasie, your blood be vpon your owne head, you haue bene warned, and would not harken. I referre you to the Lordes iudgement, who shall get glorie either by your conuersion and saluation, or els by your finall harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and condemnation: <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himself, yea the wicked for the daie of euill.</hi>
