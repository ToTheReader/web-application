   <head>A loving advertisement to young Students in Divinity, who desire to come to the knowledge of the holy Scriptures.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Oving Brethren;</hi> There be three Schooles in which young Divines must bee exercised; the schoole of Arts and Sciences, the Schoole of grace, and the Schoole of your vocation. It is a great helpe and an introduction to Divinitie, to bee trained up in the first Schoole of Arts and Sciences: <hi>Moses</hi> was learned in all the wisedome of the <hi>Aegyptians, Daniel</hi> in the learning of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Dionysius Areopagita</hi> was trained up in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie.<note place="margin">Act. 7.22.</note> A certaine Scholler amongst the Jewes asked one of the <hi>R.</hi> His Master,<note place="margin">Dan. 1.4.</note> whether he might read any of the humane Writers or not?<note place="margin">Act. 17.34.</note> he gave him this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere; you may reade them, providing you reade them neither day nor night: this was a foolish answere, for the Jewes hated all humane learning; therefore
<pb facs="559"/> they say, <hi>maledictus qui aluerit Suem, aut didicerit Sapientiam Graecorum,</hi> they call all humane learning the wisdome of the Greekes. But to shut up this Schoole, and to take away all humane learning from a Divine, were in effect to make him no Divine. The knowledge of all Arts and Sciences is necessarie for him, as of Geometrie, Arithmeticke, Geographie, the knowledge of Physicke, but above all the knowledge of the tongues is more necessary for him, because they are <hi>Vehicula scientiarum.</hi> But here ye must not onely studie that part of the tongues which is called <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, which is mere Grammer, as to stand upon Letters, Accents, Pronounciation and such, but ye must goe farther to that part which is called <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, the true meaning of the words, to interpret them out of one language into another, and to understand one Phrase by another: neither should ye stand here, but ye must goe further to that part which is called <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, to censure and discerne the true reading from the false as the <hi>Masoreth</hi> did who excelled in this. Jn the warres there are three sorts of signes to direct the Souldiers, <hi>muta, semivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calia &amp; vocalia: Muta,</hi> as the ensignes, <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocalia,</hi> as the trumpets: <hi>Vocalia</hi> as the words of the Captaine: So some signes are <hi>Muta,</hi> as Arts and Sciences; <hi>Semivocalia,</hi> as the knowledge of the tongues; and <hi>Vocalia,</hi> as the meaning of the holy
<pb facs="559"/> Ghost speaking in the Scriptures. The knowledge of these is most necessarie for you who intend to apply your minds to the studie of Divinitie: for by them ye shall understand the Properties and Phrases of the holy Ghost, the ancient customes of the people of God, and the sweet allusions in the third, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ye shall never bee able to understand. And if ye begin to learne these tongues when ye are young, to what great perfection may ye attaine unto before ye come to be teachers of others? <hi>Cicero</hi> maketh mention of <hi>Marcus Crassus,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cicero De orators:</note> who walking one day upon the sea shore, saw a boy who had found a boate there, but he having no helpes to further him to saile; first he got Oares, then a Mast, raes, sailes, and ropes, and then he set to the Sea: so from little beginnings, if ye be willing, ye may attaine to a great measure of knowledge, having such helpes in this age, which your Fathers never knew,<note place="margin">Iud. 8:21</note> and the gleanings of <hi>Ephraim</hi> now, are better than the vintage of <hi>Abiezer</hi> was then; ye have now many learned and skilfull guides. The Jewes say, <hi>Qui discit a junioribus cui similis est? Edenti uvas acerbas, &amp; bibenti è torcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari: at qui discit à Senioribus cui similis? Edenti uvas maturas &amp; bibenti vinum vetus.</hi> Ye need not set your teeth on edge with sowre Grapes, for now ye have store of ripe Grapes gathered by your old Masters. The sluggard that keepeth his hand in
<pb facs="560"/> his bosome, and saith, there is a Lyon in the way; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that the Jewes are but fabulous,<note place="margin">Prov. 22.13.</note> and that it is but lost time to read them: but remember that hee said well, who said, <hi>Malogranatum inveni, corti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem abjeci, &amp; quod intus est comedi.</hi> Cast away the unprofitable things and make choise of that which is profitable. Others say, they cannot attaine to such perfection in these tongues as the Translators have done who have Translated, the Scriptures already: and therefore they will content themselves with their travels; but how shall they know whether they have translated well or not? They must give credit onely to the bearer, and if the Trench-man faile them, then they are gone. The Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> was much more delighted to heare <hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe speake than heare of him by report,<note place="margin">1 King. 10.7.</note> for she said she beleeved not that which was reported of him; and yet the halfe was not told her: so brethren, when ye heare an Interpreter speake, scarce the halfe is told you: but when ye see it in the originall tongues, then ye will say; it was true which was spoken, and the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that is in them exceedeth the report which wee heard. There is such profunditie in the Scriptures, that all the wits of men can never sound the depth of them;<note place="margin">1 King. 4.</note> it fareth with them as it did with the widdowes Oyle, it lasted as long as the Children brought vessels: so there is much store and plentie in them, that when
<pb facs="560"/> they have filled the wits and understandings of the best, yet there is enough to bee gotten out of them, by those who come after. And here J cannot let passe how much these honourable Patrons are to bee respected, who entertaine and cherish these professors in the tongues, for without such, knowledge would soone decay. <hi>David</hi> made a statute in <hi>Israel,</hi> that they who taried by the stuffe should part alike with those who went to battell. The professors of the tongues are they who keepe the stuffe, and they should bee as well rewarded as they who goe to the field and fight in the ministerie.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30.24.</note> I have indevoured (brethren) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my meane measure of knowledge to make a little path unto you, to encourage you, and to let you see what profit you may have by this kind of studie, and how it may serue you in your ministerie, and if ye reap any benefit by it, be thankefull to the God of heaven the Father of lights from whom all good things descend, and then to my Noble Patron my <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> who doth incourage me much to go on in this kinde of studie. And now when we have made some progresse in this first Schoole, and have attained to some measure of knowledge, see that your knowledge turne not like the waters of <hi>Iordan</hi> that run into the dead Sea, but let them be like those waters which come from the Sea and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>turne to the Sea againe, let them returne to the praise of him who gave them.<note place="margin">Eccles. 17.</note> Next when ye
<pb facs="561"/> are in the Schoole of grace, that ye may understand the Spirituall meaning of the holy Scriptures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your selves with prayer. <hi>Elias</hi> was a man subject to the like passions as wee are,<note place="margin">Iam. 5.17.</note> yet he prayed, and the Heavens were opened and gaue raine: so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ye be men, subject to the same passions to which others are subject; yet if yee pray earnestly to the Lord, he will open the heavens, and send downe that Spirituall raine upon you, and fit you for the Schoole of your calling.<note place="margin">Ier. 2.8. <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> And here ye must be carefull to studie the Law of the Lord, and <hi>to handle it</hi> diligently. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> borroweth this speach from those who are trained in the warres, and they are said <hi>Tractare bellum,</hi> ye must be skilfull and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before ye enter into this calling,<note place="margin">Num. 31.27.</note> that being entred in it, ye may begin to turne the key of knowledge to open the Scriptures to your headers, so that ye may have store both of new and old to bring forth when your Lord and Master shall set you over his houshold to give his servants their meat in due season. And at last he will say unto you,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.23:</note> ye have beene faithfull over a few things, J will make you ruler over many things. <hi>Lectio stata juvat,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Seneca:</note>
