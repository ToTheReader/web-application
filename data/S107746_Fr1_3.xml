   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Beloued, there hath
risen and sprung vp from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs, many dangerous
and erronious opinions, in these
our last dayes, about the subiect
of Religion, let it not therefore
seeme strange vnto you, being
the Spirit of God, did not onely
foresee, but also foretold of the
same, long before they did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
euery one being diuided into sundry and seuerall facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
all pretending to worship the true and euerliuing God in
spirit and in truth, speaking peace vnto themselues, when as
the most of them do yet lie wallowing in the puddle of iniquity,
and cradle of securitie, being not purged in heart: all which
doe rise two sundry wayes, being branches of one stocke, deriued
from one principall head, (namely) the spirit of error: The
first is, in that they contemne, or so little, or lightly esteeme
that meanes, which by Gods prouidence is affoorded vnto vs
vnder our peaceable dread Soueraigne Lord the King. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
they being selfe conceited, or as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes,
aduancing themselues in those things they neuer saw, rashly
puft vp with carnall mindes, supposing they know some thing
more then others, vnderualuing all, and ouerualuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
the conceit whereof causeth them to fall to Schisme,
and seperate from all others, when as indeed and in truth they
being examined, by the word and Spirit of God, it will appeare
<pb facs="3"/>
to the godly wise, that as yet most of them know nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
or as they ought to know, if euer they expect the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their soules. For if they were but possessed with the
true knowledge an liue of God in Christ, and so were of a
sound mind, at Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts all to be, it would rather
cause humiliation, then exaltation, which would truly teach
euery one how to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>meane &amp; carry himselfe, about so weighty
a subiect. The neglect hereof doth bring them into a labyrinth
of errors, following after a forme of godlinesse, through the
wisdome and knowledge of the braine onely, without the power
thereof, contenting themselues in the out side of religion, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
themselues in what they can doe, and measuring the loue
of God to themselues by their owne doings, as of old, their
predecessors, the Scribes and Pharises did: following shadows
insteed of substances, dreaming of a kind of felicitie in this
forme and in that, seeking peace and rest to their soules,
where it is not to be found; which condition of theirs, I cannot
but condole, desiring with the Prophet, <hi>That my head were
water, and mine eyes a fountaine or well of teares, that
I might weepe day and night for their misery.</hi> And in
speciall for them, who are neere and deere vnto me, in the
bonds of nature. For poore soules, they couer their spirituall
misery, with <hi>Adams</hi> fig tree leaues, or with the spiders web,
striuing for an outward separation in the flesh, when alas it is
much to be feared, that with many of them there is litle or
no care at all for a separation of the soule from sin: challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and assuming vnto themselues soundnes of religion, and
assurance of Gods loue, euer measuring themselues by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and not by that eternall wisdome, which is Iustified of
her children, being blinded through selfe-loue, not willing to
iudge themselues, and so become low in their owne eyes, that
God might be all in all, but contrariwise iudging and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
all, but themselues, after this maner doe they follow
the vision of their owne hearts, deceiuing and being deceiued,
running and flitting from one opinion vnto another, being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
in all their wayes. Which practise of theirs may well be
compared vnto certaine flies, feeding on the backe of a gald
<pb facs="3"/>
horse, which is euer flitting or remouing from one place to
another, vntill at last they come to sucke so much venome
therefrom, whereby they burst asunder: so likewise doe all
such persons, who haue not their hearts established with true
sauing grace, but with sundry meates (that is to say) with
sundry strange and different opinions, (I call them strange,
because they were neuer heard of in all the Scriptures, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
shall appeare,) running from one forme of religion vnto
another, vntill at last they come to sucke and feed vpon that
poysonable heresie of the Familists, who are not worthy to haue
so much as the name or title of religion giuen vnto them, it
being not onely the last straine or faction they commonly run
into, but also destroying and damnable, whereby the word of
God is by them blasphemed, and the way of life and truth
euill spoken of, to the great dishonour of the great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Ichouah, who will one day breake and teare them in peeces
(as with a rod of iron) when none shall be able to deliuer them,
as a iust recompence of reward for all such as take pleasure
therein. So then beloued brethren, friends or kindred, of what
sex or condition soeuer, whether yong or old, rich or poore, be
exhorted and forewarned hereby, not giuing the least heed
vnto any lying spirits, vnder what pretence soeuer they haue,
may, can or will present themselues vnto you; but (on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)
labour by the grace and power you haue, or shall receiue
of the Lord, to resist and auoid them, euen as our Lord and
Master did that archspirit and enemie of all mankind, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that if the least way be giuen, you will be in danger to be
inthralled and insnared by their deceiuings. And although
some of them be more defectiue and more dangerous to infect
the soules of men then others be, as most certaine there are,
for there are degrees as well in difference of spirits, as of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and naturall parts, yet (I say) they which may conceiue
haue most soundnesse in their opinion, it will be found vpon
due and iust triall, not to be that which they would seeme both
vnto themselues and others to be, which hereafter will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
Of these things, my beloued, I can in some measure
best aduertise you, being through want of the true sauing
<pb facs="4"/>
knowledge and vnderstanding of God and his truth, caught
and intangled by some of them, wandring vp and downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the drie hils and mountaines, conceiuing comfort,
when alas I was far from it; and the farther I wandred vp
and downe in that Egyptian darknesse, the more intricate laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
of error and darknesse my soule was plunged into; like
vnto a blind man who hauing not his perfect sight, goes on in
darknesse, vntill at last he falls into a pit of destruction, for
want of a guide to conduct and leade him; and especially when
I walked with the Anabaptists, which way and practise of
theirs, shall euidently appeare to euery honest, true and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
heart, not onely to ouerturne and race the foundation
of all Christian religion, but also (in as much as in them lieth)
to destroy the faith of Iesus Christ: all which time, though
strangely deluded, yet was I kept by the power and prouidence
of God from being seduced and led into that destroying and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerable
way of death before mentioned, namely, the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
though very nigh vnto it, hauing one foote entred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
whiles I walked with the people aforesaid, vntill at last
the Lord in his appointed time was pleased to giue me a true
sight of the misery wherein I was plunged; one meanes whereof
being the rod of correction, which God had laid vpon me, it
draue me the more seriously to examine things, and to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with my selfe, whether the cause (for which I suffered)
would any whit auaile me vnto saluation, or whether it would
minister comfort vnto me in that great and teerible day of
the Lord. So vpon a more serious suruay of those positions I
then maintained, I found them all too light, yea so light, as
they were not able to stand against those truths which the holy
Scriptures teach and maintaine: whereupon immediatly I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
my former receiued opinions, as erronious and wicked;
so that I may say (and that truly) with that holy man <hi>Dauid,
It was good for me that I was corrected and chastised,
for till then I went astray.</hi> Yet notwithstanding, though I
was cleane escaped therefrom, within a short time after, I was
so far from hauing or enioying true peace and comfort, that
in stead thereof, my poore distressed soule was accompanied
<pb facs="4"/>
with nothing but strange feares, terrors and guiltinesse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
crying out against me for nothing but vengeance; the
misery whereof was such, as caused me to lament the time
wherein I was borne, not regarding wife, children, or any
friends whatsoeuer that came to visit me. The misery wherein
I was, did depriue me of being sensible of the least ioy, either in
heauen or on earth, being altogether benummed therewith,
compassed and set about with many strange and fearfull appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions
of temptations; the primary and first cause thereof, was
that originall guilt which I drew from the loines of my first
parents, being the very seed and spawne of all my actuall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions;
and so being confounded &amp; vtterly lost, yea oft times
in despaire, fearing there was mo mercie with God for me, my
sins being so heauy a burden vpon my soule; then (euen then)
when I was in greatest despaire, God by his Spirit was pleased
to worke in me a contrite and broken heart, whereby it was
turned from being a stubburne and stonie, by dissoluing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> into
a heart of flesh, as soft as water; and therein (through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">

      </gap> of

         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> the
day of my redemption is accomplished in the second resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that as certaine as my Red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>emer liueth and cannot die, so
certaine I am that one day I shall enioy that glorious inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
purchased through the merits of Iesus Christ; which
happie and blessed estate, my soule could not enioy, whiles it
stucke fast in the quick sands of Anabaptistry, being euen
welnigh smothered and ouerwhelmed in error and darknesse,
vntill the Lord was pleased to open the eyes of my vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
by hearing the word and doctrine of truth, which is main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained
by and in the Church of England, as namely the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of repentance, free iustification by faith, Gods eternall
predestination and election from the foundation of the world,
that no man hath free will or power to obtaine his owne salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that originall sin to be in all the posteritie of <hi>Adam,</hi>
euer since we fell from that happie &amp; blessed estate which once
<pb facs="5"/>
we had in him, with many other excellent truths; all which
is such a certaine and sure foundation that whosoeuer can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to walke in the power thereof, the gates of hell shall neuer
ouercome nor destroy him: yet notwithstanding all these truths
there maintained, I dare not attribute so great a work as this
vnto any mortall man whatsoeuer, any otherwise, then his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
to be the ordinary meanes thereof, but desire to giue
the praise (both now and for euer) onely to God, vnto whom
it is due, he being the principall and chiefe worker therein, by
the powerfull minstration of his holy Spirit, that so he may be
all in all vnto all. And thus in all humilitie of soule, I humbly
take my leaue, proceeding vnto that which followeth, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God (euen the God of all peace, grace, mercie and loue) to
confirme, direct and informe all our hearts by his holy Spirit,
whereby we may not only come to vnderstand the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
but also to practise the same in our liues and conuersations,
to the praise of the glorie of his grace, vntill we come to be
safe ariued at the promised Ierusalem, which is the hauen or
port of eternall rest, therein shall all teares be wiped from our
eyes, and so enioy the presence of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus
Christ, the Prince of our saluation; to whom with the Father
and the holy Spirit, be all praise, honour and glorie giuen of his
Saints for euermore. Amen.</p>
