VVho beeing blamed of his freend, for stryuing further thē his sleeue would stretch, answered: that although arte &amp; skyll were wanting to beau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifie the worke, yet hart and wyll did polish that part, which lacke of cunning had left vnperfect. VVhose answere, as one guilty of a greater cryme, I clayme for a sufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of my folly, that durst enterprise to stryue beyonde my strength, knowing my selfe vnable, both by nature and arte to bring this or any part thereof by mine owne skill to a wyse ende. For if the Fouler is to bee condemned of folly that takes in hand to talke of hunting, then may I wel be dubbed a dolte, which beeing vnskilfull, dare take in hande to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipher the substaunce of Loue, that am but a foole.</p>

For beeing greatly indebted to my honourable good Lord by duety, for the first payment I offer although not mine owne labours, to you his honours worthy Nephue, this small pamphlet of M. <hi>Iohn Boccace</hi> a famous Poet, and translated by M. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholmewe Young</hi> of the middle temple, a peece of worke worthy the wearing, in that it sheweth the manner howe to esehew deceitfull &amp; wicked loue: which considered although wisdōe willed me to goe (non <hi>Vltra crepidā</hi>) I thought good to present this pamphlet vnder your worships protectiō: ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping you will deigne to accept the matter although it be but prose, though something vnsauery for want of skil, yet accept the Authours well meaning for his and my boldnesse, in that his skill and my good will is not in the wane, whatsoeuer this worke dooth want.
