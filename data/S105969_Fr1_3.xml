   <head>THE EPISTLE DEDICATORIE.</head>
   <head type="sub">To all true Christians, to my Countrey of Great <hi>Britaine, my native Soyle of Scotland, and to</hi> that famous, and woorthie Towne of <hi>EDINBVRGH.</hi>
   </head>
   <head type="sub">And especially to the two magnanimous, <hi>and worthie Lords, IAMES Marquesse</hi> of Hamiltoun, &amp;c.</head>
   <head type="sub">And <hi>GEORGE</hi> Lord Chancelour <hi>of SCOTLAND.</hi>
   </head>
   <l>MAgnanimous Lords with duetifull respects</l>
   <l>This Pilgrims Poëme, <hi>FRANCK</hi> to you directs,</l>
   <l>Wishing your Lordships daigne to patronize it,</l>
   <l>What <hi>FRANCK</hi> affoords, let favour infranchize it.</l>
   <l>My loyall love (though I bee much destressed)</l>
   <l>From praising Vertue should not bee suppressed,</l>
   <l>And how much more in Kings its eminent,</l>
   <l>So much the more to praise it should bee bent,</l>
   <l>Each generous genius. Since (conjectures past)</l>
   <l>True tacticke practicke teacheth vs at last,</l>
   <l>That IAMES the Iust hath both begunne and ended,</l>
   <l>In mercie, peace, and grace now much commended,</l>
   <l>And since so oft installed on a Throne,</l>
   <l>His happie Head was honoured with a Crowne,</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="4"/>Till that nor Crownes, nor Kingdomes to him given</l>
   <l>Could keepe his Soule on Earth now crownd in Heaven,</l>
   <l>Who having left of his owne royall race</l>
   <l>A royall, loyall Prince to fill his place.</l>
   <l>(And having him in Christian Schooles vptrained,</l>
   <l>Till hee true vertue, and Religion gained,</l>
   <l>So that in tender age hee did surmount</l>
   <l>All Christian Princes in the best account)</l>
   <l>In Peace and true Religion hath layd downe,</l>
   <l>Three Swords, three Scepters, and a triple Crowne.</l>
   <l>Shall hee so much was praised whilst hee lived</l>
   <l>For vertue loved; and who so much was grieved</l>
   <l>At vyces of this age, now beeing gone,</l>
   <l>Bequeath his vertues to oblivion?</l>
   <l>No; since both rich and poore so well were pleased,</l>
   <l>His memorie must needs bee eternized.</l>
   <l>My Muse must praise such vertues as did dwell</l>
   <l>Within his Soule, (which made him so excell)</l>
   <l>Which wee must imitate, and alwayes strive</l>
   <l>Wisely to vse our Talents (whilst wee live)</l>
   <l>By his example, who defunct, doth rest</l>
   <l>In Heaven with him, in whom he put his trust.</l>
   <l>The vertues of the living, men should praise,</l>
   <l>That more and more wee may true vertue raise:</l>
   <l>Till like the graine of mustard-seed it grow,</l>
   <l>And all the World aboundantly ore-flow:</l>
   <l>True vertues praise I heartlie doe intend,</l>
   <l>Till that my breath, and mortall life shall end:</l>
   <l>And so much more to praise it shall bee bent,</l>
   <l>As I doe finde it true and eminent.</l>
