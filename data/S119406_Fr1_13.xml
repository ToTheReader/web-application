   <l>ALthough you haue discouered nobly well</l>
   <l>The Iesuites and sonnes of <hi>Machiauell:</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Yet on this Booke which doth their Arts descry,</l>
   <l>They practise yet a greater Policie.</l>
   <l>For Sir I dare not thinke but that you know</l>
   <l>Who are the Merchants that engrost it so</l>
   <l>Spies for S. Omers, and the Doway Crew,</l>
   <l>And such as feare what good thy booke may doe,</l>
   <l>Intelligencers, Mumblers of the Masse</l>
   <l>Disguis'd and skin'd in Sattin (as the Asse</l>
   <l>Was in the Lyons hide) but their long eares</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="9"/>
Hang out too farre. Yet where their craft appeares</l>
   <l>Or where they are discouer'd openly</l>
   <l>Such bookes as those by the whole sale they buy,</l>
   <l>And hide them from our view: And this was one</l>
   <l>Of many reasons caus'd th' impression:</l>
   <l>To be renewd: That he his booke repaires</l>
   <l>Comes not from his ambition but theirs.</l>
