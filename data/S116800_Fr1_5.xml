   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <l>THe order of the men in verse,</l>
   <l>here also shalt thou finde</l>
   <l>Thy knowledge better to increase,</l>
   <l>and satisfie thy minde.</l>
   <l>First, for the Pawnes here vnderstand</l>
   <l>their march is right forth still,</l>
   <l>And who so doth before them stand,</l>
   <l>they haue no power to kill.</l>
   <l>But as they march who so they finde</l>
   <l>doe in their colour stand,</l>
   <l>Such may they kill or checke a slope,</l>
   <l>to the right or left hand.</l>
   <l>Not any in the reare of them,</l>
   <l>they can once checke or spoile</l>
   <l>Forth must they march and not retreate,</l>
   <l>but keepe their rancke or file.</l>
   <l>Till by command they pointed are,</l>
   <l>their King for to releeue;</l>
   <l>Then must they bouldly vnto warre,</l>
   <l>his foes to vexe and greeue.</l>
   <l>And comming at the last in place,</l>
   <l>where Knights and Lords did dwell,</l>
   <l>Their King shall giue to them like grace,</l>
   <l>because they serued him well.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="6"/>Thus being Bishops, Knights, or Dukes,</l>
   <l>their Kings they'le better steede</l>
   <l>The Kings may make of them a Queene,</l>
   <l>if they haue any neede.</l>
   <l>Yet ere they can such honour haue,</l>
   <l>all stormes they must a bide,</l>
   <l>And doe their best the Kings to saue,</l>
   <l>what danger ere betide.</l>
   <l>The Bishops that attend the Kings</l>
   <l>a slope doe vse to fight,</l>
   <l>The one in blacke doth helpe the King,</l>
   <l>the other in the white.</l>
   <l>Their checke in field extends as farre</l>
   <l>as any of the rest,</l>
   <l>What colours they are placed in,</l>
   <l>there must they doe their best.</l>
   <l>The Bishop blacke in blacke must march</l>
   <l>and therein vse his skill,</l>
   <l>For in the white he may not come,</l>
   <l>no man to hurt or kill.</l>
   <l>The Bishop white in white must serue,</l>
   <l>so long as he doth liue,</l>
   <l>To any which in blacke doth stand,</l>
   <l>he cannot one checke giue.</l>
   <l>The Duke in valew is halfe a Queene</l>
   <l>and halfe her draughts hath he,</l>
   <l>Right forth and backe and from each side,</l>
   <l>he can giue checke for thee.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="7"/>Through all the colours of the field</l>
   <l>in such wise may hee checke,</l>
   <l>And also when occasion serues</l>
   <l>relieue the King with necke.</l>
   <l>Like to a horseman doth the Knight</l>
   <l>assist the King alwayes,</l>
   <l>And ouer ranke or file hee leapes,</l>
   <l>his honour for to raise.</l>
   <l>When hee giues checke vnto the King,</l>
   <l>and is not for it slaine,</l>
   <l>The King must moue out of his place,</l>
   <l>else-where for to remaine.</l>
   <l>The Knights being forth, and comming in</l>
   <l>such houses as are white</l>
   <l>May help or harme eight wayes them fro,</l>
   <l>during the time they fight.</l>
   <l>Like all the men within the field,</l>
   <l>the Queene may ayde the King,</l>
   <l>Yet like a Knight no ayde at all,</l>
   <l>she can vnto him bring.</l>
   <l>Through all the houses of the field</l>
   <l>the Queene may take her pleasure,</l>
   <l>And vse her power to help her King</l>
   <l>still in a modest measure.</l>
   <l>If in the martch she proue seuere,</l>
   <l>and taketh all she may,</l>
   <l>'Tis for the safegard of the King,</l>
   <l>that she makes cleere the way.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="7"/>For this she may not blamed be,</l>
   <l>that seekes her King to saue,</l>
   <l>It is her glory for to striue,</l>
   <l>her King in peace to haue.</l>
   <l>The King in Maiestie doth martch,</l>
   <l>one step at once he goes,</l>
   <l>Further no time can he goe forth,</l>
   <l>for feare of forraine fooes.</l>
   <l>If the blacke King shall bring a man</l>
   <l>vnto the white Kings side,</l>
   <l>And then and there giue him one guard,</l>
   <l>he may there still abide.</l>
   <l>Without which help if he presume,</l>
   <l>so neere the King to stand,</l>
   <l>If neede require such one the King</l>
   <l>may kill with his owne hand.</l>
   <l>None of the Kings can take a man,</l>
   <l>that standeth on a guard,</l>
   <l>'Twere checke at once if he doe so,</l>
   <l>therefore hee must be spar'd.</l>
   <l>Thus may you learne the Kings no time</l>
   <l>can into a checke goe,</l>
   <l>In places where no perrill is</l>
   <l>they may march too and fro.</l>
   <l>Know you that this shall read or see,</l>
   <l>I wish nought for my paine</l>
   <l>If it thee please I haue content,</l>
   <l>I seeke no other gaine.</l>
