as being once past cannot at any rate be recouered and got againe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while we haue time so to bestow it, as not onely our selues may be benefited, our soules comforted, our calling and election assured; but also God himselfe glorified, and our brethren and neighbours by our good example prouoked, and by our good instruction allured to religious and holy duties. And this duty of drawing others to God and godlinesse, as it concerneth the Ministers and teachers of Gods word publickly, so parents and maisters of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies priuately.<note place="margin">Esay 38.18.19.</note> The father, saith the Prophet Esay, shall declare thy truth to his children: and so likewise the maister, who is the father of the family, is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the like dutie to his seruants. Oh that all whom it concerneth would be carefull in this case, and shake off that carelesnesse, security and forgetfulnesse of this duty, which too too much preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in these daies!

Great wil be the anguish, sorrow, griefe, perplexitie and distresse, that the neglect and omission of this duty may hereafter procure vs vpon our death-beds, by a gnawing and gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of consciēce for our failing herein; &amp; on the other side great is the comfort, ioy, peace, solace, quiet of conscience and tranquility of mind, that the godly and conscionable performance hereof will bring vs in that day when we shall lie vpon our bed of sorow, as Dauid calleth it Psal. <hi>41.3.</hi> in the greatest extremities, paines and pangs of death.
