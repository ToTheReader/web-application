   <p>RIght Christian, Honourable, and Religious
Senators; that all-disposing Prouidence
of our euer-blessed GOD, which hath
lately Conuented, and since that Centered you,
with an vnanimous and inflexible resolution, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the examination of the seuerall Innouations,
Restraints, and Pressures of our much endangered
Religion, to the great content and ioy of all good

wrath and curse against vs, (who hath blasted all
our publike Enterprises, since these Arminian Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

endammagement and disturbance of our Church,
and State; which are like to sincke and perish
vnder them, vnlesse your medicinall and helping

other now to question: (as I feare too many doe)

of Lions, the Father of the renowned <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses,</hi>
or Protestans in France, and the originall
Author of the first open defection from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
Church of Rome: yet all good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
applaud this Act of his. Such are the
Maior part of our Ecclesiasticall Commissioners,
who yet determine of Haeresies, false Doctrines,
Scismes, and the sense and meaning of our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
yet no man quarrels or excepts against them.
Why then should they deny this power vnto Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
because they are but Lay, which they
acknowledge, and admit in these? Especially,
since all our Churchmen are virtually included in
our Parliament, and so suffragate to its Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in our Prelates (the vnquestionable Iudges of
Points and Controuersies in Religion) who are
chiefe Members of this mixt Assembly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
both of Church and State, and so not
wholly Lay or Ciuill, as some vainely fancy.
Is it because Parliaments want Conusance or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to deale in Church affaires, and matters
of Religion? How then was Popery heretofore
implanted, since that exiled, and our present Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe
Religion, with all its seuerall circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and adiuncts, estated, and lawfully setled in our
Church by Act of Parliament; if Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

they could not collate, or transferre such Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction

learning, iudgement, or sufficiencie, to discerne of

<pb facs="5"/>
intermedled with matters of Religion, by a
constant, iust, and Legall right: If there bee now
no sufficient disability, either in the Members, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
Skill, or requisite Abilities of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Parliament, to censure or examine the Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our established Articles, and Religion, or
to settle, protect, define, declare, and ratifie the
proper sense and meaning of our Articles, and the
vndoubted Doctrines of our Church: I see no
cause why any Clergy men (vnlesse they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Sophisticating, or betraying the Truthes,
and Doctrines of our Church; and therefore
feare the doome of Parliaments, from which there
is no euasion) should quarrell, or except against
your pious progresse in matters of Religion,
(which most of all concerne vs) nor yet repine at
Laicks (as they do) for writing in their iust defence.</p>
   <p>This stumbling-blocke of Parlimentary Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in causes of Religion, (which stickes and
takes with many) being thus in briefe remoued;
and your present Honourable proceedings in the
examination of the innouations, and violations of
the ancient Religion, and the resolued Doctrines of
our Church, absolued from the vniust exceptions
of ignorant, obnoxious, or ill-affected Spirits, who
only censure and dislike them: It may be here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
what Doctrines, what Religion are now to
be established? Surely no other but those Ancient,
Orthodox, and Dogmaticall Conclusions, which
the Church of England, since her Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hath alwaies constantly embraced, ratified,
and defended as her owne; but those especially,
<pb facs="6"/>
which Popery and Arminianisme haue of late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded.
Yea, but how may Parliaments infallibly
discerne what Tenents are our Churches genuine
Doctrines, when as both sides lay equall claime,
and title to our Church? Arminians now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to Her, aswell as their Opposers.</p>
   <p>For resolution to this <hi>Quaere,</hi> I shall first of all
take two things as vndoubted Theories.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, that the Church of England hath some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
positiue, particular, established, receiued, yea
resolued Doctrines, which shee may truely call her
owne: in which, all necessary Truthes, (especially
such, wherein the very marrow, efficacy, life, and
power of grace, and all true Christian comfort
doe subsist) are actually, euidently, and fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended:
Else it will ineuitably follow, that as
yet shee hath no sound Religion in her, and is as
yet no true, no Christian Church.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that all these seuerall Doctrines, are,
not onely cognoscible in themselues; but likewise
publikly, indiuidually, and distinctly known in our
Church: else all our Articles, Preaching, writing,
and Disputes, (together with the bloud shedde of
our famous Martyrs, and all Apologies for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion)
from the beginning of reformation to this
present, are in vaine; and wee haue yet no other,
but an indefinite, confused Religion: an ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
implicit, Popish Faith, (which in truth is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
no Faith at all:) and so our danger is,<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 11. 21. <hi>to</hi> 25. Luke 10. 12. <hi>to</hi> 16.</note>
      <hi>our
condemnation shall be greater, then euer Sodomes or
Gomorrahs were,</hi> who neuer had such meanes, such
light as we.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>
These two irrefragable Conclusions being thus
praemised: This <hi>Quaere</hi> may be thus resolued: The
onely infallible way to determine, to finde out
the ancient, the vndoubted Doctrines of our
Church, is to compare them with the Rules of
triall: The originall Touch-stone by which all
Theologicall Conclusions must bee examined, is
the Scriptures: and these, (together with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Fathers, and approued Councels) wee dare
to challenge as our owne, if the naked truth of
our Assertions were the thing in Issue: But our
present inquirie being of a different nature, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
the true Ancient Doctrines of our Church,
and distinguish them from pestilent vpstart Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
wee must heere proceed by other Triers;
euen the <hi>Articles, Homilies, Common Prayer Booke;</hi> the
publike <hi>Euidences, Records,</hi> and <hi>Declarations;</hi> with
the concurrent Testimony of all the learned <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
of our Church: the onely Grand-Iury-men to
try, the best Euidences, the sole Witnesses to proue,
the most impartiall and able Iudges to determine
the Doctrines of our Church. That which all
these doe ioyntly, cleerely, fully vote, confirme,
approue, and testifie, a Parliament may safely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
and ratifie to bee; that which they all, or
most disclaime, a Parliament may iustly censure
not to bee; the vndoubted and resolued Doctrine
of our Church.</p>
   <p>If then all these giue vp their ioynt and seuerall
suffrages for our Anti-Arminian Conclusions; If
they all passe Sentence against their opposite Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian
Errors, (as this present Treatise will vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
<pb facs="7"/>
prooue them to haue done) you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
declare, resolue, re-establish the one, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
exile, yea damne the other, as not being, the
Ancient, receiued, and vndoubted Doctrine of
our English Church.</p>
   <p>And why should you now make any doubt or scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of passing such a sentence? Neuer were there
any truthes more copiously confirmed; more
constantly defended; more posit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uely resolued;
more aboundantly propagated; more generally
Preached; more vnanimously imbraced; more
vncontrolably published, more peremptorily esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in our Church, then these Anti-Arminian
Tenents, which I heere present vnto you: There
is scarce one publike (whether Ancient or Modern)
Act, Record, or Euidence of our Church, since
her Reformation hitherto, but doth <hi>in terminis,</hi> at
least in substance, guie iudgement for them: Scarse
a learned or godly Martyr of note or eminency in
our infant Church, but hath planted them with
his hand, watred them with his bloud. Scarce one
Diuinity Professor in either of our Vniuersities;
hardly an Orthodox or renowned Writer in our
Church, from the beginning of King <hi>Edward</hi>
the 6. his Raigne till this very present: but
hath subscribed them with his hand and feale, and
transmitted them to posteritie in some publike
Worke. Not one constant Preacher of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
who hath not proclaimed them in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.
Scarce a Graduate in Diuinitie, but hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Lectures or Disputes, defended them in the
Schoole. Scarce an Act, or Commencement hath
<pb facs="7"/>
passed in either of our Famous Academies, wherein
all, or some of them, haue not bene publikely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in Diuinity Exercises. Not one authorized
or approued Writer of our Church (for I count
not<note n="*" place="margin">Three of their bookes were not ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed.</note>
      <hi>Barret, Thomson, Mountague,</hi> or <hi>Iackson</hi> such, the
only opposites to them, that I know off, and those
generally opposed, by all our Orthodox Diuines)
who did euer once oppugne them: Yea al such who
haue formerly but barked against them in their
inconsiderate Sermons, haue beene forced to sing
a publike Palinodie for their paines: as the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations</hi>
of <hi>Barret, Sympson,</hi> and others largely
testifie: And shall wee now beginne to question,
whether they are the Doctrines of our Church or
no? because some pur-blinde, squint-eyed, ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Arminian Nouellists, begin for to dispute it?
What is this but to make a scruple, whether the
day be light, or no; because Buzzards, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
cannot see it? or sottishly to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Sunne stands centred in one constant cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
whiles the massie Earth wheeles round; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
one brainesicke <hi>Copernicus</hi> out of the sublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of his quintessentiall, transcendentall Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
hath more senselesly, then Metaphysically,
more ridiculously, then singularly auerred it?
Shall others wilfull, gainefull, and aspiring blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
make vs to doubt our eye-sight? or shall the
absurd and idle <hi>Quaerees</hi> of some Romish or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing
Spirits, so vnsettle vs in our long-profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
faith, as to cause vs now to question the most
positiue, palpable, and resolued Principles of our
reformed Religion? Yea so farre to besot vs, as
<pb facs="8"/>
to put vs to this irrationall, this frantique scrutinie;
Whether that bee the vndoubted Doctrine of our
Church, which shee hath alwayes hitherto belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
embraced, professed as a truth: or that rather
which she hath alwaies Diametrally opposed, yea
censured as an Error? O let not vs be so vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly,
so Atheistically wauering in the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

by certaine Politike, and insensible gradations to
shoulder them out of our Church; that so Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery

to dis-martyr, yea, vncrowne, and tread them
vnder foot, by disputing, or doubting these The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall

Arminian, Popish Errors, which they all haue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured

which our Church was neuer yet suspitious, in
the least degree. Proceede, therefore as you
(Gods name be blessed) haue already done: to
inquire out the Heads, the Nurseries, rootes, and
grand Protectors of our Popish, our Arminian
mungrell rabble, (which swarme like Locusts in
our Church of late) combining both together
(as is iustly feared) to eate out our Religion
by degrees, to spoile vs of these temporall
immunities, of those coelestiall treasures of Gods
sauing truth, which are farre dearer to vs, then
our dearest soules: and when you haue once dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
them (as you may quickely doe, since
practise, fame, and iealousie haue made them so
notorious,) it will be worth your labour to hew
them downe with speede, both root and branch,
at once; else all your superficiall hacking of some
smaller Issues, will but increase their growth, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their strength, and multiply their fruit,
their branches, and al-daring practises, when the
time, the feare of lopping are but passed ouer.
Trampling we know on Camomile stalkes, doth
but make them grow the thicker, spread the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
it is the breaking, not the bruising of the
roote that kills it. The mowing down of weedes,
of grasse; the lopping off of lesser branches
doth neuer hinder, but aduance their growth; not
lessen, but augment their number: The rootes
must first bee stocked vp, or else the blades, the
stalkes, the branches will not, cannot wither, or
<pb facs="11"/>
giue ouer budding. Strike therefore at the roots,
as well as at the branches of these preuailing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
else all your lopping, will turne but into
pruning: your launching into festring; your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine

in a rocky Sepulchre, to the doore of which there
was a great stone rolled: but they likewise went and
made the Sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting
a watch, for feare lest his Disciples should come by

      <hi>Fathers of the Church,</hi> but yet they haue alwaies
risen from the dead againe, to the great disquiet
of all true Christian Churches: If then you
chance to crucifie them once againe (as now wee
hope, wee pray you may, for feare their life
proue all our deathes: they being the Archest Trait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
to our Church, our State, our soules, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
Grace:) you must not only see them intombed
for the present, though it be in graues of stone:
but likewise watch, and seale their Sepulchres,
making them sure for all succeding Ages, by some
inexorable, strict, and vigilant Acts of Parliament,
which no Charme, no Wile, no Force, or Policie
may euade; Else their Disciples will come by
night againe, (as they haue oft times done) and
steale them quite away; and not onely say, but
to our great disturbance, prooue; that they are
once more risen from the dead: So shall their
last resurrection be farre worse, our second dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
your latter Error, farre greater then the first;
which God forbid.</p>
   <p>Now the GOD of grace, and wisdome, so
ayde, direct, and guide your Honours with his
Spirit, in this great weighty Worke, (which
needes an heauenly power to accomplish it:) that
wee, to our vnutterable ioy and comfort, may
now at last behold, our drooping and declining
Orthodox Religion (the onely Center, Pillar,
Bulwarke, Garrison, Honour, Treasure, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruer
of our declining State, which ebbes and
flowes together with it) reuiued, aduanced, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,

and secured once againe, against all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,
all Domestique hostile Forces, all Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemes
that oppugne it: and that all our eyes
