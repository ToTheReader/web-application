   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE
SIR THOMAS BENNET KNIGHT, LORD
MAIOR OF THIS CITIE, THE RIGHT WORSIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
the Aldermen his Brethren, and to those Worshipfull
Commoners, elected Committies, for the Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of this Businesse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE loue which I beare to your <hi>Honour</hi> and VVorships: and the duty
wherewith I am bound to this honourable Citie, makes me appeare in
this boldnesse to you; To whome I humbly Consecrate these fruites of
my inuention, which <hi>Time</hi> hath nowe at length brought foorth, and
ripened to this perfection. That Magnificent <hi>Royalty,</hi> and glorious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement,
which you your selues for your part, out of a free, a cleare,
and verie bounteous disposition, and so many thousands of woorthie
Citizens, out of a sincere affection and loyalty of his Maiestie, did with
the sparing of no cost, bestowe but vpon one day, is here newe wrought
vp againe, and shall endure for euer. For albeit those Monuments of
your <hi>Loues</hi> were erected vp to the Cloudes, and were built neuer so
strongly, yet now their lastningnes should liue but in the tongues and memories of men: But that the
hand of Arte giues them here a second more perfect beeing, aduaunceth them higher then they were
before, and warrants them that they shall doe honour to this Citie, so long as the Citie shall beare a
name. Sory I am that they come into the world no sooner: but let the hardnesse of the labour; and
the small number of handes, that were busied about them, make the faulte (if it bee a faulte) excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable.
I would not care if these vnpainted <hi>Pictures</hi> were more Costly to me, so that they might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
curious enough to your Lordship and VVorships; yet in regard, that this present Age can lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you no President that euer any in this land performed the like, I presume these my endeuours
shall receiue the more worthie liking of you. And thus Dedicating my Labours and Loue to your
honourable and kinde Acceptations, I most humbly take my leaue, this 16 of <hi>Iune</hi> 1604.</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Most affectionately deuoted to your
Lordship and Worships,
<hi>Stephen Harrision.</hi>
