   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou hast here <hi>(gentle Reader)</hi> an Edict and Censure, published by the State of France, against the Booke of <hi>FRANCIS SVARES,</hi> intended for answere to his <hi>MAIESTIE;</hi> which as it is not the first taste they haue giuen to the world of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of sundry Positions maintayned and defended by the Iesuites; so neyther is this the first borne of my Labours, which thy courteous acceptance hath entreated from mee, of exposing to thy view in thy natiue language, sundry nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and learned Treatises set forth in French. The printed Copie hereof as it came to my hands, I haue subioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; that thou maist see this Spanish <hi>Goliah,</hi> or Popish Champion, inuading the King of <hi>England,</hi> Armado-like, brought to confusion before hee commeth to grapple with his enemie. This is hee who neyther daunted to see <hi>LESSIVS</hi> beaten, nor <hi>BECANVS</hi> cast into the fire of Purgatorie, lifteth vp his arme against the Lords An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted.</p>
   <p>Now to thee, Romish-affected whosoeuer thou art, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold your <hi>SVARES, Sidus Hispanicum, imò &amp; Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum;</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>The Load-starre of Spaine, and glory of his Order,</hi> censured, not for his priuate opinion, but for a common tenent of the Iesuites: some there are, who through fauour to the Man and his Order, haue not feared to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the displeasure of his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> censure of our <hi>State,</hi> and danger of the <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> of this Land, in maintaining the doctrine of <hi>this Booke:</hi> but of the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liora spero, I am better conceited:</hi> assuring my selfe that seeing these and the like Doctrines finde no better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment with these learned <hi>French-men</hi> (as zealous for the Catholike Faith as thy selfe) neyther the report of their learning, the high commendations of their zeale and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, nor the vsurped title of the Catholike Faith, shall henceforth lull thee asleepe to forget thy duty to thy King and Country; but <hi>reddere quae sunt Caesaris Caesari, &amp; quae sunt Dei Deo,</hi> teach thee to <hi>giue vnto Caesar those things which are Caesars, and vnto God those things which are Gods:</hi> and stop thine eares against the <hi>Circean</hi> Language of this late-sprung-vp Imposters; And in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration as heretofore some certaine Catholikes haue done, cry out, <hi>Good God, that such a Societie of men, after so many scandals and foule deserts of theirs in FRANCE, and else-where, for PRINCE-KILLING SEDITION, &amp;c. can thus be of credit in ENGLAND? A. C.</hi> to his dis-Iesuited Kinsman, <hi>pag. 72.</hi> And so I leaue this and the rest, commended to thy best acceptance.</p>
