   <head>THE PREFACE to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen in the yeere 1601 I gave out a little treatise concerning the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of persons in the Vnitie of the Deity, for such reasons as appeare therein, I made a conditionall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of a further assertion of every Article of our Christian faith. This promise of mine hath oftentimes since that beene exacted both by friends, and strangers. That treatise tryed the common fortune of all bookes; some slighted it, because it brought nothing but that which was common, others condemned it, as thinking it unfit that matiers of faith should be perswaded by reason. They of the first sort were not onely mine acquaintance, who might commend my Booke for affection to me, but some strangers, who for their liking of the booke became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my friends. And these encouraged me to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of my promise. The second sort did not a little comfort me, because I had in no sort troubled the peace of the Church. The third sort have held me disheartned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till now: for although I there shewed, that even in matiers where faith is most required, both our Lord and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
<pb facs="6"/> perswaded by common reasons, as also the Prophets before-time had done: yet though I knew no reason of their dislike, I did forbeare, because I would not offend of ignorance. But seeing the everlasting saving or losse o the soule, is a thing which of all other concernes a man most to thinke of; and that all sorts and sects of men, which farre exceed us Christians in multitude, <hi>See Brere woods enquirie of Religion Chap.</hi> 14. have hope of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life aswell as wee, it concernes us not a little to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> wherein our advantage is, and what assurance wee have more than they. Now to let passe the false Religion of the <hi>Paynim</hi> idolaters in <hi>Lapland,</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> and that great continent of the <hi>South;</hi> what is our preheminence over the <hi>Iewes, Turkes</hi> and <hi>Heretickes</hi> of the former times? of them that are, and still will be untill the time that all things shall be restored? The <hi>Iewes</hi> hold firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we, the authoritie of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and denie the <hi>New.</hi> The <hi>Turkes</hi> also, though they speake honourably of <hi>Christ,</hi> as of more than a <hi>Prophet:</hi> yet of the holy Scriptures which wee receive, they make little reckoning; and al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>though they reade the <hi>Psalter Azoa</hi> 7 yet they set up their <hi>Alcoran</hi> as their Idole which they worship. Doe not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Tertullian contra Marcionem,</hi> and <hi>Augustine de Haeres. Cap. (See</hi> also the epistle of <hi>Orig.</hi> cited by <hi>Iohn Picus Miran. pag.</hi> 206.) witnesse how the authoritie of Scriptures was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based by the <hi>Heretickes?</hi> some they rejected, the rest they corrupted by false interpretations, by adding, and taking away what was for their purpose. It seemes therefore, that the authorities on all sides respectively being of like regard, the maine advantage which we have, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n reason, as it shall hereafter appeare, in every Article of our Faith. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that denie us the use of reason in a matier of so great importance as our Religion is, bereaue us of our chiefe advantage; and (as much as in them is) turne us out of the fold of <hi>Christ,</hi> to chuse at large what Religion we like best. But if man were created in the image of God that hee might know and serve him as he ought, and if common reason rightly guided be that image of God in us yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
<pb facs="6"/> as it is plaine, because that image and wisdome of the Father is that light which lightens every man that comes into the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. I see no cause why reason, that especiall and principall gift of God to mankinde, should not be serviceable to the principall and especiall end for which man himselfe is created, that is, his drawing neere unto God by faith in him: for the excellencie of every thing is in the excellencie of the End for which it is. And that common sence and reason have their especiall use in things pertaining unto God, it is most manifest. For all our knowledge proceeds from meere ignorance, first knowing words, by their meaning, then things by sence and experiments, from whence the reason ascending by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie into the causes comes at last into the knowledge thereof, and so unto the chiefest and first cause, wherein alone it findes rest. And seeing man alone of all the visible creatures is framed and formed of God unto this search, by the outward sence and reason to finde the wisdome and power of God in the creature, that so honouring him therefore as he ought he might be made happie thereby: if it bee no way possible by reason and discourse to come to this end, then should God want of his honour by some of those meanes by which it might be given unto him; then should the creature bee failing to man in the speciall use, which he should make thereof to God, then should reason the chiefe facultie of our soule, and principall meanes of our knowledge, have beene given unto man in vaine; that is, as sence is to the beasts, onely for this life; if it were either no helpe at all, or an unfit, or an insufficient meane to know that which is most necessary and worthy to bee knowne; and yet obscure, to stirre up our industrie, that as faithfull servants we may improve those gifts wherewith God hath intrusted us: <hi>See Luke</hi> 19.1. And so the purpose of God should be frustrate, both in the inferiour creature, and in man, and that in their chiefest and uttermost end. <hi>See Prov.</hi> 16.4. But these things are impossible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are commanded <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. to love and serve the Lord our God with all our heart, the seat of reason: 1 <hi>King.</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/> 3.12. with all our soule, the seat of the will and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in heavenly things, and all our affections, there stiled by a word of vehemencie or excesse. And thus doe we ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the counsell of the wise <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.9. to honour the Lord with all our substance, that is, whatsoever is ours without or within, as sence, reason, understanding, affections, and will. But still you say that reason is an unsufficient meane, and unable to bring us to the knowledge of those things which we are bound to beleeve: for else the <hi>Heathen</hi> which know not the Scriptures, might have known the truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as well as we. <hi>Ans.</hi> There be divers kinds of questions about every subject, <hi>as I shewed Log Chap</hi> 3. Now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion or Article of our faith by the <hi>Atheist</hi> or <hi>Infidell</hi> or weake Beleever being made a question, the reasons brought are to prove onely that the conclusion is true, not alwayes why it is true: for there be many conclusions in our faith which cannot be knowne and proved <hi>prioristicè</hi> (as they speake) that is, by their immediate and necessarie causes, seene and understood in the effects necessarily following thereon: for then that humilitie which ought to be joyned with our faith, should bee without reward; but yet the foundation of our faith is sure, because the Spirit of God which understands the things which are of God, hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scriptures whatsoever is necessary for us to know or beleeve concerning God: &amp; thus <hi>posterioristicè</hi> or by way of induction are all the Articles of our faith approved by reason: so that our faith and hope are not of things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, but such as are true and necessarie to be. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if there bee but one God, one Lord of all, one faith, the onelie way to come unto God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.6. as it is plaine there is but one Mediatour, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. without whom none can come to the Father. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.6. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that the same glorious faith which we are taught in the holy Scriptures of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament</hi> (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely the historicall circumstances thereof, as names and times, as that the Mediatour <hi>Iesus</hi> was to bee borne of a Virgine, <hi>Mary,</hi> and to suffer death under <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, &amp;c.</hi>) must be that very same faith by which all the
<pb facs="7"/> Saints of God were saved for above two hundred and fifty yeers before there were any Scriptures written. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that although this faith was delivered and reverently embraced by the faithfull before the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> who also so delivered it, as that they could not looke unto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nd of the law, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. Yet they who either received it not by tradition, as most of the Gentiles, or understood it not in the Law, as few among the Iewes did, beside the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, must of necessity through the light of reason alone hold with us some maine and fundamentall points, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which, if they lived in obedience, they might finde mercy, for that whereof they were ignorant, as it is said <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30 that God oversaw or neglected the ignorance of the time before Christ. For if the representative Priest, by forein bloud found forgivenesse for himselfe and the ignorances of the people concerning all punishment in this life: how much more might the everlasting high-priest by his owne offering of himselfe finde eternall redemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ion for their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances, who sought mercy of God, although they knew him not by whom they did obtaine it? yet might they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore assure themselves to obtaine it, because they could not seek forgivenesse but by his Spirit who framed their hearts to seeke it, and therby gave them an earnest or pledge that they should finde it. Compare herewith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18.20. <hi>Ioh</hi> 14 6. Now those maine points, of which I spake, which by the light of reason they might know, are these. First, that ther is a God infinite in goodnesse, in glory, in wisdome, in pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er, as it is manifest, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19.20. and elsewhere. Secondly, that this God the maker of all things, according to that goodnes, made every thing to an end infinitly good, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s farre as the creature could bee capable thereof. And that therefore the happinesse of man could not bee in this life short and miserable, but that his hope must bee for hereafter And therefore thirdly, that hee must needs perswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that hee was immortall, and that there was an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life, at least as appertaining to his soule. Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a mans wretchednesse is for the most part from him selfe, in the unlawfulnesse of his owne ill deeds, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb facs="8"/> from the bitter fountaine of his affections, and ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires tormenting himselfe: therefore hee must needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse his sinne against himselfe, and know that hee that finds himselfe so displeasing to himselfe, can no way hope, that for his owne worthinesse hee can any way bee acceptable unto God: and that therefore he hath no succour nor hope, but only in his mercy that hath made him thereunto, if he will, desire, and trust in his mercy. And thus far the reasons of the heathens, and the Religion of the Turkes doe drive them. But here that foolish Religion of the Turkes is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to stay, not holding it necessary to beleeve a Media<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tor: because (say they) God infinite in mercy made his Creature onely, because he loved it. Thus while they truely magnifie the mercy of God, they utterly forget that hee is Iust. Vnto which infinite Iustice of God if they had taken due regard, the same light of reason would further have shewed unto them, that the soule that sinnes must beare a punishment answerable to his sinne: And because by eve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry sinne against God an infinite Iustice is offended; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is impossible that any man by his owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse (which can never bee any more than by the Law of God he is bound unto) should bee able to make any satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for his sinne. Vpon which true principle it will follow necessarily in the light of reason, either that there is no possible returne to the favour of God: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion a man would by all meanes avoid; or else that the reconciliation of mankinde unto God must needs bee by the mediation of a man in every respect free from Sinne, who bearing the punishment due to sinners, might finde redemption and mercy for all them that would beleeve it, and live worthy thereof. But because all men conceived in lust and sinne are originally tainted therewith; for our of uncleannesse who can bring that which is cleane? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must the generation of this Mediator bee wonderfull and not after the common manner of all men; but so that no sinne or taint of the flesh must bee therein. So that being both borne and living, without sinne, hee might by his death become a ransome acceptable for the sinnes of
<pb facs="8"/> others. And although reason could not conceive nor finde how this should bee; yet seeing that in the necessitie of the divine justice it must bee thus; reason would as easilie yeeld that it might bee, as it did finde and see the creation of mankinde and the whole creature out of nothing, as by the discourse ensuing it will hereafter appeare. If this were not thus, how should the whole world of Infidels and misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers bee hable to the justice of God for their ignorance of him, for their neglect, and for their unbeliefe? So ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it as granted, till it doth further appeare by the Treatise following, that reason hath right good and necessarie use in the things of faith; it is too manifest, that these wretched times are such as seeme to call aloud for the publishing of some such worke as this: for though the fooles, that have said in their hearts, there is no God, dare not in words profes it; yet by their continuance in their sinful deeds they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime that their thoughts are so. Neither are they altogether wanting which say, that Religion is but a politicke inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to keep men in civill obedience: but if the conclusions of the Christian Religion bee inferred upon necessarie princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, then are they not made out of policie, as these Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists say, but cannot prove it, except they could also make it appeare that policie was able to make naturall reason. I will not denie that <hi>Mahumed</hi> setled his religion so, as they say; but hee forbids to dispute of the principles thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is against both reason and Scripture; and so perhaps it may bee said of those Will-worships that are, or have beene among other Gentiles, to whom God vouchsafed not the knowledge of his Law. But our most holy faith because it alone is true, hath no other author than God himselfe, who hath revealed it by his word: and because no man shall bee excused if hee beleeve it not, hee hath commanded reason, whereof all men are partakers, to seale thereto in everie point: but because in the Treatise before mentioned, and by the whole practice of this booke this thing is manifest, I will here turne mee onely to answer those doubts which may bee brought against the
<pb facs="9"/> perswading of matiers of faith by humane reason. First it may bee objected, that the matiers of faith are farre above humane reason, and that therefore it is a great presumption to question or skan them thereby: for it is said by S. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 11.33. that his wayes and wisdome are past finding out. I confesse, we know nothing of God, but what he hath revealed of himselfe by his workes, or by his words, for hee dwelleth in the light that none can approach unto, even as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speakes there of his calling and election to faith, a will unrevealed: but the Articles of our faith hee hath most plainely taught and revealed. And further to the argument, I confesse that humane reason turning it selfe to behold the divine truthes, is as the eye of a Bat to looke on the Sunne. But yet the eternall and infinite truthes are so apprehended by mans finite understanding, as the light of the Sunne is by the eye, that is verely and indeed the same light, and no other: for though the eye cannot receive all the light of the Sunne; yet that which it doth receive is truly that same light which is in or from the Sunne. But you say, that if in things of common use, as hony, salt, or any other things vegetable or minerall, wee must confesse our exceeding ignorance of their nature, properties and possibilities, both alone, and much more in all manner of compositions; it may seeme that our dulnesse may much rather be acknowledged in things divine. I yeeld not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to this consequence: for to the knowledge of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things, we have our owne witlesse experience to helpe us, and the deceitfull authoritie of mistaking men: but all those truthes whereon our faith relies, are grounded on the infallible rules of Gods owne word revealed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe unto us, for this end, that we should not bee deceived or mistaken. And although it was impossible for humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ever to finde out the conclusions and most fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points of our faith, as the mysterie of the Trinitie, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of God, the resurrection of the body, &amp;c. yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the cleer light of Gods own word made known unto us, we approve the same truth by the judgement and voice
<pb facs="9"/> of reason. So the reasons that are brought hereunto are not to establish any truth new or unheard of, but for that faith which was heretofore taught &amp; delivered unto the Saints; &amp; if the reasons of themselves be weak, and by their weakenes shew how mans understanding is dazled at the divine light; yet the conclusions stand sure and unmoveable: but if the reasons bee certaine and true; then questionlesse they are grounded in the Word and truth of God, and the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on true, either for the reason delivered, or for a higher rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which wee cannot finde. To this purpose the Father <hi>Anselm. de Conc. Gratiae &amp; lib. arbit.</hi> saith not unfitlie, <hi>Sacra Scriptura, omnis veritatis quam ratio colligit, authoritatem continet, cùm illam aut aperie continet, aut nullatenus negat. Quod enim aperta ratione colligitur, &amp; illi ex nullâ parte Scripturae contradicitur quoniam ipsa sicut nulli adversatur veritati, ita nulli favet falsitati, hoc ipso quia non negat, ejus auctoritate suscipitur.</hi> Yet you will say, that this endeavour is altogether needlesse, seeing the conclusion of it selfe is more manifest than the reason. I answer; The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the understanding with know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge: and if the eye bee not able to behold the beames of the Sunne, either direct from it selfe, or reflected in a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king glasse; yet it joyes to see that shining lampe when his beames are retract, or as it were broken off; as in water, a thin cloud, or a coloured glasse: so mans understanding not able to understand the glorious light of Gods holie truth shining from himselfe, for that is his garment; nor yet reflected on it by his word, a word, like the speaker, of infinite wisdome; yet takes it infinite delight to see, if it be but a glimps of that cleere light, thorow the thick cloud of humane reason, thorow which being refracted, it is better fitted to be looked upon: for because reason and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is more naturall to the soule of man, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and because the soule as every other thing, joyes in the naturall abilities of it selfe, therefore though the reasona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble soule doe beleeve what it is taught by the spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> instructing it; yet if that blessed Spirit vouchsafe further to
<pb facs="10"/> enable the naturall abilities, that it may see the reasons of the lessons taught, it triumphs much more therein: for faith is a supplie of reason in things understandable, as the imagination is of sight in things that are visible: now as the imagination takes the shapes, proportions, and distances of persons and places by their description, til it be better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the very sight of the things themselves; so the soule through faith embraceth the truth of that which is taught, and relies on the stedfastnesse of that which is promised, and this in full assurance and hope without wavering. Yet because the things beleeved are of so great importance, it is glad of the helpe of reason whereon to stay it selfe; as a weak man though upheld in his going by one that is strong and able to beare him, yet will not forgoe his staffe, which without further aide could not support him. Secondly, it is objected, that many learned men hold it not fit to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the things of faith by humane reason. <hi>Answer.</hi> The 19. <hi>Serm. of Athanasius</hi> cleerely refutes this opinion by many arguments. And I have knowne some able Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as they have judged their hearers fit thereto, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade even the chiefest points of our faith by common reason. And are not the <hi>Bereans</hi> praised <hi>Acts</hi> 17.10. because they examined the things delivered of <hi>Paul</hi> by the Scriptures? And is not reason the Scripture of God, which hee hath written in every mans heart? yet I examine not these things of faith, whether they bee true or no, as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did; but knowing, acknowledging, and to death holding them true, I bring all the strength of my understanding to approve them so. And although it be not lawfull for mee to handle either sword or speare; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I wish well to these holy wars, I have as a stragler brought my baskets of stones, whence the cunning slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers our <hi>Davids</hi> (if they please) may chuse what they like, if any uncircumcised Philistim, shall defie the hoste of Israel. And thereto they want neither reason nor example. For no man makes due account of the Holy Scripture, whose heart God hath not touched, and so is already won.
<pb facs="10"/> But there is none so brutish, which doth not willingly hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to reason. And did S. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> or elsewhere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Idolaters, perswade the worship of the true God, and Christ the Saviour of the world by the authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or by common reason, and their owne poets? beside <hi>Aratus</hi> whose words he cites, you shall finde that his speech is in their owne phrase and stile, and much of the matier in <hi>Plato,</hi> and in speciall his <hi>Phaedon,</hi> of the soules immortality. Did the valiant champions or Martyrs of Christ defend the Christian Religion before <hi>Ethnick</hi> Emperours, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures? Did the persecutor <hi>Dioclesian</hi> give any credit to the holy text, when hee commanded it to bee burnt? Did not the <hi>Apostata,</hi> nicknamed <hi>Idolianus,</hi> therefore forbid the Christians to instruct their Children in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Logicke and other liberall arts, because they woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Heathens with their owne weapons? because they defended their owne Religion, and shewed the madnesse of Idolatry, by common reason? The bookes of <hi>Iustine</hi> the Martyr, of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> of <hi>Arnobius,</hi> and other are yet extant: doe they defend the Christian Religion by Scripture, or rather by reason? by the innocent life of the Christians; and the infinite good which the Heathens themselves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them. Who blames the later writers, I meane the Schoolemen, <hi>Aquinas,</hi> both the <hi>Raimunds,</hi> and the rest? if their reasons be good, allow them, if ill, amend them. What man of learning, praises not the endevour of the learned <hi>Mornay</hi> concerning the truenesse of the Christian Religion? The Lutherans, I confesse, though learned, doe not every where like of this learning, because it strangles their consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation even in the birth. The Papists doubtles as learned as they, yet in this point are much more temperate. For though their transubstantiation cannot stand with naturall reason, yet they doe not therefore thrust the use of naturall reason out of Religion, but confesse Transubstantiation to be a thing miraculous and transcendent. Therefore let these declaimers and froward opposers against reason vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in their owne opinion; because it is knowne by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb facs="11"/> that none are so forward to thrust new doctrine and rules of life upon the Church by their owne authority, as they that gainesay both reason and authority. Other cavils like to these you may see answered note <hi>(a)</hi> on <hi>chap.</hi> 11. where for further satisfaction, the manner of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing is plainely declared. Thirdly, it will bee objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my selfe in particular, that seeing other men have handled divinity by common reason before, my paines herein might well have beene spared; And so much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because that I, neither a Prophet, nor the sonne of a Prophet, might (if any supply at least had beene needfull to their former paines) full well have let this burden alone, too heavy for my shoulders, for them to take up who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profest to divinity, might better have borne it. Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to heare: For I heartily professe that this taske had beene fitter for them to undertake, who had both more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and leasure than I to performe it. But if either they thought not hereon, or held it not fit, or that their paines were otherwise imployed; their greater and more profitable labours deserve more prayses. And though I have stood all day in the market, because no man hath hired mee; yet seeing I would as fame have the penny as he that hath borne the burden and heat of the day, I would not bee idle. But because the knowledge and study of heavenly things, and the meanes whereby the soule may bee saved, concernes all men alike, even <hi>Amos</hi> among the herdmen of <hi>Tekoa,</hi> asmuch as <hi>Azariah</hi> the Priest in the Temple of Ierusalem; And that every one as he hath received, so is hee bound to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his talent; Therefore although the burden I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, was more fit for a man in the strength of his memory and understanding and too heavy for mee now wasted in seventy yeares, with age, sicknesse, and continuall paines, yet I trusted in him that directed my heart to take it up, that hee would give mee strength in some sort to beare it. But concerning those men that have laboured herein before me, although I praise their paines, yet I thinke them nor fit for every mans use. <hi>Aquinas</hi> according to the greatnesse
<pb facs="11"/> of his active understanding in his bookes against the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, hath moved an endlesse number of questions, of which (as it seemes to mee) many are very needlesse and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to this my purpose, and would draw an English Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into a maze out of which hee could hardly winde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. <hi>Raimund de Sabunde</hi> though his writings be easie and quicke, yet his matiers are scattered, and not according to that method which I intend. <hi>Savanarola</hi> wanders up and downe, meanes well, saith something out of <hi>Thomas;</hi> but in his <hi>Triumphus Crucis,</hi> as in all the Schoolemen, and so in both the former, very many things are left our, which most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily belong to this our purpose, and many things brought in, which are not here at all questioned. <hi>Mornay</hi> though he deserves much praise for his great reading, and his plaine and easie stile; yet beside that which hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades concerning some few questions here moved, hee referres us to the Scriptures for proofe of the rest. A most certaine proofe indeed, and above all other with a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: but my purpose is to adde an overplus of proofe to the perswasion which the Christian hath; and to justifie his faith against all adversaries, not by authority of Scripture onely, which with Heretickes, Turkes, and Infidels is of small regard. Moreover that which he perswades, is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in a manner altogether inductive: which kinde of proofe, although it bee more usuall in the Scriptures than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, and is of force sufficient with them that hold the principles and maine grounds of Religion, for whom only they were written, and not for them who are without, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. yet with infidels or adversaries inductive arguments are of small force, except they be layd downe with their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position as I call it, <hi>log. cap.</hi> 14. For otherwise the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hath no foundation wheron it may stay it selfe. And he that in matiers of faith brings in reasons which are not of force to compell the understanding to yeeld to the truth, gives occasion to infidels and Atheists to scoffe at Religion, and leaves the wavering minded more unsetled than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: As I knew a young Scholar, who reading <hi>Euphues,</hi>
      <pb facs="12"/> refuting his Atheist by such slight inductions and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, onely probable, became much perplexed in his minde, till it pleased God by his light to settle his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. The reasons of <hi>Raimund Lully</hi> and his manner of arguing gives more full satisfaction; And hee it is from whose enlightned Spirit I borrowed most, because hee one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the rest hath written particularly to almost all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Creed: yet that treatise hath great need, both to be cleered, and of supply. And although for examples sake in his art generall, and inventive, hee handle some of the questions, yet while he strives therein to shew the use of his art, rather than the truth of the things, hee proposeth his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with great confusion, and exceeding difficulty to bee understood, as it will easily appeare to him that reades him. But to yeeld that, I tooke my light from those illuminate doctors <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Lully</hi> (for I seeke not mine owne praise, but the manifestation of the truth of God and the joy and comfort of the Christian soules among mine owne nation) was the light theirs? is not reason the common light of every man which can either finde it out, or see it being found? is the light in a Church his light that made the windowes thorow which it shines? what interest hath he therein more than any stranger that injoyes the light, yet knowes not the mason? But if my knowledge of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that is my reading of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> make the reasons his, then his reading of <hi>Aristotle</hi> shall make the reasons <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> from whom hee hath gathered his reasons, some where whole and entire, every where from his principles. And so if my reasons gathered from the practise of <hi>Raimunds</hi> art, or from his owne practise, bee therefore <hi>Raimunds</hi> reasons, because he delivered that excellent art, then the light shall be the Masons. But if they for their goodly buildings, made Bay windowes to let in much light: And I for my low, yet sure built house have made but casements and loopeholes, yet so disposed them as they may let in light enough to ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten every corner of my little roomes; Let everie one that is pleased come in and enjoy the benefit of the light, and
<pb facs="12"/> thereby behold the truth of God, and rejoyce in His light; And when hee understands the reasons; let him account them his owne, either to strengthen himselfe and others thereby against misbeleefe and doubting; or especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as shall either wilfully or ignorantly withstand the truth. And if I for my long and great study earne not so much as the name of a diligent translator, or an Abridger, or a gatherer hereby; yet if any man gather either profit or content, I shallbe glad, for the paines that I tooke herein, brought unto me an abundant reward. And having thus defended my selfe I will tell you, for what reasons I have at last taken heart, to discharge my selfe of my former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. First of all, when in the earnest thought of these things, I found that the holy religion of the Christians, howsoever tryed by Scriptures or by the cleere evidence of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, had such light and manifestation of the truth therein, as that all the darkenesse of hell could not dimme it I confesse I had such assurance of joy therein, that I jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged I ought not to conceale it alone. For what greater joy can any man have in all the miseries and discontents of this wretched life, than to know and see; that his hopes propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for a better life are such as cannot faile? then to see the exceeding mercy of God such, as that hee requires nothing to bee beleeved for which hee doth not abundantly satisfie the understanding, if it will enlarge it selfe, and desire to be satisfied. Is it nothing that the mouthes of all Hereticks are stopt hereby? I meane not every difference in opinion to be an heresie, no not in an Article of Faith, but there is not any heresie in any maine point, but by the strength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son alone, it may be overthrowne, as it will hereafter at large appeare. Besides when the Christian Religion is found to be so reasonable, and to stand on such sure<note n="*" place="margin">Fundamenta ejus in montibus Sanctitatis. i. Scriptura sacra, et ratioris. Psal <hi>87.1.</hi>
      </note> Foundations, as that it only is able, only worthy to binde the conscience of a reasonable man; whereas all other religions, or rather false worships, although examined in themselves onely by their owne principles, are found to be false and against com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense: what triumph is this of a Christian over all
<pb facs="13"/> Heathens and misbeleevers, that, will they nill they, if they will bee men, and stand to reason, they must confesse that the Christian religion is onely true. And seeing the world hath beene called to the marriage of the Kings Son, <hi>Luc.</hi> 14.16, &amp;c. First by the voyce of nature, declaring the wisdome and power of God in the creature, and that they that were so called would not come, because their mindes were set on earthly things. Secondly by the Law: but the Iew who sought righteousnesse by the Law, would try what his five yoke of oxen, that is, his keeping of the Ceremoniall Law, contained in the five bookes of <hi>Moses</hi> could doe, and so would be excused. Thirdly by the Gospell; but the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Gospeller and false Christian could not come, because he is marryed to pleasure, and worldly lusts; what remaines but that they who are yet strangers, and walke in the broad wayes of sinne and the by-paths of their owne inventions, should by reason, that servant of God bee compelled to come in? And seeing the time cannot bee farre off, that all the nations of the earth are to bee called to the knowledge of Christ; For great shall his name be from the rising of the Sunne to the going downe of the same, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.3. What hinders that the truth of Christ bee taught according to common reason, whereto every man doth listen? For it cannot bee but that all Idolatry and false worship, all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and dissentions about Religion must then cease, when the truth is taught in the evidence of that Spirit whereby e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is guided. For as God made man reasonable, so doth hee command nothing to bee done which in true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is not the best: nor require any thing to bee beleeved, which in true reason is not most true. You will say, is there no difference then betweene faith and reason? yes, very great. For Reason is busied in the proofe of some generall conclusion which is to bee held for a truth, and so received of every man; but faith is the application of that conclusion to a mans owne selfe. As if it be concluded, that because Christ being so conceived and so borne had no sin, and therefore he suffered not death for himselfe, but to save
<pb facs="13"/> them that should beleeve on him: faith applies this generall conclusion thus: but I doe beleeve, and therefore I shall be saved. Now this application is not made by reason, but by the speciall instruction of the Spirit of God in the heart of the beleever, although it were inferred upon such a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as was proved by reason. I have not endevoured herein to heap up arguments by numbers, but by weight, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have I let passe all reasons from forrein autority, and all that were but likely onely, and of small importance, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I brought any one, but such as seemed to mee suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of it selfe to confirme the question. The reasons here used are for the most part from the goodnesse, power, wisdome, and other dignities of God; because the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are concerning the things of God, and no arguments can be of greater force, and more immediate, then such as are drawne from the verie being or immediate properties of the things in question, they are handled by necessities, and impossibilities, to shew that all things that are, and are not, stand for the truth of the promises of God to us, that by all meanes wee might have strong hope and comfort in <hi>Christ.</hi> And though I sometimes bring one argument for divers conclusions, yet it is not therefore of lesse force, no more than a good toole is of lesse worth because it serves for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers uses. I have studied for plainenes as much as I may; and therfore have I sometimes handled the same reason both af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively and negatively, that he that cannot take it with one hand, might hold it with the other: &amp; for that purpose also are divers reasons brought, though all satisfying (as I thinke) yet perhaps all of every one not equally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood: but he that understands all, may upon these grounds or the like, bring many other to the same purpose, and give glorie to that infinite mercy, which hath so fortified this glorious truth which hee hath bound us to beleeve, with such walles, bulwarkes, ravelings and counterscarpes of reason, that all the power of hell, all the batterye of <hi>Atheists, Turkes, Iewes</hi> and other adversaries, shall never bee able to overcome it. And because a little light is soone lost, if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed,
<pb facs="14"/> as in the Starres called <hi>Nebulosae,</hi> and those of endlesse number and distance in the milkie way; I have proposed the reasons together in as short and few words as I can, that the light of the reason may more easilie appeare. For oftentimes while men desire to enlarge themselves, the reason vanishes into words. The autorities of the sacred Text I bring as need is, that the Christian may see whence the Article of faith in question is taken, and whereon it is grounded, and that in the proofe thereof I bring no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doctrine than the holy Scripture doth teach. Let no man carrie my words or meaning awry: for although in this search of causes and reasons, other conclusions offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselves, yet I held it not meet to propose any other things than the holy Church of old thought fit to be held as sufficient for the saving faith of Christians, conteined in the Creed which is called the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as being gathered from their writings, and that according to that order as it is therein delivered, yet with such prefaces and notes, as the necessitie of the things did drive me unto, leaving those other things to the higher speculation of them, whom God shall vouchsafe to enlighten for their further progresse from faith to faith, from knowledge to knowledge, till all the holie Church come to bee partakers of those things new and old, that are kept for her in store, when she shall come unto the fulnesse of the measure of the age of Christ; that is the perfect knowledge of all those things which our Lord in his time taught his Disciples, who were not able then to beare them, till they had received the light of the holy Spirit from above. If any man learned bee pleased to read in this booke, let him forgive me the harshnesse of my speech, being to teach the unlearned in English a language not taught that nicetie of words, whereby to expresse the difference of things, which I easilie hope he will doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee knowes that the infinite differences of things do much exceed the sharpnesse of our understanding, and yet the subtiltie of mans understanding doth goe farre beyond the rudenesse and scarcitie of all words and speech. The
<pb facs="14"/> Treatise, whatsoever it is, with all humilitie and reverence I submit unto the undefiled Spouse of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> my dearest mother, the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and if I have done any thing herein which is pleasing to God, or usefull to his Church, let the glorie bee given to him, by whose onelie mercie and favour I have beene enabled to performe it. But let his holie Church graciouslie pardon whatsoever is herein amisse through my weakenesse, or errour: And if any thing bee offensive; let it by her censure, be as if it had never beene written or thought of.</p>
