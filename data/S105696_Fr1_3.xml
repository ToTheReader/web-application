In his infelicitie let vs see our owne miserie, into which we fal by our wilful iniquitie, that sin as a serpent full of deadly poyson may be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of vs, that trembling at his iudgement, we follow not his misgouernment: We treade not in his steps, vnles we will be whipped with his stripes.

Last of all, in the happy reconcilement and returne of vs prodigall children vnto our fathers house, the church of the liuing god, behold the Lords goodnes, and the blessinges which in store the lord hath laide vp for all that doe repent, and come home vnto him,<note place="margin">

Thus haue wee laid togither in one summe matters of much price, the quintessence and dimensions (as I may so cal this hystorie) of al diuinitie, so as (to conclude) this treatise is a treasure house which leadeth vs not to a bare contemplation, but to a full fruition, not to the naked know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but the vse, not to the promise but the practise of the abundaunt and ouerflowing grace of God vnto vs most miserable sinners, vnder the parable and person of this man the prodigall sonne, in the sequell portraied and painted out vnto thee, which I wish thee to reade religiouslie, to meditate vpon fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and to practise such instructions as it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foordeth dutifully, and the Lord accompanie thee with his grace effectuallie.</p>
