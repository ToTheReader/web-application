   <p>HEre hast thou (gentle Reader) the making of holy water, and suche other of theyr superstici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous trumpery, faythfully trās<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into thy mother tong, whereby thou maiest see, what a derogacion it is against our onlye Sauiour Iesus Christ. They haue, &amp; do yet make me beleue, that they do it in remēbraūce of the shedding of Christes bloude, but when they make it vpon Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, then they can say, they make it to dryue Deuils away. If this be not blasphemy against Christ, &amp; hys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blud, I know not what is blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. They say to Salt, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

For if ye may make at your pleasure such chinges to driue diuels away, &amp; to heale both body and soule, what neede haue ye of Christ, of hys death, of hys resurrection, in whyche consist our whole saluation.</p>
   <p>And you that are vnlearned priestes, that vnderstande not what ye reade, whan ye make your holy water, this is partly setfurth for you, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> ye should take hede what ye do, for ignoraunce shal not excuse you, nor yet your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries commaundement, which ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
