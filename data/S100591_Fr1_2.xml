so comiyuge with all their holy water,
as to make of theyr whores honest mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed

watchynge wormes, that he made them

anō compelled by othe, or by the waye
of penaunce, to leaue their makes to the

   <p>Notwithstandinge we are throughly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertayned
by innumerable scripturs and

vnlesse they haue hym in preson. I haue
