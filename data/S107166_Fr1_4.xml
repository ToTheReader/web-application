   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not without cause, that the psalme speaking of the great benefits which GOD had bestowed vpon the Iewes, among whom was his Church at that time, doth cheefly magnifie the grace which he had vttered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in deliuering vnto them the sure rule of his seruice, the true maner of good life, &amp; the right way of saluation, aswell by the writings of Moses and other his seruants, as also by the liuely voyce of them agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their writings. For without that all the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and prosperitie which they could haue had, had beene but as records against them to haue increased stil the measure of their condemnation. Therefore hauing spoken of Gods defending of the gates of the holy citie Ierusalem, of his blessing vpon the inhabiters thereof, of the peace and quietnesse that was in all coasts about it, and of his carefulnesse in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing it with all things necessarie for the maintenance of the whole people: finally he setteth downe the principal point whereon the sweetnesse and assurance of all the rest hung, saying: He hath giuen forth his word vnto Iacob, &amp; his statutes and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnto Israell. And this benefite was at that time peculiar to the citie of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and to the people that came of Abraham, according as it is said expresly in the same text, that God had not delt so with any other nation, nor giuen them know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his iudgements. But we know that Iesus Christ hath by his comming made the same grace to extend to al nations of the earth, and that looke whatsoeuer he had promised by his Prophets in the holy scriptures, he hath performed it by his holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, who haue preached the Gospell faithfully, as their writings do autentikely, fully, and sufficiently witnesse. This aduertisement therefore belongeth as now to all churches of our lord Iesus Christ, in what countries soeuer they be, so as they ought to acknowledge Gods mercie in that he teacheth them familiarly and in such lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as they may vnderstand, by the reading and preaching of his worde. For so little ought the long interceassing of so great a benefite (inforced through the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Antichrist) to make vs to holde scorne of it, now that God renueth the course thereof againe: that contrariwise wee should thinke it the more sweete and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, praysing God for restoring vs the thing through his great mercie, which Satans vnderlings had wickedly bereft vs of: acknowledging that God had beene too sore prouoked by the sinnes of the worlde, when he punished it in such sort: and seruing him with such obedience according to his worde, as we may not prouoke him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, to vse the like vengeance against vs or our children after vs. And no doubt but this lesson is told vs throughout the whole Scripture, from the beginning to the end of it, and specially in the bookes of the New Testament, wherin the perfection of all learning is throughly comprised, wel written, and faithfully inrolled. Neuerthelesse, forasmuchas the books of Moses the seruant of god are as the fountain from whence all after cōmers, that is to wit both the Prophets and the Apostles, haue drawne wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you will not beleeue how greatly it is to the benefit and behoofe of the Church, to confer them with the other books of holy writ. And for the same cause hath God by his prouidence preserued them so woonderfully, from so many dangers through so long a race of so many hundred yeares. For there, besides other things, we see the antiquity of our faith, and that the substance of true religion hath alwaies been one, yea and that the very forme of it hath euer tended to the perfection that is fully and infallibly shewed vs in the holy writings of the New Testament. And in very deede whereas S. Peter saith generally of all the Prophets, that the faithfull do well to take
<pb facs="4"/>
heede to their wordes, that they may go foreward in Christianitie: it is full certaine that therin he comprehendeth Moses as the foremost of them al. And in asmuch as he wrote of Iesus Christ, as Christ himself auoucheth in expresse words in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of S. Iohn. it may well be concluded (according also as saith the Apostle to the Hebrues) that his speaking and writing was to beare record of the things that were to be spoken afterward, namely by the son of God &amp; his Apostles, as we reade them written in the new Testament. Now among the books of Moses, al such as can skil of thē wil easily grant, that as <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> is the last, so it teacheth whereto the other books tend, shewing the meane how to fare the better by them, yea and conteining as it were the summe of thē. Therfore it is very likely, that that was the cause which moued our welbeloued brother or rather good father Master Iohn Caluin, that most faithfull minister of the Gospell of Iesus Christ, to preach and expound the same in the Church, bicause that by his setting forth therof he should after a sort cōprehend the other next three also, so farre forth as the vnderstanding of them should be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the people. His sermons therfore were faithfully gathered in order, like as his sermons were which he preached vpon other books of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scripture, wherof many haue beene printed here already. And in the meane time til all the rest of his sermons may by Gods helpe be brought to light, it hath seemed good that these same should be put forth first in the meane while: the impression wherof should not neede any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation or preface, but that the long continuance of custome requireth it. For as many as haue heard true report of the person and skil of that good man Master Iohn Caluin, wil be sufficiently drawne to the reading of his sermons, by finding his name here set vnto them: assuring themselues that they shal not finde any thing in them, but such as agree with Gods spirite, that is to say profitable, good, and holy things. As touching the principall and notablest points that are to be found here, there might very well be made a rehearsall of them, to giue the readers some tast of the whole booke of the said sermōs, at their first entry. But forasmuch as it is better that euery man should hie him to the reading of them, and to heare the preacher himself speake as it were in his owne person, we purpose not to enter into such discourse, which might peraduenture be somewhat with the longest. Onely we will touch one point, wherof some word hath beene cast forth already heretofore: that is to wit, that this booke of Moses beeing well read and vnderstoode, doth shew sufficiently who they be that holde the true religion, and resolueth a question wherof men seeme partly to doubt yet at this day, and partly to determine ouer boldly after their owne fancie, against the expresse word of God. We speake not here of Turks, Iewes, Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins, and such other, which are commonly called Miscreants, or Infidels as they be in deede: but we speake of the nations which haue long time borne the renowne of Christianitie, bicause that through Gods gracious goodnes some signe of holy bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme hath continued amongst them, and Iesus Christ is professed there in name. We see then that there is great variance nowadaies. The one saith, that Christianitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that in seruing God, men should, or at leastwise may haue images, &amp; set them vp in churches for Christian people: the other side vpholdeth on the contrary part, that it is a vilanous defiling of religion, and an vtter forsaking of the true Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and a taking in of a bastard religion in steede of it. If men can finde in their hearts to heare Moses speake in this booke (as they needes must, or else be conuicted of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing God the Father and his sonne our Lord Iesus Christ who is very God and euerlasting life, and of resisting the holie Ghost:) he sheweth the thing which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth not in his other bookes also, namelie that God could neuer away to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued after that fashion, but euermore expresselie forbade images in case of Religion, and threatened his owne people with horrible punishments, if they held not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues contented with that single order, to rest thereupon without attempting any further. Were there no more but the onely text of the second commandement, it were ynough and sufficient. For (as Moses wrote in the twentith of Exodus, and hath rehearsed againe at large in the fifth of this present booke,) God saith, <hi>Thou shalt
<pb facs="4"/>
not make to thy selfe any grauen image.</hi> And to the intent that no man should vse any wrangling by standing vpon the particular, he addeth, <hi>nor the likenesse of any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in earth beneath, or in the waters vnder the earth.</hi> Moreouer, to shew that he will not haue men to yeelde them any part of his seruice, how little soeuer it be: he addeth, <hi>Thou shalt not bowe downe to them, nor worship them.</hi> Last of all he addeth a horrible and dreadefull threate, <hi>that he will take vengeance</hi> vpon the transgressors and their children, <hi>to the thirde and fourth generation.</hi> This commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement then is set downe in so expresse termes, that the matter is as manifest as may be. And therefore the lusty laddes that haue helde the people in error, perceyuing the great gaine which they and their bellies reaped, by this meane or occasion of mingling Images with religion, haue ouerleapt this second commaundement, and diuided the last commaundement into two, that the full number of tenne might be found there still. But besides this, Moses deliuereth so often expositions of it euen in this selfe same booke, and setteth forth so liuely and precise discourses therof: that if any man will not giue place thereunto in these dayes, this prouerbe may well be verified of him, that none is so deafe as he that will not heare▪ and that he is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preached vnto, which hath no care to doe well. For as touching the arguments which some haue alledged for that purpose in these latter yeres, although they haue beene oftentimes chafed and rechafed, yet are they so starke and stiffe for colde, that they haue no force nor might to giue any holinesse to Images in the Temples of the Christians, as hath beene well shewed to the forementioned gainesayers in due time and place, and shall still hereafter whensoeuer they list to giue eare. And as for vs, we haue on the one side, to continue in praying vnto God, that he vouchsafe to touch the heartes of the people and of their leaders and gouernours, effectually by his holy spirite, so as they may well vnderstande this point, which would be a good meane to appease Gods wrath, and to open a great gappe to the reformation that might insue from better to better. And on the other side it standeth vs on hand to strengthen our selues in the infallible certaintie of the holy Christian religion and true Apostolike faith, which we holde with the other holy Churches that are refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And as concerning this point, no doubt but it is an inuincible fortresse vnto vs, that we are able to shewe forth this thing from age to age: namely, first of all that the true Apostolike and Primatiue Church had no Images at all in their holy meetings, whether it were in Temples or elsewhere, ne willed the people to kneele downe to them, or to set them vp before them. That likewise aforetimes when the Church was gouerned by the Iewes, both after their returne from Babylon, and euen in the captiuitie it selfe, the good and faithfull sort did warily keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from it: that if yee mount vp yet higher, the true Prophetes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for crying out against Images and the manner of worshipping of Images, and the holy Kinges were well liked of God for pulling downe, razing out, and rooting vp the occasions of such superstitions among their people: that the good Iudges and gouernours had doone likewise before the kings: and that euen Moses himselfe (who was auncienter than any others that haue left any bookes of long time) spake of them after the same manner, and dealt accordingly thereto, bicause he had both the administration of the doctrine and the gouernement of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale together, which was not ordinarie afterwarde in others. Yee see then, yee see howe the true Catholike Church is on their side which follow the Gospell, whatsoeuer men list to say to the contrarie. And nowe that we be deliuered from outwarde Idolatrie, it standeth vs on hande to looke neerely to our selues, that our life bee agreeable to the purenesse of Gods seruice, so as wee shunne Couetousnesse (which also is named Idolatrie) ambition, excesse and vanitie of the worlde, taking good heede (as much as is possible for vs to doe) that no man bee withdrawne from the Gospell and the loue thereof through our vndiscreete dealing: to the ende it may appeare that whereas the disobedient doe seeke excuses and take occasion of stumbling, they doe it
<pb facs="5"/>
without any cause giuen on our behalfe. Furthermore the strange blindnesse or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwilfull stubbornnesse which is to be seene nowadaies in a number of them that cal themselues Christians, ought to make vs so much the earnester in praying, to the end aforesaid, that is to wit, that our good God may vouchsafe to worke so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the hearts of all men, as well great as small, Kings, Princes, and other gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, as their subiects: as the wretched world may not alwais continue at the A. B. C of Christianitie, without learning any further. We terme the second commandement an A. B. C, bicause it is and euer hath been one of the first and surest groundes of the true religion, and is (as ye would say) a necessary appurtenance to the first comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. For whosoeuer mingleth the worshipping of Images with the seruing of God, doth as much as in him lyeth, to set forth other gods than the true God. And it is a maruelous thing, that the world becommeth neuer the wiser for all the great number of punishments which God hath powred out, and stil powreth out to warne vs to come to repentance. For within these fiftie yeres, since which time God of his grace hath set vp the preaching of the gospell in diuers places: besides his sufficient smiting of the people of the earth with his roddes in former yeres, he hath also made them feele his scourges diuers wayes, in punishing their contempt of his holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Yet notwithstanding we hope that God (conditionally that we continue in prayer) wil one day shew by more aboundant effect, that he hath heard the prayers of his sillie faithfull ones, euen in this behalfe, and draw the rest of his churches out of the miserable desolation, which hath lasted now too long by reason of our sinnes. And hereof we haue good hansel in the furtherance that he hath giuen already to the gospell, notwithstanding that Satan hath spit out his spite against it on all sides. For albeeit that the holy doctrine doe sounde in the eares of the poore people in diuers places, the sacraments of Baptisme and of the Lords supper be ministred purely, the praises of God do ring shirlely to mens vnderstanding in the psalms and songs, and the father is woorshipped in the name of Iesus Christ our hope and the onely aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of wretched sinners: yet are there a number which hope, or at leastwise wish, that as the sunne hath been eclipsed this yere, so there might be an euerlasting eclips of the preaching of the gospell: but by the helpe of God and of our great day sunne Iesus Christ, they shalbe deceaued. And in the meane time while Gods kingdome may inlarge it selfe stil further out here below, we pray al such as are desirous to haue the vnderstanding and vse of the doctrine of this godlie booke of Moses, to take the paine to reade these present Sermons of the faithfull seruaunt of God Master Iohn Caluin: of whom like as the speeche and pen serued the Church as long as he liued, (whatsoeuer some Balaams bable to the contrarie:) so we beleeue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his writings wil by Gods help edifie al men continuallie hereafter. Moreouer it were a needles thing to warne men, and to pray them to take heede that they make not the Printer to lose the fruite of his labour, and his cost which he was faine to be at in the printing of this present worke, were it not for the greedie and vnsatiable couetousnesse that reigneth nowadaies in men of that trade, by reason whereof diuerse times they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerrun one another without any honestie or conscience. Surelie we had forborne to giue this warning, and had leuer to haue let the Printers alone to deale with their owne peculiar cases, as they listed among themselues, if it were not for one reason which inforceth vs to fall purposelie into that matter: which is, that in some places they not onelie print againe in such hast the bookes of that excellent teacher Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Iohn Caluin that were erst printed here, as it is pitifull to see the workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the imprinting so ill corrected: but also moreouer, some haue gone so farre, as to print in Master Caluins name the vnperfect copies which they haue gotten by peecemeale or stealth where they could come by them. We knowe not what they meane by it: but surelie they doe wrong both to the author, and to the Church of God. Yea and they open a gappe which may be dangerous in time to come, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer any man will foyst in bookes stained with wicked doctrine, to make them passe foorth vnder the name of a faithful seruant of God, as euery man knoweth hath
<pb facs="5"/>
bin done to diuerse ancient doctors of the Church: Insomuch that euen S. Paul war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Thessalonians to beware of letters &amp; Epistles that were made to run abrode in the Churches [vnder his name], as though he had been the very author of them. Truely, so long as it shall please our good God to preserue vs &amp; the Church wherein he of his grace hath made vs shepeherds: it is our duetie to find fault with such as wil needs father any other bookes vpon Caluin than his owne, or by their false additions corrupt those which he hath made truelie. But yet is it much better to preuent y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger aforehand, &amp; to eschew the occasions thereof as neere as may be. Wherefore, in Gods name we beseech all such as haue any written copies, specially of the said au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors sermons, not yet printed: to forbeare the putting of them forth, vntil they haue first bin duely conferred with the originals, which are here in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> keeping of one of the Deacons. And as touching them that are minded to print againe any worke of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> said author that is printed alreadie, we pray them to haue regard to the common profit &amp; edifying of the Church, rather than to the furtherance of their owne peculiar gaine. And here withal we commend you all to the grace of God. The Lorde Iesus be with you, who is of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> seed of Dauid according to the flesh, the verie son of the holy virgin Marie, the very Christ, &amp; God blessed for euermore as S. Paul hath expreslie written, and so haue we alwayes beleeued &amp; do beleeue all of vs. Amen. Deare brethren, we commend our selues to your prayers. From Geneua this moneth of Ianuarie, 1567.</p>

      <p>
         <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as our good &amp; faithfull shepherds the ministers of this church, peraduenture fearing to be ouerlong or tedious to their readers, do in the end of their preface made to these sermons, but (as it were glauncing lie) touch one point, which notwithstanding is of great importance for the poore straungers that are come into this towne: to our seeming it would be thought neither amisse nor strange, if we for our dueties sake, declared the thing somewhat more at large, which they spake in one word, cōcerning the printing of the sermons of our late good father M. Iohn Caluin. Nowe then, for the better vnderstanding of the whole, you must consider that from the yere of our Lord 1549 forth on, the late M. Dennis <hi>Ragueneawe</hi> being fled hither, gaue himselfe to the gathering of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons word for word, which M. Iohn Caluin did ordinarilie make: and that with such swiftnes and cunning, through the vse of certain notes &amp; shapes, as few words esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him euen from the beginning. Which thing when they saw which had the charge of the poore strangers at that time: although they had not any great sum of money wherwith to releeue the present needs: yet failed they not to take such order, that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> said writer was intertained after a sort with some part of the same money, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he might haue wherewith to maintaine himselfe and his small familie, while he gaue himselfe wholly to the gathering of these sermons, &amp; to the ingrosing of them faire againe afterward, because he shoulde spare no time to any other businesse than that. He vndertooke the charge, with condition that he should copie out all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons faire, into bookes of a certain scantling of syse whereby they should be made, which he should deliuer to one of the Deacons to be faithfully kept, as a peculiar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite belonging to the poore straungers, at whose charges the saide writer was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained. And forasmuch as afterward the number of the faithfull increased dailie in the realme of France, and many that could not heare the liuely voice of this good seruant of God in the pulpit, were desirous at leastwise to see the things in writing, which he preached openly, and praied to be made partakers of them: in that onelie respect and none other, the writer had leaue giuen him to deliuer copies of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer sermons were demaunded of him, to the end that such as receiued them at his hand, might profite themselues by the doctrine of them, howbeit vppon condition that the same should not afterward in any wise preiudice or hinder the poore, for
<pb facs="6"/>
whom the originall copies were carefully preserued (as hath beene said), that they might be printed to the common benefite of them all, whensoeuer it should please God to giue them abilitie, as was done afterward. By reason hereof some which had gotten out copies that came to whole books, taking oportunity of the liberty which our Lord of his infinite goodnesse and mercie gaue to the realme of Fraunce, sticked not to cause some of them to be printed, not onely to the great hinderance of the poore, who by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> meanes were bereft of the thing that belonged vnto them: but also to the disaduantage of all the faithfull, inasmuch as those copies were neuer ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked &amp; conferred with the originals, which are kept diligently here: which is such a deede as we know not how to name in one word, and therefore do willingly leaue the iudgement therof to such as see whereto it tendeth, and what sequele may insue of it. For if euerie man may haue libertie to print at his pleasure, al the sermons which he can pretend to haue bin so gathered, whereas notwithstanding they haue not bin conferred with the originall copies which we haue here: who shall let them to falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the most part of the true sermons by adding or diminishing, and by mangling or nipping of them after their owne fancie? It is well knowen that the abusing of the names of Gods good and faithfull seruants, is no new thing. If such libertie be giuen, &amp; men deale as they haue begun, in this cafe: what wil come of it, but that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> doctrine of saluation shall stand as it were at the courtesie of such as will make their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices flie through the whole world, vnder pretence of setting the name of this good man to the titles of them? For sufficient proofe whereof, and to the end it should not be thought that we do wrongfully &amp; without cause giue inkling of the things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said: we will briefly touch what hath bin doone herein a fewe yeares since: namely that there haue bin certaine men, who without any forecast, haue bin so bolde as to cause certain sermons vpon the Prophet Danyel to be printed, without vouchsafing to see the originall copie, or to be aduertised there of from hence. And to couer their whole doings the better, they alledge that their so doing was for the glorie of God. Yea marie: but that should haue beene done without the hinderance of other men. And it is a wonder to see how such folke dare boast themselues to be of the reformed religion. For to thinke that Papists are the doers thereof, there is no likelihood at all, considering the hatred that they beare to that good man. Therefore it is not to be doubted, but that they be of that sort which crowd themselues into the number of the faithfull, and of the reformed Churches, and will needs seeme to be great Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. But let all men iudge whether it be a dealing meete for them that feare God, so to filch away y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> things that belong to the poore members of our Lord Iesus Christ. And this thing bringeth vs to the rememberance of another deede, whereof we be constrained to make our moane likewise to the whole world, to the end that such as wittingly with hold the goods of our poore folke, may aduise themselues better than they haue done hitherto, and make amends as they ought to do. The matter concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them that print or daylie cause to be printed, or which haue heretofore printed the Psalmes made into meeter by M. Beza. There is none of them all but he knoweth right wel, that he cannot with good conscience, ne ought also to print them, without paying to our poore folke the thing that was promised and agreed vpon before they were euer once put in print, as all of them can wellynough tell. Yet notwithstanding the most part, and in maner all that haue had to do with that matter, would neuer yet pay aught of that which they ought to haue doone, for any thing that could be tolde them of it. But let them vaunt themselues to be good and faithfull Christians as much as they list: they shall not easilie make men beleeue that they haue so much conscience as the Papists had in that behalfe. For how ignorant so euer the Papistes were, yet would they neither take away nor withholde the things which they knew to belong to the poore. And therefore it is a great shame, that they which professe the Gospell, which resort to the Christian congregations, which receiue the holie supper of our Lord Iesus, and (to be short) which will needs be mustered in the aray of the faithfull, do no better bethinke themselues of the discharging of their dueties. Surely we maruell how they dare prease to the open Sermons, where they be so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="6"/>
condemned, at leastwise in generalitie. But it is seene by experience, that they be no whit mooued with them, but doe fall asleepe, insomuch that they thinke not that the great number of threatnings which are vttered against all such as behaue not themselues trustilie towards their neighbours, and against such as withhold other mens goods, specially the goods that are appointed to the poore, do concerne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Yet notwithstanding, howsoeuer any of them both doe take the matter, they shall one day be faine to feele to their cost, that whatsoeuer is doone to the poore members of the sonne of God, he taketh it to be done to his owne selfe, so great store doth he set by them. Wherefore it were nowe high time that all such folke shoulde looke more neerely to themselues and to their duetie, and not suffer themselues to be so caried away by their vnruly fancies and affections, which hinder them to make any conscience in withholding the poore folkes goods, and in turning them to their owne priuate vse. As touching some other sort of Printers, which sticke not to print againe immediatlie the copies that others haue printed at their great charges afore, and by that meanes doe bring to passe, that many good men dare not aduenture to print (among other things), a great number of the same authors sermons which are here, and belong to our poore folks: the warning that is giuen thereof in the preface of the said ministers, (notwithstanding that it be verie short) ought well to restraine them, and to make it seeme to the world, that there is at leastwise as much modestie &amp; honestie in them, as there appeareth to be in the wretched Papists that deale with the Art of printing. For they would be ashamed to haue it cast in their teeth, that they had incroched one vpon another. Thus much haue we thought good to adde in this behalfe, assuring our selues that none of the faithfull and of such as feare God will thinke amisse of this warning, which we haue bin driuen to make in discharge of our duetie, which ought alone to be a sufficient excuse for vs if any man should think that the things which we haue vttered are not material. But we hope that al men of good discretion &amp; sound vnderstanding, will iudge that we neither could nor should haue let slip so good an occasion as this, to warne such as print or cause things to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to do their dueties towards the poore. At Geneua the 12. of Februarie, 1567.</p>

      <p>IT falleth out well to the purpose, that when the former warning was ended, there remained a voide roome to put in this addition, which shall serue for a confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the things that were spoken concerning the former maner of dealing, vsed in the printing of the sermons vpon Danyel. For immediatly vpon the getting of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie printed at Rochell by Bartilmew Berton, in the yeare of our Lord 1565, he that nameth himselfe the first author of the putting of them abroade, gaue forth that they had bin kept as it were in prison by the space of twelue years or thereabouts, &amp; that the Author of them had suppressed them and held them fast locked vp, with such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like sayings deuised of his owne braine. But therein he sheweth sufficientlie by what meanes he came by those copies, which were neuer kept backe from any that were desirous to haue them, so it were but to reade them, albeit that they were kept from such as would copie them out to defraud our poore folke of the benefite that was lawfully gotten for them. And whereas he reporteth that the copie which he caused to be imprinted, fell into the hands of a friend of his: he shoulde at leastwise haue inquired how that came to passe, and by what title his friend made it his owne, so as he durst cause it to be printed. But it is apparant how great his fault was against our poore folk: and what pretence so euer he make, no man can doubt what zeale or affection draue him to do that thing. By the way, God grant that the Readers be not disappointed of the profit which they should reape of those sermons, &amp; that they be put forth according as they were gathered, wherof we neither can nor wil iudge, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we haue read them throughly, &amp; conferred them with the originall copies which we haue heere, which thing we will by Gods helpe doe ere it be long, that we may faithfully warne the readers thereof, against the next imprinting of them againe.</p>
