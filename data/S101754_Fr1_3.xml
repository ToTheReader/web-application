   <head>TO ALL THOSE THAT WISH WEL VNTO THE LORD IESVS and his poore

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the mercies &amp; goodnes of God (beloued in the Lord) towards
his deare Spouse and Church, hath especiallie manifested it selfe in
this last ruinous age of the world: So hath Sathan in these very times,
brought his whole munition into the field, with full purpose &amp; intent,
one way or other, to bring, either a ruinous fal, or a confused deformitie,
where the Lord intendeth to build his sure grounded and well ordered house:
And therefore all those, who haue giuen their names vnto the profession of
the Gospell, are to consider what it is, that thereby they haue taken in
hand. For as it hath bin true in all ages: so shal it be verified in
these our daies, that all shal not walk with the lambe for euermore, who
for a time seemed to bee of his traine. And alasse we knowe, that he
earnestly entreateth ouer many to open vnto him, who yet shall not be
partakers of the supper of the great King.<note place="margin">Reuel.
3.20.</note> For such is the deceitfull wisedome of mans nature, and
Sathans powerfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion, that euen professors themselues, neuer
want great and waightie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, why they should denie Gods opressed
truth heere vpon earth, that the Lord may deny them in that day, when hee
shall come, not to suffer in his members, but to judge as the most
magnificent King, and shal come in that glorious majestie, whereat heauen
and earth will be astonied.</p>
   <p>Now, because his judgement shall bee,<note place="margin">Luke
9.26.</note> (Go you cursed) vpon as many as shall be found, not onely the
defacers of his glory, but euen the deniers of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie point of his trueth and
worde, as the holie Ghost hath forewarned vs. Therefore, I thought it my
dutie vnto his majestie and his Church, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish this booke in the
Englishe tongue, that men and Angels may beare te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie against the
moderation and discreet wisedome of this age in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the trueth, that
the Lord hath made knowne vnto it, and that by many witnesses, what that
trueth, and what that worde of his is, which he will haue at all times, and in
this age especially maintayned by all men with out exception, that meane to
be partakers of his eternall fauour. The which trueth, as it is largely
contayned in Gods most sacred written word, of the olde and newe
Testament, so is it briefely set downe in this booke, by the whole
consent of the godly learned in the Churche of Geneua, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, by
that famous learned man, vniuersally reuerenced in Gods Church, M. THEODORE
BEZA. Out of this booke also, shall appeare, for what cause the Churche
of God is at this day persecuted, wheresoeuer the same be hardly
intreated. For this I may boldly affirm, that ther is no church or priuate man
at this houre, in any affliction for the maintenance of the trueth, but the
cause of his trouble is contained and defended in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise. So that
although all the persecuted Saints of God, now pilgrimes vpon earth, be not
included within the walles and narow dominions of Geneua, yet doth this booke
manifestly prooue, that as that Church is barbarously assayled by the
Duke of Sauoye within the boundes thereof, so is this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therein
professed, hardly delt with vnder their gouernment (though it may be they
are ignorant of it) who woulde be loath to be founde at the siege of Geneua,
or any wise to fauour such godles crueltie. And I would wish that this
were made knowne vnto them.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="7"/>And herby also it will be manifested, that there
is great cause why the estate of that now distressed Church shuld
be respected. For surely if there be any loue in men towards Christ
Iesus, laboring &amp; faynting as it were in his pore members vnder the
burden of great crosses and tryalls, they cannot shut vp their
compassiō towards him, crauing their help in the person of that poore
Church. I beseech thee therefore good reader, in the mercies of God, not to
shut vp thy compassion towards the same, and be assured, that the
Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus will for that thy kindnes say vnto thee, nay say of thee vnto
his Father, his Angells and Church.<note place="margin">Mat. 25.33.</note> I was
poore, hungrie, thristie, naked, sick, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged in Geneua, and
beholde this man enriched me, fed me, clothed me, visited me, and defended me
as farre as lay in him: wherefore come thou blessed of my Father, and
possesse thy neuer ending rewarde. I know belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that thou hast many
hinderances to do this in this backsliding age, but knowe yet that Mathew
saieth,<note place="margin">Ver. 33.40.</note> that it is a king, who requireth
this at thy hands, and will be exceedinglie angrie with thee to thy woe, if
thou deniest his request as he will reward thee most bountifullie to thy
comfort if thou graunt the same. And in any case take heed in this, as in
al other points tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thy dutie, of the wisdome of this age, whose
warines tendeth to noe other purpose, but warelie to starue and forsake
the Gospell. The shame, pouertie and discontent of the Gospell, I tell
thee is a glorious ignomynie. All the crownes in the world are not worthy to
stand in the ballance with the same. Thou art also to knowe, that the
Gospel is, whatsoeuer is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto wholesome doctrine, as the
Apostle teacheth,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.11.</note> and therefore, if
thou wilt stand vnto the same, thou must wholie cleaue vnto it,
otherwise, the fierce anger of the God of trueth, will bee against thee for
shrincking from any part of his testimonies. And thou must knowe, that
thou art not to choose what to defend, but thou art bound to maintaine
according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy calling, whatsoeuer thou seest to be oppugned by any,
be they frends or be they enemies of the truth. And thou needest not regard
herein, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer power opposeth it selfe against thee, for he
whose truth thou main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainest is no respecter of persons, but is
terrible as the Prophet saieth,<note place="margin">Psal. 110.5.</note> euen
vnto the kings of the earth, and thou shalt find, that in thy defence,
defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his truth, he will breake the great men in the daie of his wrath,
except they submit themselues vnto the scepter of his word. In
conclusion, (for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie is laid vpon me, that I cannot write what I
had purposed) say with the holy man EZRA<note place="margin">Ez. 8.22.</note>
vnto thine owne heart, and bee assured thereof, that the hand of God is
vpon all those that seeke him in goodnes, and therefore feare not, but his
power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him.</p>
   <p>Briefelie, that thou maiest profite by this booke, I craue of
thee to take this paines in it, bestow an hower a day in the reading thereof,
and in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after the first time, thou maiest well read it ouer
once euerye moneth. The which course if thou shalt take, I dout not but in
one yeare, thou shalt so benefite thy selfe, as there shall be no point
of waight in religion; wherof thou shalt not be able to resolue thine owne
conscience; and also to edifie others according vnto thy calling in verye
good measure. But in anie case take heede, that thy knowledge gotten by
reading, rather encrease, then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish thy care in the hearing of the
word preached. And thus thou mayest exspect for the blessing of the Lord,
vnto whom I betake thee, my selfe and all his, now and euer, Amen.</p>
