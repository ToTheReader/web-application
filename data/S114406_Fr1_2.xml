   <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>I</hi> Have penned this conference anent
ceremonies; short, that thine eyes
should not be wearied with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of it: plaine, that thy wits should
not be troubled with the understanding
of it: generall, because they are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in sundry treatises already hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
My purpose onely is, the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the simple and unlearned, to
guard their minds, that they bee not
drawn or stollen away from the truth,
by these common and deceaving argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which are much in the mouthes
of those who mind earthly things. The
speechmen in it are, <hi>Cosmophilus,</hi> that
is, a lover of the World: and <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
that is, a lover of God. The love
of the one of their two opposite objects,
either to God or to the World, leads the
opposite armies, whether of preachers, or
of professors in these decaying dayes. The
true badge of the lover of God, is, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
to plead for God and his cause:
although it should be to his worldly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.
The true badge of the lover
<pb facs="3"/>
of the World, is to plead for the World,
and the belly-advantage: howsoever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a fair (although a fectlesse) profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
That proverb proves now over
true, <hi>The belly is busie, and witty:
and it wants eares.</hi>
      <note place="margin">venter est in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniosus▪ ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter non habet aures.</note> Yee may perceive
many in this age among us, who draw
their wits from their belly, and their
wealth to it. So that; although a lowd
plain speaking truth do meet these belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted-men
in the teeth: yet they heare
not, they are deafe; for they have no
eares where their wits are. But the day
will dawe, when they shall be forced to
heare on the deafest side of their head. O
then, how careful should we be, knowing
the terrour of that day, to perswade men
to the love of the truth: &amp; to persevere
in it our selves, preassing to approve our
selves both unto God, and unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men: that so we may receive
that crowne of glory, that fadeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
when the chief Sheephard shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
   <l>
      <hi>Worlds-love</hi> the soule insnares in many woes,</l>
   <l>
      <hi>Gods-love</hi> the soule repairs with many Ioes.</l>
