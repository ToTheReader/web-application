   <head>To the right vertuous Lady <hi>Anne Drurie,</hi> all things for life and godlinesse.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Adame, this Psalme was preached not long since at <hi>Bury.</hi> Afterward some desired the notes, short, ragged, broken, vnfit to profit any Reader, witnesse (at the first blush of them) your Ladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: to whom though, for that you are wont to thinke somewhat of my nothing, I presume to send them, onely in desire someway to witnesse my thanks, to GOD, for his grace bestowed on you in the mysterie of Christ, and for your L. kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to me in that behalfe. I thinke of <hi>Sinaetas</hi> the Persian, who hauing nothing according to the fashion of his country to present <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> with, ranne to the Riuer <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and tooke both his hands full of water, and offered that. He was not much misliked, as for the necessity of water, so for the name of <hi>Cyrus</hi> which it bare. Foorthwith was it put to be kept in a golden flagon. The Scriptures are aboue allwater, and <hi>Dauid</hi> beyond any <hi>Cyrus,</hi> onely my vnmannerly hands may tincture, &amp; lessen account. The Psalme is the same that euer it was, which if I haue any way ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I thanke God. Howsoeuer, I wish the sweet fruite of it in your Ladiships hart, as I know God hath, and will more still there treasure it vp. Often pray this Psalme to God, and keepe these blotted leaues vnto your selfe. Serue them as they deserue. I were loth that euery body should know my rawnesse. Thus crauing humbly your pardon, I take my leaue. <hi>Bury.</hi>
