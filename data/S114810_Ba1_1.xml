      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>his contention (R. H.) vvhich I haue with the Metropolitan tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth all the realm: as the Creed is vsed in all houses: wherin I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to shew the right meaning of our Lords soule passing hence. As my paynes, all that I haue bestovved in England hath bene recompensed with extremity of badnes, by the Archb. his causing: so I looke that this paynes shall find no better interteynement. Only frō your honours &amp; the plain harted I looke for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. I beleeue that I haue handled the matter more clearly then any who before me wrote of it. All may well here consider a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Aggei, whether holy flesh yf it touch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean sanctifieth it, or polluteth it self: &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one heresy in the Creed be tolerable for the goodnes of the rest, or rather corrupteth the dignity of the whole: as one dead fly marreth an whole box of precious oinctment. How far the Metropolitans dealing hath bene from Lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning,

faith and comon humanity that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in my Epistle to him self: &amp; to what pas he hath brought the Q. honour▪ and how he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan this coyle to defeat my recompense for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations vpon Daniel, that wilbe made kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen by some of your honours to the rest, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my declaration. I seek no further revenge but this that I may have the Q. quiet Leaue to forsake her kingdom: to take a course among strangers for passage of my yeares few &amp; sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that are to come: which I hope shalbe more to myne own comfort, then those which I haue spent vnder the Q. of whome I had great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises tvventy yeares together: to hinder me from vsing other kingdoms benefit: But the strangest recompense (when I was bid be myne own chooser, &amp; referred the choise again to her highnes) that euer hath bene heard of. I will make no pleading: but refer all to him whom she tooke to witnes as she Looked to be saued, that she would bestow all the commodityes of Diuinity to best desert. She relied vpon the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan: but regardeth not how God will regard such a post. How I accuse him you may

read: &amp; more for hindering the good of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble according to the tenour shevved to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nours. Therin he may soon win a victory: Seing the matter is of so great difficulty that it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as great study as any hath vndertaken this 1000 yeres for the text of both testamēts, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the help of all the Learned of a Kingdom: all being directed to grounds manifest; Here a Metropolitā may soon hinder: but I am affrayd while the nation beareth soules to be saued the like offer wil not be again. His G. wil not fīd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the world that sēsibly defēd <gap reason="foreign">

      </gap> of the Ebrew text. VVhile some of his aduaunced teach that the text is corrupted, the Pope is sure of the other part of the Dilemma: That the Church not the word must rule. A sensible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of 848 Margent readings had bene worth thākes: how they note exactnes not corruptiōs. So the shewing how this: Adam Liued 230. &amp; begot Seth: VVherin Moses omitted 100. y. this note being admitted, disanulleth all Moses au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority 36. seuerall hūdreths. And any one mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all: this also had bene worth thanks. His G. neuer read two that yelded a plain reason whēce
<pb n="49" facs="31"/>
that difference frō the Ebrevv sprang: VVhēce Graecia, Aethiopia, Arabia, Moscouia vtterly de spise the Ebrew text: and some Papists too. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so our Bishops missing for 600000, yeres 215. make Moses Mother 257. yeres old at the Least when she bare him: and infinitely corrupt all the Bible. This should be amended and not concealed. These amendements and other full rare poincts deserued some thankes. But I cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēd thē to your honours care. My poore good will was ready: to haue wrought so much that the Bibles in English should haue ben the glory of all Diuinity of the west. Now I deem I shall neuer deal that way: but for some small parcel: as time fleeth and cannot be reuoked. Your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and the whole nation I commend to God: not minding euer to medle wher strēg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of the present religion is an haynous Crime, and saving from Gehenna, is persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as an haeresy. As your honours vvil be sory that this hath fallen out: so in the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement ye may take order: that no Bishop shall haue auctority but for receauing of his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues: vnles he can read and translate both Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments.
<pb n="50" facs="32"/>
How great hinderance his G. hath wrought it would make any hart sick to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think: &amp; it is better to be buryed then to be told. Least further harm proceed from such: I wish preuētion for the nations good: though I look for Litle to my self.</p>
