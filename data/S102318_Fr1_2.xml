IOHN COVENTRY, Sonne to the Right Honorable the Lord THOMAS Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> Baron of <hi>Alesbury,</hi> Lord Keeper of the <hi>Great Seale</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> my Noble and <hi>Singular good Friend.</hi>

      <salute>Honorable Sir,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Present you with these small fruits of my weake endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; not that I thinke by them to repay any moity of those great favours for which I justly stand obliged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; but to run further into your debt, I intreat you adde this unto the Catalogue of the former courtesies: &amp; vouchsafe to patronize his studies, to whom your tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honourable Father (whose life and happinesse shall ever be the subject of my prayers) through your mediations hath given the greatest encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements. My naturall inclination ever hitherto hath affected in all things, that secure obscurity which best befitteth mine owne unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; yet you see I have exposed my selfe to the publike view and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all men in a printed Sermon. It is no overweening conceit that I have of these meditations of mine, whereby I thinke them worthy of longer life than they had breath: But through their perswasions I publish them, who tell me that they may doe some good unto this holy and royall enterprize commended in them. Sympathy you know, Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sir, is of more force than nature: and if it be not too great a bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for a plaine Scholler to professe his owne thoughts; I must needs confesse, there is no publike matter that could have beene undertaken in our Church, that could have filled my heart with greater joy, than this now in hand. To which, as <hi>David</hi> once before the Arke, <hi>Adhuc, &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior fiam,</hi> so I may but expresse my true and hearty affection (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hearing every day how lightly by ignorance it is elevated) I care not
<pb facs="3"/> how ridiculous I appeare in the eyes of any other whatsoever. If to Preach, or Print, or whatsoever I am able to doe, may adde but one stone to the building; It is my ambition, and shall be my Crowne: my love to this cause, hath forced me with presumption to thrust my selfe <hi>(ut anser inter olores)</hi> into the Quiere of those many learned and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent men; who have in the place that these were uttered in, sweetly sung the excellence and worthinesse thereof. To whom if I can but (like the Grassehopper in <hi>Aelian</hi> upon the Lute) supply the place of a deficient Trebble, I have done enough. Your honorable name in the Frontispeece, will doe mee this advantage, That men will be preconceipted of some worth in the building, to which there is erected so goodly a Portch. Doe me therefore this honour, and daigne me your kinde acceptance; though what I offer, in your owne judgement peradventure may appeare meane and desertlesse. And if hereafter any things shall fall from me worthy the name, I shall repay this courtesie: and in the meane time remaine him, who desireth no longer to live, than he may pray for and honour, both you, and the whole Noble Stocke you come of; and gratefully continue,</p>

      <signed>Your Honours in all obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and duty, <hi>GYLES FLEMING.</hi>
