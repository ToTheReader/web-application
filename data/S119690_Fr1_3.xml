   <p>RApt in admiration (Gentlemen)
vvith the excellencies of our
English Poets, whose wondred
spirits haue made wonderfull the
workes of prophane loue; I gaue my
selfe ouer to the study of inchaunting
Poesie, in which, I so much the more
delighted my selfe, by how much the
farther I found me from attaining the
celestiall secrets of her soule-pleasing
Arte, and in that amazement, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

became an eternall Prentise to the
Muses. At length, finding Nature an
enemy to mine Arte, denying mee
those affections, which in others
make more then immortall the most
earthly imaginations; I betooke mee
to Diuinitie, in which labouring my
sunne-burnt conceits, I found Poesie
which I so much reuerenced, created
but a hand-maide to attend Diuinitie:
and that as Poesie gaue grace to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
subiects, so Diuinitie gaue glorie
to the best part of a Poets inuention.
Proude in this opinion, I made loue
to Salomons holy Song, &amp; dissoluing
my spirits in applause of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb facs="5"/>
sought to attract it within the
compasse of our most vsuall stanzaes,
which hauing done, (though worse
then Millions can doe) I commit to
your gentle censures. If the manner
displease, the matter was Salomons, if
the descant dislike, the plaine-song
was Salomons, if the lines bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smooth,
the words were Salomons, &amp;
howe euer set foorth, the inuention
was Salomons. Be Salomon then my
Rock, to defend me from the rayling
of the enuious; and my mediator to
purchase fauour with the curteous, so
shall the one kicke against the pricks,
and the other bring grace to thēselues
<pb facs="6"/>
in being gracious.</p>
   <p>This Song was not tuned for vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Musicke, but thought to haue
beene reserued for a priuate Consort,
onely nowe commaunded by those
which may compell, it is made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.
Sweet Gentlemen, let it haue
gentle passage through your eares,
that it may bee endow'd with good
hap, and I with good fortune, both
with your fauours, and all with your
prayse.</p>
