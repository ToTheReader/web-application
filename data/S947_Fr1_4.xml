Albeit my skill is not such as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, yet haue taken vpon me a Pilots charge, and in safetie haue set him a shoare, where his desire led him, vnto whom Gentiles (my hope is) your accustomed fauour to all strangers shall not be denied, being a Cauilere of fame: how plainly so euer you see him attired, yet accept him, and as a Traueller comming of good will, bid him welcome, and with fauour, peruse his honours in Armes gained, which I hope may in some sort delight you, if happily it prooue as I desire, he hath his wish. But (how so euer) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance

Abrupt faultes, he may vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly c≈çmit many, which if according to your accustomed curtesies you vouchsafe to pardon, and after his long trauaile, with careful trouble, to delight you, receiue but the least shewe of good liking, it is all he exspecteth: your curtesie is more then the cost, from which as you are English men and Gentiles allianate, so shall hee endeuour to deserue better, and shall in his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile hereafter, report of you as you are, and binde me his carefull Pylot, your Country man, through whose procurement hee is come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to your humble seruice.</p>
