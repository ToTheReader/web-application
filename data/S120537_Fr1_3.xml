   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a common saying, that an <hi>Exorcist</hi> may sooner <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure</hi> vp a <hi>logion of deuills,</hi> then <hi>adiure</hi> one of them out of his habitation: And as it is with bodily <hi>possession,</hi> so is it with the <hi>obsession</hi> of the soule: for although the deuill cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the <hi>soules dimensions,</hi> yet he will sit so neere it, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer admits him the least good fellowshippe, he shall not be freed of his company, when he is wearie, and with all his heart would shake hands with him. The <hi>Papists</hi> challenge all our Churches as false, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we can cast out no deuills; but the whole world knowes that they can doe it to the <hi>admiration of thousands:</hi> but for my part, I knowe not how they coniure the deuill from the bodie; yet this I dare boldly affirme, that where they haue gotten one deuill out of mens bodies, they haue admitted a thousand into mens soules: and surely, the deuill were a foole, if he would not change his roome for a better lodging: I am sure, that there was neuer any church that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured vp more <hi>heresies</hi> then they haue done; and as yet I know not one that they haue adiured, and sent packing into hell. No marueile that they haue need of strange <hi>exorcismes,</hi> for otherwise how should men be confirmed in their strange doctrines? these questionlesse haue bin <hi>strong delusions to make them beleeue lies.</hi> But if they please to admit of the holy Scriptures, we shall at the first resolue them of a double meanes: <hi>Math. 17.20.21.</hi> the first is miraculous, and for a time: the second ordinarie, and so remaines in the Church: the one is in the <hi>20. v.</hi> the other in the <hi>21.</hi> and this second meanes we haue: I am sure the Church of God may <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>fast,</hi> to deliuer both bodie and soule from the deuil. But perhaps they will say, shew vs whom you haue dispossessed? I answer, Prayer &amp; fasting are of the same nature that preaching and administring the sacraments: they being conscionably vsed, worke where and whensoeuer God pleaseth.
<pb facs="5"/>I doubt not but by the preaching of the word, thousands haue bin cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto the faith: and where men get the deuil out of the soule, he will haue small hope or comfort, either to enter or stay in the body: and so, no maruell the deuill holds them so strongly, and takes such good liking of them, that he will be at their commaund, to leaue the body, and ascend into an higher roome: for he is proud enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain such a motion. And though I deny not but we haue had some possessed among vs, yet I dare boldly say, the most haue bin of their owne making: Let them take the credit of their art, for questionles, a blacke art best beseemes a religion of darknesse, blindnesse, and ignorance.</p>
   <p>But to applie our Sauiours rule vnto our purpose: <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>praier</hi> are admirable meanes in the Church of God; not onely to cast out deuills and vncleane spirits; but also to fill the soule with the <hi>spirit of grace, and goodnes.</hi> And here I tremble to speake, and charge mine owne heart with exceeding great negligence, as often as I call to remembrance, the extraordinarie fasting and prayer of <hi>Arminius;</hi> especially whensoeuer he entred this <hi>mysterie of myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Gods eternal predestination:</hi> A point that hath troubled the Church of God, more then euer the deuill vexed that young man in the Gospel. This hath made many no better then <hi>lunaticke,</hi> cast o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into the <hi>fire of contention,</hi> and drowned numbers in the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of euerlasting perdition.</hi> Now alas, what good soule would not downe on his knees, cry with all his heart, <hi>Lord Iesus take pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> on this destressed world, restore them to their <hi>senses,</hi> deliuer them from these <hi>fierce fiers,</hi> and pul them out of these <hi>dangerous waters:</hi> often hath it bin in the hands of thy Pastours, but as yet they could not heale vp these brawles: surely it is, because we are a <hi>faithlesse</hi> and <hi>crooked generation:</hi> Long hast thou been with vs, and we haue had a large time of thy patience, and it could not be but that thou would haue brought it to passe long before this, except our vnbeleife had hindred it. <hi>Arminius</hi> hath taken in hand to worke this cure, but I feare he hath raised vp more <hi>spirits,</hi> then can easily be laid againe. Questionlesse, as our <hi>Sauiour Christ</hi> spoke of that kind of possession, that it could not come out but by prayer and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting: so no more can these <hi>dangerous spirits of error</hi> be quieted
<pb facs="6"/>and laid to sleepe, but by the prayers and fastings of Gods faithfull people. <hi>Isa. 58.3.</hi> condemnes all fasting to <hi>seeke our owne wills,</hi> and <hi>require our owne debts:</hi> it cannot be good <hi>to fast for strife,</hi> and <hi>to smite with the hand of wickednesse.</hi> Surely I haue heard, that when <hi>Arminius</hi> was intreated to defend the receiued opinion of Predestination in the reformed Churches, did so distast it, that hee broached in his readings the cleane contrarie, whereupon strange rumours were raised, that he was become a maine hereticke. It was <hi>Bezas iudgement</hi> of him, when hee was a young man, that hee would either prooue an admirable minister of God, or a dangerous enemie to Gods truth: These reports are not to be passed ouer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consideration; for though he seeme to cry downe the <hi>former ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> in a booke now extant: yet both the booke, and the rumours together, demonstrate that he sought an opposite wil to the reformed Churches. We denie not but that Gods true Church may erre, and so his will might not be against Gods will: yet for my part, I esteeme so reuerently of my <hi>auncients,</hi> and the <hi>truth admitted, defended,</hi> and <hi>propagated</hi> by them, that I dare not otherwise iudge, then that <hi>Arminius</hi> in fasting and prayer, sought his owne will: and therefore no maruell if he haue laboured to striue with that worthy man <hi>M. Perkins.</hi> In the beginning of his booke, he professeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but brotherly loue: yet I intreat you, obserue but the whole carriage of his booke, and see how he scannes euery word, exults &amp; triumphs ouer him, as though he meant to censure him for a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous hereticke against God. The man is dead, his booke is now his memoriall: and to my reading sauours of nothing more, but that he meant to smite this worthie man, if not <hi>with the fist of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> yet of <hi>hard censure</hi> and iudgement. This likewise may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in his <hi>followers,</hi> who beare a most deadly hatred to all that professe M. <hi>Calvin,</hi> and his best followers; and most shamefully rayle on them: the <hi>Papists</hi> shall find more loue at their hands, then a <hi>Caluinist.</hi> Alas, my brethren; <hi>is this the fast that the Lord hath chosen?</hi> No, no: the Lord would haue vs <hi>loose the bands of wickednesse, take off the heauie burdens of sinne,</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, <hi>deale the bread of life to the hungrie, bring the poore that wander into Gods house, &amp; not hide our selues from our own flesh:</hi> If wee would consider this, then would the Lord <hi>make our
<pb facs="6"/>light breake forth as the morning, our health growe speedily, righteousnesse goe before vs, and the whole glorie of the Lord embrace vs.</hi> The want of this, makes the Papists reioyce, and triumph to see vs, their professed enemies, to quarrell and strike at one another. Oh that I had a <hi>bodie</hi> to <hi>fast</hi> night and day! and a <hi>heart to pray</hi> that the Lord would reconcile vs, and make his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truth shine among vs, to expell that darknesse that makes the diuision! When my booke was in the presse, I intended nothing but the meere explaining of Gods ordering of sinne, and so make vse of it: but I could not in my minde be at rest, vntill I had attempted some thing, in this maine controversie. I acknowledge it might haue bin much better atcheiued by some of the <hi>Lords great Worthies,</hi> vnto the least degree of whose strength, I haue not attained: But being as yet neglected by them, I thought it better, notwithstanding my great weaknes, to say something in the loue of the truth, then to passe it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with silence. I hope it will put others in mind who are of greater abilitie, what they ought to doe: and I would to God my labours might serue as <hi>foyles,</hi> to shew the greater glory of their surpassing excellencies: or as <hi>courser wares,</hi> to make their <hi>finer stuffes</hi> more saleable and commendable. For mine owne part, I am so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that I put it in my creed, as an error that I will neuer beleeue; and I hope in God it is now at his height. Christian Reader, be not offended with my young yeares, to make thee distast my timely wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. I hope I haue keept me to Gods truth; esteeme that, and then iudge mee as thou pleasest. <hi>Consider what is said, and the Lord giue vs vnderstanding in all things.</hi>
