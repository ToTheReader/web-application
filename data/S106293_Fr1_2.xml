   <head>THE
PREFACE TO
the Reader.</head>
   <p>WHen that
great seruāt
of God, S.
Benet, had
in most ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
and deuout prayers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vp his soule vnto God:
two of his religious followers
(as reporteth S. Gregorie) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ignorant altogether of his
death, although in places far
distant, had the like vision.
They saw out of their godly
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
Fathers cel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e, directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the East▪ a most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
way, adorned with gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
Tapestry, and shining
with a multitude of innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
lampes, to proceed euen
vnto heauen. At the toppe
wherof there standing, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
person in a venerable
habite, and demaunding of
them whose way it was which
they behelde, they answered
they knew not. But he incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
said vnto them these
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>rdes. <hi>Haec est via qua di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
Domino coelum Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictus
ascendit.</hi> This is
the way, by the which Gods
wel-beloued seruaunt Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
went vp to heauen,
meaning thereby (as S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard
noteth) the holie Rule
of a religious life, instituted
<pb n="5" facs="3"/>
and practised by the same
Saint, by which not hee alone
was passed, as by a most readie
and pleasant way to heauen,
but whosoeuer of his followers
would trauell by the same,
should with like securitie, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue
to the end of a most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
iourney.</p>
   <p>The Author of this little
Booke (gentle Reader) I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doubt, but is verie well
knowne vnto thee, as also for
his learning, pietie, zeale, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
fortitude, &amp; other rare
and singular qualities, but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>speciallie for his pretious
death, he is renowned in the
world abroad: neither needeth
there any extraordinarie visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the sound and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Doctrine of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Church, is sufficient to
<pb n="6" facs="4"/>
perswade, that he is a most
glorious Saint in heauen: hee
being such an one as hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
a good confession before
many w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tnesses, and made (as
Saint Iohn saith) his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
white with the blood of
the immacula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e Lambe. But
because thou shouldest not
be ignorant, of the way by
which this valiant Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ, arriued vnto so
happie a Countrey, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
hath left behinde him for
thy benefite, and euen amongst
the least of his fruitfull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
for the good of soules,
had designed to publish vnto
the world, the description of
this most gainefull voyage to
heauen; be-decked with the
most pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ious ornaments of all
Christian vertues, and with
<pb n="7" facs="4"/>
the most pleasant and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
brightnesse of notable
rules of spirituall life: euery
one of which, may be as it
were a Lanterne vnto thy
feete, and a continuall Light
vnto thy steppes.</p>
   <p>This therefore doe I nowe
(deuout Reader) present vnto
thy sight, affirming vnto thee,
that which thou thy selfe
wilt not denie, as being both
true and manifest: that, Haec
<hi>est via qua dilectus Domino
N. caelum intrauit,</hi> This is
the way by which the wel-beloued
seruant of God N.
went vp into heauen.</p>
   <p>For in what estate soeuer
he liued in this worlde, hee
ranne the way of Christian
perfection, in an ordinarie
course of a secular life, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb n="8" facs="5"/>
from his very infancie he was
a spectacle to all that knewe
him in the state of Religion,
the which he imbraced from
his childehood; he was a rare
example of religious perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and discipline: and finally
in his manie seueral and most
cruell conflicts with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Christ, he sheweth
how stronge and vnconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the loue of God is, whose
burning heate neuer so manie
waters or gustes of moste
mayne floudes, may either
quench or smother: and whose
power the most power-able
thing of all, which is Death,
can not ouercome.</p>
   <p>Thou therefore (my deare
brother) heholding, according
to the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ortation of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious
triumpher, see thou
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>
imitate his faith. Fashion thy
life and manners according to
these deuoute rules, which are
a most perfect mirour of his
godlie life: &amp; in so doing, thou
mayest hapilie attaine thy self
to the like crowne of glorie.</p>
   <p>For though Martirdome be a
most speciall gifte of God, and
he freelie bestoweth it where
hee liketh, neyther is it an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
rewarde due vnto ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so great merites of neuer
so holie personages, and it is to
his excellent power a moste
easie thinge, <hi>subitò honestare
pauperem,</hi> euen from the
middest of a sinnefull life, to
exalt vnto Martirdome: yet
is there a certaine disposition
in those which are chosen to
so high a dignitie ordinarilie
required of God, which is
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>
first to haue killed their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
before they be killed by
persecutors; first to haue
beene exercised in a spirituall
conflict of mortification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be tried in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
of Christian confession;
first to haue become the towne,
butchers, before they be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
to the hangmans sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
Otherwise (as our Sauiour
saieth) <hi>Qui amat animam
suam perdet eam:</hi> Who so
loueth his life or soule disordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
shall loose it, and neuer
be able to stand in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batte,
wherein not flesh and
bloud, not pride, ambition, and
vaine glory, not malice and
rancour; but a mortified
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>inde, and a resigned heart
into Gods handes, obtaineth
the victory.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="11" facs="6"/>Which disposition and
ready preparation for this so
happy a crowne, was most
perfectly found in this our
Authour: whereupon iusued,
that he might truely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ay
with holy. <hi>I. B. Elegit sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium
anima mea, &amp;
mortem ossa mea. Desperaui
nequaquam, vltra iam vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uam.</hi>
My soule bath made
choice of hanging, and my
bones of death. I am become
desperate, I will now liue no
longer: because long before he
had hanged vp his soule by
perfect estranging of it from
earthly affections, and keeping
it fixed and ioyned to God;
thence did it pooceed, that his
earthly bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es, abhorred not
that death which was to be
suffered for Christ. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="12" facs="7"/>
he had wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hdrawne
his hopes from the base desires
of this life, therefore did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e
contemne this life for the loue
of this heauenlie life, and he
thought he had liued long
enough, when he might die to
liue for euer.</p>
   <p>Enioy therefore these rules
deuout Reader, and ioyfullie
treade the pathes of this most
pleasant way to heauen: and
if by the compendious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
thereof thou shalt see
thy iorney toward thy euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
countrie to be forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
giue glorie vnto God, and
vnto this his faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt;
and assiste with thy
deuoute prayers those which
haue beene meanes to prepare
it for thee.</p>
   <p>Yet doe I aduise thee of two
<pb n="13" facs="7"/>
especiall thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es: first, that
whereas in these Rules thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalt
sometimes reade, that
thou must doe this or that;
thou must not vnderstand
that worde (<hi>must</hi>) as though
thou wert bound to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of any thinge there
expressed, but onely that those
actions doe belong vnto the
exercise of perfection without
anie further bond, then either
the lawe of God, or holie
church do impose.</p>
   <p>Secondlie, that before thou
begin to practise these Rules,
containing in them great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
thou acquaint thy
selfe with an other Booke
entituled The Exercise of a
Christian life, or such other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
lest thou attempt to
builde a great house with
<pb n="14" facs="8"/>
slender foundation: and
climing to the toppe of a
high ladder; without pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by the middle steppes, at
vnawares thou receiue a
fall. Vale.</p>
