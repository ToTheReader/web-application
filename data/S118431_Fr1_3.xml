      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST Gracious, and most
Sacred Soveraigne, This Tyme,
and This Subject, doe joyne and meete so
vvell together, that it is novv, if ever; and
in this, if in anie thing, that I dare be bolde
expresse the desire I haue to doe service
to Your Majestie, and to my Countrey. I vvish the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
had not beene so faire for venting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> ambition;
but rather that it had lyen buried in my Breast, and I my
selfe had beene vnknovvne of Your Majestîe to my liues
ende. But <hi>GOD,</hi> vvho putteth <hi>Marches</hi> to <hi>Peace</hi> and
<hi>Warres,</hi> and <hi>periods</hi> to <hi>Tyme;</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>vho hath His apt and
<pb facs="3"/>
proper <hi>Instruments,</hi> for everie disposition of <hi>Tyme; HEE</hi>
hath encouraged mee, to offer to Your Majestie, this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,</hi>
as a necessarie, and vsefull <hi>Inter-course</hi> of this <hi>Tyme.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I did stryue, so much as I could, to make it short; but by
reason of so manie <hi>Histories, Discourses,</hi> and <hi>Examples,</hi> as
vvere to bee pertinentlie and profitablie brought in, I
could not confyne it to a more narrovv <hi>Compend.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And yet, vvhen Your Majestie shall consider it, it vvill
bee found <hi>minus mole, quam facultate,</hi> a great deale lighter
in <hi>Paper,</hi> than in <hi>Matter:</hi> For vvhy? It contayneth the
large <hi>Extent</hi> and <hi>Misteries</hi> of the <hi>Spanish Ambition,</hi> vvith a
<hi>Contemplation</hi> of the truest <hi>Contrapoyse</hi> to bee made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
by <hi>Neighbour States;</hi> Graue and Weightie <hi>Theorems</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
but vvhich fevv of them doe speculate so deeplie
as neede vvere; the greatest part beeing vvhollie carried
to things sensible, present, and of nearest commoditie to
them-selues in particular, al-be-it it should import a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
danger to their <hi>Common-peace</hi> and <hi>Prosperitie:</hi> vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the care, and curious mayntaynance vvhere-of, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can anie one of <hi>Them</hi> flovvrish by it selfe, nor yet the
most flovvrishing, long endure.</p>
   <p>Farther, <hi>SIR,</hi> Heere are contayned diverse <hi>Purposes</hi>
and <hi>Passages,</hi> touching <hi>The present estate of this Kingdome of
SCOTLAND,</hi> most expedient for avvaking Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
<hi>Subjects,</hi> to looke to that vvhich the great exigence of
this <hi>Tyme</hi> doeth require at their Handes; together vvith a
varietie of delicate <hi>Conceits,</hi> verie fit to season both the
Understanding and Humour of a young <hi>PRINCE:</hi> and
those not hatched in my Braynes, but sought, and sucked
by me, from the richest <hi>Hyues</hi> of <hi>Politicke Wits,</hi> vvhich haue
beene committed to <hi>Registers</hi> in anie Age gone.</p>
   <p>Heere also is contayned, <hi>A new Reason,</hi> brought from
the mysticall <hi>Theologie,</hi> for the holinesse and perfection of
<pb facs="3"/>
the number 10; and vvhy <hi>GOD</hi> did choose it to be the
<hi>Quotient</hi> of the <hi>Ecclesiasticke</hi> Goods, in the <hi>Leviticall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>So that if Your Majestie shall vouchsafe to reade it
once, I haue good hope that Ye shall do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> it tvvise, al-be-it
I knovv, that it is not Your Majesties Calling, to cast
over Bookes, <hi>Tu regere imperio popul. Rom. mem. hae tibi
erunt artes:</hi> but such Bookes doe belong vnto that same
Arte. <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> did counsell King <hi>Proleme,</hi> to
buy all Bookes vvritten, <hi>de regno imperio{que} eos{que} lectitaret,
quia</hi> (inquit) <hi>quae amici non audent Reges monere, ea in ejusmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
libris descripta esse. Alexander the Great</hi> did sleepe
vvith <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poësies vnder his head. <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> amidst
the combustion of bloodie Warres, did spende most part
of nights, in reading and vvryting.</p>
   <p>Therefore, SIR, let it please Your Majestie, to take
paynes, remembring hovve the same <hi>Homer,</hi> vvhome
that great <hi>Monarch</hi> did so affect, and vvhome the <hi>Philosophs</hi>
esteemed to be <hi>A source of humane Sciences,</hi> hee hath left
this <hi>Aphorisme</hi> for a King, <hi>Non decet Principem solidam
dormire noctem:</hi> A Prince must not take a vvhole nights
sleepe. A thing vvell proved by that <hi>Arch-Prince</hi> for ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
vvisdome, <hi>Augustus,</hi> vvho vvhyles at a certaine tyme
hee could not rest in the night, having his mynde loaden
vvith anxieties and cares of the State, hee sent for the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv
of a knovvne <hi>Bancq-ruptier,</hi> greatlie indebted, vvho
vvas reported to sleepe vvell.</p>
   <p>GOD hath called Your Majestie vp in-to this <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
of Paynfull Governament;</hi> not lyke vnto <hi>Helias,</hi> vvho
vvhyles hee vvent vp, too much delyted vvith the pleasant
vmbrage of the <hi>Iunopre</hi> Tree, hee fell a-sleeping there-by:
But lyke to <hi>Moses,</hi> to vvhome it vvas sayde, <hi>Ascende in
Montem, &amp; esto ibi.</hi> Upon vvhich vvordes, <hi>Esto ibi,</hi> another
<pb facs="4"/>
doeth vvell note, <hi>Non dicitur venisse, qui non steterit.</hi> Wee
doe not reade that <hi>Moses</hi> sleeped in that Voyage to the
<hi>Mountayne:</hi> It vvas a significant <hi>Hyerogliffe,</hi> vvhich the
<hi>Aegyptians</hi> had of a King, <hi>Oculum cum Sceptro,</hi> One Eye, and
one Scepter: Shevving, that Princes are to joyne <hi>Vigilance</hi>
vvith <hi>Power;</hi> and ought to haue <hi>Aquiline</hi> Eyes, able to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate
the hidden thinges of the <hi>Vulgar Valleyes</hi> belovve
them: Even as the <hi>Eagle</hi> doeth espy the <hi>Prey</hi> vnder him,
before him-selfe can bee perceived of <hi>Fowles. Nazianzen,</hi>
speaking of <hi>Governament,</hi> he sayeth, it is, <hi>Ars artium,</hi> to rule
a <hi>People:</hi> And <hi>Seneca,</hi> speaking of <hi>Man, Nullum morosius
animal, nec majori arte tractandum;</hi> There is not a more
enorme and insolent Creature than <hi>Man,</hi> nor vvhich is to
bee managed vvith more cunning. And, as <hi>Plutarch</hi>
sayeth, That as <hi>Beasts</hi> can not bee guided, nor commanded,
but by <hi>Men;</hi> So <hi>Men</hi> cannot bee governed, but by Him
vvho is more than a <hi>Man,</hi> and hath a great measure of
<hi>Deitie</hi> into Him.</p>
   <p>Certaynlie Your Majestie hath neede of <hi>Eyes</hi> vnder
<hi>Wings,</hi> as is sayde of the <hi>Spanish Cuttuio;</hi> that Yee might
flie abroade, to explore the manners of Your <hi>Subjects,</hi> and
malice of Your <hi>Enemies:</hi> to see that no <hi>Backe-doore</hi> bee left
for those to enter at, nor no <hi>Fielde</hi> commodious, vvhere
they may cover their insidious <hi>Nettes:</hi> but that the vvhole
<hi>Sea</hi> of Your Majesties <hi>Governament</hi> bee calme and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
vnderstanding hovv the <hi>Spanyard</hi> is skilfull to fish in
drumblie Waters. Hee can practise as vvell <hi>Protestants</hi> as
<hi>Papists,</hi> if hee finde them loose and vvavering. Which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Your Majestie vvill see examplified in this <hi>Treatise:</hi>
besides Testimonies of <hi>French</hi> Wryters, vvhich might bee
suspected of Partialitie, and malicious detraction, it is
verefied by naturall <hi>Spaniards,</hi> namelie, <hi>Antonio Peres,</hi> vvho
vvas a chiefe <hi>Secretarie</hi> of Estate, vnder <hi>Philip</hi> the second;
<pb facs="4"/>
and vvhose Relation in some thinges touching the sayde
King, and Estate of <hi>Portugall,</hi> I haue trusted, and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vved,
for tvvo respects: First, Because none could haue
knovvne those better: and secondlie, Because hee did
handle the lyke <hi>Theame</hi> to this, by vvay of shovving to
King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> the necessitie of making
Warres to <hi>Spayne.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Your Majestie knovveth, that it vvas a braue <hi>Embleme</hi>
for Kings, vvhich <hi>Cyrus</hi> had, of <hi>putting his foote vpon the midst
of a hard and dry hyde,</hi> vvhere-by he kept it close at earth: for
if he had set his foot vpō the borders, or extremities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the vvhole should haue revolted: to note the <hi>Golden
Rule</hi> of the <hi>Mid-way</hi> in <hi>Governament,</hi> &amp; forbearing of <hi>Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities:</hi>
and to shovv, that <hi>Kingdoms</hi> are never sure to <hi>Princes,</hi>
vntill they be in the middest of the <hi>Hearts</hi> of their <hi>People,</hi> and
guarded round about vvith their <hi>Affections.</hi> Your Majestie
seeth hovv the example of <hi>David</hi> is a perspicuous <hi>Mirrour</hi>
for <hi>Kings</hi> to looke vnto; of vvhom vve reade, 2. <hi>Sam. 7. When
the king sate in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round
about from all his enemies, he said vnto Nathan the Prophet, Beholde,
Idwell in a house of Cedar trees, &amp; the Arke of God remaineth within
the Curtaines.</hi> Hee resolved to provide for building of the
Lord's <hi>House:</hi> Therefore, can vvee not deny, Sir, that the
<hi>Orient</hi> of Your Majesties Reigne, doeth breake vp in just &amp;
holy <hi>Actions,</hi> in favours of the <hi>House</hi> of GOD, by setting out
a <hi>Navie</hi> against the mightie <hi>Enemies</hi> of <hi>Christian Peace,</hi> and
true <hi>Religion;</hi> and by vvhom the over-throvv there-of hath
bene so directly sought in these Your Majesties <hi>Kingdomes,</hi>
that numbers of vs yet liue, vvho did see their proude <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada,</hi>
put even to the parts of our <hi>Countrey</hi> for that ende.</p>
   <p>Your Majesties <hi>Intentions</hi> at <hi>Home,</hi> to restore the <hi>Mayntay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
and <hi>Splendor</hi> of God's <hi>Worship,</hi> doe argue the like zeale:
and vvho doubteth, but God vvill grant to Your Majestie
<pb facs="5"/>
the same <hi>spirit of wisdome,</hi> vvith <hi>David,</hi> rightly to choose your
<hi>tymes,</hi> for <hi>offices of Peace, &amp; offices of warres.</hi> The prudence, and
happie successes of <hi>Actions,</hi> doe consist in discret &amp; sure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of <hi>Circumstances.</hi> With a little <hi>Tyme</hi> &amp; <hi>Patience,</hi> your
M. vvill get your good <hi>Subjects,</hi> not only to contribute after
your <hi>desires,</hi> to the <hi>House</hi> of the Lord, to the <hi>Cōmon-wealth,</hi> &amp;
vvorks of <hi>Pietie;</hi> but to doe it vvillingly, as those <hi>Israelits</hi> did
vnto <hi>David, 1. Chron. 29. Then the people rejoyced, for that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
willingly; because with a perfect heart they offered willinglie to
the Lord. And David the king also rejoyced with great joye.</hi> And
then, Sir, their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> shall bee savorie vnto God, vvhen
they come not from <hi>Hearts</hi> dyed into <hi>Murmuration, Grudge,</hi> or
<hi>Blacknesse,</hi> like vnto the <hi>Swan,</hi> vvhich for the same cause vvas
anciently forbidden to bee sacrificed to the gods.</p>
   <p>I doe most humbly recōmend these my Christian <hi>Ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi>
to your M. <hi>patronage</hi> &amp; <hi>protection.</hi> If they be acceptable
to your M. I hope they shall displease none of your faithful
<hi>Subjects.</hi> If they doe not fully correspond the judicious
quicknesse of your M. great spirit, it is not my fault; my
smal <hi>Vessell</hi> could hold no more. The Lord, vvho is the giver
of all good thinges, and vvho hath sovven into your M.
Heart these Seedes of Royall <hi>Pietie</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> Hee may be
pleased to nourish them, vvith the daylie influence of His
Grace; vntill they grovv to that glorious and fruitfull <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,</hi>
vvhich they doe novv prognosticate and promise in
their <hi>Spring.</hi> That God, vvho hath set your M. over a great
and mightie <hi>People,</hi> Hee may blesse your M. vvith the true
vvisdome of <hi>Governament,</hi> the trustinesse of faythfull <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers,</hi>
the vpright loue of your <hi>Subjects,</hi> and a prosperous &amp;
