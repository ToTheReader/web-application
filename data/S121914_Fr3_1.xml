   <head>TO THE MOST EXCELLENT, VERTV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OVS, AND GRACIOVS PRINCE, HENRY, by the Grace of God, Prince of Wales, and Heyre Apparent vnto the most famous Kingdomes of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> All happinesse in this life, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Glory in the life to come.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which the Apostle hath seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deliuered in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Discourses, dedicated to your most Royall Parents, hee now in this last Treatise collects and conioynes in one, which ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of right can appertaine to none more then to you Sir, who being by them both the happy fruit of heauenly proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and deerest pledge of their mutuall loue and ioy, may iustly challenge interest in the smallest good ouer which their names are named. Sir, here is the way to that <hi>Crowne of Triumph,</hi> which the more you know, the more (I hope) shall you place your glory in it. Crownes
<pb facs="208"/> of earthly Kingdomes are indeede the gifts of God, but such as bring not so much Honour as they breed vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. <hi>O nobilem magis quam foelicem pannum</hi> (said <hi>Antigonus.</hi>) If the cares which dwell in the Diadem were knowne, no man would stoope to the ground to take it vp (said <hi>Seleucus.</hi>) And albeit, it be not giuen to all to know this in their entrie to Honour, yet are they all compelled to acknowledge it in the end. <hi>Seuerus,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the world, found his Crownes but comfortlesse to him in death, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, I haue (said he) beene all things, and it profiteth me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Not onely the teares of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> but the laments of <hi>Salomon</hi> may witnesse to all the world, that the end of the worme-eaten pleasures of this life, is heauie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure: yea, the golden head of Babell had at length worms spread ouer him, &amp; worms to couer him. <hi>Esa. 14. For all flesh is grasse, and the glory thereof as the flowre of the field:</hi> Onely, <hi>the word of the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures for euer.</hi> By which that same God who hath called you to be an apparant Heyre of the most famous King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes on earth, doth also call your Grace to a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine inheritance of a better Kingdome in heauen, <hi>which cannot be shaken:</hi> whereby aboue other Princes, and Rulers of the earth yee are blessed, if so be yee answere your Calling, endeauouring to be no lesse than you are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Principem te agnosce ne seruias affectibus.</hi> It is vnseemely in any, but most of all in a Prince, to become a seruant, eyther to the corrupt humours of men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, who creeping in into the Courts of Kings, like wormes into the bosome of excellent trees, doe nothing
<pb facs="208"/> but consume them: whom godly <hi>Constantine</hi> properly called <hi>Tineas &amp; Sorices palatij,</hi> subtile peruerters of the good inclination of Princes in manners and Religion, where they can preuaile: or yet to the disordered affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his owne heart, which if they be not restrained doe quickly turne the glory of a man into shame. What did it profit <hi>Cham</hi> that hee was the Sonne of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Monarch of the world, and Patriarch of the Church in his time; or that hee was the Heyre of the third part<note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> of the world? <hi>vitia siquidem voluntatis vicerunt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilegia naturae,</hi> his owne vndantoned will bursting out in contempt of his Father, brought vpon him that curse, and shamefull name, <hi>A seruant of Seruants,</hi> which was neuer taken from him. Seeing God (as saith the Apostle) is the glory of man, what honour can make that man glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, who carries not the image of God, consisting in righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teousnesse, and true holinesse? but especially a King, whom the very Ethnicks called, <hi>Animata Dei imago in terris,</hi> should carefully keep that Image which keepes his glory. Naturally <hi>facilius alijs, quam nobis imperamus,</hi> but in very deede he shall neuer be a skilfull Ruler of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who is not first taught of God to rule himselfe, <hi>decet eum qui alijs praefectus est interiora sua decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
      <note place="margin">Basil.</note> adornare.</p>
   <p>The best remedy against both these euils, is to embrace that wholesome counsell giuen by God to the Gouernors of his people, <hi>Let not the booke of the Law depart from thee, but meditate in it day and night, that thou maist do according to all that is written therein: turne not away from it to the right hand nor to the left, so
<pb facs="209"/> shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and shalt haue good successe.</hi> Beware of those <hi>Lucifugae,</hi> haters of the light, because it discouers the darknesse of their errours, <hi>Qui cum a Scripturis redarguuntur, in accusationem</hi>
      <note place="margin">Tertull.</note>
      <hi>Scripturarum se conuertunt.</hi> As the wise men follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Starre, were at length led by it to Christ, so if according to <hi>Peters</hi> counsell, <hi>ye take heede to the light that shineth in darknesse,</hi> not onely shall the day-starre arise in your heart, but that cleare shining <hi>Sunne of Righteousnesse</hi> (so named by <hi>Malachie</hi>) euer rising and neuer going downe, shall illuminate you with his bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And herewithal take to you the domestique exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of your Royall Father, who stands before you as a paterne of pietie, <hi>viuum omnis virtutis examplar:</hi> it shall be no small proofe of your progresse in vertue, and greatest praise among your godly Subiects, that yee be a follower of him. And so praying Almighty God that your happy deedes may exceed all that great hope which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of you, I humbly take my leaue.</p>
