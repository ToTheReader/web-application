   <p>The consideration hereof Right deare and dearely Beloved Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, hath caused me as at the first to preach these two Sermons, the <hi>one</hi> to the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> to <hi>your selues:</hi> so nowe to set them forth only and wholy to your selues, that as one of them was the very first Sermon that ever I preached vnto you since I came to be your Pastor, so it might re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maine vnto you for ever as a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my care of you, and not perish with me when I am gone as did a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good words in this kinde with my worthy Predecessor <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Wharton.</hi>

so often, and necessarily to be supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Vniversity</hi> as it is, perhaps I would speake thence vnto you more often then I doe, but since I cannot what I would, I will now do what I can, even preach vnto you <note n="d" place="margin">Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo manu &amp; scriptione Raynold. de Rom.

Beloved, a many of you are as desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to find <hi>Iesus</hi> as ever those womē were, especially in this age when so many Romish <hi>Sable Catholicks,</hi> so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny English <hi>Browne Schismatrickes</hi> so verefie our Saviours words, <note n="g" place="margin">Mark. 13. 21.</note>
      <hi>Lo here is Christ or lo he is there,</hi> as it is in Saint <hi>Marks</hi> Gospell.

   <p>Wherefore as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi>

<pb facs="40"/>
on the <hi>Left,</hi> this is the <hi>Word</hi> your cares haue heard, and I ingenuously professe that after so many yeares spent in this famous <hi>Vniversitie</hi> in reading <hi>Olde</hi> and <hi>New</hi> writers (you knowe whose <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 13. 15.</note> precept it was) if <hi>ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of the other waies, or any <hi>other</hi> had appeared vnto me better, for the better directing of your Soules, or doubtlesse I would haue proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it to you vpon the house top, hauing had so many opportunities, or I would at leastwise at this time haue vtterly abstained from printing This: a labour (beleeue me) not the least, and now as the world goeth not so necessarily to be vndertaken.</p>
   <p>J had purposed to haue put you in mind, <hi>of</hi> the place of aboad God hath given you, even in the eye of this <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie</hi> (the <hi>Vniversitie</hi> the eye of the Land) as though his meaning were you should be examples to all about you, how they also like you should

frequent his House: <hi>of</hi> Church-Service and of Sermons how they are both (if well performed) like <hi>Rahel,</hi> &amp; <hi>Leah</hi> (but <hi>Leah</hi> without a blemish) which twaine did build the house of <hi>Israel</hi> and multiplied the heires of the promised land: <hi>of</hi> being to be as loath to loose the <hi>one</hi> at any time whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as a many are or seeme to be, to loose the <hi>other,</hi> the profit being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable that accreweth vnto vs by either: <hi>of</hi> being much more hard to <hi>Pray,</hi> then it is to heare a <hi>Sermon,</hi> and therefore how it behoveth vs to come the oftner to shew our willing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse to vndergoe the greater paines in Gods Service: but I am now, even very <note n="o" place="margin">Octob. 15. 1612.</note> now, surprised with the newes of her death, who was vnto me in her life the only Iewel of this world.
