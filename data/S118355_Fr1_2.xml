                 <title>True relations of sundry conferences had between certaine Protestant doctours and a Iesuite called M. Fisher (then prisoner in London for the Catholique fayth:) : togeather with defences of the same. In which is shewed, that there hath alwayes beene, since Christ, a visible church, and in it a visible succession of doctours &amp; pastours, teaching the vnchanged doctrine of fayth, left by Christ and his apostles, in all points necessary to saluation and that not Protestants, but only Roman Catholiques haue had, and can shew such a visible church, and in it such a succesion of pastours and doctours, of whome men may securely learne what pointe of fayth are necessary to saluation.

   </opener>
   <p>I haue thought good to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to thy view these Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
together with the defē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of them; not doubting but
if thou peruse and ponder them well, they will
turne to thy benefit more wayes then one. First,
supposing thou neuer heardst any thing of these
conferences but in general, or perhaps hast heard
particulers falsly related by some who are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
affected, or misinformed; thou mayest by
this my labour be certified of the truth, and heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
enabled to do a worke of Charity, in freeing
others from ignorance and errour, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
such false rumours as thou mayst chance
to vnderstand to haue bene spread abroad, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in speach, or in print, about this matter.</p>
   <p>Secondly, if thou be not thy selfe already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
a right in matter of Faith necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
thou mayest gaine no small help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb facs="3"/>
a sound setling of thy mynd; first, in the
true knowledge &amp; belief of that One Holy, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
and Apostolique Church which is mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Apostles, and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed; &amp;
by meanes of it, in euery other article, &amp; point
of that true Catholique Fayth, which <hi>S. Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
in his Creed signifyeth to be so necessary to
saluatiō, that whosoeuer doth not hold it entire
(that is, in all points) and inuiolate, (that is, in
the true, vnchanged, and incorrupted sense, in
which Christ, &amp; his Apostles left it, as a sacred
<hi>Depositum,</hi> to be kept alwayes in the Church)
without doubt he shall perish euerlastingly.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, if thou be already rightly resolued,
thou mayst receaue confirmation in thy Faith,
and consolation, in considering how plainly it is
proued, that there is no other Church, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
Fayth, which can (with any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
colour) be pretended to be truly Christian
&amp; Catholique, besides that which alwayes was,
&amp; yet is, the Roman, or vnited with the Roman
Church, and Fayth.</p>
   <p>Lastly, hauing once thy mind thus setled, and
confirmed in the right Roman, Christian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
Fayth, and thereby freed from waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in vncertainty and doubtfulnes about any
particuler point of Fayth, thou needst not spend
tyme in endlesse Disputes about Controuersies
of Fayth, nor be alwayes reading, and learning
<pb facs="3"/>
(as many curious people be now adayes, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
cōming to setled, &amp; well-grounded know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
or beliefe of all points of Fayth) but mayst
bestow thy tyme,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.</note> as <hi>S. Peter</hi> coūselleth those who
be faythfull Christiās, when he sayth: <hi>Imploying
all care, minister yee in your Fayth, Vertue</hi> (by which
you may liue conformably to that Fayth) <hi>and
in Vertue, Knowledge</hi> (by which you may discerne
practically good from ill) <hi>and in Knowledge, Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi>
(from all that is ill) <hi>&amp; in Abstinence, Patiēce</hi>
(in regard there will not want some paine to be
suffered, whiles you labour to abstaine from ill)
<hi>and in Patience, Piety</hi> (or Deuotion, out of which
will spring spirituall comfort, inabling yow to
endure patiently all kind of paine) <hi>and in Piety,
Loue of the fraternity</hi> (or brotherhood, &amp; vnity of
the whole Church, not suffering your selues
with a preposterous piety of priuate feeling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
to hate, or separate from the cōmon Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Sacrifice, Sacraments, Seruice, Rites or
Ceremonies of the Catholique Church) <hi>and in
Loue of the fraternity, Charity</hi> (or loue of God;
which charity of it be well grounded, &amp; rooted
in your hart, it will doubtlesse mooue you <hi>to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>
as the same <hi>S. Peter</hi> further aduiseth) <hi>by
good Workes</hi> (and not by only Fayth,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> or apprehē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that your sins be forgiuen; or that yow be
iust, or the children of God, or of the number of
the Elect) <hi>to make sure your Vocation and Election,
<pb facs="4"/>
which doing, yow shall not</hi> (as the same Apostle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth)
<hi>sinne at any tyme;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
      <hi>and there shalbe ministred
vnto you aboundantly, an entrance into the euerlasting
kingdome of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus-Christ.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Some may perhaps meruaile, Why these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
come out so late, it being now long since
the Aduersaries haue giuen out false Reports,
both in speaches, and print? For answere herof,
it must be considered, that besides the ordinary
difficulties which Catholiques in <hi>England</hi> haue,
eyther to write for want of conuenient place,
tyme, commodity of bookes, and conferring
which others, or to print; there haue bene some
speciall extraordinary impediments which haue
hindred the same. As namely, that <hi>M. Fisher</hi>
was straightly charged, vpon his Allegiance,
from his Maiesty, that then was liuing, not to
set out, or publish what passed in some of these
Conferences, vntill he gaue Licence; which
made both <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> &amp; his friends to forbeare,
hoping (as was promised by him who deliuered
his maiesties message) that <hi>D. Whyte</hi> and others
were not to publish any thing,<note place="margin">L. K.</note> vntill they mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> should treate, and agree, &amp;
vnder their hands confirme what was sayd on
both sides; which his Maiesty perusing, would
grant licence to publish. The which meeting
<hi>M. Fisher</hi> expected a long while, &amp; once went
to <hi>D. Whytes</hi> House, to know what he would say
<pb facs="4"/>
about the Relation which he had set out; but
found him vnwilling to make any such treaty &amp;
agrement, nor would himself set out in print, or
writing, what he thought to be the true Relatiō,
as knowing by likelihood that he could not set
out the truth, without disaduantage of his cause,
or not without impayring, or at least not aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
his owne credit so much, as he desired.</p>
   <p>If any meruayle, why in these Relations so litle
is sayd of the secōd Dayes Conference with <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
Whyte,</hi> the reason is, because in a manner all
the speach of that meeting, was betweene his
Maiesty, and <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> who beareth that dutifull
respect to his Soueraigne, that he will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any thing sayd by him, to be published now
after his death, which he had so specially for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to be published in the tyme of his life. For
if this cause had not bene, it had bene also now
published as wel as the rest; there being nothing
in it, which <hi>M. Fisher</hi> should be ashamed off,
or by which any preiudice might come to the
Catholique Cause: for if there had bene any such
matter, <hi>D. White</hi> (who in generall tearmes doth
in his Preface seeke to disgrace <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> saying,
<hi>he vanished away with disgrace</hi>) would not haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to set downe in particuler some, at least
one, blame-worthy Argument, or Answere. But
of this, as also of <hi>D. Featlyes</hi> indeauouring to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
<hi>M. Fisher,</hi> by obiecting falsly-supposed
<pb facs="5"/>
Vntruthes, Contradictions &amp;c. more is to be
sayd in another place; and therfore not being
willing to hold thee, Gentle Reader, any longer
from the consideration of the first Occasion of
all this busines, I commit thee to the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Almighty God.</p>
