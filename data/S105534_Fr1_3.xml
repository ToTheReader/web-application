      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE (GENTLE Reader) set foorth to thy viewe, two Dialogues of the Reuerende &amp; renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Clarke <hi>Erasmus Rotero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus:</hi> whose learning, vertue, and authoritie is of sufficient force to defend his doyngs. But bicause I haue chaunged his eloquent stile, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our English phrase: and thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his liuerie, and embased the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite grace of his Muse, I am compelled to craue pardon of this my doings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider I beseeche thee (learned Reader) that if it had still rested in that Noble language wherein hee left it, although thy knowledge had yelded thee greater felicitie than this my trauaile can, yet thousandes, which by this mine inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour may draw out some sweete sap of these his pleasant and fruitfull doings, might (thorow ignorance) haue wanted thys peece of delyght. Therfore the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (if any be) is made to <hi>Erasmus</hi> a mā of that pacience in his lyfe, as I assure
<pb facs="6"/> my self that this my bold dealing with him, can not a whit disquiet his ghost. Harme to thee at all it can not bee, for that I haue not digressed from mine Author. Pleasant and profitable I hope it will be to many of my country folks whose increase in vertue I greatlye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. Then suffer mee I pray thee to rest with thy quiet and thankfull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whereby thou shalt vrge me to attempt farther enterprise (perchance to thy delight.) Thus assuring my selfe of thy lawfull fauour, I rest voyde of care of the vnlearneds reproche, if they beyonde their skill shall couet to chat. And wishing to thee thy full delight in learning &amp; to them increase of knoweledge, I bid you both farewel.</p>
