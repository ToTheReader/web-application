      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O sooner came this Sermon
vnto my hands, (the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
whereof for his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
zeale, worthily deserued the title
of an eminent Light and Ornament
of our Church) then I vowed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
thereof vnto your Ladiship;
Nor may it seeme vnworthy your
fauourable acceptance (the principall
aime of my expectance) in regard of
<pb facs="3"/>
that singular testimony which all men
that haue been conuersant in his
Works, doe giue of the Author, being
such a one as neither affection could
corrupt, nor affectation transport; but
of that spirit, as he was zealous with a
good conscience, making humility his
path to glory. Jn a word, (Madam)
his former Labours (now reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one Ʋolume) haue been euer coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
by some choice Patrons:
Nor may this (being equall with
most of the rest) claime lesse preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
then the rest. Thus wishing you
that benefit for which it was intended,
to the glory of God, whereto it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
