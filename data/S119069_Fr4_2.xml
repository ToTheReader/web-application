      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE store of a good Scribe is (according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour) both old and new; I would (if I durst) be ambitions of this onely honor; hauing therefore drawne forth these not-friuolous thoughts, out of the old Testament, I fetch these following from the new; God is the same in both; as the body differs not with the age of the sute, with the change of robes: The old and new wine of holy Truth, came both out of one vineyard; yet heere may wee safely say to the word of his father, as was said to the Bride-groome of Cana,
<pb facs="173"/>
      <hi>Thou hast kept the best wine till the last;</hi> The authority of both is equally sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, the vse admits no lesse difference, then is betwixt a Sauiour fore-shadowed, and comne. The intermission of those military imployments, which haue won you iust honor, both in forraine nations, and at home, is in this only gainefull, that it yeilds you leasure to these happy thoughts, which shall more fully acquaint you with him that is at once the God of hosts, and the Prince of Peace: To the furtherance whereof these my poore labors, shall doe no thankelesse offices. In lieu of your noble fauors to me both at home, and where you haue merited com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, nothing can be returned but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgements, and harty prayers for the increase of your Honor, and all happines to your selfe, and your thrice-worthy and vertuous Lady, by him that is deepely obliged, and truely deuoted to you both.</p>
