      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLE Reader, I confesse, as I meditated this Treatise vpon mine owne motion (as I doe sometimes matters of other argument, when my leasure serues me thereto) so also I doe not set it out to the view of the world vpon mine owne motion, but was desirous it should haue bin keept in, sauing that I must obey where I am bound. The thing that gaue me cause to this meditation, was, that I saw many times how meanly men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed of the Ciuile and Ecclesiasticall Law of this Land, valuing them by the practise of so much of them, as we haue among vs. And therefore I thought good, although not who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vnfold the riches of them, yet to make shew of them folded vp, in such sort as Mercers make shew of their silkes and veluets, laid vp in whole peeces in their shops; whereby it may be seene what great varietie they haue of all these kind of wares, although the goodnesse of the ware it selfe cannot be discerned, because it is foulded vp: Beside, seeing how frequēt prohibitions are in these daies in causes of either cognisance more than haue bin in former time, I thought it not vnworthy my labour to inquire and see vpon what iust grounds they are raised vp in this multitude; not of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour I haue to gaine say the lawfull proceedings of any court (which I reuerēce &amp; most readily acknowledge their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in all things belonging to their place) but to know and search out the truth of those suggestions that giue cause vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these prohibitions. For whenas such Lawes as are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="5"/>
of these businesses, are written indifferently as well for the one Iurisdiction as the other, no man is to be offended, if the one Iurisdiction finding it selfe pressed by the partial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation (as it supposeth) of the other, inquire the groūd of such interpretation, &amp; labour to redresse it if it may be, by the right interpretation therof: To the end that either Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction may reteine their owne right, &amp; not the one be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topt by the other, as it seemeth to be at this day: And that in such matters (as they cōceiue) of their owne right, as depend of no other authoritie but of the Prince alone: which is the thing only that is sought in this little Treatise. And therfore the Reuerend Iudges of this Land are to be intreated, that they will vouchsafe an equal interpretation of these matters as well to the one Iurisdiction as the other, for so it is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them to doe; and if they doe it not the other are not so dull senced, but they can perceiue it, nor so daunted, but that they can fly for succour vnto him, to whose high place and wisdome, the deciding of these differences doth of right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine. <hi>PENELOPE</hi> is said to haue had many wooers comely in person and eloquent in speech, but she respected none but her owne <hi>VLISSES.</hi> Such should be the mind of a Iudge, that whatsoeuer other apparance or shew of truth be offered, one saying this is the true sence of the Law, and another that; yet the Iudge should respect none but the very true germane and genuine sence thereof indeed. Which if it were religiously or indifferently obserued in euery Court, then needed not this complaint that now is, but euery Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction should peaceably hold his owne right, such as the Prince, Law, or Custome hath afforded vnto it.</p>
