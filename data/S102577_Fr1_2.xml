   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, GEORGE, Marquisse of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Vicount <hi>Villiers,</hi> Baron of <hi>Whaddon,</hi> Lord high Admirall of <hi>England,</hi> Iustice in Eyre of all his Majesties Forrests, Parkes, and Chases beyond <hi>Trent,</hi> Master of the Horse to his Majestie, and one of the Gentlemen of his Majesties Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; Knight of the most noble Order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and one of his Majesties most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Priuie Councell of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>Right Honourable:</p>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing it hath pleased God by so weake meanes, as my poore selfe, to haue his power and goodnesse made manifest to the world, as by this following Relation may appeare, I thought it my dutie to present the same vnto you, whom the <hi>Majestie</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath presented vnto vs, as our Patron and chiefe Commander of our Sea-affaires: Accept it then, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseech you, as an vnpolished worke of a poore Sailer;
<pb facs="3"/>
and the rather for that it exemplifies the glory of God: for by such men, as my selfe, your <hi>Honour</hi> must be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and <hi>England</hi> made the happiest of all Nations. For though you haue greater persons, and more brauing spirits to lie ouer our heads, and hold inferiours in subiection; yet are we the men that must pull the ropes, weigh vp the anchors, toile in the night, endure the stormes, sweat at the Helme, watch the Biticle, attend the Compasse, guard the Ordnance, keepe the night houres, and be ready for all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions: If then you vouchsafe to entertaine it, I haue my desire. For according to the oath of <hi>Iurors,</hi> it is the truth, and the very truth: If otherwise you suppose it triuiall, it is only the prostitution of my seruice, and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not bought in the market.</p>
   <p>Your Honours humbly to be commanded,</p>
   <p>
      <hi>John Rawlins.</hi>
