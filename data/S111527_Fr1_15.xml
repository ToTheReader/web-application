   <l>THy selfe a tendrer of that Golden-groue,</l>
   <l>To which thou send'st this golden Groue of thine,</l>
   <l>How truly that so called was dost proue:</l>
   <l>How truly this: it needs no proofe of mine.</l>
   <l>It is no gilt, it is a golden booke,</l>
   <l>Fit for that gemme thy Brother on to looke.</l>
   <l>The gold whereof, as pure as euer shone,</l>
   <l>(Let Enuie speake, she can it not denie)</l>
   <l>Feares not to touch the learneds Lydian stone.</l>
   <l>Who buyes this Gold, too deare it cannot buy;</l>
   <l>It is refin'd in furnace of thy braine,</l>
   <l>In fire then to trie it, were but in vaine.</l>
   <l>

Some say <hi>Prometheus</hi> man of clay did make,</l>
   <l>But beastlike passions put into his heart:</l>
   <l>Vaughan, beleeue them not, for they mistake,</l>
   <l>To make men was not his, but is thine Art.</l>
   <l>Thou hast effected what he ne're began,</l>
   <l>Thou hast made maners: maners make the mā.</l>
   <l>Gold-gutted <hi>Crassus,</hi> were he now aliue,</l>
   <l>Might here find gold to find an host of men:</l>
   <l>Rich-finger'd <hi>Midas</hi> might here learne to thriue,</l>
   <l>Not by his owne rich touch, but by thy pen;</l>
   <l>Which Chimick-like (I hope) wil turn to gold</l>
   <l>Our iron times, and make them as of old.</l>
