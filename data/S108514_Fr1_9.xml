      <l>Let Bees be praysed by that Latian Bard</l>
      <l>That sweetly sang their occupation,</l>
      <l>(Enriching with his song, his song rich nation,</l>
      <l>Himselfe with never dying fames reward.)</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>While thee we prayse with hearty loves regard,</l>
      <l>That hast set forth this sweet Flyes operation,</l>
      <l>With <hi>Maro's</hi> skill, though in another fashion,</l>
      <l>To thee thy Country men like fame anward.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Oh had thy Countrymen enioyd thee still,</l>
      <l>How many choise fruits had they reapt by thee,</l>
      <l>Which now death envies to posterity,</l>
      <l>What art-surpassing drops did heaven distill</l>
      <l>Into that graden where this plant did grow,</l>
      <l>And thousands more which natures hand did stow?</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The winged Citizens of mount <hi>Hymete</hi>
      </l>
      <l>(Forsaking once their flowry mansion)</l>
      <l>Flew down to <hi>Athens</hi> laden with sweet meat</l>
      <l>For infant <hi>Plato's</hi> mouth to feed upon.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>There did they turn his cradle to a hive,</l>
      <l>And gently buzzing, harmlesse busses gave him,</l>
      <l>Thereby presaging that his name should live,</l>
      <l>And that his wisdome from to dy should save him.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>I saw a swarm descended of that stock,</l>
      <l>Fly to our Authors tomb, from whence proceeds</l>
      <l>This posthume birth conceiv'd of heavenly seed,</l>
      <l>I heard the humming of that airy flock,</l>
      <l>Mourning his death; then swearing on this book,</l>
      <l>His fame as they should dure, their flight they took.</l>
