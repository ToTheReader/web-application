      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle M. <hi>William,</hi> that learned writer <hi>Rhenish Wine and Sugar,</hi> in the first booke of his Comment vpon <hi>Red-noses</hi> hath this saying: <hi>veterem ferendo iniuriam inuitas nouam,</hi> which is as much in english, as one Cuppe of nipitaty puls on another. In moyst consideration whereof, as also in zealous regard of that <hi>high</hi> countenance you shew vnto Schollers, I am bold in stead of new wine, to carowse to you a cuppe of newes: which if your worship (according to your wonted <hi>Chaucerisme</hi>) shall accept in good part, Ile be your daily O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator to pray that, that pure sanguine complexion of yours may neuer be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misht with pot-lucke, that you may tast till your last gaspe, and liue to see the confusion of both your speciall enemies, Small Beere and Grammer Rules.</p>
   <p>It is not vnknowne to report, what a famous pottle-pot Patron you haue beene to olde Poets in your daies, and howe many pounds you haue spent (and as it were throwne into the fire) vpon <hi>the durt of wisedome, called Alcumie</hi>: Yea, you are such an infinite Mecaenas to learned men, that there is not that morsell of meate they can carue you, but you will eate for their sakes and accept very thankefully. Thinke not though vnder correction of your boone companionship, I am disposd to be a little pleasant, I condemne you of any immoderation either in eating or drinking, for I knowe your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement and carriage to be euery way Canonicall. Verily, verily, all poore Schollers acknowledge you as their patron, prouiditore, and supporter, for there cannot a threed-bare Cloake sooner peepe forth, but you strait presse it to be an outbrother of your bounty, three decayed Students you kept at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending vpon you a long time.</p>
   <p>Shall I presume to dilate of the grauity of your round cap and your dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion dagger? It is thought they will make you be calld vpon shortly to bee Alderman of the Stilliard. And thats well remembred, I heard say when this last Terme was remooued to Hartford, you fell into a great study and care by your selfe, to what place the Stilliard should be remooued: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise you truely it was a deepe meditation, and such as might well haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemed Eldertons Parliament of noses to haue sit vpon.</p>
   <p>A Tauerne in London, onely vpon the motion mourned all in blacke, and forbare to girt her temples with iuie, because the grandam of good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship was like to depart from among them. And I wonder very much, that you <hi>Sampsownd</hi> not your selfe into a consumption with the profound cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Diu viuas in amore iocisque,</hi> whatsoeuer you doe, beware of keeping dyet. Sloth is a sinne, and one sinne (as one poyson) must bee expelled with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What can he doe better that hath nothing to doe, than fall a drinking to keepe him from idlenes?</p>

   <p>In earnest thus: There is a <hi>Doctor and his Fart,</hi> that haue kept a foule stinking stirre in Paules Churchyard: I cry him mercie I slaundred him, he is scarse a Doctor till he hath done his Acts: this dodipoule, this d<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

   <p>What say you Maister <hi>Apis Lapis,</hi> will you wirh your eloquence and credit shield me from Carpers? Haue you any odde shreds of Latine to make this lettermunger a Cockescombe off?</p>
   <p>It stands you in hand to arme your selfe against him, for he speaks against Conny-catchers, and you are a Connycatcher, as Connycatching is diuided into three parts, the <hi>Verser,</hi> the <hi>Setter,</hi> and the <hi>Barnacle.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>A <hi>Setter,</hi> I am sure you are not, for you are no Musitian: nor a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> for you neuer were of the order of the Barnardines: but the <hi>Verser,</hi> I cannot acquite you of, for M. <hi>Vaux</hi> of <hi>Lambeth</hi> brings in sore euidence of a breakefast you wonne of him one morning at an vnlawfull game called riming. What lies not in you to amend play the <hi>Doctor</hi> and defend.</p>

I pray aske them the question in my absence, whether such a man as I haue describde this <hi>Epistler</hi> to be, one that hath a good handsome pickerdeuant, and a pretty leg to study the Ciuill Law with, that hath made many proper rimes of the old Cutte in his daies, and deserued infinitely of the state by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling himselfe and his two brothers in euery booke he writes: whether (I say) such a famous piller of the Presse, now in the fourteenth or fifteenth yeare of the raigne of his Rhetoricke, giuing money to haue this his illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Pamphlet of Letters printed (whereas others haue money giuen them to suffer themselues to come in Print) it is not to bee counted as flat simony, and be liable to one and <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
