   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou first directed and taught me, how to teach you; I learned from you, not from my Bookes, what questions to instruct you in, by observing your misconceits of the first &amp; necessary grounds of faith, and accordingly I have framed this short Catechisme: Many other points are needfull for you, as to understand the Creed, because else you cannot beleeve it: and the ten Commandements, els you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know your sinnes, nor your duties: and also the Lords Prayer, els you cannot tell
<pb facs="3"/>how to pray: But for help heerein, I referre you to some short Catechisme, where these Heads are expounded. Now that you may profit by this take these directions: <hi>1.</hi> Learn by heart the places of Scripture brought for proofes, and ponder them in thy mind, till thou understandest how they proove the point for which they are alledged. This will help thy understanding; for it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to say the words, unlesse thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the matter. <hi>2.</hi> Observe by the order of the parts, how and in what order God doth save men by Christ and be you sure to goe that way. <hi>3.</hi> Observe that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nt of Life and Peace in Christ, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith do goe before the use of the Sacrament, as the Grant or conveyance of Land, doth before the sealing: and therfore you must first be in covenant with God, ere you can have right to, or benefit by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <hi>4.</hi> For the great duty of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your selves, doe thus: Lay the signe of triall before thee, and then aske thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, Is it thus and thus with my soule? For example for triall of thy faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, put thy selfe to the question: How
<pb facs="3"/>long have I had faith? Have I indeed been wrought upon by the word of God? What change do I finde in my selfe since I was a beleever? Spread all thy sinnes before thee, and then demand, Soul how do I like of this or that sin? Do I make conscience of it? or am I willing to enjoy it longer? to make excuses, and find pretences for the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it? So for obedience and charity, examine thy selfe thus; Do I desire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to know, and doe Gods will in all things? Or am I willing to hide mine cies from this or that daty, and to shift it off? Do I love the godly because they be godly? Or can I sco<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ne, mock, and despite them? Deale faithfully with thy poore soule in this duty of examination and triall remembring that before the act of receiving, thou doest confesse thy sinnes, and professe before God and that Congregation, that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them is grievous unto thee, and the burden intolerable: doe not now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble with God and men: be sure of this, that if thou bring not grace, the Sacrament will put none into thee. He that comes a Iuaas, shall go a Iudas: he that comes an
<pb facs="4"/>unbeleever, or ignorant, or impenitent, shall goe away so as he came, may in worse case then he came. <hi>5.</hi> And lastly, Labour for distinct knowledge in matters of salvation, content not thy selfe with ungreauded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, as I thinke so, and I hope so. Build not on the sand, but be thou an hearer and a doer of the word, so shalt thou be able to day hold on eternall life. Amen.</p>
