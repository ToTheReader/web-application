      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho but behelde the one</hi> syde of <hi>Ianus</hi>: woulde hardlie iudge that he were so rare mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaped. And who but viewed the vpper part of a <hi>Siren</hi>: would think she were a whole womā incorporat. So who but readeth the beginning of a booke: can giue no iudgement of the sequell ensuing. The Fryer in the midle of his sermon, cryed the best was behind: and I hauing tolde you a peece of a tale, say the finest follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth. So, if that you beholde <hi>Ianus</hi> perfectly: you shall see his deformednesse, and if you see all partes of the <hi>Siren</hi>: you shall finde the alteration, lykewise if you reade all the booke: you shall not be deluded by (the best is behinde) but so to reprehend mine excuse. The Printer (you will say) hath painted it full of Pictures, to make it be bought the better: and I say the matter is more meritorious, and therefore you should buy it the sooner. So, if you wyll be ruled by the Printer and me: you shall at no tyme want any of the Bookes.</p>
   <p>The homelyest house, may be hansome within: the simplest Garden, may haue Flowers woorth the smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and a weather beaten Bulwarke, may hold out the bolde blowes of a well wintered Soldier. Many a good Captayne, may goe in a playne coate, and many an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man, may walke simply arayde. Therefore, the

homlynesse of the house, dooth not reprehend the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnesse, the symplenesse of the Garden, condempne the sweet sent of the Flowers, nor the Bulwark disbase the stoutnes of the Soldier, lykewise, the playne coate of the Captaine dooth not diminish his manhood: nor the meane aray of the Citizen, impayre any of his honesty: Neyther dooth the bluntnes of my Booke, altogether condempne me: nor the meane methode of the matter, diminish any iot of the good wyll of the Author, you can haue no more of a Catte but her skyn: nor of me more then I am able to doo. Well, I wyll not trouble you with wresting many woords, nor hinder you from hearing that which ensueth: you haue free entraunce into the Orchard, pluck where you please, looue where you lyke, and fancy where you finde fyttest.</p>
