      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a way (saith M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Askame</hi>)
touched in the first booke of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero
de Oratore,</hi>
      <note place="margin">M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
         <hi>Askame</hi> 1. Booke page 1</note> which wisely
brought into Schooles, truely
taught, &amp; constantly vsed would
not onely take wholly away that
butcherly feare in making La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
but would also with ease and pleasure, and in
short time as I know by good experience, worke a
true choise and placing of words, a right ordering of
sentences, an easie vnderstanding of the tongues, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse
to speake, a facilitie to write, a true iudgement
both of his owne, and other mens doings, what
tongue so euer he doth vse.</p>
   <p>This way, as he sheweth, is by causing the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
first to vnderstand the matter which he learneth:
secondly, to construe truely: thirdly, to parse exactly:
fourthly, to translate into English plainely: fiftly, to
translate out of the English into the Latine of the
<pb facs="14"/>
Author againe: and so after to compare with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
how neere he came vnto it. Finally, by much
translating both wayes, chiefely out of the English
into Latine, as hee setteth downe in the beginning of
his second booke; and hereby hee saw those strange
experiments of the increase of learning, which hee
reporteth of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Iohn Whitney,</hi> and others. Now,
whereas these things are very hard to bee performed
in the common schooles; especially for lacke of time
to trie and compare euery schollars translation, and
euer giuing them new peeces to translate, and those
such as are meete for euery forme; by the meanes
of these translations of our first schoole Authors, all
these things may bee performed in euery Author
and forme, most certainely and constantly, and with
much ease and delight both to Maister and Schollars;
as I trust will be found. The manner hereof I haue
set downe in the 8. Chapter, and others following.
Therfore since the time that God made these knowne
vnto mee (which was about some foure yeares agoe
or not much aboue, vpon the occasion of a late wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
experiment related vnto mee, confirming the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Askam</hi>) I haue laboured in these
translations aboue all other things, First, to finde out
the Grammar rule of construing truely and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whereby to guide these translations, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
they chiefely depend: Secondly, to finde out
the parricular vses and benefits of them: Thirdly, to
finde out and set downe such directions, as whereby
to frame the translations to serue for all the vses most
plainely: Fourthly, to translate so many of our first
Authors after the same manner, as since that time I
<pb facs="14"/>
haue had occasion for my schollars in each forme to
reade: Fiftly, to haue certaine triall and experience of
euery thing, so much as in this time I could; and vpon
triall to commend them to Schooles, to help hereby
to bring into Schooles that excellent way of learning,
which hee so highly commendeth, and whereof I
haue very great hope; and so by them a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
benefit to all schooles and good
learning: which I vnfainedly
wish and pray for.
