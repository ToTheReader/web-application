and Devotion to bee unfained. The causes why I present them unto you, are these: First, the true respect you merit from all them who professe Learning: Secondly, the many excellent gifts worthy of much commendations in your selfe: Thirdly, that my Father (whom God hath taken to his Mercy) was sometime Chaplaine to my late Honourable good Lord your Father (who now resteth with God, his body being layd up in peace, and his memory with good men preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) and one of the first Chaplaines that ever he entertained: Lastly, to testifie my owne engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you being my worthy Patron, humbly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that as you succeeded your Honourable Father in his Vertues; so I may succeed my Father in your favours. Touching these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons upon <hi>Iude,</hi> the naturall sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is so clearely opened, and the Doctrines arising so powerfully applied and enforced, and all manner of sinne so reproved, that I doubt not, but Gods Church and People shall hence reape much benefit, which was the Authors one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intent in the exercise of his Ministery. But it becommeth not mee to say much; they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to publique viewe, and as mens eyes shall bee upon them, so my prayer to God shall bee, that their hearts may be informed and reformed by them. For my part I intend especially (though I bee of all men most unworthy to bee an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein) to further Christs Kingdom, which
<pb facs="3"/>
if it may, I have my desire: howsoever, I shall leave it to the blessing of God, and your worthy Patronage. Now the God of all consolation, according to the riches of his Mercy, blesse you with the Honorable good Lady your Wife, your hopefull Children, and whole Familie, with all externall, internall, and eternall blessings of his Spirit, that all your actions may bee prosperous, your troubles few, your comforts many, your life long, your death blessed, your election sure, and your salvation certaine. <hi>Amen.</hi>
