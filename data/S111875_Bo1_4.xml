   <p>TO my faythfull Brethren, we geue
thankes to God for your constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and vpryght delynge in this gret
controuersie now raysyd by packynge of
enemys about the wearinge of popish ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
and as ye haue well begonne, ther
is no doubt, but the Lorde in mercy shall
kepe ye pure and blameles to the ende. It
hathe byne no small ioye and comfort to
many godlye and good Churches, which
dayly and howerly prayeth for your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerāce,
and that it wolde please God to
ease it, whē his good will and pleasure is.
So on the other syde muche lamentynge
the blyndnes of those that goeth about to
defende it: but especiallye those that are
become persecutors of their godly &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
brethren: but as charite requireth, we
desyre God neuer laye it to theyr charge,
but geue them grace to ryse agayne vnto
whom we le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e them wether they stande or
falle. Let Lottes wyfe be a warnynge in
tyme to take hede. Moses that blessyd ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uant
of God wolde not alter the valew of
a curten, or a lytill pyne in the Arcke, so ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
was he in the Lordes worke: nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
brought any thynge out of his owne
heade to the people: But had always the
<pb facs="19"/>
warrant of the worde for hym, to cōclude,
what so euer may be obiected agaynst the
refusars of those ydolators garmētes, for
what so euer they brynge, may be redused
into this poyntes, that Godly men ether
nede not or ought not to be scrupulous in
so small a matter, which answer ye shall
vnderstand as folowith with an answere
to a question at the end hereof. The Lord
for his Christ sake make Ephrahim and
Manassis agre, that we maye all with on
hart and mynde vnfaynydly seke Godes
glorye, the edificacion of his people, that
we may lyue in all godly peace, vnyte, and
concord. This grant, o Lorde, for Christ
Jesus sake, to whom, with the, and the
Holy goste, be all prayse, glory, and
honor for euer and euer.
Fare ye well deare

what our Sauiour Christ saythe: He that

now are cōmandyd for order &amp; comlynes.
No godly man doubtyth, but the Quenes

which hath in it no necessary cause of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.
Let all thinges be donne for edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Nether can it be conuertyd to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes
of the Christian Churche, which is
the chaste spowse of Christ, which is takē
from Antichrist, and the fylthye whore of
Babylon. What cōsent hath Christ with
Belyall: what porcion hath the faythfull
with the infydell: or what agrement hath
the temple of God with Images? Yf the
reason of S. Paule be examynyd,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> by the
which he dissuadith the Corynthians frō
eating of meate offeryd to Idoles, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
may be also extendyd to garmēts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secratyd
to Idolatry. The nature of cery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
and rytes is to make the vser to
haue felowship with the principall of that
religion, as the Jewes of the alter, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb facs="22"/>
with Christ, and Gentils with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells.
As manye as are partakers of the
breade which we breake, are partakers of
the bodye of Christe. They therfore that
eate meate offeryd to Idoles, are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of deuells. And as many as are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
haue put on Christ: it is not to be fea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryd,
leaste as many as weare antychristes
robes, wil take more yf auctorite comand
it, neyther dothe the auctoryte of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stian
Magistrat excuse vs, except we thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
that Sergius Paulus myght permyte
that S. Paule had forbydden the sentence
of Jamys,<note place="margin">Act. 15. Deut. 12.</note> which is, that the gentyls shul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
abstayne from the polucion of Idoles,
God will borowe nothynge of Idoles to
garnysh or become his religion. thou shalt
not do so to the Lorde thy god, but rather
he commandyth vtterly to destroye theyr
alters, woddes, pyllers, and theyr very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
He forbyddyth them also to brynge
any thinge in to theyr howses that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gythe
to Idoles. Esaye chap. 30. byddyth
those that are earnestly turnyd to the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shippe
of god, to cast awaye the reliques
of Idolatrie, You shall, sayth he, put out
the couerynge of the Imagis of syluer,<note place="margin">that is all thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Idolatry.</note> &amp;
the precious vestymēts of the goldē Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,
and thou shalt caste them awaye lyke
<pb facs="23"/>
a menstrous clowte, and saye vnto yt: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uawnte,
or get the hence. Fynallye when
all godly men abhorre the monstrous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
of Fryers, Monkes, Chanons, I
can not se, by what order they shulde exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
the ornaments of Popishe Preastes,
whose order is as wyckyd as Freyers,
Monkes, or any other, which thyng may
be sayd of the reste of the Popishe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies,
which may all with lyke precepte and
coloure, &amp; by as good reason be receuid in
the Churches as those. But admyttinge
that these thynges were neuer so indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
yet it can not be that we shulde thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
them lawfull, for vs to vse them: For euē
those thinges, which by them sealues are
lawfull, whē an other circumstance is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyd
to them, then become they vnlawfull
for a Christian to vse them, as in these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
First we can not cast of all doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
hauing so many reasons on our syde,
and so manye examples bothe of learnyd
men, and best reformyd Churches, but in
all thinges most indifferent. Saint Paule
chargith euery mā to be certanly persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyd
in his owne mynde, which some men
vntruly translate, Let euery man abownde
in his owne sence, for he that with doubt
of conscience eatyth, which of it sealfe is
<pb facs="23"/>
lawfull, is condemnyd, because he doth it
not of fayth. Now the assurance of fayth
muste be sought no where, but in Gods
worde. Secondlye, thowghe we shulde sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfye
our consciences, yet this man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fylid,
which is not persuadid by Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de,
but encreased by our examples, that he
dare do that, whereof before he doubted,
and this is to geue an offence, as they cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call it to anger them, for they that
are best pleasyd with these matters, are
most offendyd that they stomble and falle,
we must not do what so euer is lawfull,
but what so euer also is profytable to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying:
nether must we only regarde what
lyberte permyttyth, but rather what our
brothers proffyt requiryth. Thyrdlye, we
maye not altogether neclecte what infy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells
iudge of vs in the vsynge of thinges
lawfull by them sealfes, and therefore S.
Paule byddeth them that are callyd to the
feastes of the gentyls, so sone as mencyon
is made of meate offeryd to Idoles, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayne
from eatinge of it, because of hym
that tolde of it, and his conscience, not of
hym sealfe, but of an other. What the Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pistes
iudge of vs, maye casely be seene by
this, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Harding for the retayning of those
Popishe cerymonies, cōteynith hope that
<pb facs="24"/>
popery shalbe restoryd: what the ignorant
people iudge of the reamnants of papistri
retaynyd, wyse men may well consyder.
Herunto might haue byne ioynid the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of olde Doctors, Justinus, Ireneus,
Tertullianus, Agustyne, Ambros, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostums,
Celestinus, &amp; almost all the rest,
for abhorrynge the customes and ryghtes
of the Jewes and gentyles and heritykes,
but Gods truthe nedyth not mans aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte,
except they that be against vs, in this
cause wyll appeale to the fathers, thē shall
they perceyue, that in nomber both of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
and sentences, we shall be nothinge
inferior to them. In the meane tyme this
maye suffyce, to shew fyrst that the precy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians
is blameles, secondly the garmētes
ar not indifferent, &amp; thyrdly that thowghe
they were indifferent yet ther is sufficient
reason at this tyme, why we shoulde not
weare them. Come Lord Jesus, and make
an ende of thys wyckyd wordle, that thy
sainctes may come to gether, that we may
synge with the in thy holy hyll for euer.
He that ouercomith, shalbe crownyd.
Pray, pray, as the Apostell Peter
sayth: the end of all thinges
is at hand.</p>
