      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>CIPIO</hi> that noble capitaine, and valeante
conquerour, continually delighting in seking
wisedome, and assaying profitable enterpryses
for the common wealth of the Romaines, and
also for the glory and aduauncement of his
countrey, in noble feates of armes, striuing to
be aboue the reste singular, did continually oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
him selfe in histories, &amp; in monumentes
of great antiquitie. Whose commendable studies, <hi>Marcus Tullius Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi>
in a certayne epistle to his brother <hi>Quintus,</hi> commendeth in these
woordes, <hi>Cyrus ille à Zenophonte non ad historiae fidem scriptus, sed ad
effigiem iusti imperij, cuius summa grauitas ab illo Philosopho cum sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulari
comitate coniungitur, quos quidem libros non sine causa noster
ille Africanus de manibus ponere non solebat; nullum est enim praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missum
in hijs officium diligentis &amp; moderati imperij. Cyrus</hi> that noble
prince of <hi>Persia,</hi> who is set out in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> history of <hi>Zenophon,</hi> although y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie
wrytten of him, be aboue that which <hi>Cyrus</hi> attayned to, yet the
very liuely image of a prince, what he ought to be, and of his state is in
those bookes declared, the grauitie and maiestie of. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
courteous humanitie is ioyned together of that Philosopher,
the whiche bookes of <hi>Zenophon,</hi> not without great cause or dope consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
oure noble <hi>Africanus</hi> woulde neuer laye oute of his handes:
For in those bookes is fully set out the state and royall office of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
prince and tēperate. The example of so worthy a prince of so great
wysdome, of so victorious and valeante a conquerour, is of great force
to shewe what great knowledge, wysedome, and profitable learning,
what glory is conteined in histories to the studentes thereof. This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Scipio,</hi> being a rare prince for all excellency. The staye of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
Empire, a light to all princes, dayly occupied him selfe in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of histories. <hi>Octauius</hi> Emperour of Rome, did greatly delight in
histories, and in all antiquities of learning, who was in loue so muche
rapted &amp; inflamed with the <hi>Aeneados</hi> of the famous Poete <hi>Virgil,</hi> as
that noble <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> was delighted with <hi>Zenophons</hi> workes.
<hi>Alexander</hi> the great, whose commendation is aboue all princes, who
as the booke of the <hi>Machabes</hi> sheeweth, hauing great warres in hande,
he wan many strong cities, and slewe many kynges of the earth, goyng
throughout the endes of the worlde, in so muche that the whole worlde
stoode in awe of hym. This <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, being brought vp of
that great and moste wyse Philosopher <hi>Aristotle,</hi> did chiefly place his
delight in histories, who gaue great and princely giftes to all suche as
<pb facs="6"/>
by any meanes profited the cōmon wealth thereby. This mighty prince
<hi>Alexander,</hi> did so muche delighte in histories and in the bookes of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere</hi>
the Greeke Poete, that he would rest his study and minde therin.
Whiche bookes of <hi>Homere</hi> he named his pillowe, because he woulde
neuer sleape without them: saying alwayes giue me my pyllowe (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
those bookes.) Out of those bookes he learned many notable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
mete for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> office of prīces, many rare vertues &amp; great knowledge,
for all such as shall be gouernours in the common wealthe, great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
for captaynes with the felicitie of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> minde &amp; rare magnaminitie,
the noble vertue patiēce, is there fully set out, mete for al states, with al
the calamities of warre. <hi>Lucius Lucullus,</hi> by his great knowledge in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
brought to the Romaines felicitie of estate, and perpetuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme
in his warres fought against <hi>Mithidrates.</hi> Thus <hi>Marcus Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Cicero</hi> writeth of him. <hi>Lucius Lucullus, percontandis peritioribus,
rebus gestis legendis, tātus in omni genere belli extitit vt omnibus quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rūcun{que}
seculorū principibus anteferretur. Lucius Lucullus,</hi> by diligent
inquisition of the beste learned, and by reading of histories, was so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and noble in al pointes of chiualry, that he ought to be placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the princes of all ages. <hi>Alexander Seuerus,</hi> an Emperour of great
glorie, and of moste noble fame, inferiour to no prince in wysedome and
learning, by whome the Romaines enioyed a florishing state and moste
peaceable gouernemente, the frutes of all good gouermente. This <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
Seuerus,</hi> wold neuer enterprice any thing of any great weight
or importance, either in warre or peace, but he would sende for suche as
were knowen to be excellēt in histories, to consulte and debate with thē
of suche matters: wherein he founde a chiefe treasure of all depe &amp; sage
councell, a register of all famous actes. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, at what
time as he ouercame <hi>Darius</hi> king of <hi>Persia,</hi> in a place called <hi>Arbellis,</hi>
he demaunded of his noble men the nerest and safyst waye out of <hi>Persia</hi>
into <hi>Aegipte,</hi> but none could tell him. A certayne marchaunt man the
historie sayth, <hi>Homo multarum rerum peritus,</hi> a man very cunning in
many thinges, it semed by his answere he was a traueyler in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
&amp; in many other countries. This marchaunt was by countrey a <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian,</hi>
who being brought to him, the historie maketh no mention of
his name, but <hi>Lucianus</hi> wryteth the story. O king (sayth the marchaūt)
I am able to promyse thee that the waye from this parte of <hi>Persia</hi> into
<hi>Aegipte,</hi> is but three dayes iourney through the mountaynes, and so it
was proued. <hi>Alexander</hi> ignoraunt of the situation of the countrey, and
fearing the marchaunt to haue dissembled with him, of long time bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it not, but in the ende the marchauntes tale was founde true, it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the marchaunt knew more by his trauayle then those <hi>Persians</hi> did,
of so great force is the worthy knowledge of histories. The knowledge
<pb facs="7"/>
of the situation of countreis, regiōs, and cities, <hi>Ptolomeus Euergetes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>
      </hi>
that worthy prince of <hi>Aegipte,</hi> of whome <hi>Galene</hi> that noble phisition
wryteth of in the third booke <hi>De morbis popularibus.</hi> This <hi>Ptolomeus</hi>
greatly deliting in histories, and in all kinde of learning, commaunded
as many as arriued at his coastes or countreis, to bryng to hym al such
bookes as were to be founde with them of any worthy memorie. Those
bookes this king <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> caused truly to be writtē out, and the new
copies to be deliuered to the firste possessours, all suche bookes in this
sorte brought, the kyng commaunded them to be placed in goodly and
sumptuous libraries, there perpetually to remayne as worthy monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
to be reserued of the posteritie. And also this kyng <hi>Ptolomeus,</hi>
commaunded that vpon all those bookes thus broughte to him from
farre countries, to haue this title vpon them, <hi>Ex nauibus acceptorum,</hi>
as who should saie, all suche bookes were brought by shippe from farre
places to him. Howe great was the care of this <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> towardes
learning, when he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

talentes of siluer for the bookes of <hi>Sophocles,</hi> of <hi>Euripides,</hi> and of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi>
the poete. He caused a copie to be writtē out of thē, the olde bookes
he kepte, and restored to them the newe laste written copies. Thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<hi>Galene, Orabat vt quindecim talenta tenerent acciperent{que} nouos
pro veteribus quos ipsi dederant, sic Athenienses &amp; argento potiti sunt, &amp;
libris. Ptolomeus</hi> prayed the <hi>Athenians</hi> that they would receiue of hym
the. 15. talentes, &amp; the newe wrytten copies for the olde copies whiche
they gaue to him, so the <hi>Athenians</hi> receiued at y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> kinges handes muche
siluer and their bookes agayne. The rare loue of this Prince towarde
learning, his greate care to obtayne workes, to reserue them to all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterities,
and geeue so great rewardes for so small bookes, sheweth a
rare and moste royall harte to learning. Those tragedies of <hi>Sophocles</hi>
and <hi>Euripides,</hi> do conteine notable histories, wherin kyng <hi>Ptolomeus</hi>
delighted, a continuall studie mete for all princes. Great be the commē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of that noble Empresse <hi>Zenobia,</hi> the Empresse of the Easte, she
was the wyfe of valeant <hi>Odoacer,</hi> for her great wysedome and excellēt
learnyng, both in histories, and also in all matters of councell. This
learned Empresse <hi>Zenobia,</hi> by her wysedome, and great knowledge in
histories, excelled in those dayes and in manye ages before, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> mightye
Monarches of the worlde. This <hi>Zenobia</hi> made a Chronicle of all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
warres fought in <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Also she gathered a collection of all the
notable warres fought in the Easte partes. The reading of histories
is a study right profitable for all men, for magistrates, for princes a
moste pleasaunt and comfortable trauell. The knowledge of histories
is a spurre to vertue, a brydle to represse vice in all that feare God. An
historie is the glasse of Princes, the image moste liuely bothe of vertue
<pb facs="7"/>
and vice, the learned theatre or spectacle of all the worlde, the councell
house of Princes, the trier of all truthes, a witnes of all tymes &amp; ages.
After death a perpetuall memorie of the noble actes of those that here
deserued fame, a liuely register of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> common wealthes of al ages, the
worthiest scholemaister of manners, the fountayne of all knowledge to
knowe God thorowely and thy selfe, a bytte and snaffle to the proude &amp;
ambitious, the learned schole of princes, the booke of princes, &amp; their
quiet and softe pillowe to slepe on, the perfit description of the marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
workes of God, in the preseruing of princes &amp; common welthes,
a paterne of all common wealthes layde before our eyes. Kyng <hi>Asueue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus</hi>

prouinces, so muche delighted in histories, that for a perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of thinges done. He commaunded to be put in a chronicle all thinges
that happened to hym. And also that treason whiche <hi>Mardocheus</hi> the
Iewe vttered of the kinges chāberlaynes wrought against this <hi>Asue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
of the whiche treason the king commaunded inquisitiō to be made,
the king <hi>Asueuerus</hi> commaūded it to be written in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Chronicles before
his owne sighte and the name of him that vttered the treason. This
worthy register of fame, being preserued and kepte. A certayne tyme
this king <hi>Asueuerus,</hi> (not able to take sleape in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> night season, through
his greate cares of mynde) commaunded the Chronicles and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to be brought before hym, and the Chronicles were redde. In that
place of the histories redde to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> king, <hi>Mardocheus</hi> the Iewe was foūde
chronicled, who vttered the great treason wrought against the kyng, by
<hi>Bigthana</hi> &amp; <hi>Theres</hi> the kyngs chamberlaynes, who sought to haue layd
handes on the kyng, but they were as all traytours deserued, in lyke
sorte hanged vppe, but <hi>Mardocheus</hi> who vttered this treason, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled
to greate honour. It was a worthye acte of the kynge to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alte
and rewarde the well doer, and to hange vp the traytours diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
so mischieuously God and their prince, seeking to establysh their
deuelishe purpose by the subuersion of the prince. Proude <hi>Haman</hi> was
broughte to confusion, that soughte the deathe of manye: who, beinge
aboue all the subiectes of the kynge aduaunced, not knowing him selfe
fell into the destruction that hee prepared for other. <hi>Malum consili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
consultori pessimum,</hi> The deuyce and counsell of a wicked man to
hurt other, turneth to his owne destructiō. The story sayth kyng <hi>Asue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus</hi>
not able to take reste, commaunded the Chronicle to be brought
to him, and to be redde, it semeth that Chronicles be pleasaūt, they put
awaye tediousnes, they bringe great wysdome to princes, they geue
knowledge to forsee mischieues and treasons, &amp; to subuerte the wilye
pollicies of forayne nations. This noble kinge <hi>Asueuerus</hi> calleth hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
an euerlasting remembraunce. The actes of wise men are a rule
<pb facs="8"/>
and square for other to direct their councel and doings by. This noble
<hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> sheweth to all wyse men the depe knowledge in histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and the great profite of them. <hi>Octauius Augustus, Alexander</hi> the
great, <hi>Lucius Lucullus, Alexander Seuerus, Ptolomeus Euergetes,</hi> who
were the great princes of the worlde, by learned histories, in florishyng
estate gouerned, and thereby attayned to great wysedome. The worthy
<hi>Zenobia</hi> is to be folowed in the great knowledge of histories, and in her
great wysedome obteined therin. That wyse Salomō Henry the seuēth
was very studious of histories, and that victorious prince <hi>Henry</hi> the
eight, who was a terror to all princes that had any quarel against him.
The Emperour Charles the fifte sovght his amitie, and Fraunces
the Frenche kyng afrayde to displease him, he was more valiant then
<hi>Hector,</hi> of more noble courage then <hi>Achilles,</hi> an other <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi>
or rather if he had mynded to enlarge his dominion, an other <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
in wysedome and graue councell <hi>Salomon.</hi> These noble princes do
shewe what it is for princes to be learned, and especiallye for graue
councell and wysedome in histories. He knoweth nothing that knoweth
not histories, and it is the lyfe of beastes to knowe nothing, the more a
man knoweth, the more he excelleth from men &amp; differeth from beastes.
If the Empire of the Easte might in those dayes glorie and reioyce of
their Empresse <hi>Zenobia.</hi> What may this our noble ilande of Britaine,
and how much reioyce, that almighty God, for the glory and aduaūce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his church, for the florishing state of this noble kingdome, hath
raysed vp this our noble queene to sit in the throne &amp; seate of her aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours,
kynges from long descent, of moste auncient tyme victorious
princes, in the queenes maiesties vertuous gouernement, the frutes of
godlye peace do shewe it selfe, whose maiestie of princly state, the great
power of God vpholdeth, in all respectes the moste fortunates coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
God graunte that all we Englishe men may acknowledge in what

what blessed state God hath set vs, all suche as are vnmyndefull of this
blessed gouernment, are vnmete burdenes to treade on earth, meete to
drawe in yoke and myserable seruitude with the barbarous <hi>Scithians,</hi>
or in slauerie with the bloudye Turkes. <hi>Marcus Tullius Cicero</hi> wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a notable sentence, meete to be put in golden letters, to be redde of
all good subiectes against rebelles, or mainteyners of rebellion.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Sic sentit senatus, sic populus Romanus nullos vnquā hostes digniores

people of Rome at any time y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> no enemies haue ben more worthy al kind
of punishement or tormentes, then those who in this warres taken in
hande against their owne countrey are become rebellious, making war
against the same, vpon whiche workers with the cōsent of all good mē,
I do take reuengement of, and pursue to the vttermoste this talke
he had with <hi>Brutus</hi> a man of great authoritye: Also the sayde <hi>Tullye</hi>
made aunswere to a certayne epistle of this <hi>Brutus,</hi> which was writtē
to <hi>Tullie. Vehementer à te dissentio Brute ne{que} clementiae tuae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedo,
sed salubris seueritas vincit inanem speciem clementiae, quod si
clementes esse voluerimus, nunquā deerunt bella ciuilia.</hi> O <hi>Brutus</hi>
saith he, I do greatly disagree from thee, neyther do I alowe thy piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
clemency, for wholsome seuerity doth passe and excelle this vayne
kinde of clemencie: for if we will be pytifull in such cases, ciuil warre
wyll neuer cease to the Romaynes. God alwayes ouerthroweth the
wicked attemptes of such domestical vipars, to whome their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
are their owne snares and pitte of destruction to fall into.</p>
   <p>As conserning the order of my Booke, I do beginne wyth the lyfe of
<hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> setting forth with it the greate warres betweene him and
noble <hi>Pompeie,</hi> called <hi>Pompeius Magnus:</hi> from thence I procede tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
the liues of all the Emperours, euen to <hi>Maximilian</hi> this noble
Emperour which presentlye rayneth, makinge a full discourse of the
great glorye, nobilitye and perpetuall fame of the godlye Princes, the
myserable and doulefull fall of the wicked. In this historye I note
perticulerly the actes of euery one, I doo set foorth the great prouidēce
of God in preseruing common wealthes, in raysing and exalting to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
godly princes, in thrawing downe tyrauntes, rebelles, and
all mainteiners of rebellion, howe God by his mighty hande ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
the persecutors of his churche, and all deuelishe practises, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
hath his limites and bondes appointed which he shal not passe. In
histories, it is set forth of the great alterations from tyme to tyme of
kingdomes, the chaunges of Empires, the partition of the Romayne
Empire for the East, the first being of the beggerly <hi>Scithians,</hi> y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> beastly
<hi>Gothes,</hi> of the runnagate <hi>Vandales,</hi> &amp; to what power they grew in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
and in the ende their ouerthrowe by the mighty power of God,
the state of the Turkes and Saracenes, &amp; of their beginning, of the oft
taking of Rome, &amp; sacking of it, of the great warres against Millaine
by the Frenche kyng, of the great warres in Germany, of the taking of
the Frenche kyng, of the great warres of the Emperour Charles and
noble Ferdinando against the Turkes, and of the great ouerthrowe of
the Turkes. I haue in the histories setforth the images of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
<pb facs="9"/>
as they were in the coigne of them, with their tittles. I doubt
not but the reader shall finde it profitable, with manye plentifull histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for knowledge necessary, the noble man, the captaine, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
shall finde knowledge therein very profitable. God graunte vs al
