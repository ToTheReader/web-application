   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Neuer yet durst hazard my short Scantling of knowledge, to be tried by the iust Standart of your Iudgement, nor put those few graines of mine vpon the indifferent Scales of your Censure, as being conscious to my selfe how much they are wanting, both in weight and measure. Please you but remember how I long since disclaimed the publication of the <hi>View of France</hi> and <hi>Suruay of Tuscany,</hi> (though I could not disauow the things themselues) it will make you a faire way to the truth of this my ingenuous protestation. But now I must confesse, the desire I haue to make him liue still in your memories, (in whose great hopes while he breathed all gentle spirits liued,) hath dulled my sence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those tender impressions, and violently driuen me, either vpon the rocke of your iust reproofe, or into the armes of your good fauour; I know not yet whether. Be mine the hazard, so his be the honour: by whose gracious influence euery little starre in that goodly Sphaere of his subal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne gouernement, mooued in their proper Orbe to do him seruice: and among these my selfe, the vnablest of many in that Academy (for so was his family) had this especiall employment, for his proper vse; which he pleased fauour ably to entertaine, and often to reade ouer. Whose all-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising vertues and all-deserued praises while you shall sing, I will sigh the losse of all in sorowfull silence, and offer you these his papers in his memory. The Argument is generall, wherein the publicke Minister may meete with his experience, the Souldier with his practise, the Scholler with his reading: and euery of these in his owne Element pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel both the Aphorisme, Example, and Authorities. The Method is not vulgar, for though bookes of Ciuill discourse be full of axiomes, Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of proofes, and Historians of instances; yet shall ye hardly meete them all combined in one couplement. Out of their legions of Authorities I haue drawne out these Maniples, because our Masters in the art of
<pb facs="4"/>
warre doe teach vs, that these are more readie for vse, vpon all sodaine occasion of seruice. I haue enter-laced them with variety of Language, to procure his better appetite for whom they were written, I was the more plentifull in Authorities, because, to reade many and great volumes few yong men haue the will, no Prince hath the leisure. It is true many of them may serue to seuerall Aphorismes, so doth the workmans Last for seuerall mens wearing, and yet neither the shooe is cut, or foote pinched: Nor are they so loose but that with Lipsius Soder you may cyment them together, and make them con-center in the maine proposition. To the Aphorismes I haue giuen some farce of illustration, which falles not necessarily in the nature of the conclusion; but this I did of purpose, to giue them better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish in the dainty palate of a Prince, and to draw him on with the variety of his viands. Some of them likewise compared together may seeme one and the same, yet is not their co-incidence so close, but that the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reader may obserue a difference, either in the Roote or in the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as also in the Authorities and Examples. In the Examples I haue bound my selfe to the truth of the history, but vsed my liberty for the phrase and manner of relation: because my Authors periods are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, to sute with that perspicuity which I intended. What else is to be obserued, your iudgment may discerne, whereunto I subscribe: and your fauour accept, whereupon I rely.</p>
