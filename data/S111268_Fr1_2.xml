   <head>¶ TO THE CVRTEOVS Buyer, by a VVelwiller of the tvvo Authours.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Vrteous Buyer,</hi> (for I write not to the enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Carper) it was my good happe, as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreate it, nowe lately at the fourthe or fifte h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>e, to bee made acquainted wyth the <hi>three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="4 letters">
            <desc>••••</desc>
         </gap>ters following,</hi> by meanes of a faithfull friende, who with much<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> entreaty had procured the copying of them oute, at <hi>Immeritos</hi> handes. And I praye you, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete it for your good happe, so soone after to come so easilye by them, throughe my meanes, who am onely to craue these twoo things at your handes, to thinke friendely of my friendly meaning, and to take them of me wyth this Presumption, <hi>In exiguo quandoque cespite latet lepus:</hi> and many pretious stones, thoughe in quantitie small yet in qualitie and valewe are esteemed for great. The first, for a good familiar and sensible Letter, sure liketh me verye well, and gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth some hope of good mettall in the Author, in whome I knowe myselfe to be very good partes otherwise. But shewe me, or <hi>Immerito,</hi> two Englyshe Letters in Printe, in all pointes equall to the other twoo, both for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it selfe, and also for the manner of handling, and saye, wee neuer sawe good Englishe Letter in our liues. And yet I am credibly certified by the foresaide faithfull and honest friende, that himselfe hathe written manye of the same stampe bothe to Courtiers and others, and some of them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing vppon matter of great waight and importance, wherein he is said, to be fully as sufficient and hable, as in these schol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>erly pointes of Learning. The whiche Letters and Discourses I would very gladly see in Writing, but more gladly in Printe, if it might be obtayned. And at this time to speake my conscience in a worde of <hi>these two following,</hi> I esteeme them for twoo of the rarest, and finest Treaties, as wel for ingenious deuising, as also for sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant vttering, &amp; cleanly conueying of his matter, that euer I read in this Tongue: and I hartily thanke God for bestowing vppon vs some such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and hable men with their penne, as I hartily thanke the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, for vsing his pleasaunte, and witty Talente, with so muche discretion,
<pb n="4" facs="3"/>
and with so little harme, contrarye to the veine of moste, whych haue thys singular conceyted grace in writing. If they had bene of their owne set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth, I graunt you they might haue beene more curious, but beeyng so well, and so sufficiently done, as they are, in my simple iudgement, and hauing so many notable things in them, togither with so greate varietie of Learning, worth the reading, to pleasure you, and to helpe to garnish our Tongue, I feare their displeas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>re the lesse. And yet, if they thinke I haue made them a faulte, in not making them priuy to the Publication: I shall be alwayes readye to make them the beste amende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

Surely, I wishe them bothe hartilye wel in the Lord, and betake you and them to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull gouernemente, hoping, that he will at his pleasure conuerte suche good and diuine gifts as these, to the setting out of his own glory, and the benefite of his Churche.
