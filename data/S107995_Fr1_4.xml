them selues to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, nether vvill to moue them selues vnto it, are
by the proudident Gouernour and Menager of all, indevved vvith naturall
inclinations, propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or instinctes, by vvhich they are caryed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one directly to their ende, as though they kne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve it, and desired it. For as
the Arrovve, though it knovve not the marke, yet, bicause it is directed by
one that knovveth it, flyeth as directly to it, as if it knevve it, and as
svviftely, as if it vvere in loue vvith it; so these creatures although
they knovve not their ende, yet bicause they are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by natural
propensions, &amp; instinctes, vvhich God, vvhovvell knovveth it, hath put
into them, ayme allvvayes at their conuenient places, endes, and perfections,
as if they not only knevv them, but also moste earnestly desired them.
The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, as vvee see, doe moue so vniformely, as though by common
consent they vvere aggreeed, to be the neuer erring dialles, vvhich measure
our actions, and distinguishe our tymes, and seasons. The Sunne
riseth at a iuste tyme, as if he vvere Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <pb facs="20"/>cocke, to calle
him vp to his vvorke, and his candle also to giue him light by vvhich he may
see to vvorke; and he setteth also at his tyme, putting man in mynde,
that then it is tyme for him, to take his rest, and to cease, from labour.
The Moone in her Chaunge, is vnchaungeable, and constante in her
inconstancie; and bothe the Sunne and Moone, are so sure moderatours of
tymes and seasons, that vvinter and Sōmer, Spring, and the Falle of the
leafe, neuer chaunge their order; not that these Planets knovv their time,
but bicause they are moued by one that knovveth. Brute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes as soone
as they are able to nibble vppon the grasse, can chuse the hearbes,
vvhich are most conueniēt for them, as though they vvere cunning
herbistes, and you shall seeldome or neuer see them dye of
surfitting, or mistaking one hearbe for another: not that they knovve the
vertues of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but bicause God hath giuen them an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincte of
Nature, to take that vvhich is aggrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to nature. The byrdes of the ayre,
Keepe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and a most conuenient tyme for breeding, and building; and
their nestes they build as arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially, as if they vvere Carpenters by
occupation, and their youngones they feed vvith that discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if they
vvere experte Nurces. The spider vvill not yeeld to the Fisher, vvho as
coningly vveaueth his vvebbe, &amp; placeth it as craftilie to take the flye,
as he doth his netteto take y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> heedles fishes. The Bee vvhen the vvinde
riseth, taketh claye in his mouth, leaste the vvind haue to great 
<pb facs="20"/>force ouer his litle body. I vvill say nothing of the so vvell
ordered common vvelthes of Bees and Antes, nor of the staunge operations, of
other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures, bicause of them I ame to treat in diuers places of
my booke. Plantes and trees, seel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or neuer deceiue the husband man,
but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the dead of vvinter, all vvhich tyme they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so seemed dead,
they send forthe, first theyr leaues, and aftervvardes their bloomes, as
messengers to fortell the fruites, vvhich for his labour in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them,
they meane to bestovve, vppon him. And neuer shall you see them budd in
the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of vvinter, but in the spring only, vvhen the ayre is so
vvarme, that their yonug ones can take no harme; not that they knovve the
moste con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient tyme, but bicause God vvho Knovves it, hath engrauen
such an inclination in them. But more bountifully, hath the Allmightie dealte
vvith man, then vvith any other corporall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, bicause he is more
noble then them all, and is an abridgement of all; for to him he hath giuen
vnderstanding to knovve his God, his Good, his Ende, and Felicitie, and a
vvill also, to desire and pursue the same. And least his
vnderstanding should banger, in approuing falshood, for truth and
veritie, he hath engrauen in it a naturall propēsiō to veritie, and least
his vvill should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace euil, and badde for good, she also hath the
like inclination to good. In so much that, as the eye seeth nothing but
light or colours, and the eare heareth nothing but sounde, so the
vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <pb facs="21"/>aymeth only at truthe, and the vvill desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
nothing else but good; and as the eye can not perceue sound, nor the eare
colours, so the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing can not giue his assent to a knovven
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthe, and the vvill can not affecte euil, as euil. Hence it is that vve
can not vvith harte thinke that the crovve is vvhite, or the svvanne blacke,
bicause this is a knovven vntruth, and vvhere nether the truth nor
falsehood is apparaunt, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vve doubt, and suspend our Iudgement,
vvhich is the cause vvhy vve nether iudge the sandes of the Sea, nor the
starres of the skye, to bee euē or odde in number, bicause vvee haue no
more reason to thinke the one, then the other. The vvill in like manner can
not affect a knovvn euil, as euil, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause her obiecte is Good,

Dionisius Areopagita sayed, that no man intendeth euil as euil, but euen
then vvhen he embraceth vice, vvhich is the greatest euil, he aymeth at
some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunt good of pleasure, or profit, vvhich he imagineth in that
euill. Vvherfore all knovven <hi>Goodes,</hi> such as knovvledge, vertue,
&amp; Faelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie are, euery man desireth and loueth euen in his enemie vvhom
he hateth, though he like not of the difficulties, vvhich are to bee deuoured,
befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he attaine vnto them. Vvho novve vvould thinke that man, ether should
or could approue errours and heresies, for true doctrine, and falle in loue
vvith vice in vvhich is no true goodnes to be liked? But nothing is so good
vvhich may not bee abused. God hath giuen man freevvill, not to <pb facs="21"/>sinne, but to merit, vv<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> if hee had not, his vvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing vvould
deserue no God a mercie, and his euil deeds should be vvorthy no blame,
bicause they vvho of necessitie do othervvise then besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes them, are
rather to be pitied, then blamed. And yet from hence proceedeth all iniquitie,
from vvhēce, vertue, merit, and laudable actions, should haue had their
source and beginning. He hathe grafted in our nature passions of loue,
feare, anger, and such like, that by loue vvee might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <hi>Good,</hi>
by feare, auoid euil, and by anger, chastice vice and euil: and yet
vvhilest vve giue passions the head and bridle, passions rule, reason
is ouerruled, man is ouerthrovvn, and ruined by that, by vvhich he should
haue stoode. He hath imprinted in vs a naturall loue, and liking of
Beatitude, in so much that no man is so barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, vvhoe, if you aske
him vvhether he vvill be happy or noe, can, or vvill say, noe, vvith harte
and mynde. Vvherfore sainct Austine sayeth,

      </note> that the Iester,
vvho promised that he vvould tell euerie one the thing vvhich his harte
desired, had hit the nayle on the head, if he had sayed, <hi>omnes beati
esse vultis, miseri esse non vultis: you vvill all be happie,
miserable you vvill not bee;</hi> and yet vvhilest by this naturall
propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, vvee seeke for faelicitie in honours, ritches &amp;
pleasures vvhere it is not, and not in God, vvhere it is, that is made our
bane vvhich should haue beene our good. And so God hath bountifully
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stovved on vs vnderstanding, vvholly bent to <pb facs="22"/>truthe, and
only to truth, and yet by abuse, that is made the fountaine of all errours,
vvhich should haue been the of-spring of verities. For vvhilest like
Aesops dogge, vve snatch at the shadovve, insteed of the flesh, that
is, seek after truth in those thinges in vvhich is no truth at all, but
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a shovve and shadovve, vve make our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall propension vvhich vve
haue to truthe, a cause of our errour, vvhich should haue been our best
direction, and vvith as great a vehemencie vve embrace our errours, as vvee are
propense &amp; prone to truthe, euen as that dogge, the more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily leaped
at the shadovv, the more desirous he vvas of the flesh. And hence proceed
Idolatries, superstitions, sectes, and heresies, to vvhich vve vvould
neuer giue so obstinate an assent, did vve not imagin some truthe to
bee, vvhere only is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite and errour. He hath giuen vs also a vvill,
vvholly bente to <hi>Good,</hi> and altogether auerted from euil; and yet
vvhilest vvith those foolish byrdes, vvee pecke at Appelles painted
grapes, that is seeke after <hi>good</hi> in pleasures, ritches, and
honours, vvhere is but a painted hevve of good, vve embrace vice our greatest
euil, insteed of our greatest good, and so much the more greedily, by
hovv much vve are more inclined to <hi>Good.</hi> And hence proceed
fornicatiōs, aduouteries, thef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and murders, vvhich vve vvould neuer
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire so vehemently, did vve not apprehēd in them, <hi>Good,</hi> that
is pleasure, or profit. So that the bā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of our vvill, proceed only from
mistaking of <pb facs="22"/>badd for good, and the errours of our
vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, proceed not from any prones vvhich vvee haue to vntruthes,
but from mistaking of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunte, for true verities. And this is the cause
(moste gentle Reader) vvhy I haue made so exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte a Suruey of the nevv
Religion, bicause I knovv thy vnderstanding to be so naturally inclined
to truth, and so auerted from all vntruthes and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, that to lay open
vnto thy vevve, the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and grosse absurdities, vvhich it implyeth,
is to refute them, and to make them knovvne vnto thee, is to dissuade thee
from thē. For truly I finde many pointes of this religion, so opposit to
light of reason, that I dare anouch, that noe man can be ether Lutherane or
Caluiniste, vnless he vvante vvitte, or hauīg vvit, enter not into
cōsideration, or be caryed avvay vvith passion, or partiall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I
vvill not deny but that many a good vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te may be found amongest the
Professours of this Religion, but yet I saye, that these good vvittes,
if they layed a side passiō and partialitie, &amp; vvould vouchsafe
also to enter into due consideratoon, could be nether Lutheranes nor
Caluinistes, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to euident vntruthes, the vnderstāding can giue no
assent nor approbation. And vvhat more euident vntruthe then Lutheranisme
or Caluinis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me? First of all their preachers can say no more for proofe
of their authoritie or doctrine, then Simon Magus, Ebion, Cerinthus,
Basilides, Nestorius; Eutiches, Arius, Vvicleph, or any other heretike
could haue sayed, and enerie false prophet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after <pb facs="23"/>may
saye, preach he neuer so absurdely, as I haue demōstrated in my
first booke moste euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For nether can they proue their mission to
be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie by succession, nor extraordinary by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and so if you
giue eare to them, you must bynde your selfe to harken to all false
prophets, vvh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> vvill say
and svveare that they are sent frō Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste, and if you put them to the
proofe of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, they vvill say you are partial, vvho reiecte
them, and yet receiue Luther and Calum, vvh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> can not proue their missiō: But no man can
vvith any shovve of reason admitte all false Prophetes, bicause some
of them teach contraries, <hi>ergo</hi> he can not haue reason to receue
Luther and Caluin, as the true Messengers and ministers of Christe, and
consequently, he can not in harte receue them, bicause the vnderstanding
can not approue a thing for vvhich she hath no probable reason. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
their doctrine, if it bee vvell considered, is as euidently false, as that
vertue is vice, or blacke, is vvhite, but the vnderstanding (as is allready
proued) can not approue manifest false-hood and euident untruthes,
<hi>ergo</hi> noe man of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and consideration, can admitte
Luthers and Caluins doctrine. Novv that their doctrine is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently false, I
can not only euidently, but also easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie proue. For to a Christian it is
euident, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the veritie of Scripture, that heresie is errour and
falsehood, but in my second booke I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, that all the
markes of heresie, aggree as fitly to this nevv doctrine, as to Arianismen 
<pb facs="23"/>any olde heresies, <hi>ergô</hi> to a Christian it is
euidēt, that this nevv doctrine is errour, and consequēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, it can not bee
approued by a Christian of Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement and consideration, bicause the
vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding can not giue asseni to an open vntruth. It is euident also
to a Christian▪ that Antichristian doctrine, vvhich is
dishonourable, and repugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt to Christe, can not be true, but
Lutheranisme and Caluinisme, is altogether opposit to Christe,
bicause it pulleth at his diuinitie, and makes him nether Redeemer, nor
spirituall Phisitian, nor lavv maker, nor eternall Preest according to
Melchisedechs order, nor Iudge of the quicke and the dead, but rather aequali
Zeth euerie Christian to him in grace and sanctitie, and maketh him
ignoraunt, fayneth him also to haue despayred, at length bringeth him to
hell and damnation, and hateth all
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>inges vvhich haue beene
beloued of him, or belonging to him; all vvhich the third booke conuinceth,
<hi>ergô</hi> a Christian of vvitte and consideration, can not in
harte brooke such a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. In like manner to a Christian yea to euery
man that beleeues that ther is a God and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is euident that Religion
can not stande vvithout Preestes, sacrifice, sacramētes &amp; prayer;
but it is euident also, that in the nevve religion, none of these
essential partes of religion can be found, especially according to the
doctrine of the same Religion, as my fourth booke maketh mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
<hi>ergô</hi> a Christian of vvit and devve consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, can not
aepproue it for true Religion. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kevvise <pb facs="24"/>it is euident to
reason, that all lavvful authoritie is of God, that Princes lavves bynde,
that their tribunals are iuste and lavvfull, and that correspondēce
betvvixte the Prince, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, and betvvixte one subiect and another
is necessarie to vphold societie, to vvhich God and nature encline vs,
all vvhich is proued in the fifth booke, but the reformed doctrine,
despoileth Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of authoritie, bringeth their lavves and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals in
contempte, and ruineth all Societie, at is euidently also proued in the
same booke, <hi>ergo</hi> a man of common sense and iudgement, vvho
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth also into a devve consideratiō, can not vvith harte admit of
this religion. Lastelie, as euident it is, that this nevve religion is
absurd, as that God is not the autour of sinne, and the only sinner, that
he is not vnreasonable, cruel or Tyrannicall, but according to the reformed
doctrine, all these blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies are verified of God, as my sixte booke
tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, <hi>ergo</hi> the reformed doctrine is euidently absurde. Vice
also, and Atheisme, by light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, are euidently Knovvne to be
repugnaunt to reason, vvherfore seing that this nevve Religion leadethe to
all vice, and Atheisme, and that by many pointes, and principles of the
doctrine of the same, as is in my seuenth and eight booke demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
it is an euident absurditie, euidently repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnaunt to reason, and
consequently can not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by a man of reason and consideration,
bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the understanding can no more assente vnto
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>n euident vntruth, then can
the vvill affecte <pb facs="24"/>and like of euil, as euil, as I haue allready
proued. Vvherfore (most gentle Reader) if thou bee a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, and
vouchsaffe to peruse my booke, I hope thou shalt bee more confirmed, if
thou bee a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovver and professour of the late and nevv reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, vvhen
thou seest the fovvle absurditie of thy ovvne religion, and the
plausible veritie of the Catholike, I hope thou vvilte reiecte the one, &amp;
imbrace the other, bicause my booke vvill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke manifest vnto thee, bothe
the one and th'other. At least, as this I intended so this I haue
ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured. And if my intended purpose be vvell brought to passe, God
vvas the Principal Agent, I only his vnvveldy instrument, and so he only is
to be praysed; if ill, myne is the faulte, yet such as I hope shalbe
excused, bicause it vvas not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie. If thou reape commoditie by my
labours, I counte them vvel bestovved, bicause they haue the revvard I
looked for: if thou doe not, yet are they not loste, <hi>quia aliquid est
voluisse, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some thing it is to haue desired thy good,</hi>
and I haue taken no more paynes then thy good deserued. If the stile of my
booke please thee-not, refuse not gold, bicause it is ill fashioned,
and remember, that though the autour bee thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triman by byrthe, yet he is
more a straunger then an English-man by educatiō. If thou fynde faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
in the printing, yet fynd not faulte vvith the Printer, he knevv vvhat he did,
bicause he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not vvhat he printed; and I had not the leisure
allvvayes to ouer see his labours. If I seeme <pb facs="25"/>to speake to
sharpely some tymes, it is not for any toothe against any person, but
for hatred of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. And if thou take this my impolished vvorke in good
vvorthe, thou vvilte giue me the occasion and courage to take in hande
another, in vvhich I shall explane (as I haue in parte allready) and make as
plaine, and plausible, those pointes of the Catholike Religion, (to vvit
Indulgences, Merit, Satisfactiō, vvorship of Saintes, Images, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
vvith many such other) vvhich seeme to the deceiued, to imply iniurie to
Christe, or absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, as I haue discouered the grosse errours of
the Nevve Religion. But novv for a <hi>Vale</hi> and frein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly farevvel, I
beseech the to take this counsaile at my handes. Build not vppon that, not
so flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as false opinion, vvher vvith many vse to comforte them
selues, to vvit that thou maiest be saued in any religion. My second
booke vvill assure thee, that vvithout a true and intier faith, it is
impossible to please God, and that out of the true Church, 
<note place="margin">See the second booke, and 4. chap.</note>
there is noe saluation: As God is but one, the truthe but one, so his
Religion, Church, and vvorship is but one. This Church and Religion is not to
be found amongest the reformers, as my second booke vvill tell thee,
bicause it hathe all the markes of heresie: It is only to be found
amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the Catholikes, vvho are Nicknamed Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, as thou mayest
see by the same booke, and by some chapters of the first booke, and by
other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the other bookes, euidently demonstrated. The Catholike
Church then is the hauen of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <pb facs="25"/>to vvhich thou must
repayre, It is the porte of Saluation, the Arke vvherin Noe lodgeth &amp; his
familie, that is Christe and his faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, It is the barne vvhere
the good corne is layed vp, till the vvinovving day, It is the folde of
Christes Sheepe, The piller of truthe, The treasure-hovvse of Christes
Graces, The Shoppe of spiritual Negotiation, The lande of promise, The
paradise of the second Adame, The Temple of the second Salomon, The
misticall body of Christe, The terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial heauen of those that hope
to be blessed, The only vvay to life euerlasting. If then thou desire
to be free from tempests, and contrarie vvindes of disagreeing heresies,
direct thy ship and saile to this quiet hauen; if thou vvilt not make
ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvrake of thy soule, fly to this porte of Saluation; If thou vvilte
not be drovvned in the deluge of sinne or Infidelitie, haue recourse vnto
this Arke, out of vvhich none can escape damnation; If thou vvilte be of
Christes chosen corne, repose thy selfe in this his barne, vv<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> is
the only place of purging from the chaffe of sinne; If thou vvilte be one of
Christes flocke, ronne to his folde, that thou mayest be fedd vvith his
sheepe; If thou vvilte be sure of the truthe, keepe thy standing vppon
the piller of truthe; If thou vvilte bee enritched vvith Christes spiritual
treasures, this is the treasure hovvse of all his graces. If thou vvilte
traffique for heauen, and heauenly merchandise, enter the Shopp of Christe,
I meane his Church, the only pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of merit, and Christian negotiation; If
thou vvilte be pertaker of Christes promises, dvvell in <pb facs="26"/>the
lande of all his promises; If thou vvilte en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>y faelicitie, enter into this Paradise of the
second A. dame; If thou vvilte honour God vvith true sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and
vvorship, this is the only Temple, out of vvhich nether prayers, nor
oblations, nor sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, are pleasing; If thou vvilte receue any
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and motion from Christe the Head, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate thy selfe to the
Church his mystical body; and if thou vvilte bee pertaker of his spirite,
vv<seg rend="sup">th</seg> is the soule, and life of this body, dismember not thy selfe, that
thou mayest be a liuely member; If thou vvilte enioy the blisse of Angels
in the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per heauen, enter first into this lovver heauen, out of vvhich is
no hope to ascend to the higher; If thou vvilte attaine to life
euerlasting, passe by the Church, it is the only vvaye; If thou vvilt bee
one of the Church triumphaunt, bee first one of the Church militaunte; and if
thou vvilte haue God for thy father, take his Churche for thy Mother. Nothing
more dangerous then to liue out of this Churche, and no surer damnation, then
to dy out of this Churche. Be not carelesse therfore in seeking out this
Churche, and vvhen thou hast found it, differre not thy entraunce. It is thy
greatest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire, and a matter of most importaunce, bicause theron
depēdeth, not a temporall state of thy body, but aeternall saluation, or
damnatiō, both of soule and body. Farevvell, and pray for him that
vvisheth thee vvell, and prayeth for thee, that thou mayste do vvell. Iul.
