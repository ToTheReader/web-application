   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit the dulnesse of this time be such, (gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader in the Lord) that it rather mooueth manie to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with other mens writings, then to take paines, to write for the profite of any thing themselues: yet such is the zeale of some, that they cannot suffer men to sleep in the danger of sinne to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, but wil (if it be possible) awake them, &amp; let them know the deadly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger wherein they stand, which is a thing most needful, although it be neyther plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the worlde nor acceptable to the flesh: for who is he that seeth not the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the world in this age, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God and of his word, and doth not sorrow at the heart for it. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not possible, that any can truely sorrow, and sit still and say nothing, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when he perceaueth the moste part of all this blind age, by the craft of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, cast into a deadly sleepe of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble security. So that they neither care for the true knowledge of God, while they
<pb facs="4"/>
are young; nor think that they stand in neede of it being olde, but spend, or rather mispend all their time in the vain cares and pleasures of this transitorie world, without heedfull care vnto their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or giuing eare vnto their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence when the same accuseth them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victeth them, and condemneth them before God, as guiltie of infinite thinges, whereof one day they must giue an exact accounte, and at his handes receaue the wages of eternall death for their works, vnlesse they awake, while time is, truelie repent them of their former security, &amp; trye al their actions, thoughts, words &amp; deedes, by euery mans conscience, the which the Lord hath giuen him, both to be vnto him witnesse and iudge of the same. And therfore, to the ende that al men may doe this the better, to whose hearing or reading this discourse shall come. I haue thought it good, being moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in my conscience, to write this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise therof. Wherby eueryman may know his owne estate and his God, as he hath
<pb facs="4"/>
revealed himselfe in his worde to the worlde. Both the which points (saith <hi>Bernard</hi>) are aboue all things necessary for all men that desire to escape hell, and come to heauen. For as of the knowledge of thy selfe, commeth the feare of God &amp; of the knowledge of God, the loue of God; so of the ignorance of thy selfe, commeth pride, and of the ignorance of God &amp; of his word, desperation (saith he). Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whosoeuer will avoyde this deadlie dart of desperation in the ende, must not neglect the meanes which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to escape it. That is, first to know his sins, and heare his conscience, vvhen she accuseth or excuseth him according to the rule of Gods word. And next, to know the way of deliuerance from them And that he take heed, that in seeking a salue for them, he be not deceaued therin for conscience being wounded with sin, is that thing that neither can bee healed with coulors of Retorick, with sweetnes of musick, with delicacie of daintie meates, with beawtie and pleasant sights, with
<pb facs="5"/>
mans inuentions, or else with any other thing except onely Christ, as he hath offe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red and revealed himselfe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, apprehended by faith, &amp; receaued and kept with a good conscience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which, if any man liue &amp; dye, it had bin farre better for him, that vvith <hi>Kain</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudas</hi> he had neuer bin borne. Receaue therefore (gentle reader) this short discourse, wherein thou mayest see both what a thing conscience is, what an intollerable thing the grief &amp; wound thereof is when it is troubled. What are all the actions, and offices of it in al men and women. What are the sorts &amp; kinds thereof: what is mans duety touching it. How to get a good conscience, &amp; keepe it being gotten: and lastly, how to relieue &amp; helpe it being troubled, that it accuse and condemne vs not before our God, whose sentence when it accuseth, shall euer stand &amp; condemne vs without reclamation be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the Lord. But if not, then shall vve haue boldnes towards our God, to whom be glory for euer.</p>
