   <head>TO MY MVCH RESPECTED IN THE Lord, <hi>William White,</hi> Esquire; and to all other my louing friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, men, and women, children, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, of what estate and degree soeuer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Parish of <hi>Northiham:</hi> a <hi>gracious supply of all spirituall blessings in</hi> heauenly things, for the ioy and comfort of their seuerall consciences, and for the sure sealing of Gods loue and fauour in Iesus Christ, to the euerlasting peace, and saluation of their <hi>soules.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloued Brothren &amp; Sisters in the LORD: If there should bee a question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, who excels, and hath the preeminence, for birth,
<pb facs="7"/> for riches, for credit, and countenance in the world; or for humane wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, learning, and knowledge: This would bee found no ouer-hard or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible matter. But if it should bee questioned, what degrees there are of sinceritie and good affections to true Religion and godlinesse: this would not so easily be decided: The greatest part conceiting of themselues, that they are as neere to the Kingdome of Heauen, and walke as directly in the way that leadeth therunto, as the best.</p>
   <p>But I (my Brethren) endeuouring my selfe, (according to my place and calling) to be acquainted as well with your dispositions, and inclinations, as with your persons, (that so I might know the better, how to giue euery one his portion, and that in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) perceiue plainely among you, a very great difference. And although it bee not my office to looke into any mans heart, but as the words of his
<pb facs="7"/> mouth, and the actions of his life doe discouer the same, and make it appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: Neither am able, (if it were fit) to take a particular view, of the priuate and particular demeanour of euery one: Yet, if I be asked, how well I can call my Sheepe by their names;<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.3.</note> and what is the estate and condition of this little flocke: I speake it in the presence of God, (for I am so perswaded in my conscience, and finde by experience) that as there are some few amongst you truely fearing God, endeuouring to approue their hearts and liues vnto God, and to manifest that grace that is wrought in them, by the fruits of grace, &amp; who desire (in the vse of such ordinary meanes as the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed) to grow, and flourish, as greene Gardens, and as Trees planted by the Riuers of waters, in all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of sanctification, not only for their owne peculiar good, and for the sure sealing of their owne saluation; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb facs="8"/> for the good &amp; saluation of others, according to their places and callings, and that measure of spirituall gifts which they haue receiued:</p>
   <p>(A second sort also, who although they bee not so well grounded and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in Religion as the former; and therefore cannot possibly either haue such peace in themselues, or make such conscience of all their wayes: yet are tractable, willing to be instructed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished, and reformed: And thus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing good hope of a comfortable proceeding in the way of godlinesse and saluation:)</p>
   <p>So, are there many (on th'other side) whose mindes and affections are so wholly set vpon the profits &amp; pleasures of this world, as that they seem almost vtterly vncapable of the heauenly things. If they come to the Church (as sometimes they doe) when the holy exercises of Religion are in hand, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are asleepe, or so giue place
<pb facs="8"/> to idle, and carnall cogitations, that they nothing profit by any thing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: but returne to their houses as carelesse and secure, as ignorant and sencelesse in the mysteries of saluation, as they came from thence. Nay, some of them as vaine and common swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; as wilful prophaners of the Lords day; as malicious, as proud and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, as filthy talkers, as very lyers, slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, tale-carryers, Alehouse-haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the like, as euer before. The Word of God sounds in their eares, but can take no rooting in their hearts.</p>
   <p>Now of this third sort there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; (as I said before) yea, some such there are manifestly faulty in some of these, who in regard of their yeeres, education, and wealth, should be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter instructed, and giue better exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
   <p>They that are thus affected, as they cannot loue the Minister whom God
<pb facs="9"/> hath set ouer them, because hee is Christs Minister, nor yet any other that truely feare God, because they doe so; but are very ready vpon all occasions to oppose against such, to disgrace, despight, and discourage them to the vttermost of their power. So very small delight can either the Minister or any of the rest take in them againe: And so much the lesse, because seldome, or neuer, shall you heare any of these either penitently acknowledge any thing in them to be amisse; or in humility desire to bee taught and instructed, but (puffed vp with high conceits) are ready rather to wrest and peruert wholesome doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; yea, peremptorily to censure and controll, whatsoeuer either disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth their corruptions, or crosseth their peeuish and peruerse affections, how well grounded so euer it bee vpon the Word of God.</p>
   <p>This (my Brethren) is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="9"/> state and condition wherein (so farre as I am able to discerne) you presently stand. And let no man bee offended for this manner of discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, seeing it is done in the presence of GOD, and of his Church, vpon grounded experience, and without the touch of any mans person in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: For conscience also of my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that euery one of you might be the better mooued, and stirred vp to try and examine your seuerall soules, and finde how the case stands betwixt God and them.</p>
   <p>As I obserue this difference among the men of this Congregation; so hath late experience (much against my hope and expectation) discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the like betwixt you that are the women. But not iudging it fit in this manner to stand longer vpon it; I will onely admonish and put you in mind of these two things, which haue been formerly taught and applyed vnto
<pb facs="10"/> you. The one, that the nature and sexe of women is no sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or excuse; wherefore you may lawfully, or safely continue in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of heauenly things: or why the Word of God should not dwel in you plenteously,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16</note> in all wisedome and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vnderstanding.</p>
   <p>The other is, that seeing it is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall end of your Creation, that you should bee helpers;<note place="margin">
         <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18.</note> that therefore in the feare of God, according to the notable examples of <hi>Priscilla,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.3, 12.</note> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther godly women (whose praise is in the Scripture) you endeuour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the same end of your creation, in being helpers not onely at all times,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Phil.</hi> 4 3.</note> and in all good things to your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; but also to the Minister (as shee was to the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>) and vnto one another, in spending some part of the time, when you are together at one anothers house, and at womens labours, and when you feast and gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sip
<pb facs="10"/> together, for the edifying of one another in the holy Faith; by asking questions, and by calling that to mind which hath beene publikely taught, by exhorting, admonishing, and incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging one another in the way of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and by all other good meanes, as occasion is offered.</p>
   <p>And that it may appeare to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, to the ioy and comfort of all such as feare God, and to the silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the contrary-minded, that the saluation of you all, hath beene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeuoured, and sought after; I haue published this little Treatise, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining those speciall, and choise Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Christian Religion, vvith their seuerall Expositions (as neere as I could both for matter and forme) which you haue in writing, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not long since, you haue beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.</p>
   <p>These doe I desire to leaue behinde mee, for a perpetuall Testimonie and
<pb facs="11"/> pledge of my true and vnfained loue towards you all, and as my last Will and Testament; wherein I bequeath vnto you the very best gifts and Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which I haue to bestow. Onely, whereas in other Testaments vvhich concerne goods, and Lands, the death of the Testator giues life and power to the Will that is made, and vvhich before is of none effect: It is my will and hearty desire (if it may so also please God) that the Legacies thus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and bequeathed, may be possessed, and enioyed of you (to whom they are meant) euen whiles I liue. And that howsoeuer the time of my disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution cannot now be farre of; and my desire is to benefit many (yea euen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my death) yet, that I may liue to see some fruit of them, before I goe hence, and be no more.</p>
   <p>Herein (my beloued) shall you more comfort the feeble spirits, and bring greater ioy, and gladnesse of
<pb facs="11"/> heart to the ancient yeeres, and last breath of your deceasing Pastor (when God cals for it) then hath been all sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and griefe conceiued, for, and in regard of any former iniuries, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesses: what, and how great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</p>
   <p>And now, my last request is, that you, who haue religiously harkened vnto these Principles, and doctrines of Religion when they were preached, would be as diligent in reading, and meditating vpon them, beeing thus brought into the light; for the better establishing, and confirmation of your hearts &amp; minds in the truth:<note place="margin">
         <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.1.</note>
      <hi>for it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me not to write the same things vnto you; and for you it is a sure thing.</hi> And that you (on the other side) who haue carelesly regarded them in times past, would take the opportunity which the Lord doth offer, in thus putting them into your hands, and in laying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine before your eyes, to redeeme the
<pb facs="12"/> time past with a more religious care and conscience of the glory of God, and of your owne saluation. For the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of your eyes, &amp; sanctifying of your hearts &amp; affections whereunto: I heartily pray and beseech the Lord.</p>
   <p>And whereas (good M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>White</hi>) I am thus bold to make choise of your name (amongst all rest of the neighbours) in this Dedication: I haue done it for two especiall Reasons, and respects. First, that by this publike testimony of speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all respect, I might the better expresse the great desire which I haue of such true and vnfained loue in your selfe, and in yours, as whereof many yeeres together in the good neighbourhood, and godly conuersation of your decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed parents, I had good experience, and content: And that as a Successor in grace, as well as in nature, you shew and approue your selfe constant &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute for the nourishing and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of it; and not suffer the same by
<pb facs="12"/> the suggestions and subtilties of the contrary-minded, of such as are ill-af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fected in this kind, to be remoued frō you, or stolne out of your heart. The which to your worthy praise and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation in the Churh of God, will be so much the more, because such a succession and descent of true ancient loue towards their Minister in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of almost all the rest, is much decayd, if it be not already euen vtterly extinguished, and come to nought.</p>
   <p>The second reason is, that by this meanes, you might in a more speciall manner, be prouoked and stirred vp to true zeale, and seruency of Spirit, as well for the right vnderstanding, as for the profession and practise of these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Doctrines, and Principles of our Faith: wherin (together with the rest) you haue formerly beene instructed: And that not onely in regard of your own peculiar good, and saluation, and of those that are committed to your
<pb facs="13"/> charge in your owne particular Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but for the good example also, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, incouraging, and drawing on of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hers. For being the chiefe (through the Lords bounty and goodnes) in this place of your aboad, and hauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of all sorts vpon you: it is well worthy your serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and godly regard; how much more, then many others, you may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God; and what great good you may doe among your neighbours, in be ng a godly president, and patterne of Religion and vertue, in your life and conuersation, in shewing a good and cheerefull countenance, and in expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a true and sincere loue to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gospell of Iesus Christ, both in the Ministery, and in the profession of it; hauing no fellowship (in the meane season) with vnfruitfull works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but eschewing and auoiding them from the bottome of your heart. And (good Sir) bee you well assured,
<pb facs="13"/> that God doth require, and will looke for all this at your hands.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>And now,</hi>
