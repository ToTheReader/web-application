   <head>THE TRANSLATOR to the Reader.</head>

      <salute>Gentle Reader:</salute>

   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Confesse vnto you, when this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came first into my hand; which was about the 20 of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> brought as it should seeme by some of the last <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> company, I read it as a thing according to the Italian phrase, <hi>trouata</hi> or <hi>bugiarda;</hi> and christned it with this opinion, that it could march in no other rancke of veritie, then amongst our selues the <hi>Sussex Serpent,</hi> the <hi>German Ghosts,</hi> and the great Armie met in <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tarie</hi> marching by the <hi>Caspian</hi> shore ouer <hi>Taurus,</hi> all which of my owne knowledge came out of the shop of invention, and were beholding more to deuise, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religion or discretion: so that in a manner I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the translating of it, and put it from me with a kinde of contracted brow: but in truth there were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="4"/> reasons, which got the masterie ouer my Iudgment, and kept that a while predominant against further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption. First, the difficultie of the stile, being my self a very poore Linguist. For had not the pulling hooke of <hi>Florios</hi> Dictionarie brought many words neerer vnto me, they had all passed for strangers, and those which you haue, meerely come from the apprehension of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the coherence of the matter, rather then the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular signification of the words by themselues. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the time, wherein we liue, not like that concise Historiographer <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> who spake what he thought, and wrote what he spake; but we as soldiers vnder good Commanders, who must simply obey, and though neuer so wise, dispute not a word by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation with the busines imposed. Thirdly, a priuate conference with some <hi>Italians,</hi> who only put it off with a shrug of the shoulder, when any thing is distasting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: although some of them went further, and cryed out aloud, as their manner is, <hi>Cancro</hi> and <hi>Cazzo</hi> when they dislike a thing. Last of all, my owne poore affaires, which haue busied me otherwise, and out of the rules of moralitie tyed me to the preuention of wants, and that intolerable and insupportable vexation to depend vpon any mans bountie. For questionles Friendship now adaies is but like a fire from a painted cloth, which for all the braue show reflecteth no warmth: so that I may
<pb facs="4"/> well conclude with the Dutchman, he neuer fared worse then when he wisht for his dinner: notwithstanding all these reasons, and some thing else more pleasantly enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the importunitie of my freinds, and that same <hi>auri sacra fames,</hi> got the vpper hand of nicitie, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put the booke into my hand, but extracted this poore revolution out of a barren spring, which more and more I confesse opened her selfe from my owne affection to the matter and poore experience of certaine repinings euen amongst the <hi>Turks</hi> themselues, against the long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of <hi>Mahomets</hi> returne, being now full 40 yeere elapsed beyond their owne account, and his promise to bring them glad tidings of a new Paradice: and in truth when I considered those excellent praedictions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Antichrist shall not only be discouered, but euen punished in this world; that the Iewes should be recalled, and all apparantly to be seene before that doome of doomes, and scourge of incredulitie, the terror of the last iudgement, I cast vp a new account for the entertaining this relation, and rancked it thus in the maniple of my endeuors, which though it troupe with a file or two, yet according to the straitnes of the passage may serue the turne, as well as a greater Armie, or stronger forces. Accept it then, good Reader, and if you be not curious concerning the fullnes of truth, and infallibilitie of the matter; you may make this bulrush of noueltie hold vp
<pb facs="5"/> your head in the calmer waters of securitie, that you sink not ouer head and eares into pride, contempt, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnes. First, considering God hath such a worke to bring to passe, and he will finish it in his due time. Secondly, that although the <hi>Vrim</hi> and the <hi>Thummim</hi> cease, and miracles are very sparing; yet the heauens declare the glory of God, and many fearefull accidents haue bin prefigured by apparition. Thirdly, that therefore the heauens burne first to light vs the way to repentance, and seeing there must come a dissolution of all things, to prepare our hearts to put confidence in nothing: Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that we be not so stupefied, as not to admire the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> of hidden mysteries, but verily belieue there is something to be done, which we cannot apprehend by reason. Last of all, to continue our holy duties, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally priuate prayers, and contrition, which shall so molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our hard hearts, that they shall make the lifting vp of our hands as incense, and by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation moue God to continue his mercies, and auert his iudgments from vs.</p>
