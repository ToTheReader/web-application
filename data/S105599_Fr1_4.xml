   <head>MY DEARE READER, I beseeche thee to reade this Preface for thy satisfaction and myne.</head>
   <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Paynim historians report of a mayden called Glycera, greatly delighted in making of nosegayes, who could so fitly and properly varie and chaunge the disposition and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of the sweet flowers in her posies, that with the self same flowers, she would frame manie diuers kinds of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>segayes; in so much that the painter Pausias came short of his cunning, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as it were by emulation to expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se the varietie of her flower-workes, for he could not chaunge his colours into so many fashions in his pictures, but Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera would find more by a new maner of placing of her flowers in her nosegaies. Euen so doth the holy Ghost dispose and
<pb n="12" facs="7"/> order with enterchaungeable varietie the instructions of deuotion which he geueth by the tongues and pennes of his seruaunts; that the doctrine which they teache being one, and the self same: the discourse notwithstanding which they make, and in which they deliuer his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine do much differre, according to the diuersitie of methods, &amp; fashions (that I may so say) in which they be couched and composed. I cannot therfore, neither ought I, or would I, in any sort write in this introduction, any thing but that, which hath been alreadie published by our learned predecessours concerning this matter; they be the self same flowers that I present vnto thee (gentle reader) which diuers before me haue offered vnto thy view but the nosegay which I haue framed of them, is of a different fashion from theirs, as being handled in another forme, and wrought after another manner.</p>
   <pb n="13" facs="7"/>
   <p n="2">2. Those that haue treated of deuotion before me, haue allmost all attended onely to the instruction of persons all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together retired from worldly conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or at the least haue taught a forme of deuotion, which properly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally directeth and tendeth to that retired state of life. But my intention is particularly and principally to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct such as liue in cities and townes, busied with the affaires of their hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, or forced by their place and calling to folow their princes court; such as by the obligation of their estate, are bound to take a common course of life in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew, and exteriour proceeding; vvhich kind of persons for the most part of them, vnder colour of a see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or pretended impossibilitie, will not so much as once thinke vpon the vndertaking of a deuout life: persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them selues, that as no beast (yf we may beleeue the naturalists) dare
<pb n="14" facs="8"/> tast of the seed of the hearbe called <hi>pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Christi,</hi> so no man ought to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to obtaine the palme of Christian pietie, so long as he liueth in the presse of temporall occupations. To these men do I demonstrate: that as the mother pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les doe liue in the sea, not taking one drop of salt-water into their shelles; &amp; towards the Chelidonian Islands there be fountaines of sweet water in the middest of the brackish sea; and a small kind of flie called Pycaustes borne and bred in hot burning ouens and furnaces, flies in the flames without scorching her wings: so a vigourous and constant hart may liue in the world, and yet not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the vaine humours of the world; may find out fresh springs of sweete deuotion, in the midst of the brinish waters of temporall affaires; &amp; may flie without harme among the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of earthly occupations, and yet not burne nor seare the wings of holy desires
<pb n="15" facs="8"/> which lifte vp a deuout soule to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, although the bodie necessarily, tread vpon earthen mould. True it is in deed, that this is a thing of some difficultie: but therfore would I desire that many men would employ their cares in the attaining of so high à thing with more zeale then ordinarilie they doe, and they should find it not so vneasie as they imagine it. My self, weak and feeble as I am, haue endeuoured by this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, to cōtribute something of mine owne cost, toward the helping of such, as with a noble hart will vndertake this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.</p>
   <p n="3">3. Yet notwithstanding this present desire of mine, it was neither by mine owne choice nor liking, that this intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductiō came to the publique vew of the world. A certaine frind of mine, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed indeed with true honour and virtue, hauing some good while recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the grace of God, to aspire vnto a
<pb n="16" facs="9"/> deuout life; requested my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ayde &amp; assistaūce in this kind: &amp; I being many wayes obliged vnto him, and hauing long before noted in him à singular good disposition for this matter, easily suffered my self to be ouer-intreated by him, and too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke great care in teaching him to my power; &amp; hauing conducted him through all the exercizes, which I thought conuenient to his holy desire, and agreeable to his estate, I left him in writing for to help his memory these few rules, that he might haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to them when so euer he needed. Since which time he communicated them, vnto a great, learned, &amp; deuout person, who esteeming them so profitable that many other might reape commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by them, did earnestly exhort me to publishe thē: and easie was it for him to persuade me, because his loue had great power ouer my will, &amp; his iudgement
<pb n="17" facs="9"/> had great authoritie ouer mine.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Wherfore, that it might be more acceptable, I haue tooke a review of it, enterlacing many things in diuers places, and adioyning some aduices and instructions, fit for the purpose which before I sayd that I entend: and all this haue I done, hauing all most no leasure at all to spare. For which cause look here for no exact or curious discources: but onely a plaine heape of good aduertisments, simplie and nakedly set downe and declared in easie and intelligible woords: at least wise I desired so to doe. As for the adorning of the stile and language, I could not so much as think of it, as hauing other things enough to doe.</p>
   <p n="5">5. All my words throughout the book are addressed to Philotheus. For my intention being to reduce to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good many soules, that which I
<pb n="18" facs="10"/> had first writt for one onely: I think I may fitly vse that name which is cōmō to all such which wil be deuout and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligēt in gods seruice: for Philotheus is as much to say as a louer of God.</p>
   <p n="6">6. Therfore in all the treatise, laying before my consideration a soule which by exercise of deuotion aspireth to the loue of God: I haue deuided this intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction into fiue parts. In the first, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour by persuasions and peculiar exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cizes, to allure and winne the wille of my Philotheus, to an entire and fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me resolution of liuing well: which he maketh at length after a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, with a round and sound prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, seconded by the receauing of the holy communion, in which giuing vp his soule vnto his sauiour, he receaues his sauiour into his soule, and so entreth happelie into the retreat and closet of his heauenly loue, That done, to lead him farther on, I shew him two speciall
<pb n="19" facs="10"/> meanes how to vnite him self more &amp; more euery day vnto his diuine maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie: the one, the vse of the sacramēts, by which our good God commeth vnto vs: the other, the exercize of holy prayer, wherby he draweth vs vnto him self: and in this I spend the second part. In the third, I set before his eyes, how he may exercise him selfe in such virtues as be fit and conuenient for his profit &amp; aduancement: in which yet I onely bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie my penne, in laying together some particular aduices which I thought he could hardly haue had of another, or found out of him self. In the fourth part, I discouer the embushments and lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dennes of his enemies, shewing him how he may escape their snares, &amp; deliuer him self frō their enticemēts, that so he may goe forward without hindraunce in his worthie enterprize. In the fift and last part, I teach him to with draw him self as it were from
<pb n="20" facs="11"/> other ordinarie exercises to the cabinet of his soule, to refreshe his weerie deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and renew his holy purposes, taking breath as it were, and repairing his forces, that he may afterward cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageously get ground &amp; aduaunce him self in his iourney to perfectiō &amp; deuotiō.</p>
   <p n="7">7. Well do I see in this curious age of ours, that many will say, it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to religious votaries, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the particular guidaunce of soules, vnto this singular exercise of pietie, which requireth more leasure then a Bishop can well spare, charged with a diocese so heauie as mine is; that these deuout instructiōs too much distract the vnderstanding, which should be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied in affairs of greater importaunce. But as for me, to speak what I thinck, I say (deere reader) with great S. Denis that it appertaineth principally to Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops to conduct the soules committed to their charge vnto perfection: since their
<pb n="21" facs="11"/> ranck and order is supreme among men, as is the order of Seraphins among the quyres of Angels; so that their leasure cannot be better spent, then about such busines. The aunciēt Bishops &amp; fathers of the church were at the least as much affectioned to their charge, as wee: yet letted they not for all that to vndertake the particular care of guiding many sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, which singulary had recourse vnto their assistaūce, as it appeareth by their epistles. And heerin they imitated the Apostles them selues, who in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the generall haruest of all the world, gathered notwithstāding many times with peculiar care and affection, certaine notable scattered eares of corne; not onely contented to tye the vvhole sheafs of wheat, but also not disdaining euen to gleane, as they say, where they perceiued any remarkable soule, that in particular offered it self to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>are. Who knovveth not that
<pb n="22" facs="12"/> Timotheus, Philemon, Onesimus, Thecla, and Appia were the deare children of the great S. Paule? as S. Marck and S. Petronilla of S. Peter? S. Petronilla I say, who (as Baronius learnedly proueth, Gallonius folowing him) was not the naturall daughter, but onely the ghostly child of S. Peter. And S. Iohn the beloued disciple of our Lord, writeth he not one of his cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall epistles vnto a deuout Ladie, whome for her pietie he calleth <hi>electa,</hi> the elect, and chosen ladie?</p>
   <p n="8">8. It is a painfull charge I confesse, to take the particular care of soules, and conduct them in such singular manner in the way of perfection; but as painfull as it is, it bringeth withall excessiue comfort: much like vnto the painfull toile of thriftie husbandmen in time of haruest and vintage, who are neuer more merry, then when their hands are most full of such labours. It is a
<pb facs="12"/> burden which recreateth and reuiueth the hart of him that is loaden with it, through the abundāce of delight which floweth from it: as the bundles of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namom vvith sweet and recreatiue odour comforteth those that carie them through the boiling sands of Arabia. They report of the Tygre, that hauing recouered one of her whelpes (which the craftie hunts-man leaueth in the way, to busie her with all while he caries away the rest of the litter) she taketh it vp presently be it neuer so great, and finds her self neuer a whit the heauier or slower, but rather lighter and swifter in her course, naturall loue as it were lightening her with her very loade. How much more willingly then will a fatherly hart take vpon him the charge of a soule, which he finds all melting with desire of holy perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? vvhy should he not most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bear such a soule in his bosom (as I
<pb n="24" facs="13"/> may say) like as a louing mother doth her litle child, being neuer weary of cariyng the burthen which she loueth so entirely? But it must be indeed a fatherly hart that vndertakes so toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some a taske: and for that cause the Apostles and Apostolique men, doe call their disciples not only their children, but with a terme of more tender affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, their litle children.</p>
   <p n="9">9. To conclude (gentle reader) I confesse that I write of deuotion, being my self without deuotion, yet truly not without an earnest desire of attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therunto. And this very desire is that which hath giuen me courage to vndertake to instruct thee in the way to deuotion. For, as a great learned man sayd, it is a good meanes to become laarned, for a man to studie hard: a better, to heare a learned maister: but the best of all to teach another. And it often commeth to passe (saith S. Aug.
<pb n="25" facs="13"/> writing to his deuout Florentin) <hi>that the office of distributing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, serueth vs as a merit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the same things our selues: and the office of teaching, beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes a foundation of learning.</hi> The great Alexander, caused his louely Compaspe to be pictured by the pencill of the famous Appelles: who forced by often reflexion to contemplate wishfully Compaspes perfection, as he drew the lineaments of her faire bodie vpon his table, so imprinted he withall the loue of her beautie in his hart, and became so passionatly enamoured of her, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander perceauing it, &amp; pitiyng his case, gaue him her in marriage, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him self for his sake, of the dearest loue he had: shewing heerin (as Plinie iudgeth) the greatnes of his hart more plainly, then by any bloudie victory ouer a puissant enemie. I persuade my self that it is the will of God, that I should
<pb n="26" facs="14"/> procure in the best colours that I am able, to paint the formes of beautifull virtues vpon the harts of those which are committed to my charge, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the beautifull virtue of Deuotion, most amiable and acceptable in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine eyes. And I vndertake the office willingly, as well to obey, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme my duty, as for the hope I haue, that engrauing this louely virtue in the minds of other men, mine owne perhaps may wholly be enamoured of the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therof. And I doubt not, but yf euer his diuine maiestie perceaue my soule sincerely in loue with this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull virtue, he will bestowe her vpon me, in a happie marriage for euer. The faire and chast Rebecca watring Isaaks camels with a readie good will, was presently chosen to be his espouse, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out of hand in his name, pretious earings and golden braceletts, as pledges of his loue. So doe I persuade my self,
<pb n="27" facs="14"/> through the boundlesse goodnes of my God, that carefully leading his beloued sheep to the wholsome waters of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he will make my poore soule his spouse, fastening in my eares the golden words of his holy loue, and binding on my wrists, force and vigour to practize them, in which consisteth the essence of true deuotion; which I humblie beseech his heauenly maiestie to bestow vpon me, and vpon all the obedient children of his holy church. To whose decrees &amp; correction I do, and will, allway sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt my writings, my actions, my words, my wills, and my thoughts. At Necy, on S. Mary Magdalens day, 1609.</p>
