   <head>THE AVTHOR TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ILLIAM CECIL,</hi> Baron of <hi>Burghley,</hi> Lord High Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> (about <hi>16.</hi> yeers past) opened vnto me (farre from my thought) first, some memorials of State of his own: afterwards, those of the Kingdome; and from them, willed me to compile a <hi>Historie</hi> of Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Raigne from the beginning. I know not to what intent, vnlesse whilest he prouiding for the propagation of the Queenes honour, meant to take a taste of my abilitie in this kind. I obeyed, and indeed not vnwillingly, lest I should be thought to haue been wanting to the memory of the best Princesse, his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, and truth it selfe; which to me equals them both. For shee being esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and hauing hidden herselfe, my hope is to finde her there, or no where.</p>
   <p>But in the first entrie, a most intricate difficultie deterred me: I fell vpon whole masses of writings, &amp; instruments of all kinds, well enough digested for the computation of the times, but very confused for varietie of argument; in examining whereof, I was couered with dust and sweat. I diligently collected together fit matter, harder to find out than I expected: but he dying, mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie slackt. And after that, that incomparable Princesse had rendred her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine soule to heauen, I waited a while with a greedy expectation, not only who, but if some one, of so great a number of learned men, who by her bounty abound in riches &amp; leasure, would repay this due and deserued thanks. But when I had certainly obserued, that weightier affaires hindred some that were best able to performe it; others, (I know not for what causes) with specious excuses refused it: Afterwards, I eftsoones betook myself to my interrupted study, &amp; embraced it more vehemently than before. I sought all manner of helps on euery side, I se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> volued &amp; reuolued Characters of Kings &amp; Peers, Letters, Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons held at the Councell-Table; I ran through the instructions &amp; letters of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, &amp; likewise the Records &amp; Iournals of Parliaments, Acts &amp; Statuts, &amp; read ouer al Proclamatiōs. For most of which (as I ought) I hold my self chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to sir <hi>R: Cotton,</hi> kt. Baronet, who with great expence, &amp; happy labor, hath gatherd together most choice variety of Histories &amp; Antiquity: for at his torch, he willingly sufferd me to light my taper. So as <hi>(Reader)</hi> if in this I haue don any thing pleasing vnto thee or profitable, thou owest him the merited thanks.</p>
   <p>I haue also made search throughout mine own Cabinets; &amp; although I am an admirer of venerable antiquitie, I am not iniurious to later things: I haue seen &amp; obserued much, &amp; haue from elder men than my selfe, worthy of beliefe (who were present when these were acted, &amp; studious on both sides, in this diuision of
<pb facs="16"/>
Religion) receiued them, &amp; haue weighed thē in the ballance of my Iudgment, such as it is lest by a deceiueable credulity I should incline towards those which are false. For the study of <hi>TRVTH,</hi> as it hath been the only spur to prick me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to this Worke; so hath it beene mine only Scope. To detract from Historie, is nothing else than to pluck out the eies of a beautifull creature, and for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable potion, to offer poison to the Readers vnderstanding.</p>
   <p>All those things which are wont to hinder the light of Truth, I purposely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided, and as much as in me lay, haue vncased <hi>IGNORANCE</hi> &amp; <hi>FALSHOOD,</hi> by the light of a Witnesse pure &amp; neat, drawn from these <hi>VNSKILFVLNESSE</hi> &amp; her deriuatiues, <hi>DOVBT</hi> &amp; <hi>FALSITY</hi> haue I dispelled, as well as I could, by the splendor of an incorrupt faith, out of those monuments aboue al exception; &amp; it may be, from them haue gotten no lesse knowledge of those things, than they which haue had long &amp; great imployment in the Common-wealth. I haue auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>PREIVDICE,</hi> as an abuser of the Iudgement, which so infects the mind in affairs of Religion and the Reipublique; that like them that haue sore eyes, they see nothing cleerly. I haue not feared <hi>DANGER,</hi> no not from them, who by their present power thinke the memorie of the succeeding Age may be extinguished. And let them remember, that as many as haue beene iniurious to Writers, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the Truth, haue procured to themselues dishonour; to them glorie.</p>
   <p>The hope of a <hi>LITTLE GAINE</hi> misse-led me not; To make the dignitie of Historie mercenarie, I (who haue alwaies contented my selfe with a meane for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune) haue held sordid and seruile. I haue left no place to the <hi>SVSPICION OF FAVOVR OR PRIVATE GRVDGES;</hi> for of these I am to write of Scarce two were known to me by any benefit: by iniury, not one; that I should be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>PARTIAL</hi> or the <hi>OFFENDED.</hi> Those which are aliue, I haue scarse touched at. Inueighing against the enemies of my Countrie, I haue held it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, to hunt after the name of a good Patriot, with the aspersion of an ill Historian. These things haue I been carefull of, that (as <hi>POLYBIVS</hi> commands) I might <hi>SACRIFICE ONLY TO TRVTH.</hi> Neither shall any man, I hope, finde wanting in me, that ingenious liberty (ioyned with modestie) of speech, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of an Historian: That, which vnder a false disguise ioyned with the poison of obtrectation personates libertie, and is so pleasing to euery eare, I detest from my heart. Things <hi>MANIFEST,</hi> I haue not concealed, things <hi>DOVBTFVL</hi> I haue tenderly interpreted: the more <hi>ABSTRVSE,</hi> I haue not been too inquisitiue of; The vnsearchable intents of Princes (saith that Prince of Historie) and what they out of reasons of State pretend, is not fit to inquire; &amp; being doubtfull, not to be explored. And with <hi>HALYCARNASS AEVS,</hi> I am iustly angry which the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant critiques, who go about to know or find out more than is iustly permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. As to the rest, although I know, that matters militarie and politique are
<pb facs="16"/>
the proper subiects of an Historian, yet I neither could nor ought to omit Ecclesiasticall affaires (for betwixt Religion and policy there can be no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce. But seeing the Writer of the Ecclesiasticall Historie, may lawfully chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge these things, as proper to himself, I haue not touched at them otherwise than as it were with a light and cursory hand; whereas it is the Law and dignitie of an Historian, to run through the most eminent actions, and not to dwell vpon small ones: I haue not therefore laboured in them, yet there are pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of lesse cōsequence, which may concern another professor, though not him. I haue not omitted any circumstances, by which, not only the euents of things, but their reasons also and causes may be known; That of <hi>POLYBIVS</hi> pleaseth me exceedingly, If you take out of History, <hi>WHY, HOVV, TO WHAT END,</hi> and <hi>WHAT IS DONE▪</hi> and whether the Actions answer the intents, that that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, is rather a mocking than an instruction; And for the present may please, but will neuer profit Posteritie; I haue not betrayed my <hi>IVDGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT</hi> to affection for writing with an impartiall minde, I haue rather desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to finde out the affections of other men. I haue inserted little of mine own, treating of matters in another kind, it being a controuerted point, whether or no it be lawfull for an Historian to doe it. Let euery one abound in his owne sense: I haue thrust in no occasions, but such as were truly spoken; or those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to fewer words: much lesse haue I fained any. I haue seldome vsed Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, nor beautified my discourses with those obseruatiōs which the Greeks aptly call <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, my intent being as it were insensibly to instruct the minde. I haue shunned digressions; I haue vsed formall words; I haue not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected discriptions of places, pedigrees, nor Chronologies, following, as neere as is possible, the order of the Times; beginning the yeare (as our Chronologers were wont) from the first of <hi>IANVARY.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I haue inscribed my discourses with the name of <hi>ANNALS,</hi> because I place e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery passage in his owne yeare; and because <hi>TACITVS</hi> directs vs, that great &amp; illustrious Actions should be committed to Annals; whose principall office it is to take care, that Vertue be not obscured, and by the relation of euill words or deeds, to propose the feare of infamie, with posteritie. And that sterile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted kind of writing (such as mine is) is for Annals, of all other, most fit.</p>
   <p>With these beginnings I applyed my mind to write, with this resolutiō I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, &amp; intended to bestow the rest of my time and industrie, in the beautify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing polishing, and exornation of these Annals: and then by my last Will, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath them to my honorable friend <hi>IAMES AVGVSTVS THVANVS,</hi> who hath begun a Historie of his owne Times, with great truth and modestie; lest that, as strangers are wont, he, a man most deare vnto me, should like a traueller in a forraine Countrie, be ignorant of our affaires. But this resolution I was forced
<pb facs="17"/>
(I know not by what fate) to alter; for a great part being sent vnto him, some few years past, whē they were like rough-drawn pictures scarcely begun, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with blots &amp; imperfect places, swarming with errors &amp; patches thrust in, as they fell from a hasty pen, &amp; ill vsed by Transcribers: Out of these he took &amp; as it were inter-weaued some things into the eleuenth and twelfth Tomes of his Historie, hauing first polished them by adding, altering, substracting, but all with good iudgement (according to that order of the worke which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to himselfe) (for he intended a vniuersall Historie of his owne Time) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting some few things concerning <hi>ENGLAND</hi> and <hi>IRELAND,</hi> ommitting many things not only fit, but peraduenture necessary for vs to know, and I had heard that beyond the Seas, the Historie of English affaires was much (and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproach) desired; I therefore betook me to my intermitted study, read all ouer againe, corrected, added diuers things, refined the eloquution, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affectation; for it sufficeth me, if I may place this Booke like a picture in water colours, vnskilfully done, in a commodious light.</p>
   <p>But when all was done, I was much perplext &amp; irresolute, whether I should publish it or not. But <hi>CENSVRES, PREIVDICE, HATRED, OBTRECTATION,</hi> which I foresaw to display their colors, and bid battell against me, haue not so much deterred me, as the desire of <hi>TRVTH,</hi> the loue of <hi>MY COVNTRY,</hi> and the memory of that <hi>PRINCESSE,</hi> (which deserues to be deare and sacred amongst English men) did excite me against those, who shaking off their allegeance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Prince and Country, did not cease beyond the Seas, to wound aswel the Honor of the one, as the glory of the other, by scandalous libels, conceiued by the malice of their own hearts; &amp; now, (which they sticke not to confesse) are about to publish a Book to remain to posteritie, as a monument of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. As for me, I desire nothing more, than to be like my self, &amp; they like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Succeeding ages will giue to euery one their deserued Honor. I confesse with sorrow, that I haue not done so wel, as the height of the argumēt requires; but what I could, I haue done willingly. To my selfe, as in other writings, so neither in these, haue I giuen satisfaction. But I shall hold it more than suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, if out of an earnest desire to conserue the memorie of things, of truth in relating them, &amp; instructing mens minds with that which is wise and honest, I shall be ranked only amongst the lowest writers of great things:</p>
