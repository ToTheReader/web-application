of these were Henrison and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert

apprehended in suffock, 3. at Nayland,
for distributing of their Bookes, and
condemned, after the Iudge offered them
pardon, if they would live obediently, as
the book of Common Prayer did direct,
but they answered, that the booke of

Common Prayer? And they affirmed it
Idolatrous, and on this they were hanged

I knew 3 preachers, which fled in Queen
Maryes Raigne, and they were zealous
preachers; yet I perceived som difference
betwixt them, the one (Mr. Brodish) he
tooke a living neere where I lived, and
he was a zealous preacher. The other was

with him sundry times, and had
speech with him concerning Browne, and
he disallowed Brownes Separation, from
the hearing of the zealous preachers in

why they would not use the Booke of

and they answered, and said: because I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatours
