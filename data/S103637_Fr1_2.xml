   <head>TO THE HIGH

      <salute>MOst gracious Prince:</salute>

   <p>IT is not from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of such worth in my
labors, that they durst
looke so hye. A lower Patronage
would haue serued an hyer work.
<pb facs="3"/>
It were well, if ought of mine
could bee worthie of popular
eyes. Or if I could wring ought
from my selfe, not vnworthie
of a iudicious Reader; I knowe
your Highnesse wants neither
presents, nor counsells: presents
from strangers, counsells from
your teachers; neither of them
matcheable by my weakenesse:
Only duty herein excuses mee
from presumptiō. For, I thought
it iniustice to deuote the fruite
of my labour, to any other hand
beside my Maisters: which also
I knewe to bee as gratious, as
mine is faithfull. Yet (since euen
<pb facs="3"/>
good affections cannot warrant
too much vilenesse in gifts to
Princes) lest while my modesty
disparages my worke, I should
hazard the acceptation; heere
shall your Grace finde varietie,
not without profite. I hate a
Diuine, that would but please;
and, withall, thinke it impossible
for a man to profit, that pleaseth
not. And if, while my stile fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it selfe vpon others, any spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
profite shall reflect vpon
your H. how happie am I! who
shall euer thinke, I haue liued to
purpose, if (by the best of my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
I shall have done any good
<pb facs="4"/>
office to your Soule. Further
(which these times account not
the least prayse) your Grace shal
herein perceiue a new fashion of
discourse, by Epistles; new to
our language, vsual to others: and
(as Noueltie is neuer without
some plea of vse) more free, more
familiar. Thus, we do but talke
with our friends by our pen, and
expresse our selues no whit lesse
easily; some-what more dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedly.</p>
   <p>Whatsoeuer it is, as it cannot
be good enough to deserue that
countenance; so, the countenance
of such Patronage shall make it
<pb facs="4"/>
worthie of respect from others.
The God of Princes protect
your person, perfect your graces,
and giue you as much fauour in
heauen, as you haue honour on
earth.</p>

      <signed>Your Graces
humbly-deuoted
seruant,
IOS. HALL.</signed>
