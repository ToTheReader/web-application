   <p>COnsidering with my selfe (worshipfull <hi>Mistresse</hi>) the due desert proceeding to your person, the perfect proofe of pure pretence, in supporting and holding vp of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse exercises: was and is the occasion to incourag me of presenting this vnto your view. I am though vnskilfull yet not vnmindful of your deserts, which if I should take in hand to penne, I were like him which boldly and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

But when requisite remembraunce had deemed of Delay: Then presently p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
