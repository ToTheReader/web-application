      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F thou shouldest aske mee, why I would write of things so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated off, why I would write in such a method, I haue an answer at hand for both thy questiōs, though not one and the same for both: there lay a kinde of necessity on mee to write of one part of this treatise, <hi>The Lords Praier,</hi> (that drew on the rest) to disauow a <hi>sonne of the people</hi> that was fatherd on me, nothing like me nor my children, who though they are most of them rough-hewed like their father, yet haue they all their portion of wit and common sense. For the nouelty of the method, let this answer thee, that knowing that by many parasanges I could not come neere, nor attaine vnto the worthies of our Church, as many as haue written of these things a <hi>Caluin</hi> &amp; an <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin,</hi> a <hi>Ʋiret</hi> and a <hi>Ʋirell,</hi> a <hi>Perkins</hi> or a <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensis,</hi> with others whose learned comments and bookes of institution are in hand: I fell into this new forme of method, that thou mightest know though <hi>nihil est iam dictum, quod non sit dictū prius,</hi> &amp; al do sing but the very same song: yet we can in this age set out our learning in new fashions of word, and method, as the men of the age can set thēselues forth in new fashions of cloathes. Thou hast the reason of these my numbers, maiest thou vse them to thy profit &amp; comfort, fare thou well.</p>
