   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Omthing must be said to you (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader) although it be but for Formes sake; and it shall not be much, I have put forth some Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons here (you see) <hi>rude,</hi> and just according to the <hi>first draught:</hi> I could have proceeded (I confesse) to the <hi>second</hi> and <hi>third sittings,</hi> have added the <hi>lights</hi> and the <hi>shadowes,</hi> the <hi>graces</hi> and the <hi>rellishes,</hi> which make peeces beautifull; but the <hi>same reasons</hi> which made me <hi>expose</hi> them to the world, would not allow me time to <hi>pollish</hi> them. I am not yet so meanly conceited of my selfe, but that I will think there is <hi>somthing</hi> in them; nor yet so in love with what is mine owne, that I dare affirme that <hi>somthing</hi> to be any <hi>great</hi> matter,
<q>
         <l>— Qui se mirantur, in illos</l>
         <l>virus habe.—</l>
      </q> The Age we live in is full of Knowledge, so that should the spirits of our dead Ancestours returne to view their old habitations, they would finde by a strange <hi>Metem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>psychosis,</hi> the <hi>soule</hi> of <hi>learning</hi> wandred even into <hi>places</hi> where they left nothing but <hi>Barbarisme,</hi> behold great <hi>Clarks</hi> in <hi>russet</hi> coates, and an <hi>University</hi> even at the <hi>Plow.</hi> Bookes are dayly multiplied, and with those, the desperate Censurers, and therefore I cannot be ignorant of the danger I have put my selfe in, by this open way. It is very likely that I may repent the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of them, when I see the entertainment they shall have in the world: but it is also as probable that I may make some good uses of that repentance. I have already
<pb facs="4"/> tasted of the successe of the Presse in some of my younger studies, and therefore desire thee to be so faire, as not to interpret it vain glory, or an itch of being read in Print. No, my intent and end is good and honest, neither of which Titles can belong to thee, unlesse thou provest so charitable to beleeve me. Whether it be necessity in me, being in a low Fortune, (the common calamity of us Schollers) whether it be a perswasion of the good which may accrue to the Reader, or whether it be to feele the Pulse of the Times, that knowing the temper of their acceptance, I may hereafter or expose or suppresse some other things, or what other ayme soever I have, doth not much concerne thee to know, and I shall make it a suit that I may still keepe it private to my selfe. I am natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally an enemy to <hi>Apologies,</hi> otherwise I might tell you, that most of these were <hi>sudden births</hi> borne in a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Auditory, without any intent of ever shewing their heads abroad; but it is my fault to force them into a <hi>crowd,</hi> who would have beene farre better pleased still to have enjoyed a <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>chast solitude.</hi> The <hi>yeares</hi> I have past (I acknowledge) are not <hi>many;</hi> but my <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires</hi> to benefit Gods people, and to communicate those few good things the Lord hath beene pleased to bestow upon me, are <hi>farre above</hi> the number of my <hi>yeares,</hi> or <hi>abilities.</hi> There is <hi>good</hi> to be learnt from these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, if thou readest them with <hi>candour:</hi> but come with <hi>prejudice,</hi> and the best food is turned into poyson. If thou wilt needs be finding fault with me, (as there be a generation who suckt that humour from their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) be so kinde (I entreate thee) to let the <hi>censure</hi> thou layest upon me be <hi>milde.</hi> If thou apprehendest that I am somthing <hi>too bold</hi> in <hi>adventuring things</hi> of
<pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>this nature</hi> to the <hi>publique eye,</hi> not having <hi>haire</hi> enough to plead a <hi>fulnesse</hi> in me, while other men of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founder learning and larger reading, like deepe streams, passe silently on; be advised, and that for thine owne sake, (for feare there be other men who wil censure thee, even for that very act, and call thy judgement into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion) let the Title thou fastenest upon my offence, reach no farther at the most, then to the tearme <hi>forwardnesse;</hi> and then it is likely wee shall not <hi>quarrell</hi> for that: for two or three good words, it may be, will make me confesse as much, and withall grieve that I have occasions offered me to prick me on to that <hi>forwardnes;</hi> which for ought thou knowest, is <hi>contrary</hi> to my <hi>nature,</hi> how ever my <hi>out-side</hi> may <hi>appeare</hi> to <hi>those</hi> who are not well <hi>versed</hi> in my <hi>disposition.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>It is not impossible but there may be somthing found in this booke which may <hi>rellish harsh</hi> to many of our <hi>preciser</hi> people, and open their mouthes both against it and me: but I should shew my selfe an <hi>ingratefull Son</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>bad Subject</hi> to my <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> and an <hi>unequall spirited</hi> man in my selfe, if I should much esteem of the <hi>suffrages</hi> of <hi>those,</hi> who esteeme not at all of the sacred <hi>lawes</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> of their <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> nor of the blessed <hi>discipline</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> whose <hi>comly</hi> &amp; <hi>harmonious order,</hi> the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> (our neighbors round about us) do looke upon with envie and admiration. — But I feare I have already tyred thee with a <hi>Preface;</hi> so that I shall deterre thee from going any farther.—rest,—and so will I, till I have some other occasion to tell thee that I am</p>
