salutations.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath euer ben obserued frō
the firste creation, that nature
(by diuine prouidēce) hath in
all ages brought forth excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and heroicall persons: to
the great comfort of posteritie folowing. For as
the Adamāt naturally ceasith not to attracte &amp;
drawe to it iron and steele: no more haue these
ceased, from the inuention of suche thinges, as
vvere nedefull to mans vse. VVhich at the first
like as tender and small sedes (by times reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutiō)
haue grovvne to high and mightie trees
of small beginnings, by trauelles of noble and
ingenious persons, frō age to age, haue sprōg
so many sondrie sciences▪ artes, and professiōs,
as vve see at this daie. But for that in all times
the numbre of these haue been most small, &amp;
the multitude infinite of those that folow igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance:
prouidēt nature, being yet fruteful, hath
brought forth in this olde &amp; feble age of the
vvorlde, as vvell as in times past, diuine vvittes:
by whose laboures, the treasures of science and
knowledge, vnto this present gottē, should be
<pb facs="8"/>
preserued and defended from perishing, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
the forse of doultishe ignorance, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card
obliuion. Neither in my opinion are they
lesse worthy honor and praise, whose famous
actes mainteine, and cause freshly to floryshe
the precious monumentes of forworne age:
then the authours them selues. For as we owe
to the one the excellent inuention: so are we
debters to the other, for the diligent propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō
therof to vs their posteritie. Neither are we
more beholden to Apollo, for the first inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the nature and vse of herbes: then vnto
Hippocrates, who first seperating phisique frō
philosophie, made of his elders traditions, and
his owne diuine obseruations a noble arte.
And yet doth Galen merite no lesse honor &amp;
immortall fame then either of them. For he
hath largely vttered, that whiche Hippocrates
did briefly set out: opening plainly, that which
was obscurely writtē, adding that which semed
to wante: and commendinge their actes vnto
those that shold succede. what grateful mindes
we are of dutie constrained to showe to those,
that in this our age trauel in diuinitie, phisique
mathematicalles, lawe, historiographie, poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
Agriculture, and other profitable studies:
<pb facs="9"/>
not only the professours, but all Christian pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique
weales being tasters of the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
(though I be silent) can truly reporte. And
omitting that herein might be saide, I torne
my penne only to you, the worshipfull bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhode
of Chirurgians in London. vvhat
prayse and worthie fame, chiefly of you, and
then of those which haue nede of chirurgerie,
Iohn Halle one of your felowshippe haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued:
these his labours doe apparātly showe.
For where as for want of good authors in your
owne natiue tongue, chirurgerie haue not a
little decaied: she is nowe againe by his pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
trauelles not a little restored. And for as
muche as in all studies it greatly doth profite
to haue first briefe and compendious intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions:
he hath translated a short Isagoge
of that noble Chirurgian Lanfranke of Millā,
named Lanfranke his briefe. In whiche, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lanfranke oweth more to him for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
of his decayed worke, or he to Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franke,
for the immortall fame hereby obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
I can not easely iudge. But this I dare
boldly affirme, that Lanfranke before being
corrupted, and of small vse: is nowe by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures
of my friende Iohn Halle, purged and
<pb facs="9"/>
made pure so that henceforth, I may rightly
call it Halles Lanfranke. In which is set out cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiously
the curation of woundes, tumores
against nature (Lanfranke nameth them apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>)
vlcers, luxatiōs, fractures, and of certain
griefes and diseases of the eies, with a chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
antidotarie. But for because briefe treatises
want not obscuritie, especially to the yonger
students: Iohn Halle hath made an expositiue
table, setting plainly out as well the perfect na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of those simple medicines mentioned of
Lanfranke, as also of all the termes belonging
to the arte. And where as the preceptes of the
arte or approued medicines, can little profit
the body of man in all his partes not exactly
knowen, he hath also added a compendious
Anatomie, in whiche thou maiest easely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great laboure, learne that is herein requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site:
which booke of al the reste, would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be first redde, but also cōmitted to memory.
This good halle yet seaseth not, nor suffereth
his priuate gaine to call him awaye: but with
pitie beholding decaied chirurgery, to be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defaced by a rable of rōnagates, hath made
against them an historicall Expostulation: in
whiche he showeth the difference betwixt the
<pb facs="10"/>
chirurgien, and the rōnagate abuser. Al which
his workes, being set out to your great increase
in knowledge, requireth not only present thā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes:
but a perpetuall memorie to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you of him for euer. This author also
hath finished an other worke inuaying against
vice, and therfore named the court of vertue:
being nowe in the Printers handes. Takinge
these therfore his trauelles in good parte, he
frely and gladly offereth them to you, you
shall both eschewe the suspicion of ingratefull
Momus, and geue him occasion to attempte
greater thinges, to your cōmoditie and gaine.
