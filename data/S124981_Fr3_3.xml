   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in the former Sermon (belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Christ) there is laide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto thee the offence of the Israelites in desiring a king: So in this (the argument whereof was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise takē out of the first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the order of our church appointed for the Sabaoth then next ensuing) there doth
<pb facs="58"/>
follow some part of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, wherewith it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to scourge the mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented desires of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious people. In asking a king, they did wilfully cast off the ordinance of God, who had established anotherforme of gouernmēt amongst them: therefore (as this history doth euidently declare) the Lord hath now giuen them a King in his wrath, and as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he doth punish euery trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression in and by it selfe, so to a rebellious &amp; wilfull people he hath sent a stubborne and obstinate gouernour. The matter then of this latter Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="58"/>
depending so necessarily on the other going before; I haue thought it not amisse here to ioyne them both togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with equall labour of pē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as before they required not much vnequall time in their vttering &amp; deliuering: And being so vnited I do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them here ioyntly to thy godly consideration, praying thee in the same maner to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them, as they are now presented to thee, that is with a single sincere and wel-willing affection. Farewell in Christ, From Tanridge this xviii. of Iuly. Anno 1598.</p>
