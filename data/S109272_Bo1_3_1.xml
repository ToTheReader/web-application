      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>He holy apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saynct Paule (good childern) writteth expresse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Hebr. xii.</note> that withoute faith it is vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to please God.

He that beleuethe and is baptised, shall be saued.<note place="margin">Mat. xvi.</note> Now I trust ther is none among you, but he is desirous to please God, and enioye euerlastynge lyfe. Then yf you wyll attayne therto, you must chiefely and most diligently, applye youre myndes

to learne the christian faythe and the articles of the same. For you haue hearde that without it there is nothing able to reconcile vs to God y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> father, to pacifie his wrath and to bringe vs to the lyfe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng. For althoughe the tenne commaūdementes are an excellēt godly and heauenly doctrine, yet we can not be saued or iustifyed by theym. For we be not able of our owne strength and power to fulfyll the lawe and goddes holy commaundementes. But by theym, we onelye do learne what God requireth of vs, and so be brought to the knowledge of our synne.<note place="margin">Roma. iii.</note> For this is the office of the lawe (as saincte Paule sayeth) to teache vs our offences and to set before our eyes the great feare of God and the indignation whiche we haue deserued by breakynge
<pb n="cvi" facs="128"/>
his commaundementes, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that we acknowledgyng our owne weakenesse, shoulde flye to Goddes grace and mercye.</p>
   <p>This feare of God is learned in the ten commaundementes, and it is the begynnyng of wysedome But the holy christian fayth is a muche more hyghe and excellente knowledge and wysedome, as sayncte Paule wytnesseth saying.<note place="margin">i. Cori. ii</note> We speake wysedome amonge theym that are perfecte, such wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as is not of thys worlde, nor of the rulers of thys worlde, whiche be mortall, but we teache the wysedome of God, whiche is secret and hyd, which God ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before the worlde vnto oure glorye, whiche wysedome none of the rulers of this worlde dyd knowe. These be the wordes of sayncte Paule, whereby he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="129"/>
that the science of fayth pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth al other sciences, and teacheth heauenly and eternall wisedome that excedeth all mennes philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phye. For by faythe we learne to knowe God, what he is, and what loue he beareth towarde vs, and howe great benefites he hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vpon vs. For by fayth we be made y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> childrē of God, and he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto vs the holy goost, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che doeth lyghten and kyndle our hartes, that we maye begynne to kepe hys lawe, whiche els of our owne strengthe we were not able to kepe and fulfyll. Wherfore good children it is necessarie for you to learne y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> doctrine of faithe, for without it we can not be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or brought agayne into gods fauour. For no man is iust or rightuous before God, that hath not the holy gost, and he that will

receyue the holy gooste, muste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in Christe (for by faith we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the holy goost) therefore by faith we be iustified. Agayne yf we wyll be saued, we must knowe God and our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Ioh. xv</note> as it is written Iohn the .xvii. But we can not knowe God and his sonne Iesus Christ but by faith, therfore faith iustifieth vs and bringeth lyfe euerlastyng. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore good children ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye your selfes dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygently to learne▪ the Christian faith the which nowe I wil shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely reherse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
