      <hi>that we should not beleue all that is said,</hi> I thought it not conueniēt to beleue the publick fame that reported vnto vs, that you M.

VVherfor as euery one that is desirous to ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the truth, when rumors are spred inquireth of the authour as occasion serueth for furder triall and better creditte of the thinge: Euen so I longing to heare whether the doctrine vttred in the said booke, be the doctrine of all your church of Englād, or the fansie only of one idle brayne, make this request to you and the rest of your bretherne, for furder certificate, and surer knowledg of this. For albeit the wynkīg at the setting forth of it, the permitting it to be sold, the suffring the authour to triūphe of it at the Crosse, and the not forewarning the people to be ware of it, and longe silence to maister Dormans request,<note place="margin">M.

from you. As you therfore tender the honour of God, truth of the Ghospell, and wealth of their soules, whome you pretend to bring to Christ: So let vs be aduertised whether you will iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie all the doctrine vttred in that boke, as the receaued and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued doctrine of all your newe church of England or no. The request is reasonable: yf you refuse it, we shall iudge of your silence accordingly.</p>
   <p>Lest you should hafte in this cause, and finde some friuolous excuse, as distemperature at the full of the mone, businesse in ministring of othes, care in sending promoters to the hauens, aegernesse in searching after bokes, and trouble in seeking after non communicants, and zeale to apease the contētions amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the brotherhoode for the weightie matters lately in hand, and pretend that you haue no leysure to take a newe viewe of that old worke, I haue drawē out certayne of his positions, and quoted the places in the margent, where you shall finde them. And as I truly in effect repete them: So doe I most earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and challenge you and all the rest of the superintendents (that must be ready to geue an accompte of their doctrine to al that aske) to geue notice and signification by some pamphlet in print, whether it be the receaued and approued doctrine of all the newe church of England able to be iustified by the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and vndoubted word of God,<note place="margin">M.

   <p>These with diuerse other which I omitte to repete, are his positions and paradoxes, these are his resolutions and sayings, as you may see in the places quoted in the margent. Nowe yf you haue priuiledged and allowed them as the receaued and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued doctrine of all the newe church of England, for them and euery one of them we require proufe out of the playne and vndoubted worde of God, out of the true and godly fathers of the church, within six hundred yeres after Christ, and out of lauful councells, within the said terme, or within these xiiij. hundred yeres. And that the world may see your playne dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in this behalf, Ley downe the scriptures plainly without corruption, ley downe the fathers wordes truly without falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying. Ley downe the canons of the councells simply without all clipping, chaunging and inuerting their wordes. Or yf you haue neither scriptures, nor fathers, nor councells for proufe of them, condemne them as blasphemous, wicked, and vngodly, able to be mayntayned neither by scripture, councell, nor any
<pb facs="5"/>
godly fathers of the church. Yf you suffer this doctrine to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede and haue increase, as it is sowed, we may say vnto you, as the vertuous emperour Cōstātine saied to the Arriās assembled at a Synode in <hi>Tyrus:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 7. histor. Tripart.</note>
      <hi>Vos autem qui sancta mysteria eius clementiae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre videmini, non dicam custodire, vos inquam nihil agitis nisi quae ad contentionem noscuutur &amp; odia pertinere, &amp; vt absolute dicam, quae ad humani generis tendere videntur interitum.</hi> You who seeme to bring foorth, I will not say keepe the mysteries of his mercie, you I say, doe nothing but that which is knowen to pertayne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and debate, and seme to tende, (that I may speake fully and wholy as it is) to the destruction of all man kinde. Or yf you fansie not Constantines saying, I will say vnto you as that valiaunt Emperour Charles the fyft sayed of Luther in his edicte set forth at VVormes in this sort: <hi>Lutherus scribit nihil ferè aliud, nisi quod ad seditionem, schisma, bellum, caedes, rapinas, incendia, &amp; ad defectionem vniuersalem Christiana fidei tendit atque subseruit:</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writeth almost nothing els, but that which tendeth and serueth to sedition, schisme, batail, slaughter, robberies, burnings, and to the generall reuolt and defection of the Christiann faith. Or yf that like you not, we will say of you as our noble king, Henry of famous memorie spoke of the same friers faction. <hi>Nulla vnquam factio fuit ita seditiosa, Pestilens, nepharia,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Epist. ad duces Saxo.</note>
      <hi>quae sic religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem omnem tollere, leges omnes ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ilere, mores omnes bonos corrumpere, res publicas omnes euertere, machinata fit, vt nunc ista coniuratio Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana.</hi> There was neuer factiō so seditious, so pestilēt, so wicked, which so endeuored to take away all religion, to oppresse all Lawes, to corrupt all good manners as this conspiracie of the Lutherans doth nowe. The counsells of Christe in his Ghospel, to be called ordinances of the diuell, suffrages helpes to hel, The lawe of God and his church forbidding hym that diuorceth an adulterous {per}son to marry another whiles the partie lyueth, horrible and impious, the prayers of Christians a sacrifice of the diuel, Christ no lawe maker, and his Ghospel no Lawe, what is to endeuour to bring a generall reuolt and defection from all Christian religion and faith, yf this be not Grindall? Consider it, you were best. The matter is weightie, and the tyme perilous.
<pb facs="6"/>
And whereby a figure called <hi>praeoccupatio,</hi> you chardge vs that our bokes are seditious, yf it may please you to examine them indifferently, it will easely be espied whether your diuines bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes breathe sedition, or ours. Let the lerned iudge: praysed be God, There is no blast blowen against the monstruous regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt of womē. There is no libel set foorth for order of successiō: there is no word vttred agaīst dewe obediēce to the soueraine.</p>
   <p>As for corrupt gaynes which is another foule fault that you chardge vs withall, we are thankes be to God so farre from all iust reproufe in this behalf, that euer more we were content to geue the copies of our bokes and gaynes whatsoeuer it were, to him that would bare the chardges of the print, and conuey them into the realme. And as yet, yf it will please you either to send vs mony to bare such necessarye charges, or apoynt some frend of yours that will faithfully print and trulye set them foorth to the sight of the worlde, you and your factour shall haue all the gaynes, that may be made. At this present I haue gathered together maister Calfhils lies, contradictions, false translations, falsifying the scriptures, corrupting the doctours, which will make a pretie volume, and because I could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently set them foorth together with this replie, I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued them to another tyme. Nowe yf it wil please you to trie whether I wil stād to the performāce of my promise, send your factour with your lettre and he shall be heard with the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions afore mentioned. S. Augustine declaring certayne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the hartes in the forest,<note place="margin">In Psa. 41</note> saieth: They rūne very swift to the foūtaynes ād ryuers, they kil serpēts, and after the killing of thē are very thyrstie, and when they will swymme ouer into any other cuntrie, they ley their hornes one vpon another: and applying that to vs, he saieth: <hi>Sic nos Christiani debemus velociter currere ad fontes aquarum, &amp; vitia, serpentes iniquitatis nostrae interime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, vt amplius desideremus fontes veritatis: Debemus inuicem onera portare &amp; sic adimplere legem Christi.</hi> So we Christen men ought to runne swiftely to the fountaynes of water, and kill synnes, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes of our iniquitie, that we may the more desire the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes of truthe, we ought to beare one anothers burden, and
<pb facs="6"/>
so fulfill the lawe of Christ. Nowe yf your zeale be such as you pretend to the Christen religion, and furderance of truth geue vs leaue to runne to the fountaynes of water, to kill the serpents of iniquitie, to impugne your heresies, to detect your ministers lies, keepe not our bookes from them, that would come to the fountaynes of truthe, but as you loue the truth, so beare part of the burden with vs, and fulfill the lawe of Christ. God send you his grace, and spirite of truth.</p>
