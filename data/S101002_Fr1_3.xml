      <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>Ing <hi>Dauid</hi> the man beloued of God after his owne hart (Right Honorable and most worthy <hi>Mecenas</hi>) though he was also the faithfull feeder, the Shepheard of God,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7.</note> the seruant of the Lord, the Conquerour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible, the Captaine of the destitute, the sacred Psalmograph, the melodious Musitiō, the sweet singer of Israel, and Patrone of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the praise-worth Prophet of God the annointed of the Lord, and princely figure of Christ, the soueraigne King of all kinges: Albeit (I say) he was such an earthly personage, endewed with mo heauenly graces, then euer any was either before or after him: yet, in himselfe feeling, and of himselfe confessing great and manifolde infirmitie of humane nature, by many his most greeuous conflicts betweene the Spirit and the Flesh, suffering (according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that old beaten souldier of Christ) <hi>Inward feares, outward feightinges.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.<hi>5.</hi> he found also by experience in the world both inward and outward enuy, both domesticall and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine enmity, and vnder the handes of the highest <hi>Iehouah,</hi> both temptations of abiections, troubles of deiections, and tryalles of his truth, constant faith and vnfained conuertion.

to them that loue God &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 8.28.) amongest his other greeuous complaints in his sacred Psalmes, to mollify his miseries with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating of Gods mercies, hee eftsoones tooke into his handes the harpe of his heauenly harmony, sounding thereuppon and singing to the same such like consolatary conclusions of Gods goodnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his elect, as this is: <hi>Great are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord deliuereth him out of all.</hi> Psa. 34. vers. 19. And againe such like testimonies of Gods indignation against the reprobate as this is: ibid. <hi>But mallice shall slay the wicked, and they which hate the righteous shall perish.</hi> vers. 21. That these effectes apparantly were thus proued in him and his enemies, the history of his life and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the euents of his enemies enterprises most euidently do testify. For it was a thing past his and all humane expectation and helpe, that he so mighty a Personage, aduaunced from the sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooke to the scepter. 2. Sam. 7.8. From a Kings page. 1 Sam 16.21 to a kings personage. 1. Sam. 5.3. Long persecuted by Saul. 1.

It was (I say) a thing impossible with man, and past all his expectation, that this desolate <hi>Dauid</hi> should find such fauour with God and man, as to reobteine a right recouery of that, which he had before lost with so great iniustice, viz. Gods grace and fauour, his estate of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, kingdome, life, and felicity: Notwithstanding, such was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, presence &amp; promise of the most highest <hi>Iehouah</hi> (as is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the holy Ghost, the true witnes of Gods most worthy will &amp; working herein. The Lord in his mercies so looked vpon him with his louing fauour, that he searched the secrets of his hart, heard his sorrowfull sighes, salued his sore, renued his spirit, remitted his sin, healed his harmes, saued his life, prolonged his dayes, continued his kingdome: and finally, <hi>clothed his enemies with shame, but made his Crowne to florish,</hi> Ps. 132. vers. 19. Then all which blessings none could bee more at any time or greater, by God bestowed vppon any mortall Prince or Potentate vpon earth: whereuppon highly commending the great goodnesse and mercie of Almighty God as the onely vmpier in this spirituall and corporall conflict, well and worthily ascribing the glory of this triumph vnto the highest <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah,</hi> doth this learned expositor <hi>Victorinus Strigelius</hi> thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly

But this diuine <hi>Dauid,</hi> the Lords Conquerour so fought his battels against the enemies of God and his truth, as this interpreter inferreth of him in the 7 Psalme, that the very youthes of his people and dominions, might at home in the Church and Scholes heare, reade, learne &amp; profite in the law of <hi>Moyses</hi> and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Prophets, touching the promises infallible of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting kingdome of Christ, and the saluation of all the faithful for euer: of which euerlasting kingdome, <hi>Salomon</hi> sonne of the said K. <hi>Dauid</hi> was also a liuely and expresse figure, as in the 45.
