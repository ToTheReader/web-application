   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou will say; what neede all this wast? this labour might haue beene well spared. For seing the same argument hath ben hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led long since, and of late; learnedly, and at large by men of our ownes: what neede this foraine ayde? In such aboundance of wits and writings, to transport <hi>Sarauia</hi> out of Latine into English, is to bring owles to Athens, and to carry stickes to the wood; as it is in the Prouerbe.</p>
   <p>True it is: the cause hath ben vndertaken long since; but it was late first: and of late; but it was long first: And the same hath ben maintayned learnedly enough; if not with learning too much: and it hath ben handled at large also; yet all little enough: Such is the female misconceit, of the lasciuious male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and the male miscontent of the learned ignoraunt of this age, <hi>euer learning and neuer able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Notwithstanding, seeing in the iudgement of the most wise and best learned, this <hi>Germane</hi> Booke seemed for sound iudgement inferiour to none, and for graue discourse equall to any, it was therfore thought by them an action no lesse commodious to the people, then commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to the Author; that he, who in the causes of present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, hath propounded his iudgement vnto all, shoulde haue his iudgement expounded vnto vs. The which although it hath beene curstly censured by a certaine suspicious and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Criticke, emulous of his betters credite, who in his professed lectures hath vsed the remembraunce of his name in disdaine, with <hi>Sarauia nescio quis:</hi> Yet his best auditors there, and others his betters elsewhere, haue found this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene <hi>Sarauia</hi> and him: that, besides his great learning, and no lesse experience (of the which this great Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor neuer had the one, neuer will haue the other) <hi>Sarauia</hi> hath made knowen to him and the whole world, by this his
<pb facs="5"/> resolute definitiue, <hi>who he is:</hi> whereas the other in one whole tearme hath so behaued himselfe in the same cause, that albeit wee all know <hi>who he is,</hi> yet we could neuer tell <hi>where to finde him.</hi> So hoppeth he betweene the stone and the Altar, that as a man distract betweene feare and flattery, he maketh vp his doubtfull resolution with this harmelesse confession, <hi>Sentio quod sentio; quod? nescio.</hi> I know what I know, what? I doe not know.</p>
   <p>I, but now we see the aduerse part (partly by theyr lawlesse outrage, and partly by theyr lawfull restraint) to be nowe as impotent in their faction, as they are odious in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be at this time as vnable, as they were at all times vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to preuaile: and then, what neede we any longer striue when the ennemy can no longer stand? I aunswer; that their increase was seene long since, to be at the full, and their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite appeareth euen now to be in the Waine. For the which as we are to giue God thankes, (who in taking Iustice vpon some of them, hath taken pitty vpon the whole Church,) so likewise are we to pray for the rest, that in good time we may see, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theyr speedy amendement, or their present preferment: (For it is time (O Lord) that thou haue mercy vppon Sion, yea the time is come.) Notwithstanding, in the meane time wee haue entertained this profered aide, not so much to inuade the seditious brethren, or to bring home the resolued recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, as to strengthen the godly Subiect, and to bring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the well affected Protestant. With the which if any man finde himselfe agreeued let him shew for it; but so, that <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia</hi> may vnderstand what he saith.</p>
   <p>For my part; if I haue conceiued him right, the fruite is yours: if I haue deliuered him not right, the fault is mine. Sure I am, the Author meant you well; and my Authors: And so doe I.</p>
