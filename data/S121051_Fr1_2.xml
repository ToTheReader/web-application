earnestly intreated since, by some of my good friends, to giue way that it might bee printed. And though I am not ignorant of mine own inability: yet because I know that God can, and doth worke, as well by weake, as by greater meanes; I haue yeelded to their request. I confesse it is written in a rude &amp; homely stile, and I doubt not, but the curious censurers of this age, who like nothing but that which is for their owne humors, will carpe &amp; cauill at the plainenesse of it: but my desire was to make it appear, that as <hi>Barnard</hi> sayeth, in the like case, I rather sought <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> then <hi>Ostentation.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the meanes of that mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
