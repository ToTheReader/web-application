There is required in all magistrates both a fayeth and feare in God, and also an outwarde policye in worldly thynges, wherof as the one is to be learned by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so the other must chiefly be gathered by readyng of histories. For in them men may see the groundes and beginnynges of cōmen wealthes, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> causes of their encrease, of their prosperous mayntenaūce, and good preseruation: and againe by what meanes they decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, decayed, and came to ruyne. There the vertues and vices of men do appeare, howe by their good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynges they florished, &amp; by their euil actes they decayed. How they prospered so lōg as they mainteyned iustice, persecutd vice, vsed clemencye &amp; mercye, were liberal, religyous, vertuous, and voyde of couetousnes. And contrariwise, howe they fell into manifold calamityes, miseries, &amp; troubles, when they embraced vyce and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soke vertue. In historyes it is apparāt how daūgerous it is to begyn alteracions in a cōmen wealth. How en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
<pb facs="3"/>
&amp; hatredes oft risyng vpō smal causes, haue ben the destruction of great kyngdomes. And that disobeyete of hygher powers, &amp; suche as rebellyd agaynst magy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, neuer escapyd punyshment, nor came to good end. In theym there be presydentys for all cases that may happē, in folowyng the good, in eschuyng the euyl, in auoydyng incōuenyences, &amp; in forseyng mischiefes. In them may be learnyd how to temper in prosperitye, how to endure in aduersytye, &amp; after what maner men should vse them selues both in tyme of peace &amp; warre. As in all artes there be certeyne prynciples and rules for men to folowe, so in hystoryes there be ensamples paynted out of all kynde of vertues, wherin both the dignitye of vertue, &amp; foulenes of vyce, appeareth much more lyuelye then in eny morall teachyng: there beyng expressed by way of ensample, all that Philosophy doth teach by waye of precepts. Thys is suche a kynde of knowledge, as make men apt euē wyth smal experyēce eyther to gouerne in publyke matters, or in their owne pryuate affayres: For by cōparyng thynges past, wyth thynges presente, men maye easelye gather what is to be folowyd, and what is to be eschuyd. And he whyche can reade thē wyth such iudgement, waiyng the tymes wyth the causes and occasions of thynges, shall bothe see moste deepelye in all matters, best declare hys opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, &amp; wynne most estymaciō of prudence &amp; wysdome. For if aged men be estemyd for the wysest by reason of their experyēce. Or if Homer paynted forth in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> persō of Vlyxes, the ymage of a perfyte wyse man: imputyng the cause therof, to the knowledge he hadde gatheryd by traueylyng many coūtreyes, &amp; by vewyng and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng the customes and maners of dyuers nacyous.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>Then such as be wel experte in hystories and by the well applying of them, can take the due fruite pertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the same: must nedes obteygne profoūdnes of iudgement, with a stable and groūded wysedome. For in them men may beholde as it were before there eies, both the whole worlde, and the gouerment therof, with the policies and lawes, the discipline customes &amp; mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of al people from the begynnyng. Thys is suche a thyng, that who so euer is clerely voyde of it, though he be endued wyth neuer so greate a wytte otherwise, with such aptnes of nature, or other goodly vertues. Yet when he shall haue to do in weyghtye affaires, he shall fynde a certeigne mayme and imperfection, not onely in ciuyll gouerment, but also in the matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining to the warre.</p>
   <p>For al though in an excellent capitaine nature must geue the chiefest partes, that is to say: hardines, stowte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of stomacke, wyth a natural wisdome and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: by which qualities onely (experience therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to adioyned) diuers haue become famous capitaines.</p>
   <p>Yet thys is a thynge that geueth a greter policye, groundeth a deaper Iudgemente, addeth a further or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and glory, and formeth a perfitnes &amp; an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie in a shorter space. The shortnes of a mans liefe shortened besides by so manye casualties, is the cause that men be taken awaye before the canne get suche an actual experience as may make thē perfite, and cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly become rotten, before they canne attayne to a rypenes in knowledge. But by thys kynd of learning in youth a man is become aged, he hathe knowledge wythout experience, he is wyse before it is loked for, he is become a councelour the firste houre, and a man of warre the fyrste daye. The same thynge hath bene
<pb facs="4"/>
verified in manye, whych in young age haue bene pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente councellours, and in small experience politique capitaynes. Alexander hereof is an euidente ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who, brought vp vndre Aristotle in learnynge, and so geuen to this kinde of studye, that he had Homer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes laied vnder his beddes hede (wherby he myght be admonished of the vertues and offyce of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prynce) entered into hys kingdome, whan he was but .xx. yeares of age: and neuerthelesse bothe establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed hys owne estate wyth suche prudence, that wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in shorte space (besides the enlargynge of hys owne boundes) he subdued the greatest parte of the worlde. And albeit he began so young, and continued so smale tyme: yet no mans actes be comparable to his: beinge counted the most excellente captayne from the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng. But if eny man wyl impute the greatnes of his doynges to the perfyte disciplyne the Macedons vsed in the warres, and to the politique Capitaynes, and expert souldiers, left to hym by hys father Phyllyp: it shal appeare euydētly by the decaye of Realmes when they haue bene gouerned by imprudent Prynces, and by the ouerthrowes the Romaynes receyued when they were conducted by euyll Capitaines, that no pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of counsellours can take place, nor eny dysci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyne or experience of the souldiours can auayle, if the heade be not a mā of excellēt vertue. There is nothing newe vnder the Sunne (as the wyse man faith) and it is impossible for eny thing to chaūce either in the war or in cōmon policye, but that the lyke maye be founde to haue chaunced in times past. Al which thinges laied vp in memorye, as in a place of store: mē may alwayes be furnished for all chaunces that maye occurre. Seing histories be then so good and necessary, it were
<pb facs="4"/>
muche requisite for mens instruccion, that they were translated into suche toūges as most men myght vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstād them: and specially the histories of antiquitye, whych both for the greatnes of the actes done in those daies, and for the excellencie of the writers haue much maiestye and many ensamples of vertue. I therfore hauyng alwayes desired that we englishmē might be founde as forwarde in that behalfe as other nations, which haue brought all worthie histories into their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall language, did a fewe yeares paste attempte the translacion of Quintus Curtius, and lately vpon an occasion performed &amp; accomplished the same. Whych auctour treating of thactes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> great Alexāder, being figured in the Prophetes, Ieremie &amp; Danyel, &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioned in the first boke of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Machabies, seme to haue bene borne, and brought forth into the world, not with out a mooste speciall prouidence and predestinacion of god: who prospered so his procedinges that (as Iustine writeth (he neuer encountred with eny enemyes whō he ouercame not, he beseiged no citye that he wanne not, nor assailed nation that he subdued not. Thys so worthie a matter I thoughte good to dedicate vnto youre grace, folowyng their ensample that haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyled in the like studye, whiche are wonte to declare their good willes, by bestowing of their labours. Therunto I was also moued y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> rather, by considering y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> qualities of your grace, which seme to haue certeine affinitie and resemblaunce wyth such as were y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> very vertues in Alexander. For Arianus writeth of hym y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he was of a semelie stature, bolde in his enterprises, stowte of stomack, moderate in pleasures, wise in coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle, and prouident to forsee thynges. That he was excellent in conductyng of an armye, moste pollitique
<pb facs="5"/>
in orderyng hys battailes, that he could encourage his souldiers wyth apt wordes, and when neade requyred take part of their peril. What partes of this be in your grace, let them iudge that haue knowen your actes in the warres, and your excellent seruice done, both in the time of the kinges maiestie that nowe is, and also in his fathers dayes of most famous memorye. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in doing hereof I haue not parauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture satisfied al mens expectacyōs, yet my trust is, that your grace will accept the same in good part, and consider that in a translacion a man can not alwayes vse is owne vaine, but shalbe cōpelled to tread in the aucthores steppis: Whyche is harder, and a more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulte thynge to do, then to walke his owne pace.</p>
