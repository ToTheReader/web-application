Yet the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of these high and stately buildings doth not erect so lasting a monument of your praise, as the repairing the collapsed discipline, and reuiuing of our ancient Statutes, the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters whereof were more worne out in some mens manners, then in our bookes. But aboue all, the safe custodie of that pretious <hi>deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> of sauing Truth, no way clipt by schisme, nor adulterated by Popish heresie, nor emba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by any semipelagian alloy, is to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
