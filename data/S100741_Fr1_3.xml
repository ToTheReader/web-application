They earnestly protested to haue receiued much fruit
<pb facs="5"/>at the hearing. That it may now bring forth fruit in thee (Reader,) let it bee in thy hands, as a <hi>Deaths head,</hi> to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy end: take it as the clock striketh, as thou thinkest vpon thy worldly store, and as thou remembrest thy conscience; apply it line by line: and then as <hi>Dauid</hi> stood triumphing with the head of dead <hi>Goliah</hi> in his hand: so when the time of thy dissolution commeth, (although others at the like time, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther senselesse, or else yell &amp; houle; thou shalt dye as ioyfully, as if death had no venome; crying out triumphantly in the midst of the pangs of death,

      <hi>O death where is thy sting?</hi> When the seruants in the citie of <hi>Tyre,</hi> had slaine their Lords and Masters, they agreed to chuse him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them to bee king, who should first espy the Sunne rising the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
