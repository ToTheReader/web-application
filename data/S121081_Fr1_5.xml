      <hi>A short Aduertisement, touching the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities</hi> of this Booke, and the things <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in it.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Vrteous Reader, albeit in my generall Preface and particuler Rules, I haue some-what discouered both my purpose, and the profit of this new vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted worke; yet for thy better encouragement to bestow the cost in buying, and paines in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I haue heere distinctly and seuerally gathered the maine and manifold vses, whereunto this Booke may serue, if it bee rightly vsed and not abused, as euery Booke (euen the best) may be, and are.</p>
   <p n="1">1 The most wordes of Holy Scripture, both maine and meane, both proper and borrowed; are heere plainely, and with few words expounded and opened, to help the Minister to interpret, and the hearers to vnderstand the Scriptures.</p>
   <p n="2">2 The sundry and diuers acceptions and scattered sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of one and the same word, are noted and gathered vnder one view, with fit places of Scripture, agreeing to the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the sence.</p>
   <p n="3">3 Where any word is by the Holy-Ghost drawne from his proper sence, to an improper and figuratiue signification,
<pb facs="8"/>
there ye haue the name of that Trope or Figure, set down vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Word, whether it be <hi>Metaphor</hi> or <hi>Metonimie, Irony, Sinecdoche,</hi> or some other; by which meanes, the reason of pulling many words from the Primitiue significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to a secondary, may appeare.</p>
   <p n="4">4 Besides single words, this Booke interpreteth very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny double words, compounded of a Nowne &amp; an Adiectiue, or Epithite. Also sundry Scripture-Phrases be expounded.</p>
   <p n="5">5 In setting down the meaning of the words, this Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary doth very often point at some wholesome Doctrine, and sometime expresseth it.</p>
   <p n="6">6 All the wordes of foundation (as I verily trust) which contain the sure grounds of our Faith and Religion, are heere comprehended.</p>
   <p n="7">7 Heere bee giuen the definitions of the Capitall and chiefe matters, with due proofes of Scripture, to confirme euery part of the definition, the better to expresse the nature of things.</p>
   <p n="8">8 You shall find not a few Theologicall distinctions and diuisions, the better to distinguish one thing from another.</p>
   <p n="9">9 Not onely wordes, which beare difference betweene Protestants and Papists, are written downe and cleared in this Booke, but also there is a taste giuen, of the oddes and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence it selfe, in most points of Controuersie, between vs and them, for the information of such as haue lesse profited, in discerning the differences.</p>
   <p n="10">10 There bee two thousand Texts of Scripture (at the least) declared and made plaine, to the vnderstanding of the simplest.</p>
   <p n="11">11 Vnto such words as be hard or waighty, I haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times added, for fuller edifycation, short and easie obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vnder this word [<hi>Note</hi>] being set in the Margent.</p>
   <p n="12">
      <pb facs="9"/>12 Lastly, this is not the least fruite that may come of this Dictionary, to the studious and well minded Christian, that it may cause him more narrowly to search and examine what signifycation euery word of Scripture may beare: for out of mine owne experience, I may truly speake it, that since I took this Booke in hand, it hath caused me a great deale more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly to marke the Scriptures, the sweete proportion and large compasse whereof, I know much better then euer I did.</p>
   <div type="part">
      <head>Differences betweene this Booke, and M. <hi>WILLIAM KNIGHTS.</hi>
      </head>
      <p n="1">1 HIs Booke is a Concordance, mine is a Dictionary.</p>
      <p n="2">2 His is Axiamaticall, of simple propositions; mine is partly Verbaticall and Rematicall, as I may so speake, of Wordes with their signifycations: partly, Pragmaticall of things, with their Defynitions, Diuisions, and Obseruations Theologicall.</p>
      <p n="3">3 His serues for Doctrines, Reasons, &amp; Vses; mine serues most for interpretations.</p>
      <p n="4">4 His helps Ministers to direct them to teach well; mine may helpe all, but cheefely hearers, to direct them to learne well. To be short, they do agree in nothing but the Generall truth, and in following the order of the Alphabet.</p>
