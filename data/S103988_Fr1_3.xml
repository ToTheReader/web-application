   <head>TO THE
AMOROVS AND
DEVOVT HARTS
TO IESVS.</head>
   <p>I Present you, my HARTS
most deare to Iesus, with a
wounded HART, enfla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ed
al with diuine loue. This is
the Royal Throne of your
Spouse the Pacifical <hi>Salomon,</hi>
the Sanctuary wherin▪ God
would haue perpetual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to be offred, the Tower
which IESVS hath taken to
defend against al hostile inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>
which being wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
vsurped, and sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
profaned, he recouers,
purgeth, expiates, then takes
and cōsecrates for his Palace,
Temple, and Tribunal. Here
<hi>Iesus</hi> exercises his commands,
here he raignes, here he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
here cutting off al de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murres
of appeales he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
sentence of eternal
predestination or reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
here he rayseth thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and lightnings, here
sweetly dartes he rayes of
light, not vsually seen in this
sublunary Globe. Finally I
offer here the HART, the
heauen and Court of the supreame
Moderatour of soules.
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>
But why especially to you?
Surely I should thinke this
guift could be no-where held
in more esteeme or taken for
a greater fauour, then by
you, whom I know wel to
be not only singularly tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vp and exercised in these
diuiner things, but so ardently
affected to them, as that you
set by the loue of this one
<hi>IESVS</hi> more then al the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and fauours of Kings &amp;
Princes in the world: Since
in your soules the Crosse of
Christ and loue of holy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty,
is deeper and more
strongly imprest, then al
those mushrumps of honours,
that pelf of riches, those
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>
Grand-Sires seales, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
images of old, then al
those goods, so commonly
called, which men of your
ranck and quality either ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
promise to themselues,
or more ambitiously hunt
after.</p>
   <p>I present to you a breife
Table, wherin (speaking
with modesty) I haue suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nctly
delineated in short
points of meditations the
summe of al Christian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and that meerly for
your sakes, and the rest who
thinke and loue the same
with you; where no sooner
shal you fix your eyes on that
image of Diuine loue, how il
<pb n="11" facs="6"/>
pourtraicted soeuer with a
ride pencil, but you shal ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
discerne, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ow, a liuely
Image, truly represented, of al
those faire and goodly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
you haue formed in your
mindes, and shal find no
doubt by what wayes and
degrees the diuine goodnes
hath led you to the top of
this Mount, from whence,
remayning yet on earth, you
may contemplate euen hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
it-self, that land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and blessed inheritance
of the children of God; and
where you haue the most ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous
regions of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
<hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi>
the mother of confusion, not
<pb n="12" facs="7"/>
only subject to your eyes, but
trod vpon and trampled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-foot.
Accept then, my
soules most deare to heauen,
this guift such as it is, not
regarding so much the hand
which giues, as the giuers
hart. For my part I haue but
dipt, as I may say, my finger
in the hony-combs, which
here lye hid in certayne
figures and Images, as folded
vp in wax: but the Holy
Ghost, I trust, wil copiously
deriue the purest hony
thence, and consequently
open the very fountaines
of nectar it-self, and most
aboundantly dew your
minds with showers of
<pb n="13" facs="7"/>
diuine graces; so doe I
hartily vow, so wish, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning,</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your most humble and
obedient seruant in
Christ.
