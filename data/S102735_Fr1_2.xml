   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not vnknowen
to your Worship, (gentle
Maister <hi>Marshall,</hi> howe
since my first entring on
this Historie, to translate
it: I haue been diuers and
sundrie times counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by her Maiesties appointment, in the
place where I serue, to post from place to place
on such affaires as were enioyned mee, so that
not hauing fully finished one sheete, and the
Printer beginning almost so soone as my selfe;
I haue been greatly his hinderaunce, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
<pb facs="4"/>
to catch hold on such little leasures, as in
the morning ere I went to horse-backe, or in
the euening comming into mine Inne, I could
compasse from companie. That I fable not
herein, you are my witnesse; in that at your
owne house I wrote a sheete or two, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in your companie, as occasion serued:
and sithence in a long lingring iourney, I haue
knit vp the rest, sending leafe by leafe vnperu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the Printer, which must needes yeelde
doubt of a perfect Translation. In this hard
case, I hope your Worship will the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
mee, being perswaded it should haue been
better, if more respite had been graunted me.
Yet this dare I saye beside, that except it bee a
word here and there by mee left out, or by the
Printer mistaken, I am assured verie little lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
I am certaine not so much as a line of the
Historie: for in verie trueth, I followed the
French (welneere) word for word. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
imperfect or vnpollished it bee, your
kinde Acceptation will make it passe for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant:
whereof, as I make no doubt, so am I the
better encouraged in the successe of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
<pb facs="4"/>
You are a Scholler your selfe, and know
both how to gratifie Schollers labors, as also in
affabilitie of spirite to shew them good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce.
I am not vnmindfull of the good
Gentlewoman your Wife, and although thys
worke were once else-where determined: yet
now, both my promise to you and her (at our
last beeing together) is perfourmed: wishing
that <hi>Gerileon</hi> may prooue as delightfull to you
both in the reading, as it hath been painfull &amp;
laborious to me in the Translating.</p>
   <signed>Your Worships to vse.
