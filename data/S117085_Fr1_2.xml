   <head>To my most beloued Friend and <hi>Chamberfellow,</hi> M. <hi>Edward Heyward.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>SIr, Had I not been such a remote stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to Greatnes, yet, beyond you, scarce should I haue sought a Name to Honor this place. Being, as fortune hath plac't mee, I well could not, without charging my Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of spirit with what, as the worst in Manners, it euer hated; <hi>Flatterie.</hi> But I was resolu'd, that, as the Architecture of olde Temples, you know, was either <hi>Dorique, Jonique,</hi> or <hi>Corinthian</hi> according to the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's seuerall nature, so in analogie, should Gifts of this kind be to the Receiuers, &amp; that Bookes should most fitly be consecrated to true louers of Goodnes and all good Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. I would call <hi>Books</hi> onely those which haue in them either of the two obiects of Mans best part, <hi>Verum</hi> or <hi>Bonum,</hi> and to an
<pb facs="3"/>
instructing purpose handled, not what euer onely speaks in Print and hath its litle worth ending in its many words. In this of Mine dealing with <hi>Verum</hi> chiefly, in matter of <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and <hi>Philologie,</hi> I giue you the greatest interest, that in a thing of so Publique right may be enioyed. Your more noble Studies, Vertue, Learning, and your Loue, to what euer is in those Names, made you most ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it. And to speake here freely, the speciall worth of your Qualitie and of some more <hi>(luti melioris)</hi> compar'd with that world of Natures infinitely varied by base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Spirit, Daring ignorance, Bewitcht sight, worst of inclination, expressions of scarce more that's not Bestiall then what Clothes and Coffers can, and the like haue made me, I confesse, doubt in the Theorie of Nature, whether all known by the name of MAN as the lowest <hi>Species</hi> bee of one <hi>Forme.</hi> So Generous, so Ingenuous, so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd
<pb facs="3"/>
to good, such Fosterers of Vertue, so Industrious, of such Mould are the <hi>Few:</hi> so Inhuman, so Blind, so Dissembling, so Vain, so iustly Nothing, but what's Ill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, are the <hi>Most.</hi> Our long societie of life, and the special Desert, which you know you may truly challenge of my Endeuors, entitled You to it as from Mee. Neuer shall I not confesse you to haue been to me <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>. Some yeer since it was finish't, wanting, only in some parts, my last hand; which was then preuented by my dangerous and tedious sicknesse; being thence freed (as you know too, that were a continuall, most friendly, and carefull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) by the Bounteous humanitie and aduise of that learned Phisician Doctor <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Floyd</hi> (whom my Memorie alwaies honors) I was at length made able to perfit it. And thus I employd the breathing times, which from the so different studies
<pb facs="4"/>
of my Profession, were allowed mee. Nor hath the Prouerbiall assertion, that <hi>the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Common Law mustly alone,</hi> euer wrought with mee farther then like a Badge of his Familie, to whom (by the testimonie of the wisest man) euery way seems <hi>full of Thornes,</hi> and that vses to excuse his labour with <hi>a Lion's in the way.</hi> I call you not my Patron. <hi>Truth</hi> in my References, <hi>Likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> in my Coniectures, and the <hi>whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture</hi> shalbe in steed of One, and of all else which, like inuocations of <hi>Titulina,</hi> might be vsed. It comes to you only, that, if it liue, it may be an enduring testimonie of our <hi>Loues</hi> and your <hi>Desert.</hi> Happinesse euer second your wishes.</p>
