Patriake out of the bitternesse of his soule to cry and make his complaint vnto his God in these words. <hi>Behold I goe childlesse, and the Steward of my house is Eleazer of Damascus; loe to me thou hast giuen no seed, wherefore a servant of mine house must bee mine heire.</hi> But to be furnished with mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine issue, and to haue his first borne of that sex, to whom the Birthright is due, as to the sanctfiied of God, and the preseruer of his name and patrimony, is a double blessing vnto all men, much more vnto Kings, the Lords anointed, whereby his horne is established, his subiects in the middest of the day present, do behold the Sunne that shall arise vpon them the day suceeding, and haue their hearts setled to say vnto their Soueraine, wee and our seed will serue thee and thy seed for euer: This made the Propheticall King in the day of his departure to blesse God, and say, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the Lord my God, who hath caused mine eyes to see this day that one of mine own loynes shall fit vpon my Throne.</hi> But contrariwise was <hi>Achah</hi> accursed, of whom God said

he would not leaue him one <hi>mingentem ad parietem,</hi> threatning (as it were) by that circumlocution to root out all issue male of <hi>Achab</hi> that might succeed him. And hence it is that all Potentates of the world haue highly respected and aduanced in the eyes of their subiects, their heire apparant, and giuen and conferred vpon him very high and eminent titles of honor: Of the<note place="margin">Suetonius.
