   <head>Vpon the Life and Death of Master Henry Welby.</head>
   <l>WHat age is this we live in, that does see,</l>
   <l>And produce wonders above Antiquity?</l>
   <l>Some Nature taxe, as if our life and growth</l>
   <l>Were unto former times inferior both.</l>
   <l>Yet we saw one of late, that when he stood,</l>
   <l>He look't as he were borne before the Flood.</l>
   <l>A second, numbring dayes, as they should have</l>
   <l>No end, or did defie Death, and the Grave.</l>
   <l>A third, as if that Nature would amend,</l>
   <l>And contract what she did before extend,</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="6"/>Is like a Pigmy in his height decreas'd,</l>
   <l>Who now will say that Miracles are ceas'd?</l>
   <l>Looke farther in Mens manners, you will finde</l>
   <l>As great a disproportion in the minde:</l>
   <l>We have a <hi>Welby,</hi> can himselfe immure</l>
   <l>Within his Chamber, and there live secure</l>
   <l>Forty odd yeares, and rather more, than lesse,</l>
   <l>Than <hi>Israel</hi> once did in the Wildernesse.</l>
   <l>He eate no <hi>Manna,</hi> nor no fare so good,</l>
   <l>And yet he never murmur'd at his food.</l>
   <l>Flesh he abhorr'd, and wine; he drank smal beere,</l>
   <l>Cowes Milke and water-gruell was his cheere:</l>
   <l>It was not avarice, nor hope of gaine,</l>
   <l>Nor love towards his heire, made him abstaine:</l>
   <l>He was no Sectary, no <hi>Anchorite,</hi>
   </l>
   <l>Nor yet of that engagement, to invite</l>
   <l>To such a strictnesse, vaine applause to winne;</l>
   <l>Nor was it any pennance for his sin:</l>
   <l>But once upon distaste, he took an Oath,</l>
   <l>And since all mens society did loath,</l>
   <l>Which made him live inclos'd thus; yet his purse</l>
   <l>VVas open, and the poore far'd ne're the worse.</l>
   <l>He read all Bookes, and for his recreation,</l>
   <l>He used frequent Prayer, and Contemplation.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="7"/>O who can found the thoughts that doe arise</l>
   <l>From minds so rap't, and fill'd with extasies?</l>
   <l>Thus <hi>Welby</hi> liv'd according to his vow:</l>
   <l>Whose Life to us was but a Death, and now,</l>
   <l>That he his wonted solitute may have,</l>
   <l>He is retir'd to a more silent Grave.</l>
