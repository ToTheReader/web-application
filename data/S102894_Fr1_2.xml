Grace and peace from Iesus Christ.</head>
   <p>RIght Worshipfull, giue mee leaue to put you both in <hi>one</hi> Epistle, whō <hi>one</hi> seruice, <hi>one</hi> place, <hi>one</hi> profession, <hi>one</hi> order, &amp; <hi>one</hi> Religion haue so neerely combined: As you are <hi>Brethren</hi> many waies, and especially in the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; practise of one Religion: so vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to be <hi>ioynt Patrons</hi> of this little after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, this <hi>faetus posthumus,</hi> of that vvorthy man Ma. <hi>Perkins,</hi> now deceased. I send you heere one of the <hi>shortest,</hi> and one of the <hi>sweetest</hi> of his Treatises: had it been as well brought foorth <hi>by me,</hi> as it ws begot <hi>by him,</hi> it had beene a <hi>child</hi> not vnwoorthy of so great a <hi>father</hi>: but seeing it is now as a <hi>fatherles</hi> child, be you the <hi>Tutors</hi> to this Orphane, at whose hands Orphanes and <hi>Wards</hi> haue euer been well vsed. The <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
whilst he liued was a shining light in this our Church, and beeing dead, is a shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning starre in heauen, for <hi>he turned manie to righteousnes,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Dan.</hi> 12, 3.</note> and his doctrine will shine in Christian Churches vvhilst the sunne shineth vppon the earth. The subiect of this Treatise is <hi>the Ministerie,</hi> whereof are layde downe <hi>the duties &amp; dignities.</hi> And well dooth he couple these two together: for some can challenge the <hi>dignities</hi> of the Ministerie, and cunningly cast the <hi>duties</hi> frō theyr shoulders: others performe the <hi>duties</hi> but are kept from the <hi>dignities</hi> dulle belonging to that calling: but as hee that will doe the <hi>duties,</hi> may iustly challenge the <hi>dignities,</hi> so he that will expect the <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> must doe the duties of a Minister: therefore in this building, these <hi>two beames</hi> are in great wisdome well set together by this <hi>wise Maister builder,</hi> and so closelie coupled, as the idle or ambitious man cannot looke at the <hi>dignities,</hi> but he must withal behold the <hi>duties,</hi> nor the painful &amp; laborious man see his <hi>dutie,</hi> but withal shal see the <hi>dignitie</hi> thereto belonging.</p>
   <p>And surely (Right Worshipfull) none might better haue written of this subiect then <hi>he</hi>: for who may more worthily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<pb facs="3"/>
the <hi>dignities</hi> of the Ministerie then he, who neither by doctrine nor conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, was euer the least disgrace vnto his <hi>Ministerie?</hi> or who may better challenge the <hi>honour</hi> of his calling, then he who was euer an <hi>honour</hi> to his calling; And vvho might better teach the <hi>duties</hi> of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, then hee who so discharged them, as Enuie it selfe cannot iustly reproue, and the <hi>enemies</hi> thēselues cannot but <note n="(a)" place="margin">Answer to Perkins his refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, by B. a priest.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend: and who may better <hi>teach</hi> them to others, then he that carefully <hi>practised</hi> thē in his owne person? And as none could be a fitter <hi>Author</hi> of this discourse <hi>then he,</hi> so not many fitter <hi>Patrons</hi> then your <hi>selues: not many</hi> in your profession better schollers, <hi>nor any</hi> that better loue schollers then your selues: &amp; you are some of those few in this wicked age, who willingly yield all <hi>dignities</hi> and due reuerence to such <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> as you see willingly to discharge the <hi>duties</hi> of good Ministers. Well would it be with the Ministerie of England, (and the better with it, the better with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) if all <hi>as great</hi> as you, vvere <hi>as great friends</hi> to it as you. And if the Papists ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and say how can this be, for that you haue beene persecuters of <hi>their Priests,</hi> let
<pb facs="4"/>
me answere once for you, who often aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere for many distressed men: they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute you with slander, that say you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted thē, (but be content to beare your part in popish slanders, with our Prince and state, our Counsellers &amp; Clergie, our Parliaments and Lawes, for none of these haue escaped these viperous tongues) for though you haue <hi>executed the lawes</hi> vpon some of them in your seuerall places, yet not with <hi>sharpnes</hi> nor seueritie, but with <hi>mercifull iustice,</hi> and that also not as they were <hi>Priests,</hi> but <hi>Plotters,</hi> Practisers, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerters, and seducers: and as they vvere Priests, you sought their reformation, not their ruine. And if they, who can hardlie discharge themselues from beeing <hi>Priests of Baal,</hi> haue had but <hi>iustice,</hi> and that also tempered with <hi>mercy,</hi> it shewes how good regard you haue, and howe much you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme all good and faithfull Ministers, which are <hi>Gods Interpreters.</hi> In a word, if all our <hi>Ministers</hi> were such as this Treatise describeth, or came but as neere it as the <hi>Author</hi> hereof did, &amp; if all our <hi>great ones</hi> did vse &amp; esteeme good Ministers as you do, we should then soone pull the <hi>Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> frō vnder that foote of contempt, with
<pb facs="4"/>
which this prophane age doth daily tread vpon it. The Church of Rome, who are farre <hi>wiser in theyr kinde then the children of light,</hi> haue taken other &amp; strange courses to magnifie the Clergie. They teach, that the state <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> is so far more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then the <hi>Ciuile,</hi> as the <hi>sunne</hi> is then the <hi>moone,</hi> &amp; that not in <hi>spirituall</hi> onely, (for that we deny not) but in <hi>temporall</hi> power, pompe, &amp; estate: and that therefore the <hi>Chiefe</hi> of their <hi>Clergie,</hi> is as farre aboue the mightiest <hi>Emperour,</hi> as the <hi>sunne</hi> is aboue the <hi>moone</hi>; and as the moone borroweth her light from the <hi>sunne,</hi> so doth the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> his state and power from the <hi>Pope.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>They teach, that the <hi>Clergie</hi> is a state so distinct, &amp; so absolute of it selfe, as it hath not to do with the <hi>Ciuile</hi> state, yea they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt their <hi>Clergie,</hi> from beeing any vvay subiect to the <hi>temporall Magistrate.</hi> And though their crimes, be neuer so many or monstrous, yet the <hi>Prince,</hi> or ciuile au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, hath nothing to do to take notice thereof, much lesse to punnish them: &amp; herevpon great volumes are written, and many Acts and decrees are made in theyr Cannon Law, <hi>De exemptione Clericorum.</hi> They extoll their <hi>Clergie</hi> aboue the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraltie,</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
allowing the Priests both Breade and Wine in the Sacrament, but leauing the <hi>Laitie</hi> bread alone. They make them in their Masse <hi>Mediators</hi> betwixt Christ &amp; God the Father, &amp; <hi>Creators</hi> of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and Redeemer, when and as often as themselues list. And finally, they send for the most part, all their <hi>Clergie</hi> immediatly to <hi>heauen</hi> without let, wheras all the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralty</hi> (except Martyrs) must passe by <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Here are great buildings, but on a sandy <hi>foundation,</hi> goodly <hi>Castles,</hi> but built in the <hi>ayre</hi>; if these deuises vvere of God, they would certainly stand, but their long tottring threatens a suddaine fall.</p>
   <p>Contrariwise, our Church, or rather <hi>the corruption of our Church,</hi> by auoyding this <hi>Scilla,</hi> haue falne into <hi>Charibdis,</hi> by auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one extremitie, haue falne into the other, by taking too much <hi>dignity</hi> &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority frō our <hi>Ministerie,</hi> &amp; by laying too much pouerty, <hi>contempt,</hi> and basenes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it. It were a worke worth the labour of the <hi>wisest heads,</hi> to put downe the <hi>true meane</hi> betwixt both extreames, &amp; vvorth the labour of our <hi>Noble King,</hi> to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that that meane be kept, without <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> to the right hand, or <hi>falling</hi> to the left.
<pb facs="5"/>
This short Treatise may hap to giue som light &amp; directions therein, or at least may encourage &amp; stir vp their <hi>harts</hi> in vvhose <hi>hands</hi> it is to doe it: Vnder your woorthy names would I haue it see the world, not so much for that I am bound to you both in many priuate and particuler respects, (though that be much) as for that I know you both to be of so right and reformed a iudgement in this case, as you would haue none <hi>Ministers</hi> but of sufficient gifts, and vnblameable liues, nor those <hi>Ministers</hi> put to their pensions, or vncertaine sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but to haue <hi>certaine</hi> &amp; <hi>sufficient</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance proportionable to theyr charge, and beseeming the honour of a christian Church: God continue you still in that minde, and make many more of the same with you, so should we haue as florishing a Church as any Christendome hath seene. Goe forward in that, &amp; other your religious resolutions, it is the true way to <hi>honour</hi> both heere and in a better world: stand firmly for the truth, and boldly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the popish enemies thereof, as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you haue done: Religion had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more cause to thanke you, and all that doe so then now it hath, for her enemies
<pb facs="6"/>
were neuer so insolent since they were our enemies: but if you and others holde on, as in your seuerall places you haue wel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and others take the like course, there is hope their insolencies will bee easilie (if timely) repressed, and themselues neerest the <hi>fall,</hi> when they imagine they are in the <hi>full.</hi> The Lorde blesse and assist you in your painfull places, and make you on earth Instruments of his glorie, to the good of his Church, so shall you be ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of glory in the kingdome of Heauen: And thus commending this little treatise to your <hi>reading,</hi> and my selfe to your <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,</hi> I take leaue, and will euer rest</p>
