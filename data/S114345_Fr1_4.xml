   <head>¶ THE AVTHOVR to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LTHOVGH there is nothing in these bookes which haue beene so long vnanswered, but either it is vnworthy any answere, or else hath ben satisfied sufficiently before in many treatises extant in the English toung already: yet because the aduersaries should not altogether please themselues in their fantasie that they be vnanswerable, nor the simpler sort suspect that there is any thing in them that we need to be afraid of, I thought good to take in hand this short manner of confutation. In which I trust the diligent &amp; indifferent reader wil confesse, that I haue omitted much matter whereof I might haue taken aduantage, rather then that I haue left any argument of importance vnsatisfied. Considering therfore what breuitte I haue vsed as was necessarie for me, being but one against so many, I trust the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Readers will looke for no other vertue of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at my handes, but onely the simple shewing of the trueth, and the plaine confutation of the false reasons of the aduersarie. Which that they may the better see, &amp; with more profit perceiue, I exhort all such as haue the Popishe Bookes here confuted, to conferre their argumentes with mine answers. And for them that haue not the bookes at hand, I haue so set downe the titles of their Chapters, and the cheefe pointes of
<pb facs="4"/>
their treatises collected by themselues, in their ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> tables, that the perusers may vnderstand, I haue left no matter of any moment vntouched. In rehearsing of their arguments, I haue rather added weight vnto them, then taken any force from them, in my repetitiō or abridgement of them, so neere as I could by any wit I haue, conceiue their order, and resolue their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode. What I haue perfourmed in answering, let the godly and learned Iudge. In the meane time I desire God to graunt that this my labour may be to the glorie of his name, and the profite of his Church, by Iesus Christe our Lord.</p>
