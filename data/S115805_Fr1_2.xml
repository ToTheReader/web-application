      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE most reuerend Cardinal of Lorraine, friendly reader, did in his life time long feede vs with a vaine hope of a view of the Legend of the life of his brother the Duke of Guise, who was slaine before Orleans, the which we haue with great deuotion diligently waited for, in ful assurance that among so manie learned men, as the said Cardinal had alwaies at commandement, he would chuse out one of the quickest wit and capacitie, who might frame some worke worthie the sight of our France, which long time hath seene fewe deuises pleasant vnto the eye, or delectable in the eare: We knowe also that the Cardinal was not destitute of sufficient store of remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brances, requisite for the beautifying of such a labour. But after much attendance, we finally haue found our selues frustrate of our expectation, through the deceasse of the said Cardinal, who hath left vnto vs the making of the Legendarie as wel of his owne person, as also of the aforesaid Duke of Guise, and the rest of the brethren: whereby diuers haue bene occasioned to thinke euil of this his said promise, and to suppose that himself was fully resolued to feede them in hope, through doubt least his flower potte should haue bene discouered, the filthines and abhomination whereof, would haue yelded him and al his progenie, most stincking and abominable in the sight of our whole nation. Not wasting anie longer time therefore in the disputation, or arguing vpon the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which haue moued him thus to cast dust in our eyes, neither making anie accompt of his lies and glosings, it is requisite that my selfe should yelde a reckoning of mine owne doings, and display the causes which haue moued me to vndertake to ease the saide Cardinals heyres (if so be he hath anie, for my selfe neither am, neither wil be counted in their number) of such their labours, as they should haue susteined by writing this Legende, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the liues not onely of the Duke of Guise, and of the Cardinal of Lorraine, but also of al the rest of the brethren,
<pb facs="3"/>
which neuerthelesse are not displayed at ful, but only in part.</p>
   <p>Some yeres therefore are passed; since that thinking vpon the miserable calamities of our France, which I did see daily to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, not that I was so blinde, as not to beholde how God being prouoked through the iniquities of the French Nation, did stretch forth his arme against them, yet marking with what stones and weapons he endeuored to humble vs and asswage our pride, I found that the house of Guise, among others were as his chiefest instruments, whose crafts and cruelties exercised ouer both great and smal, and therefore alreadie published in sundrie pamphlets, ought not still to lie scattered abroade, in hazard of perishing in the pit of silence, or by being neuer detected vnto the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. This was therefore one of the causes, that moued me by litle and litle to begin to serche among my writings and papers, for some bookes and remembrances correspondent vnto such as the Cardinal in his life time made so great accompt of, as to lay them for the most part vpon his table, and then to say, (as he did in the time of Francis the second, at an assemblie of the chiefest estates of the realme at Fontainebleau) that the same were the crownes of his life which should yelde him immortal: Out of the which I began to collect certaine places and notable matters, hopinge thereby somewhat to assiste a certaine friende of mine, who began happily with this piece of worke: But when he gaue wholy ouer this labour to the intent the better to tend vnto things of greater importance, which one day I hope shal come to light, also that the murders of S. Bartlemew so bloodily celebrated had euen lighted in the necke of their other driftes (for therein the said Lords of Guise were in maner chiefe doers) I thought it not amisse to set forth before such as are thereof ignorant, part of their life and maners, seing that them selues do delite in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the same, and that the wicked man must both heare and see things which he would not, because himselfe committeth such as he ought not.</p>
   <p>Now am I so farre of, through these remembrances collected here and there, (as anie who haue read or perused such discourses as within these fiftene yeres haue bene published, may at the first blush perceiue) from restraining the desires and pennes of such as
<pb facs="3"/>
haue in their hands other more large, ample, or exact Legends of the race of the Guisians, that contrariwise I do most heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them no longer to defraude our France the common mother of vs al, of such remembrances and warnings as ought often to be set before her eyes, the which the house of Guise both haue, and yet do endeuour to plucke out of her head, whereby them selues may afterward conduct and order al thinges after their owne pleasures and ambitious appetites.</p>
   <p>Manie times haue I wondered at the dulnesse of diuers French men who otherwise do professe but ouer much knowledge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and yet in the meane time do seeke to persuade vs that whatsoeuer commoditie we haue, doeth proceede onely of these men, from whome in deede most of our inconueniences do arise: For had not priuate affection bleared the eyes of their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, I dare say they would be of an other minde, and that whensoeuer it shal please God to take out of their sight the looking glasse of ambition, reuenge, and such other pretences as doe dazel their sight, themselues wil willingly eschewe and detest that filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which now they do cherish and worship.</p>
   <p>In respect of those who daily with me do behold these euils, them do I wish to consider how or in what maner they may be able to procure anie remedie thereunto, and to the same earnestly to set their hands, as the lawe of Nature bindeth them.</p>
   <p>As for such matters as herein my self haue entreated vpon, at the first I supposed I might haue reduced into ten or twelue leaues of paper al that I minded thereof to publish: but being once ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped I was sodainely caried away into so marueilous a sea of affaires, that before that I can recouer any hauen, I shalbe constrained through innumerable rockes and perilous goulfes, to make a long and tedious nauigation: And as those who hauing once forsaken land, can hardely in a great while recouer the same, although both with oares and sayles they doe what so lyeth in them, euen so I being entred so farre into this Guisian sea, must &amp; wil now endeuour my selfe to come to as speedy a hauen as possibly I may, and yet after such maner as I hope your selues, though that I take not land so soone as you would wish, wil neuertheles hold me excused: For the tractes &amp; trauerses are so long and diuers, with so many waues one
<pb facs="4"/>
in an others necke, &amp; such contrariety of winds puffing and tossing the course of my litle barke diuers wayes, that many times I am ready to beginne againe, and doe stil finde new occasions of further trauaile: howbeit with Gods helpe I will recouer land with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible speede, setting before your eyes the rest of this Legende.</p>
   <p>The style is such as you see, namely simple and naked after the maner of remembrances and collections. For, for the most part I am content to vse onely the tearmes and phrases of such other writers as before me haue delte herin: and notwithstanding that I haue set forth most of them at large, yet haue I not done it to the ende to fill vp paper, but onely in respect that in my opinion it seemed necessary for the explaning of such pointes as in that place were to be handled. For I doubt not but that the time may come when we shall see a full historie, wherein these homely and simple beginnings or descriptions of the deedes of the house of Guise shalbe set forth in such tearmes as the matter requireth: and vnto me it is enough if my rude and sillie discourse may serue some of our french men as a light wherwith to behold and feele the fier which hath already consumed many, and yet doth ouermuch smoke still in purpose to wast the remnant, vnlesse a mightier then man doe take in hand to prouide a remedie.</p>
   <p>It might be demaunded wherefore I haue so long deferred the bringing of this into light: but I may answere that it is yet time enough, also that it were to be wished that this Legend might be an ample discourse of all mischiefes fully ended and past, whereby we should be exempt of all cause of feare in time to come. But the spirit of the Cardinal of Lorraine liueth stil in France, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing desisting from all meanes to bring the estate into like staye as in his life time he pretended, which in case many cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or perceiue, I woulde be very glad if also in time they might not feele it vnto their owne confusions. For my part I can not possibly betraye her of whom I do holde my life, and therefore do beginne to warne her of such fraudulent embushments as are layed to deuoure her, vnder pretence of her maintenance, wherin I would that my brethren and fellowe countreymen shoulde, (if they lust) reape the commoditie of my good will toward them, the which I minde more plainely to set before their eyes, if God lend
<pb facs="4"/>
me life, not permitting any other to be more affectionate to resist by lawfull meanes the driftes and practises of foreyne tyrantes, then my selfe. And notwithstanding I haue not so good opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie so to do as many others, yet will I so effectually endeuour it, that the tokens of my good will shal not be to seeke. I could haue wished that I had some other matter to deale in, nothing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but that all men do knowe that I were able to write of other affaires, which indede is true: but I trust they can not denie but that it is both time and labour well bestowed, when a man disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth vnto the posterity, yea and to such as yet do liue, such things as are most necessarye for their instruction.</p>
   <p>Moreouer in deducting of these matters, I haue not prescribed vnto any the end wherunto he ought to applie them, neither what commoditie he may reape by the knowledge therof, seing that it wilbe easie for euery one to comprehend the same, considering also that both the thinges which be passed, and those which are contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this booke, together with such as shalbe disclosed in others that shall followe, are so cleere and euident vnto al men, that I should euen do open wrong to their memorie and iudgement, if I should make any long discourse therupon. My onely request ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, that it would please all Frenchmen to call to minde their auncient generosity and liberty, &amp; to withstand al slauish bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, whereinto through the factions of the Guisians they haue bene drawen, who abusing the simplicitie of our Kings, haue redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the whole estate of our realme into such danger as al men may euidently perceiue.</p>
   <p>I am no otherwise perswaded, but that diuers courtiers and seruants of the house of Guise in reading in this legendary such thinges as are written in their owne consciences, will shake their heads and bend their browes against me, contrarying this thing or that thing, whom I am to request patiently to beare with me, vntil they see the rest of the bookes which shall shortly followe this, if God permit: For then peraduenture they will powre water into their wine. Otherwise if they be desirous to publish any other Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendes in their masters behalfe, so that it be with better consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences then them selues haue serued thē, I am therewithal very wel content. But in case they seeke to wrong the trueth, let them be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
<pb facs="5"/>
that their flatteries and falshodes shalbe reueiled to all the world, to the end men may beware of them, and that in time to come none may vnwittingly be deceiued.</p>
   <p>The Cardinal had continually one principle in his mouth touching the aduancement of his enterprises, which was, that a lie faced out three hours, or as many daies at the least, was much worth, practising therein the saying of an ancient philosopher, which was, that a lyer ought to be vtterly deuoide of shame: which rule his seruants and partakers doe stil obserue, thinking that in stoutly denying the thing which is more manifest then euen day light, the time will weare away and for that most of them do litle or nothing at all regarde anie religion, it is not to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled, though they treade vnder their feete al equitie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, which are the two pillers and stayes of mans life, so that long to contend with them were but lost labour: wherfore we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them vnto the iudgement seate of almighty God, before whom they shal at length appeare, notwithstanding they endeuour to perswade both them selues and other men of the contrary.</p>
   <p>If anie man aske me wherefore I do now publish but one booke of this legend, seeing that I haue promised more in the title, I doe in dede confesse that I am in possession of the remembrances of the whole worke, but being surprised, and as it were manieled with an ineuitable let, and the printer also being importunate to publish so much as I had already done, hath wrested out of my hands this first part, wherein finding any faultes escaped through the said printers negligence, I trust you will neuerthelesse excuse me, as wanting opportunitie to remaine at his presse, and leysure to write ouer againe that which I had but scribled before, hoping that the next bookes shall be better corrected, also that if in any part of this booke you misse any particular matter, you shal finde the same in some other more conuenient place hereafter. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit if so be that such of the race of Guise as do remaine, might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine so much fauour of God as that it would please him to turne their hearts, so that they would suffer our realme to be in quiet, and that contenting them selues with that which is past, and so through courteous and faithful behauiours would blot out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their former mischiefes, I would be glad to breake
<pb facs="5"/>
promise, and would endeuour to be the first that should cast the remembrance thereof into the pit of obliuion: but in continuing the race which hitherto they haue runne, they shal find both braines &amp; hands enough to resist thē. And although that through crafts and treason they and their semblables haue hitherto, rather then by force of armes so highly aduāced them selues, yet wil the trueth in the end ouercome and haue his course, so that they shal get nothing by following the steppes of their auncesters, saue onely they shal become so much the more odious both vnto God &amp; men. Yea they shal builde their pinacle so high that finally it shal fall vpon their owne heads, and ensnare them selues. If therefore they wil preuent this danger, and assubiect them selues vnto their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it is the thing whereof I should be verie glad: neither can I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie but that the house of Guise conteining them selues within their limites, might haue done good seruice to the crowne of France: but of seruants seeking to become masters they haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all, and ouerthrowne both themselues and others. Thus loth to be in this matter ouer tedious, I beseech you friendly readers, to shew a good countenance vnto this first booke, vntill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth of the rest which shortly shalbe presented vnto your view: This do I assuredly trust that you wil do, in case you be natural French men, that is to say, affectionate vnto the seruice of God, the commoditie of your countrie, and the conseruation of your auncient and noble libertie.</p>
