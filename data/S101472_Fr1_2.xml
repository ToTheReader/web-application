      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a constant and vndoubted truth, approoued by all
Canonicall Scriptures, ancient Councels, holy Fathers,
Ecclesiasticall Histories,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 5</note> and Right reason it selfe;
that as there is but one onely GOD, so but one Faith,
and one Religion. Hence commeth it (Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable)
that the Pope and his Iesuites with other his Popish Vassals,
employ their whole wits, learning, study, care, industry, and diligence,
to instill into the cares and harts of the multitude and common people,
that the Religion which this day they professe, is the old <hi>Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paule</hi> first planted in the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> And for this end they indeau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

to bee the Catholique and Apostolique Faith; whereas the truth is
farre otherwise, as (God willing) shortly will appeare. Which if the

haue departed from their Ancient and Primitiue order; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do the <hi>Capucheues</hi> tearme themselues, the reformed and true
<hi>Franciscanes</hi> indeede. This is this day our case in the Church of

World. The <hi>Capucheues</hi> hold fast, keep still, and constanty defend,
all the Ancient Orders of the first <hi>Franciscanes,</hi> they onely reiect
and abandon that, which by litle and little crept into their Order,
(viz:) superstition, abuses, and neglect of Discipline. Euen so is it
this day with our Church of England, she holdeth-fast, keepeth still,
and constantly defendeth all and euery iote of the old <hi>Romane Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
reuerencing it, as Catholique and Apopostolique Doctrine,
