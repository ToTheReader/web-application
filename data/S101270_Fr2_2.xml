For my hope is, the more that God hath advāced you to worshippe, that the greater will bee your care to further all such meanes as doe concerne his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
<pb facs="95"/> &amp; that you do esteeme this to be your chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest worship, that you haue receiued of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

Lastly the Poet could say, that this was the great <note place="margin">Hoc reges habēt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificum &amp; ingens, nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus quod ra piat dies, prodesse miseris.</note> and magnificēt prerogatiue of princes, which no day could take from them, to profite the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to protect the suppliant &amp;c.

<pb facs="96"/> establish among them the meanes whereby they may be made partakers of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And verely this is a great dignity vnto you, that God the full fountaine of all good thinges hath made you a river to water the plantes of a goodly nursery, and to minister vnto thē al such thinges as might further their growth: and a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Guardian to fence and keepe them from all such things as might worke their annoy ance: that so many good trees might grow vp therein, fit to be transplanted into many places of this land, &amp; to replenish the same with much fruite. We also, which haue bin heretofore plantes in your nurse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, hope that your river wil flowe forth farre fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and extend it selfe even vnto vs, to water vs with some of your droppes, and to bee our fence and fortification, that the fruites of faith &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines that growe vpon our branches may bee the better preserved and kept, vntill they come to maturity and ripenes.</p>
   <p>And now to come to you my foster brethren, as I togither with you expect protection and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from our common head, so as a fellowe member I am bould to put you in minde, that while yee may come to the full breast, yee desire
<pb facs="96"/> the sincere milke of the word, that ye may grow thereby, if ye haue tasted how sweete the Lord is, and what an honour it is to be borne of God, and how great is the gaine of faith and godlines; And that while the yeeres of plenty cōtinue, ye follow the ensample of provident Ioseph, and lay vp in the store-houses of your harts all manner of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual graine, that when yee be called abroad to be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ords husbandmen, yee may bee able to sow the Lordes fielde with plentifull store of all good seede. Verely the harvest is great, and the <note place="margin">Matth. 9. 37</note> labourers are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ewe: and ye may well perceive by experience in your selues, what a labour it is to bring into tillage the vntidy soile of one soule, &amp; to cause it to yeelde but a meane harvest: for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly in this kind of husbandry especiallie is the proverbe best verified: A great harvest, and a little corne.

Ye haue in place of your Honorable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="97"/> the right reverend Father in God the Bishop of Winchester, one that hath bin of your owne society, a famous and renowned Coronell, who hath most couragiously fought the Lordes bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels and hath fitted for you many notable wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, whereby yee may be able not onely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, but also to subdue and vanquish the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: who hath already called some of you, and is readie to cal other of you also, and to place you over no meane bandes O most reverend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Bilson, thou hast best deserved among al our companie to haue the preheminēce, for that thy sword hath hewen cleane a sunder manie of the strōgest &amp; greatest Pillars of the VVesterne Babilon O lift it vp stil against the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: and let it be as the bowe of Ionathan &amp; as the sword of Saule, which never returned emptie <note place="margin">2. Sam. l. 22.</note> from the blood of the slaine, and from the fatte of the mightie. And so as all the sheves of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephes brethren did stand about Iosephes sheife, <note place="margin">Gen. 37. 7.</note> and did obeysance vnto it: so shal al our swordes stoupe lowe to thy sword, and shal be marshalled at thine appointment.</p>
   <p>But to turne to you my brethren which are nowe as it were the Lordes trained souldiers,
<pb facs="97"/> and out of whose companie manie captaines are to be chosen for the guiding and leading of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny severall bandes: ye may behould and looke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ensamples of your owne predecessors, even of such as haue beene of your owne society: And withal yee may somewhat respect your pay, which no doubt may bee good here, if that you endevour faithfully to performe your service, but especially you may assure your selues that you shall receiue a large allowance when ye come to appeare before the great Lord of all hostes, and the high generall of all armies. Then if yee haue fought the good fight, and kept the faith, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished your course, there remaineth for you a crowne of righteousnes: and if this be given to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good souldier, what a large portion may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very captaine expect?</p>
   <p>But here by the way I would willingly put you in minde of this one thing, which is, that many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous captaines and couragious souldiers both in the bodelie and ghostlie fightes, haue beene brought to vtter ruine and decay, by leaving the pursuite of the vanquished enemie, and by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too hastelie &amp; greedelie after the pray.

And how els was the large and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Empire of the city of Rome, and of manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great kingdōes and coūtries overthrowne?

What made the high Priestes &amp; Elders among the Iewes to destroy Christ, and to treade vnder their feete his heavenlie doctrine, but that they might retaine the favour of the Romane Emperour, &amp; so might preserue their earthlie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state?

And what made them giue over the carefull see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that glorious inheritance that St. Peter enioyeth in the highest heavens, but their deepe devising how they might make the counterfeite and forged evidences of St. Peters patrimonie to
<pb facs="98"/> goe for currant and good? And whereof also did it proceede that they clouted and patched togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but with all manner of worldly pollecie and cunning, such an earthly religion as they nowe professe, but that they saw it to bee most fitte for the better maintenāce of their earthly kingdome? And was not all this most significantly shadowed &amp; drawen out vnto vs Apocal. 9. by a starre fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from heaven to earth, who giuing over the care of heavenly matters, and fastening his heart wholy vppon earthlie, became the heade of the blacke and darke kingdome of Antichrist, which can agree to none so fitly as to the Papacy, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a Bishop is the cheife prince, who is stil accoū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a most principall starre aboue al other by many that thinke themselues to bee the onely Christians? And not onelie this starre is fallen by this meanes, but also Apocal. 12. the dragon is said with this his taile of ambition &amp; covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to throw down evē the third part of the stars of heaven, &amp; to cast them to the earth. Which he bringeth to passe when hee perswadeth them to vse all vnlawfull meanes to bring them to their earthly preferments &amp; commodities, &amp; also whē he causeth them to giue over all their former la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures
<pb facs="99"/> in setting forth and promoting the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God that so they may haue more lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to seeke their owne, by neglecting the things that are Iesus Christs. Wherfore worthy of most <note place="margin">M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Foxe in his third considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the Gospel</note> honourable commendation &amp; commemoration is that sinceritie that was in Wickeleife &amp; others of those times, who went about bare-foote, and very meanely cladde, preaching the ioyfull and glad tydings of the Gospel, thinking it to be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reward to haue liberty freely to publish the same, albeit it were without all earthly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But here I pray you mistake me not: for I thinke it no way to be vnlawful for the ministers of the Gospell to enioy temporall possessions &amp; honours: (seeing they are best worthie of them, that know how to vse them best, and are thereby made more careful to amēd their worke, as they perceive their wages to be amended:) but these things are spoken to this end, that al such as seeke after earthly vanities by al sinister meanes, &amp; are moued therby to giue over their labours in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and publishing the Gospell of Christ, may be cōvicted in their own cōsciences, &amp; brought to acknowledge and to bewaile their wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched estate: and that other also seeing their fall
<pb facs="99"/> may thereby bee made more watchfull and warie, least they bee taken in the same trappe: the which thing is so much the more carefully to bee obserued by vs all, seeing wee bee fallen into those times, wherin Christ and his Apostles haue plainely foretold vs, that the danger, wherevnto <note place="margin">Math. 24 38 Luk. 17. 28. 2. Tim. 3. 4. 2. Pet. 2. 3. Apoc. 12. 4.</note> al shal generally be subiect, and particularly such as be of the Ministery, is this, even the loue of the earth that shall draw away the most part of men from the loue of heaven, and shall make many of Demas his place and giftes to forsake Paule and to embrace this present world, and with Iudas to sell Christ and that for a matter of no great gai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e. The faithfull indeede are the right heires even of all the blessings of their heavenly father, but yet so, that they must not be their owne carvers, but seeke for them by such meanes as hee hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, being resolved to be wholy at his dispositiō, and to content themselues with such a portion as he best knoweth to be most meete for them. And what neede haue they too greedily to seeke after the temporal and transitory goods of this world, seeing their portion is fallen vnto them in a very good ground, and they haue a very goodly heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: seeing God is their Father, and Christ their
<pb facs="100"/> brother, and the holy Ghost their comforter, and faith their freehold, and truth their treasure, and godlines their gaine, and goodnes their goods, and righteousnes their riches, &amp; piet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

But these things are sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne vnto you, &amp; therfore I cease any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to trouble you, most hartely beseeching the most blessed God so to water you al with the plē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful streames of his heavenly graces, that when yee haue beene as good trees bearing much fruit in the dry wildernes of this barren world, ye may be transplanted by his gracious hand, and set in his celestial and heavenly paradise.</p>
