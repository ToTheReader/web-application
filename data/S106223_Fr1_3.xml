      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst &amp; foremost, I call the enemies of the mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nisters mariage, pope Eustachians, because that in this poynte, they folowe those aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciente heretikes, whom they called commonly Eustachians, whithe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yere of the lorde .324. helde opinion, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> maried ministers oughte in no wise to be estemed, yea that no man ought to receiue the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion at the handes of theym that were coupled in matrimony, whych opinion was thoughte is straunge, that then a concill was gathered &amp; assembled agaynst in Gangris,<note place="margin">The canon of the concill Gangris.</note> a town of Paphlagonia, wher it was proued to be directlye agaynst Gods worde and the truthe thereof. And therfore this canon or decree was
<pb facs="18"/> made agaynst them. <hi>Qui coniugatum pres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>biterum discernit, quasi occasione nuptiarum of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre non debeat▪ et iam ab eius oblatione abstinet, anathemas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>.</hi> That is to saye, he that doth discerne or maketh a difference of a maried priest, although because of his mariage, he can not offer, or minister the holy communiō, &amp; doth already abstayne from his oblation, let him be accursed.</p>
   <p>Whereby, as I haue proued in my booke, we can iudge none other, but that the Popes catholykes, whyche do so abhorre maryed ministers, makynge no conscience at all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the sacramentes, at a sorte of whoremongers handes are by their owne canons, anathema, that is to saye, accursed. Agaynst them I haue here in this small treatise written. Fyrste, shewynge that all the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they do aleadge, both out of the olde and newe Testamente, for to impugne the maryage of prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, are shamefullye wrested and wrethed.</p>
   <p>Secondly I haue proued, that al the
<pb facs="18"/> vowes that the religious persons, or secular priestes, dyd make, for to binde them selues perpetually vnto single life, are directly agaynste the holye and sacred Scriptures, and worde of God, and that therefore they maye lawefully breake theym, and couple theym selues in honeste matrimonye, that so liuinge in the feare of God, they maye kepe them selues vndefiled members of oure sauiour Iesus Chryst.</p>
   <p>Thyrdelye, I haue declared moste manifestlye, bothe by the examples of the Scriptures, and also by stronge argumentes taken oute of the same, that all religious persons or seculare pryestes, that haue not the gyfte of chastitye, oughte to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye: in so muche that yf there be any that hauynge not the gyfte of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitye, wil not vse the remedye, that God hathe appoynted, for all men: The Godlye Magystrates oughte to compelle theym, and if they be disobedyente, to depose theym
<pb facs="19"/> least by their incōtinent liuinge, thei be an offence and stumbling block vnto the church, and a slaunder vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the doctrine that thei haue taught and set forth. These thinges haue bene done briefely and shortly, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge hereafter, if anye do kicke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste his doctrine, to aunswere them fully, by the leaue &amp; assistaunce of my lord and sauiour Iesu Chryst. To whom with the father, and the holy ghoste, be all prayse glorye, and honour, world without ende. Amen.</p>
