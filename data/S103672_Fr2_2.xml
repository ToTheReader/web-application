   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, IAMES, LORD HAYE; Baron of <hi>Saley,</hi> Viscount <hi>Doncaster,</hi> Earle of <hi>Carlile,</hi> one of the Lords of his <hi>Maiesties</hi> most Honourable Priuie COVNSELL.</head>

      <salute>Right Honourable:</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Cannot but thus gratulate to you your happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from your many, and noble imployments; which haue made
<pb facs="6"/>you, some yeeres, a stranger at home; and so renowned abroad, that all the better parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope know and honour your name, no lesse, than if you had beene borne theirs; Neither is any of them so sauage, as not to say, when they heare mention of your worth, that <hi>Vertue is a thousand Escu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If now your short breathing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time may allow your Lordship the freedome of quiet &amp; holy thoughts, cast your eyes vpon Israel and Iudah, vpon the Kings and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of both, in such beneficiall varietie as prophane historie shall promise in vaine. Your Lordship shall see <hi>Rehoboam</hi> following <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in nothing but his seat, and
<pb facs="6"/>his fall, as much more wilfull than his father, as lesse wise; all head, no heart; losing those ten Tribes with a churlish breath, whom he would (and might not) recouer with bloud. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> as crafty, as wicked; plotting a reuolt, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Religion to his state, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Israelites to make subiects, branded in his name, smitten in his hand, in his loynes. You shall see a faithfull messenger of God, after miraculous proofe of his courage, fidelity, power, good nature, paying deare for a little circumstance of credulous disobedience; The lion is sent to call for his bloud, as the price of his forbidden harbour; You shall see the blinde Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrying the disguise of a Queene,
<pb facs="7"/>the iudgement of the King, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouall of a Prince, too good for <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboams</hi> heire. You shall see the right stock of Royall succession flourishing in <hi>Asa,</hi> whiles that true heire of <hi>Dauid</hi> (though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some blemishes of infirmity) inherits a perfect heart; purges his kingdome of Sodomy, of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, not balking sinne, euen where he honoured nature. You shall see the wonder of Prophets, <hi>Elijah,</hi> opening and shutting heauen, as his priuate chest; catored-for by the Rauens, nor lesse miraculously catoring for the Sareptan, conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting with <hi>Ahab,</hi> confronting the Baalites, speaking both fire and water (from heauen) in one eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; meekely lacquaying his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne,
<pb facs="7"/>weakely flying from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel,</hi> fed supernaturally by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, hid in the rocke of <hi>Horeb,</hi> confirmed by those dreadfull appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions, that had confounded some other; casting his mantle vpon his homely successor, and by the touch of that garment, turning him from a plough-man, to a Prophet. But what doe I withhold your Lordship in the bare heads of this insuing discourse? In all these, your piercing eies shall easily see beyond mine, &amp; make my thoughts but a station for a further discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Your Lordships obseruation hath studied men, more than bookes; heere it shall study God, more than men; That of bookes hath made you full, that of men,
<pb facs="8"/>iudicious, this of God shall make you holy, and happy; Hitherto shall euer tend the wishes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours of</p>
   <closer>
      <signed>Your Lordships humbly deuoted in all faithfull obseruance, IOS. HALL.</signed>
