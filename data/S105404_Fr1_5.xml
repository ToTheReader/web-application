   <head>TO THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE, IOHN
GORE, Lord Major; ROVVLAND
HEYLIN, and ROBERT PARKHVRST,
late Sheriffes, and now Aldermen, of the
famous (though forlorne) Citie of
LONDON.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O You, and to Yee
three alone (Right
Honorable, and right
Worshipfull) prime
Guardians of this his
Majesties <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Chamber,</hi> am
I bold to commend these ensuing Lines
(<hi>Prosopopaeia</hi>) of the <hi>Lamentations</hi>
and <hi>Teares</hi> of this whilome flourishing, now
forlorne <hi>Citie:</hi> the which I (whoever I
<pb facs="5"/>
am, an vnworthy member of the said Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
haue Compiled, not without many
salt Teares, and in the Meditaions of mine
owne Mortalitie; when as so many
Thousands haue falne, dayly and weeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
on my Right hand and on my Left:
And what am I (a seely Worme and no
Man) that should bee left aliue, amids
the Thousands that haue falne, to relate
the sad Story hereof? But, it is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
of <hi>GOD</hi> it so should bee: By him
Kings doe Reigne; and by him also sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Magistrates doe Gouerne:
By him, I say, and by his especiall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
doubtlesse, You my Lord <hi>Maior,</hi>
and Yee Mr. <hi>Sheriffes,</hi> (all three Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
of Religion) were Chosen and Sworne
for this Yeere; a Yeere full of fatall and
memorable Accidents; the ending of a
mightie and prudent King, the beginning
of a mightie and prodigious <hi>Plague,</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
besides the marriage of a mightie King,
and the setting forth of a mightie Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy,)
such <hi>an one,</hi> as no Age, no Record,
no Chronicle ever mentioned the like, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this our faery Land, in this our famous
Citie: I pray <hi>GOD</hi> the Countrey and
whole Land doe not drinke of the same
Cup: Yea, Lord, if it bee thy will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
this Cup from this Citie, from this
Land.</p>
   <p>So as, to this present Plague of Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
all former Plagues were but pettie
ones, as I may say: This, to future Ages
and Historiographers must needs bee Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendred
the <hi>Great Plague.</hi> I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
also, that by <hi>GOD</hi> wee liue and
moue and haue our being: But, Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,
and right Worshipfull, by your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
and religious Discipline, wee that
remaine in this desolate Citie haue liued
<pb facs="6"/>
in greater safety: for had you not beene
with vs, wee had beene in danger to haue
had a further Plague added; our Throats
cut and to bee despoyled of our Goods, by
a certeine Rout of Rascals that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
lie lurking and hunkering about this
Citie: as I haue further demonstrated in
the ensuing Treatise: For the which,
your indefatigable <hi>labour of Loue,</hi> Care,
and constant Residence, what should my
poore selfe say? but, for a farewell now
at your going forth, <hi>The blessing of him
that dwelt in the Bush</hi> bee with you
and yours evermore:
And so I humbly take my leaue
of your Honour and your
Worships.
