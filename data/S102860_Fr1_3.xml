   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Intend by Gods helpe, and your patience (gentle Reader) to present vnto your view an Abstract of such intermariages as haue bin betweene the two royall Lines of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and some other passages betwixt the two Nations, from the time of the Conquest, vntill this present: the subiect appropriating to that which is now most autentick on <hi>Englands</hi> faire stage, &amp; of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test consequence that hath been there these many years, therefore the greater, is both my aduenture and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for that the same and such great affaires of State, are not to be meddled withall or talked of, but with great caution and reuerence, or rather indeed not at all, vpon the former and accustomed courses of restriction, of the vulgar in that particular, hauing bin a long time in councel consulted of, &amp; now someway publike: These my endeauours being but meerely collectiōs out of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Chronicles (as history) which is said to be the witnes of time, the light of truth, the memoriall of life, &amp; report of antiquitie: with some other obseruations concerning those affaires, and in the countrie too much expostulated
<pb facs="4"/>of, I hope I shall giue no cause of offence, taxe, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; hauing no affectation to talke or busie my selfe in State affaires, nor minister more, but rather lesse occasion for others so to doe. But that I should presume to write in a businesse of so great a consequence, and of this nature, and the rather comming now so late, and not in so good a season as formerly it would haue done, I may be subiect both to reproofe and taxe. Onely, I shall desire the Iudiciall, and best affected <hi>(prima facie)</hi> not to iudge me; what followes comes from a Protestant pen, from one that wisheth all may bee well, liueth in the countrie farre out of sight, and almost out of hearing, from the helme where the affaires of State are steared: therefore more then by obseruation, and what the countrie affoords is beyond my knowledge, neither sent, nor set on to write or speake, hauing neither thought, aime, nor expectation of preferment, (not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming to my selfe thereof any waies worthy) should thinke my selfe happy, if I might as a Moderator some way quallifie passion that the Countrie people might not so much expostulate of our Princes Royall Match, and the affaires of State as now they doe. For that purpose it is only to them sent, meant, and intended: hauing only treated of the passages of former times, concerning that affaire or others of State for the present or future, I neither haue, nor will meddle withall, as indeed not
<pb facs="4"/>fitting for the common people so to doe: As they are farre from their knowledges and apprehensions, so should they bee likewise from their discourses and expostulations, not to looke where Lyons wake or sleepe: The actions of Princes not to be pryed into, but by such as are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. Peraduenture some will say, that in this my Discourse I haue beene squint-eyde, as not looking or bending my course any waies direct: those who haue beene auerse, and vnwilling for our Princes Royall Match, will taxe me for a temporizer, J conceaue J haue not magnified the <hi>Spaniards</hi> aboue measure, more or otherwise then our owne authors and other Writers affirme; so could J wish they should not out of passion, and inuention, be detracted beyond merrit, and with those that haue so much desired our Princes Match, my selfe with them I shall not any waies ingratiate, I hope my honest plaine meaning and intentions, shall indici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally iustifie me against either. Will as a good subiect ought (wishing all the Countrie people would doe the like) only desire God may be truly honoured, praying to him to direct all things for the best, his Maiestie obeyed in all his Commands on earth, haue compleat content and comfort, and liue long to see his holy intentions take effect for the good of Christendome, and not with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny farther expostulations to trouble our selues, but rely on Gods prouidence, the King and Princes wisdomes,
<pb facs="5"/>and integrities, letting them and those that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie alone in the businesse; neither feare nor doubt, that any thing will be done, which shall any waies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the honour of Religion, or generall good of the kingdome: The farther particulars, this my Epistle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory by way of anticipation, shall not relate, but the work it selfe shal make particuler demonstration therof: What I haue here begun, some of better abilitie (if it please them) may supplie that wherein I haue beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue: these my poore endeauours, I humbly leaue to your considerations, &amp; my selfe to your fauourable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: resting</p>
