Wherein I haue sooner chosen to eternise my own insufficiencie, the render their perfections any waies vnsatisfied. And therfore haue made choice to publish these fower first Bookes by an vnknowne (without name, but a most iust and faithful) Author, at the first digested in a forren tongue, wherein J must needes yeelde to adde so much more to my owne vnperfectnesse, as shall come within the view of your eyes, or pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of your iudgement, as then receiuing most blemish, when you shall vouchsafe the Author in his owne and proper language: Who cannot in himselfe but much satisfie such is his stile, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, truth and varietie of matter, wherein the minde of man most delighting, doth vndoubtedly couet Historie, before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writinges, and if Historie what more pleasing then is in him contained?

iustly deere to his Soueraigne and Countrie, dreadfull to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, terror to traytors, and scourge of Spanish Monarchie, which the defeate of that inuincible army, (for so in Print thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seues published) can best testifie, the glorie whereof can not but stirre vp those two young Jmpes of great hope and expectation, (ouer whome you haue euer beene a carefull <hi>Cornelia</hi>) as well to succeede their renowmed Father, in his vertues (which neuer shal perish) as other his humaine dignities &amp; possessions; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of if you shall not in this Historie haue the like profered to your view, (for no age hath left any such recorde) yet cōtemne not the reading of my Author, by whome you shall receiue the true first motiue of all the Ciuil and foraine warres of <hi>Fraunce</hi> in our age, and her neighbour Countries: with such memorable accidents and occurents, as continually were ministred. Not like to that impudent, though excellent writer, <hi>Paulus Iouius,</hi> no lesse wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be a Bishoppe, then a Historiographer, who plainly auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nay was not ashamed himselfe in his Bookes to vaunt, how he made no accounte in writing a lie, were it in matter of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or to please the appetite of great ones, which shoulde set him a worke: for that wher ther was one in his time, which knew the fault from the truth, all posterity hereafter would notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing belieue and giue credite to what he should set down, my Author contrariwise, hath beene so little tickled with the couet of rewarde or ambition (capitall enemies to the truth) as that he refuseth to set his owne name to his so painefull labours, mildely and with such great temperance ouerrunning the proceedings of all enemies, as hee cannot iustly be suspected of any partiall lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the one side more then the other, wishing for my own part that some one ther were (according to my tast giuen) who in this scribling age (whereof translating humours and quoters are plentie) would finish out the rest, many fragments and sundrie

   <p>It now resteth (glorious and beautifull Ladies) adorned with your stately ranke and place, humbly to intercesse pardon for my presumption in seeking so boldely to shrowde the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my pen, vnder the shadowe of your winges.

In which albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it many of you bee singularly well able to iudge of him, yet if it please any of the rest, to vouchsafe to entertayne his broken Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, I dare assure that for his discourse, you shall finde him very

delightfull, for his newes not ordinarie, and for his truth can bring good securitie, when soeuer he may be permitted to attend vpon your leasure, not importioning his accesse, vntill weried with your more weightie and serious seruices, a desire may possesse you, insteede of recreation, to spend with him some fewe howers of the day. A matter heretofore accustomed (in my knowledge) by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie high and loftie Ladies, who often times to be meete with wearisomnes, exercised themselues in studie, &amp; reading of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie writers, as <hi>Marguerite</hi> Countesse of <hi>Lennox, Anne</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse of <hi>Oxford, Francis</hi> Countesse of <hi>Sussex, Elizabeth</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesse of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> the Ladie <hi>Marie Sydney</hi> (liuing my thrice honoured mistresse) truely liberall and bountifull, rare Mother of so heroicall an ofspring, by her noble minde and cariage easily discouering greatnes of birth and Princely parentage; and that wise good, and godly Ladie aduancer of so many excellent perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, both in Arte and Armes, employing her credite with her Soueraigne, (then whome none had greater) in doing good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for all sortes in generall, but especially preferring those, in whome she might perceiue any signification of vertue to appeare. That graue Matron, harmelesse Courtier, and faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant <hi>Francis Barones</hi> of <hi>Cobham,</hi> (late wife to the noble L. and trustie Councellor yet liuing) to whome I was so much bound (in many duties being likewise to the whole house) as that both in her health and languishing Maladie, she sundrie times ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me, to conferre or reade with her, finding in the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Historie her most delight. But no waies may I heere without extreame note of grosse ouersight pretermit in this lift, that famous Religious and learned Ladie (flower of her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,) prouident mother, blessed in her posteritie, <hi>Mildred Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones</hi> of <hi>Burghlie,</hi> besides her knowledge in the Latine letters, (wherein of a subiect she excelled) such were her studies, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,

and continuall Meditation in the Greeke Doctors of the Church, (especially <hi>Basil, Ciril, Chrisostome</hi> and <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzene,</hi>) as a chiefe reader in that tonge (<hi>Laurence</hi> by name) hath ere now confessed vnto me, that in his iudgemēt she Egalled if not ouermatched any, in whose profession (as expected so) most was to be required. Neither were these excellent parts of hers, onely Theoricall, but still put in practise like an other <hi>Dorcas,</hi> full of piety and good works, as without any ostentation or <gap reason="foreign">

      </gap>, besides her readines in solliciting for poore and distressed sutors vnto her deare Lo. (the auncients Councellor of <hi>Europe, Pater Patriae,</hi> piller of the state, thorough whose prudent pollicie, and carefull watchings iustly may be applied, <hi>Neque periculum in R.

Such as you are, were they, and such as they now are, shall euerie one of you be, who though they seeme faded, and as it were vanished from among vs, yet doth their goodnesse, and memorie stil remaine fresh and fixed in the minds and harts of manie.</p>
   <p>But how can it otherwise fare <hi>(Illustrious Ladies)</hi> but that you must needes succeede, or rather abounde in all or greater worthinesse hauing the honour and blisse to bee trayned vpp,
<pb facs="6"/>
in the same Schoole, from the which they (and all other) borrow their light as the Moone doth frō the Sun, at the mouth of that diuine Oracle, <hi>Ex cuius ore, melle dulcior fluit oratio,</hi> that sacred Queene, vnmachable and victorious Ʋirgine, <hi>Supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minens omnes,</hi> Mans mirror, <hi>Ioues</hi> darling, worlds wonder, and natures perfection, whose <hi>Angelicall</hi> face so often as I doe beholde, (as behold to often I can not) me thinketh J still (with daseled eyes) see as it were in full aspect <hi>Solarem Maiestatem, cum Saturnina grauitate.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>That the powerful and essentiall thing of things, may number the peaceable yeeres of her Raigne like the sands of the Sea, that the shadow gonne downe in the Dyall of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> may be ten and ten degrees brought backward, that the Sunne abide, and the Moone stand still, vntill she may be auenged of her enemies. Let all her Subiects pray, our age rest thankefull, posteritie admire, and the heauens eternise her name for euer.</p>
