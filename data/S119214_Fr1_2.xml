   <head>TO THE RIGHT Worshipfull Sir <hi>Iohn Stawell Knight, in the Countie of</hi> Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed, <hi>the grace and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, with all prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, in Iesu Christ our Lord.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Iewes beeing captiued in <hi>Babilō</hi> (Right worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Sir) were not a little sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not onely for their miserable thraldome of body: but also for this, that they could not then, and there exercise themselues in the right ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the true God, as they might sometimes freely haue done in the Citie of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and land of <hi>Iudah:</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/> therefore, when the Babilonians (in their merrie moode) required them to sing one of the Songs of <hi>Zion:</hi> they in their heauinesse answered them: <hi>How shall we sing the Lords Song in a strange land?</hi> howsoeuer it was delightsome to the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> now triumphing ouer those Iewes, to heare them to sing one of the Songs of <hi>Zion:</hi> it was (doubtlesse) no Iesse wofull to the Iewes, to sing the Lords Song, then and there among such as scorned and cōtemned both them and their holy religion: then it was sometimes loathsome vnto those Iewes, to heare the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to sing and modulate such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Canticles and Songs at home in their owne land. But thus did the Lord deale with thē in his vpright iudgements, that for as much as they neither loued, nor delighted in, but altogither loathed and disdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, both the Lords messengers and
<pb facs="3"/> their holy Songs &amp; diuine Sermōs, euen then, when they had a time of grace and peace, with fit opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to heare &amp; sing the same to their owne solace and the glorie of their God: and therein resembled them that would not daunce vnto them that piped, and proued like the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and vngratefull vineyard: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a time &amp; place ouertooke thē, where in (they being miserably cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued) were thralls vnto such, as did (in the like sort) both disdaine them, and deride those holy Songs and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces in the which their soules shuld take the greatest delight and cōmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity: neither had they the like peace and opportunitie to vse and exercise that which they had both neglected and grossely abused in the due time: wherein as their vnthankfulnesse was deciphered towards the Lord God after his manifold benefites on them bestowed: so his iudgements
<pb facs="4"/> laid on them for the same, were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise expressed and made knowne. The Lords Prophets foreseeing such things to ensue on that vnthāk<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full people, did not omit, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, to foreshew them therof, and the same by many Arguments to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, wishing and admonishing them to accept gratefully, and to vse reuerently the graces of Gods spirit offered them, the which would bee for their good; and that the neglect thereof, would surely bring vpon them intollerable troubles &amp; woes both of body and mind: the which gentle admonition, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets perceiued, how lightly the Iewes did regard &amp; loosely obserue, it grieued them not a little, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer those hard hearted Iewes could not bee moued to lament for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, vntill their dayes of sorrowes came. Hereat <hi>Ieremy</hi> wept bitterly for them, whereof also hee made a
