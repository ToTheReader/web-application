      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His little booke intituled <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> and first writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Latyne by <hi>Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge,</hi> was thought mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and very profitable to be translated, and turned into Englishe, not onely by mee, but also by the iudgement of diuers others of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, godly and zealous Ministers of this citi of London, who cōsidering y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite that hereby might come, firste vnto the Churche of Christe, and nexte vnto them selues, and to all their other brethren and fellowe Ministers throughout this little realme of Englande, according to their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whiche do or ought to thriste and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, after the increase and aduauncement of
<pb facs="4"/>
Christe his kingdome, to the ouerthrowe &amp; vtter distruction of blindnes, error, Popery, superstition, and of all the tyrannie of Anti-christe, haue perswaded me to accomplyshe their great and earnest desire, and to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late into our vulgare tongue, this little and necessary treatise of <hi>Himmenge,</hi> called <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastes,</hi> wherein what paynes I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I had rather a great deale the learned in reading should iudge, then that I would speake any one worde of my selfe. This only (as I trust) without offence of any, I maye truely saye, that it would haue bene a great deale easier for me, to haue medled rather with some one whole and continuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mētarie, thē with this little treatise, which in my iudgement may not vnfitly be termed <hi>Christiana Rhetorica,</hi> that is to say, an arte out of the whiche the true and faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christe, may learne playnely, and orderly, to breake and distribute the worde of God vnto the people, and flocke commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their charge. Nowe it is not vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen howe harde a thing it is to translate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arte written, either in the Latyne, or in the Greeke tongue, especially into our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyshe and vulgare tongue, in the which we
<pb facs="4"/>
haue wordes, neither sufficient, nor yet apte enough to declare &amp; expresse the same: that is to saye, the termes and proper names of arte: as <hi>Genus, differentia, species, adiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta, exordium, enarratio, genus didascali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, paraeneticum. &amp;c.</hi> not withstanding this great difficultie whiche might altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seeme to haue bene sufficient to disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, hinder, and discourage mee, to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this little harde, and profitable woorke in hande: yet the examples of other wyse &amp; learned men (who before me haue brought into our tongue the artes of Grammer, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike, Rhetoricke, Arithmeticke, Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, Geographie. &amp;c. did not a little encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and bolden mee hereunto: so that I thought if other graue, wyse, and learned men, before me, both Romaynes, Italians, Germaines, Frenchemen, and Englishmē, haue thought good for the aduauncement of Philosophie, and humaine knowledge, to bring into their mother tongue those and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like artes firste written in the Greeke tongue, though they could not always finde out proper wordes euery one in their owne tongue to declare y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> proper termes of arte. I with muche more bouldnes might take in
<pb facs="5"/>
hand to interprete this little arte of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Rhetoricke, especially seing that the same doth so farre passe the arte of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy worde of God doth exceede the knowledge of all manner of humaine philosophie. For that arte doth teache thee, cunningly to handle, &amp; eloquently to speake of worldly thinges, and of mens matters: &amp; that either in prayse, or disprayse, either in defending and prouing, or els in reprouing, impugning, discōmending, and disalowing, wherof we haue examples in <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> and <hi>Cresiphon,</hi> among the Greecians: in <hi>M. T. Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Mar. Antonius</hi> among the Romaines, and in diuers other Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, who florished in their time. But this doth instructe and teache thee, the true deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the scriptures, home they haue bene diuersly of diuers godlye wryters diuided: What the vse and profite thereof is: what tongues are necessary for thee to learne and vnderstande the scriptures: what the vse of them are. Howe thou must studie diligently and aboue all other writers the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Howe thou must, for thy better vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standing, conferre them together, not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing altogether, either to thyne owne or yet
<pb facs="5"/>
to other mens opinions: And to conclude, how thou mayst orderly and with profite of thy hearers preache, &amp; expounde the worde of God, whether mē are to be lifted vp, and comforted with the swete promises of God, or els to be beaten, and cast downe, with his dreadfull minaces, and threatninges: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wickednes be to be defaced and troden vnderfoote, or vertue to be praysed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted vnto: But all these and many suche others, thou shalte more at large better learne out of the treatise it selfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I referre thee vnto the diligēt reading thereof, and do exhorte thee, so to reade, that thou maiest not only hereby learne to know a ready and easy Methode, or waye of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out of the worde of God vnto others, orderly for the helpe both of thine own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, and also of thy hearears: but also, and that especially that with the studye of this arte and Methode, thou alwayes make thy prayers vnto almighty God, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> assistance and helpe of his holy spirite, whiche maye teache thee, the true ende, and right vse of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same. For as arte helpeth nature, &amp; nature arte, so that arte can doe nothing without nature, so must we alwayes remember that
<pb facs="6"/>
the Methode or arte of preaching, shall lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, or nothing at all profite vs, vnlesse the the spirite of God bee ioyned thereunto, whiche is, as it were the true nature vnto it, and without the which the arte it selfe is able to doe nothing: for this holy spirite of God, doth not onely make vs apte, and able to learne this arte, or Methode, but doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so teache vs that the true ende, and right vse hereof, is not onely to preache learnedly, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly or cunningly the woorde of God vnto others, but also and that especially vnto our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues, that our audiēce seing our wise &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sayinges to agre together, with our good and godly dedes may by our example frame also their life, and conuersation according to our preaching out of the worde of God, &amp; so together with vs both in word and deede glorifie God the father of our Lorde Iesus Christe, to whom bee prayse and glory for euer and euer. Amen.</p>
