   <head>TO THE GENTLE Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous and christian Reader; I confesse, that to publish a Translation, is no more, then what may bee perfourmed by a Grammar Scholler: as wherein indeed is shewed more industrie then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Yet I pray thee lend me herein thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable conceit and Christian affection, together with thy friendly acceptance of that, which with an vpright minde, ayming at the glory of God, and at thy good, I doe here tender vnto thee. And for this small worke, I pray thee, be like minded, as the Apostle was, for the matter of preaching: which though it were by some perfourmed of contention, and by others of love;<note place="margin">Phil. 1.16.18.</note> yet he therein ioyed, because Christ was still preached. In like manner, so that God be glorified, and his Church edified, whether it bee primarily by the deepe meditations of some, or secondarily by the painefull translation of others, reioyce, and thanke God in it. For it is in the edifying and building of the Church of God, as in an earthly house or building, wherein every stone is not a carved or corner stone, but some are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hewen, and fillers, (as they call them) which, though they appeare not; yet are they necessarily of the building: So is it herein; some labours are more excellent, and some more meane,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> yet both tending to the repayring of the Saints, and for the edification of the bodie of Christ. That which mooved my selfe and another, who ioyned with me in this small worke, was the worth and excellency of the Treatise it selfe: it not being a frivolous or vnprofitable Pamphlet, but a worke very well beseeming such a reverend and learned Author, as wherein is contayned strong and sound doctrine, to furnish thee with knowledge and iudgement against the common Adversary: as also very sweet and comfortable points, to comfort thy conscience, against those same strong temptations of Sathan concerning the assaults of diffidence or distrust. On these two heads especially, dependeth the
<pb facs="4"/>
matter and subiect of this booke: which if it please thee to peruse, thou shalt finde in it no doubt, matter to thine edifying and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We have taken this paynes, for the good and benefite of those, which vnderstand it not in the tongue wherein it was written: but for others, it shall be best for them, if they please, to reade it in the Originall wherein it was written; as wherein indeed it hath the best grace, both by meanes of the elegant style and composition thereof; as also because there are sundry termes and words of Arte, which can hardly be familiarly expressed or resolved by our idiome or dialect. This, I say, gentle Reader, have we, by the Lords assistance, both at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted and atchieved; in regard of the goodnesse of the Treatise: and a good thing, the more common and vniversall it is, the more commendable and the better it is. The same reasons which do vrge, that the holy Scriptures should be written in a knowne tongue, doe likewise proportionally enforce, that divine and godly Treatises vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on severall passages and places of Scripture, should be made familiar vnto the vnlearned and common people, as whereby they may be the better enabled to vnderstand the Scriptures, and so to be furthered in their Salvation. So that if thou censure the translating of such Authours, thou wilt very easily drawe vpon thee the blemish and suspition of Popery it selfe. Thou must not thinke, gentle Reader, that the Lord would have it to be amongst vs now,<note place="margin">Gen. 11.7.</note> as hee himselfe caused it to be amongst them which built the tower of Babel, whose language was so confounded, that they perceyved not one anothers speech, but that God would have it so to be in his Church now, as that every man should say,<note place="margin">Acts 2.11.</note>
      <hi>Wee heard them speake, in our owne language, the wonderfull works of God.</hi> But I trust, I shall not neede to make excuse for this our small labour, but rather presume of thy loving and friendly acceptance thereof: whereof perswading my selfe, I commend thee to the tuition of the almighty; promising thee, that if thou wilt by thy good endevours, so breake the shell of an vnknowne tongue or language, as that eyther my selfe or the Church, may by thy good meanes come vnto the sweete kernell of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Treatise, I would give to God the glory, and to thee thy due prayse. And so I doubt not, but that thou wilt walke according to that vpright rule set downe by our Saviour Christ: <hi>Whatsoever yee would that men should doe vnto you, even so doe you vnto them:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 2.12.</note>
      <hi>for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
