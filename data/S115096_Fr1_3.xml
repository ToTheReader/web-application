   <head>To all Romish Priests and Iesuites of the English Seminaries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Necessity of this ensuing Treatise; as also of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Sincerity, and his Adversaries unconscionable Dealing in their Allegations of Authors.</head>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all the Controversies held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your Romish Religion, none were ever more hot, to draw Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants violently into the fier, than these two; first the denying of your <hi>Romane Church</hi> to be <hi>The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, without which there is no Salvation:</hi> the second to affirme the Romish <hi>Adoration of the Sacrament of the Altar</hi> to be <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> Therefore have I especially vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the discussion of both these Questions, that seeing (as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> truly said) <hi>It is not the punishment, but the Cause which maketh a Martyr;</hi> it might fully appeare to the world, whether <hi>Protestants</hi> enduring that <hi>fierie triall,</hi> for both Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, were indeed <hi>Heretickes,</hi> or true <hi>Martyrs:</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether their <hi>Persecutors</hi> were iust Executioners of persons then condemned, and not rather damnable <hi>Murtherers</hi> of the faithfull Servants of Christ. And I doubt not but as the first hath verified the Title of that Booke, to prove your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Necessity of salvation</hi> in your Romish Church to be a GRAND IMPOSTVRE: So this second, which I now (according to my promise) present vnto you, will make good, by many Demonstrations, that your Romish <hi>MASSE</hi> is a very
<pb facs="9"/>
Masse, or rather a Gulfe of many Superstitious, Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Idolatrous Positions and Practises.</p>
   <p>And because the very name of <hi>Romane Church</hi> is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used as (in it selfe) a powerfull enchantment to stupifie every Romish Disciple, and to strike him <hi>deafe and dumbe</hi> at once, that he may may neither heare nor utter any thing in Conference concerning the Masse, or any other Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in Religion, be the Protestants Defence never so Divine for trueth, or ancient for time, or universall for Consent, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for beleefe: I therefore held it requisite, in the first place, to discover the falshood of the former Article of your <hi>Church,</hi> before I would publish the Abominations of the <hi>Masse;</hi> to the end that (for <hi>Idolatrie</hi> in Scripture is often ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med spirituall <hi>Adulterie)</hi> the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> which playeth the Bawd, in patronizing <hi>Idolatry,</hi> being once outted, your <hi>Romish Masse,</hi> as the Strumpet, might the more easily either be reformed, or wholly abandoned.</p>
   <p>This may satisfie you for the necessity of this Tractate. The next must be to set before you your owne delusorie tricks, in answering, or not answering Bookes written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you; especially such as have beene observed from mine owne experience. One is to stangle a Booke in the very birth: so dealt <hi>Mr. Breereley</hi> long since by a letter writ unto mee, to prevent the publishing of my Answere against the first Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his <hi>Apologie,</hi> when he sent me a second Edition thereof to be answered, which both might and ought to have beene sent a twelve-month sooner; but was purposely reserved to be delivered not untill the very day after my <note n="*" place="margin">See the Protestants Appeale in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> Answere (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and <hi>Appeale)</hi> was published. Of which his prevention I have therefore complained as of a most unconscionable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvention. Another device you have, to give out that the Booke (whatsoever) written against your Romish Tenents is in answering, and that an Answere will come out shortly. So dealt <hi>Mr. Parsons</hi> with me <note n="*" place="margin">In his Sober Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning.</note> Certifying me and all his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Readers of an Epistle which hee had received from a Scottish Doctor, censuring my Latine <hi>Apologies</hi> to be both fond and false; and promising that his Answere to them, Printed at <hi>Gratz</hi> in <hi>Austria,</hi> should be published before the Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
<pb facs="9"/>
following: whereas there have beene above twenty. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmasses sithence, every one giving <hi>Mr. Parsons</hi> his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise the flatt lie. A third Art is a voluntarie▪ Concealement and thus Maister <hi>Brereley,</hi> who hauing had knowledge of the fore-mentioned Booke of <hi>Appeale,</hi> manifesting his manifold Aberrations and Absurdities in doctrine, his ignorances and fraudes in the abuse of his Authors, as in other passages through-out that booke, so more especially the parts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Romish <hi>Masse,</hi> yet since hath written a large Booke, in defence of the Romish <hi>Liturgy</hi> or <hi>Masse,</hi> vrging all the same proofes and Authorities of Fathers; but wisely concealing that they had beene confuted, and his fashoods discouered. Only he and <hi>Master Fisher</hi> singling out of my <hi>Appeale</hi> an explanation which I gaue of the testimonie of <hi>Gelasius</hi> (in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Manichees,</hi> concerning their opinion of not admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring the <hi>Eucharist in both kindes)</hi> did both of them divulge it in their Bookes and reports also in many parts of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as making for the iustification of their sacrilegious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the holy Sacrament, and fora <hi>foule Contradiction</hi> vnto my selfe: notwithstanding that this their scurrilous iusul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (as is <note n="*" place="margin">Booke 1. c. 3. §. 7.</note> here proued) serueth for nothing rather than to make themselues ridiculous. The last, but most base and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellish, Gullerie is a false imputation of Falshoods in the allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Authors, which was the fine sleight of <hi>Master Parsons;</hi> a man as subtile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> for inuention, as elegant for expression, for obseruation as dextrous and acute, and as politike and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasiue for application, as any of his time. He in an answere to some Treatises written against your Romish blacke art of <hi>Aequiuocation by mentall Reseruation,</hi> and other <hi>Positions</hi> fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting <hi>Rebellion</hi> (to wit) in his bookes of <hi>Mitigation</hi> and <hi>Sober Reckoning,</hi> doth commonly leaue the principall Obiections &amp; Reasons, and falleth to his verball skirmishes, concerning false Allegations: and (as turning that Ironicall counsaile into earnest, <hi>Audacter &amp; fortiter calumniare &amp;c.)</hi> he chargeth mee with no lesse than fiftie Falsifications. All which I spunged out in a Booke entituled an <hi>Encounter,</hi> and retorted all the same Imputations of falshood upon himselfe, with the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of above forty more. Which may seeme to verifie that
<pb facs="10"/>
Cognizance, which your owne Brother-hood of Romish Priests in their <hi>Quodlibets</hi> have fastened on his sleeue, calling him <hi>The Quintessence of Coggerie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>As for mine owne integritie, I have that which may iustifie mee; for howsoever any one or other Error may happen, in mis-alleaging any one Author, yet that I have not erred much; or if at all, yet never against my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Heereof I have many witnesses; One within me, a witnesse most Domesticall, yet least partiall, and as good as <hi>Thousands,</hi> mine owne <hi>Conscience:</hi> a second is above me, <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>Greater than the Conscience.</hi> A third sort of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are such as stand by mee, even all they who have beene conversant with mee in the perusall and examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Authors Testimonies, by mee alleaged; men of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular learning and iudgement, who can testifie how much they endeared them-selves vnto mee, when any of them happened to shew mee the least errour in any thing. (Hee that shall say, <hi>Non possum errare,</hi> must be no man; and hee that will not say, <hi>Nolo errare,</hi> as hating to erre, can be no Christian man.) The last witnesse for my integritie may be the Bookes of my greatest Adversaries, <hi>Mr. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Brereley,</hi> whose many scores of falshoods have beene laid so open and published for above sixteene yeares past in two Bookes (one called an <hi>Encounter</hi> against the fore-man, the other an <hi>Appeale</hi> against the second) yet hath not any one appeared out of your Romish Seminaries for the vindicating of them heerein.</p>
   <p>By these Advertisements you may easily conceive with what confidence I may proceede in this worke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is displayed and layd open, in the discussing of these Eight Words of Christ his Institution of the Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Eucharist, [HEE BLESSED; BRAKE; GAVE; TO THEM; SAYING; TAKE; EATE; DRINKE,] your Ten Romish Prevarications, and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions. Afterwards in the following Bookes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled the stupendious Paradoxes, Sacrilegiousnes, and Idolatrie of your MASSE; together with the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obstinacies, some fewe Overtures of Periuries (out
<pb facs="10"/>
of that great Summe, which may afterwards be manifested in your swearing to the other <hi>Articles</hi> of your new <hi>Romane Faith)</hi> and the manifold Heresies in the Defenders thereof: as also their indirect and sinister Obiecting and Answering of the Testimonies of ancient Fathers thorow-out, as if they conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded neither from Conscience, nor for Conscience-sake.</p>
   <p>To Conclude. Whosoever among you hath beene fascina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (according to your <hi>Colliers Catechisme)</hi> with that only Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of an <hi>Implicite Faith;</hi> let him be admonished to submit to that Duety prescribed by the Spirit of God, to <hi>Trie all things,</hi> and to <hi>Hold that which is good.</hi> And if any have a purpose to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne, in Confutation either of the Booke of the Romish <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture,</hi> or of this, which is against your <hi>Masse;</hi> I doe adiure him in the name of Christ, whose trueth wee seeke, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding all deceitfull Collusions he proceed materially from Point to point, and labour such an Answer, which hee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth he may answer for before the iudgement seate of Christ. Our Lord Iesus preserve us to the glory of his saving Grace. AMEN,</p>
