fruites, I haue nothing but this
myte to leaue with you, which
is the summe of all my Sermons:
ye haue heard it alreadie; and
as the Apostle calles the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
his Epistle, so ye should be my Sermon,
that is,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 2.</note> my Sermon should bee printed in your
hearts, as this is printed in paper. If you haue not
giuen your hearts to him which sent for them, now
thinke that God hath sent for them againe: and
heare mee writing, whom yee cannot heare spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
<pb n="261" facs="142"/>
Take not custome for Religion, shunne oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
aswell as sinne, seeke the vse of euery thing,
desire not to haue your Kingdome here. And so I
leaue you all with Christ, (whom I haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched)
to bring forth the fruite of that seed which
is sowne: beseeching you for all the loue that you
haue of heauē, that ye would not count any thing
in this world, worthie to keepe your hearts from
God, but thinke of the day when ye shall giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for euery lesson which ye haue heard, and he
which hath called you in this prison, will glorifie
you in his Pallace: where ye shall see him to whom
ye haue giuen your hearts, and enioy that blessing
of blessings, which makes all the world to worship
him. The Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which
hath begun to draw you to his kingdome, neuer
leaue you vntill you come vnto it. Amen.</p>
