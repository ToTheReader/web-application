   <p>I Did write this booke in the beginning of my procedings, to the most gracious Prince Fride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rik Duke of Saxony, when he was sore sicke. Now many thought good that it should be imprinted, but when it had bene eftsones imprinted, it was so corrupted and made vnperfect, that I found many wordes wanting, which I my selfe could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture what they were: howbeit the sentences I haue restored after a sort, and such as I thinke I had in the beginning. Neither haue I thought it good now to chaunge or adorne them as I could: For I will in this booke shewe a testimonie of my proceeding, and gratifie the aduersaries, that they may haue wherewith to exercise their malice. It is sufficient for me if I please my Lord Christ &amp; his Sainctes: I reioyce from my hart, and giue thankes to my God that I am enuied and hated of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and his Impes.</p>
