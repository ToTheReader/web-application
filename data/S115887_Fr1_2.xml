This hasty resolution having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced so untimely an issue, It hapned by some accident to be like <hi>Moses</hi> in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy exposed to the Seas. Where I made no other account, but that its own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse would there have revenged my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer boldnesse, and betrai'd it unto perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But as he then, so this now, hath had the marvellous felicity to light on the view, and fall under the compassion of a very Gracious Princesse. For so farre hath your Highnesse vouchsafed (having hapned on the sight of this Tractate) to expresse fauour thereunto, as not onely to spend houres in it, and require a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of it, but further to recommend it by your Gracious judgement vnto pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like view.
