   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho sacrificed unto their Gods of
old (most Noble and illustrious
Prince) were accustomed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
the matter of their offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
as neere as they could, to the nature and
<pb facs="3"/>
better acceptance of the Deity to whom they
immolated; as to <hi>Mars</hi> a Horse, to <hi>Phoebus</hi> a
Cocke, to <hi>Venus</hi> a paire of Doves, to <hi>Vulcan</hi>
fire, and the like; in this Dedication I doe not
much deviate from that ceremony, for as your
G<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. knowledge is generally observed to bee
multifarious, and as the many successive most
famous Vertues of your illustrious Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
doe most conspicuously survive in you, so
no where more duely could this volume of
Varieties be sacrificed then to your Gr. Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
merits, which have learned <hi>Spaine</hi> and
other Countreys to speake you every way most
generous and Noble; and which favourably
shined upon by our most glorious Sun, makes
all conclude you to prove in your maturer
yeares both delightfull and profitable to King
and Countrey. What my continued night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watches,
studies, travells, and expences have
beene in these recollections, I will think wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
bestowed if they be graciously accepted;
and if they be thought worthy of your Graces
Patronage, I have my wish: Meane gifts have
beene favourably receaved by most worthy
men; the PERSIAN KINGS disdaine not
<pb facs="3"/>
their Peasants cups of water; not <hi>Donum</hi> but
<hi>Dantis animus</hi> is most acceptable; and with
what integrity of affection I offer this, shall
appeare in what more worthy labour shall
come from me hereafter; which already is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to your G. most worthy Patronage; as
are my perpetual Orations to God for increase
of all happinesse to be heaped on you; which
shall be still seconded with the most reall and
best services that are in the possibility of</p>
