   <head>To the World. Some speciall reasons for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication hereof.</head>
   <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He worthie example of imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Iustice in Dooming to death so haynous an offender, appeares more perspicuouslye in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Gentleman of high birth, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie descended, then if it had bene execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon a meaner offender.</p>
   <p n="2">2. As he was a Gentleman of good birth, so his much companye keeping could not chuse but make his vitious life knowne vnto manye thousands, vnto whome happily the report of his repentant death, might neuer
<pb facs="3"/> come, it being as great and iust a cause of his friendes ioy and comfort, in that he made so godlye an end, as it was a cause of griefe and sorrowe in that he liued so vngodly a life.</p>
   <p n="3">3. That his fall may be a warning to al such as shal reade it, to beware they run not such a race as hee did, least thereby their liues bee shortned as his was.</p>
   <p n="4">4. Because that some out of an error, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their owne hearing or vnderstanding, haue giuen it out that hee would haue dyed desperatelye, by casting himselfe from the Ladder, for the truth of which their asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they could not gather in all the time of his beeing vppon the Ladder, any the least reason to induce then so to thinke, for so farre was he from casting himselfe off, that not but by the strength of the Executioners Arme, hee could be turned off, because he would by no meanes be guiltie of his owne death.</p>
   <p>Lastlye, knowe that some more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of his Arraignement and also of his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I could haue set downe, but the former with modestie cannot be well expressed here, although necessitie constrained them to be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb facs="3"/> there, and the latter being thinges im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to this treatise, concerning his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, I willingly forbeare: yet are neither so sparingly touched, but that as much may be thereout gathered, as concernes eyther thee to knowe or me to write.</p>
