         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> ripping vp) of the whole body of Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and within a yeare and a halfe space, haue composed and briefly abridged a Scholasticall, and Methodicall Treatise of
<pb facs="7"/> the common places of sacred Theology; first,<note n="c" place="margin">Didacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cè.</note> by way of Doctrine, and confirmation in teaching the truth, then<note n="d" place="margin">Elenctice</note> by way of reproofe and confutation, in cutting of the Sprigges of errors, with the Sickle of Truth: for there is a two-fold way of teaching Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the one<note n="e" place="margin">De Ʋeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</note> of the Truth, the other<note n="f" place="margin">Pro veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</note> for the Truth: both are coupled together, as it were, by a sacred Wedlocke, and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the through handling of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Wee haue layde downe, and confirmed the Doctrine of the Truth, or the nature of every common Place by Definition, (where eyther it might, or should be done,) and an Analyticall Explication of the same by Causes; but haue concluded the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of falshood, with an Appendix, or (Addition) of generall Solutions, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions: every one of which, wee haue opposed against each Argument of Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, (where the place hath beene in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie with the Papists,) in the same order, as they are by him laid downe in the places noted. And so having passed through the whole course of our fore-determined Iourney, we are come at length to the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb facs="8"/> Goale, and haue finished both the partes, of Theology as it were in a Platform. One thing remayned, that I being privy to my selfe, of mine owne Infancy should intreat pardon of my Auditors, for mine ignorance, and excuse those things, which were spokē, and delivered by me with honest silence, &amp; so commit and commend them to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate curtesie, censure, and consideration. And I had so done, had not both the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke respect of my Theologicall study, and the private conscience of my Duty, besides the importunate intreaties of friendes, (as it were) wringed from me the Edition, or publication hereof. In so great a plenty of so many Theologicall Bookes, and common Places, the Students of Divinity haue of long time complayned of scarsity, and that not without cause; for the Writers and Authors of common Places, (who are in vse amongst young Students,) doe eyther with their prolixitie delay the speedy, longer then is meet, or with their overmuch brevity, eyther compell them to runne backe the same way of doctrine too often with loathing, or barre them from the other,
<pb facs="8"/> (which is by way of reprooving) with danger. Hence it is, that the fervour of Study waxeth faint, and before it be liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, oftentimes waxeth old. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore long ago both my desire, and the desire of all that are studious in sacred Theology, that both parts of Divinity might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and brought into a compendious Breviary by a Scholasticall, and Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call discourse: which, wile I wished, and waited for from others, who abound both in leysure and Learning, it seemed good vnto <hi>
         <seg rend="sup">i</seg>
      </hi> me to publish this our Booke, as a witnesse of our common desire, that as a fore-runner it might invite, and provoke those great wittes, whereof this age is most fruitefull, to accomplish the same. Which if I shall obtayne, I verily professe, that I haue receyved a plentifull fruit of this my labour: the meane while I trust, if as I would request, that those things, whereof I am ignorant, might bee imparted vnto me, without concealing of arrrogancy; so it shall be likewise acceptable, that I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part those few things which I know, vnto them that are desirous thereof. Moreover,
<pb facs="9"/> whereas the profession of the handling of common places was committed vnto mee, and the explication of them, was now at length to be taken in hand againe: I thought good, not onely to ease my Auditors from a trouble of writing, but also to lay forth, as in a Table, to their memory, and eyes, what hereafter they ought to expect from me, &amp; haue withall, as a guide in the way, with the finger pointed at the matter, to shew vnto the studious, the way, (and that the readiest way) to the Doctrinall, and reprooving Knowledge of Theologie. Now, vnto you (Right Honourable) I offer, and consecrate of due right, and desert, these first fruites of my profession, such as they are, as the young tender seedes of my The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall Harvest, which first sprung vp in your field, and afterwardes, through your courteous favour, attayned vnto some maturity; both, that I may testifie and shew some proofe of my thankefull heart, by this taske of duety, and especially, that yee may the more stirre vp your lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving favours and my studies, and so yeelde your selues to be my forwarders, and stout
<pb facs="9"/> protectors against the barking mouthes of the malevolent. And so I hope, and trust in the Lord you will: vnto whome I pray (Right Honourable,) that he will pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the course of all your Councels, and very long preserue you in a safe and flourishing Estate for the good of this Vniversity and Common-wealth.
