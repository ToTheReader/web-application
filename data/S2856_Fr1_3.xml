   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader,
these things that
thou findest in
this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of Faith, were
the summe of
sundry Sermons preacht in my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
weeke-day Lecture, seven or
eight yeeres agoe, which I wrote
brokenly and briefly for my owne
memory, leaving out many things
that in the Vses &amp; Applications of
the points were delivered in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
which should set an edge upon
the doctrines delivered. I was reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
by some of the Auditors, when


<pb facs="5"/>
I had finisht them in preaching, that
they might have them still at hand
for helpe of their memories, and
furthering of their profiting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
But I thought it a good mercy
of God to me, that I might doe his
Church some little service by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
(wherein it hath pleased his
Majestie to give me some successe
and blessing, which is all I have to
rejoyce of in this world) and as
for printing, the knowledge of my
owne unfitnesse, and my want of
leisure made mee to refuse that
motion, and never to give my
minde to that worke. But now of
late a speciall godly friend by much
importunity drew my Notes from
me, and hath gotten them written
out (which I never could or would
doe) whose Copie when I had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used,
I found things so shortly and
imperfectly set downe, as I much
desired it might have beene sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
still, but his strong perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that it might bee of good use
to the poore people of God, in time


<pb facs="5"/>
overcame mee: though thou shalt
finde it farre otherwise than I
would have had it if I had had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to have revised it, or then if I
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ad yeelded to the first motion it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ight have beene, for then when
things were fresh in minde, I could
with little more paines have set
them downe more fully and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than now I can, or could if I had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eysure by many degrees; neither
could I possibly in cold blood, and so
long after, call to minde or write
those stirring passages that God
brings to hand in the heate of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.
Well, craving pardon for
all defects, I commit it to thy hand
as it is, humbly begging the Lords
blessing and good hand to goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
If any by the Excellency, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
and Rarenesse of this grace
of Faith shall bee provoked to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to be possessed of it, that are
as yet without it, and those that
have it to nourish it, that it may
encrease to the best degrees, and to
live by it to the glory of God, their


<pb facs="6"/>
encrease of comfort here, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
hereafter; I shall have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
my end, be heartily glad, and
give God thankes. If any reape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fruit hereby (as if they read it
advisedly, teachably, and with see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
God, I hope they shall) give
God the praise, and pray for the
Author, and for this crazed and
last part of his life.</p>
   <p>But let me advertise thee of one
thing, good Christian Reader, that
howsoever thou shalt often finde
in this Treatise, Faith spoken of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>
of a particular perswasion of a
mans heart, that Christ Iesus is
his, and that hee shall be saved by
him, that yet it is not meant, that
that is the first act of Faith, which
is rather an accepting of Christ, a
leaning upon him, and a laying hold
on him offered by God; And then
after by a second act of Faith by
finding a true and unfamed change
of heart and life wrought in him,
hee is then and thereby perswaded
that hee is one of those that Christ


<pb facs="6"/>
dyed for. Therefore this I take
to bee a good description of Faith;
That it is the mighty worke of the
holy Ghost, whereby a sinner hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by the Law, and quite driven
out of himselfe, by or upon the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and sweet voyce of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and the free and unpartiall
offer of mercy from God in Christ,
comes in time to cast himselfe upon
Christ, and trust to him as the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient
and only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>anes of his
salvation, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> willing to
be subject to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> his dayes.
And to say that Faith is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Application of Christ to a
mans owne soule, is a true and safe
definition thereof: for there be that
doe truly beleeve in Christ, and
that to salvation, if they should
then dye, that yet are not come to
bee perswaded that Christ is theirs;
which comes after, either by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of Gods Spirit, or the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their owne spirit, from the
truth of their Sanctification.</p>
   <p>Having advertised thee of this,


<pb facs="7"/>
I commend thee to God, and to the
word of his grace which is able to
build thee up further, and give the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>

by Faith in Christ Iesus.</p>
