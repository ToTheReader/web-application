And seeing the profite that it hath done, and howe many haue been remedied and healed with those reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I did determine to proceede forwardes, &amp; to write of the thinges, which after that the first part was written, haue come from those countries, of the which I haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that no lesse vtilitie and profite shal come, then of those which are past, for there shalbe discouered newe thinges &amp; secrets, which will bring admiration, neuer to this day seene nor knowne before. And seeing that these medicinall things which we do treate of, &amp; the Realmes and Countries from whence they come, belong vnto your maiestie, and he also that writeth of them, is your Maiesties subiect: I doe desire your Maiestie, to receiue this trauell into your protection, and that the reward may be such, as for the like workes dedicated to your Maiestie is accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be geuen.</p>
