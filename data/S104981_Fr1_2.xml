   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM BOLD RIGHT VVOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull,
on the generall report of good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and great commendation that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest
sort giues you (besides mine own affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
to present a fewe sorrowfull verses vnto
your protection and iudgement. And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moued to write of some sad inuention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I neuer knewe you delight in light or wanton discourses.
Many times I haue beheld the eeuen carriage of your behauiour
and good inclination, towards vertuous exercises &amp; studies, that
many wayes produced as much benefite to those you fauour, as
procured profit and commoditie to your selfe: a naturall dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of a good minde, necessary to bee about Princes, and a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes
that in these dayes is not common among men. And for
feare I should runne too far in those causes by manifest speeches
(which is not commonly allowed) I desire no more in you, but a
continuance of goodnes and those vertues rehearsed, and so fall I
to my purposed matter. The troth is good Sir, in the long pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of mine, I purchased many good friendes (requisite for my
infortunat life) which friends did no soner encrease, but in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as quickly went away, either by death or some vnwelcome
accident: and loozing dayly one or an other that stood mee in
great steede, I bethought me ouer-often on my great losse, so sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
a kinde of lamentation in that behalfe to expresse the want
of such friendes, I presumed to offer you this simple Pamphlet,
as a testimony to be thankfull to those that did me pleasure, (the
Bishop of Oxford one of the chiefest,) and to keepe their fauour
I honour and loue, who now are aliue.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>This trifle in verse, is named, <hi>A Feast of sad cheere,</hi> because
the best banquets I can make to my friendes, is but bare Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Epitaphes, or such bitter fruite as sewe doe feede on, and
many takes no taste in, the sowrnes of my delicates so little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
a multitude. And indeed Syr now I am left voyd of al pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision,
and am compelled to present such things as comes next
to my hande, because a Booke called my Challenge, (dedicated to
the honorable, Maister Secretarie <hi>Wolley;</hi>) hath caried away most,
or all together of my other conceits: yet my hope is, this little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
that I offer you, shall be as well accepted, as though I
could haue feasted you with a finer Banquet; for you knowing
mine abilitie in furniture and knowledge, I trust you will take
well in worth what of good will I am able to bring.</p>
   <p>Thus wishing you much harts ease, worldly hap, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
felicitie, I take my leaue, desiring you with fauour to reade
that which followeth.</p>
