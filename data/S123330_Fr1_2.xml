   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two thinges especially, that behoueth all good men to haue regarde of in this life. The one is the inlarging of the kingdome of Christ, to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of their powers, in a lawfull and holy voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the other is simplicity and plainnes, in the places that God putteth men into, or in the words or workes, that he inableth them to performe therein. At both which things we our selues haue aimed (so farre forth as humāe infirmytie would suffer) in the pulishing of this present work, for the further decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof wee haue beene contented to prefixe these fewe lines. By Gods good prouidēce, the booke it selfe came into our hādes from amongst the writings, of that religious &amp; worshipful Gentlmā M. <hi>Herlakinden</hi> of Kent, esquier late deceased, and for whose cause onely (as we suppose) the penning of this was performed at the first: Which hauing once gotten into our handes, we could not let lie and perish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the wormes and moaths (as the prouerbe is) vnles we would closly &amp; vnder hand haue hindered the edification of the Church, but indeuour to our vttermost the publishing of the same. Wherein if any man thinke we did it, for glory or gaine vnto our selues, wee can not but tell them that as they doe vncharitably surmise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, so they doe fondly and fouly deceiue themselues, as for glorye, how can we attayne, sith the labor is wholy an others, and no part ours, except men would thinke vs to be so conceited that wee would count it credit to be decked with other birdes feathers, and to waxe rich with the robbery and vniust spoyles of others. And for gayne there is as litle, if not lesse reason, for besides that we know not what vent we shal haue, the sale being very vncertaine, what likelyhood is there that our aduantage can be much, in publishing cōmentaries vpon that booke of which there are so many learned expositions extant already? And yet least any should imagine that we haue without cause, caused this to be printed, besides the reasons before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged we say, that both the soundnes of the matter it selfe, and the manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery obserued therein, which is both plaine and short (the one seruing for the more simple sort of people, and the other fitting such as either can not, or will not, allowe themselues leasure to read long commentaries) hath drawen vs on hereto. Wherein we do willingly giue al the world to vnderstand, that we speak not so much our own minds, for we confesse our selues to be men not greatly able to discerne of such high points but we vtter that, that men of good countenance in the Church, &amp; of sound iudgement, as in respect of religion, haue deliuered, and that we hope all that read it, shal well find and perceiue. There resteth no more but this, that euery good man labour to referre it, to good ends and holy purposes, namely to the building vp of thē selues and others, in knowledge, in faith, in repentance and obedience of al such good
<pb facs="3"/> things, as God hath reueiled in his worde, praying the Godly reader, for his better &amp; more plain direction in that behalfe, diligently to obserue these few points follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, First that all that is spoken, vppon all the Psalmes or any of them, respecteth either the diuisiō of the Psalme it selfe into his members and parts, or the true sense and natural meaning of the very words, or the doctrines, touching faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that are therein conteined. Secondly that wheresoeuer they shall finde, these letters, markes, or directions ensuing: i. vz. q.d. they would take paines to resolue and interpret them thus, namely that, i. signifieth that it is to say, vz. signifieth to wit: and q.d. meaneth as if he should say. Thirdly, that the framer of this work in all his notes, at the least (for the most part we are sure of it) had speciall respect to that english text of the Psalmes and Bible that was Imprinted, at Geneua, which was as it shoulde seeme, the first yere of the raygne of our gracious Queene, which also we thought good to aduertise the reader of that so he may haue an eye always in his reading to, that text, or others conformable to the same, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vpon good authoritie, though it be not wholly put downe here, nor the wordes of it in other letters for difference sake, as had been to be wished. Lastly wee are ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to intreat the godly reader, fauourably to interpret, and with loue to correct, whatsoeuer hath escaped here, through the negligence or ignorance of the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, imployed about this busines, some taste whereof also euen we our selues haue thought good to giue vnto them, by putting downe some fewe scapes obserued in the ouer reading of it, that so if there be any such like (as we hope there are not many) they may by these amend the rest. And thus beseeching God to giue a blessing vnto this work in the heartes of all these into whose handes it shall come, we end the <hi>28.</hi> of Aprill. <hi>1586,</hi>
