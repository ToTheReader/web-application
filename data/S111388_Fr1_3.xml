   <head>TO THE RIGHT Worthy, Generous, and well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Commander Captaine <hi>IOHN WED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DELL,</hi> late Generall of the East-India Fleet.</head>
   <p>WOrthy Sir, hauing written the true manner of your late famous, perillous, and fortunate fight with the <hi>Portugalls</hi> in the Persian Gulfe, and knowing that Bookes without Patrons are like fatherlesse Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I imagined that it was better to send it to you for succour and protection, than to any other whomsoeuer; for the most part which is herein by Relation, I am assured that you doe know to be true by action, and my pen hath but only superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially pratled of those things which you saw, did,
<pb facs="4"/>
and suffered. I therefore humbly intreat you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this poore fish out of your owne Ocean, this sheepe of your owne fold, this cloth of your owne weauing, and this deserued memory of part of your worthy won reputation. Thus not doubting but your affabilitie is correspondent to your approued knowledge and knowne sufficiencie, I commit both my selfe and this Relation to your acceptance and good censure, my best wishes still attending on you, that your fortunes be euer equall to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your minde.</p>
