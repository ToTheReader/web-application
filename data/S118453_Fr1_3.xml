   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Christian reader, I publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed a booke against the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> whom I haue in the same termed the <hi>Donatists</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> How farre of I was from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing anie such thing at the first, and how I was drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it afterward, I haue in that former booke truly reported. And for warrant of my doing before the Lord, I had no doubt but that it should bee an acceptable seruice to Christ: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing when I respect the waightines and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the worke, I haue alwaies wished, and do wish, that some man of greater learning might deale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thē. Neither as yet am I cast into any thoughts of doubting, by the mislike, or fault finding of some in all places, which are no <hi>Brownists:</hi> But I am ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thrust forward by beholding that weakenes of iudgement and want of vnderstanding not in a feaw, touching the foulnes of <hi>Donatisme,</hi> and by the sight of such nerenes of multitudes vnto the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which before I coulde not suspect. Now tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the faultes which are found, which causeth the mislike, they are partelie for the matter it selfe, and partlie for the manner of dealing both in it, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so towards the persons themselues against whome I write. In the matter some haue found fault as though I should stand to cleere &amp; to iustifie al things, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the Booke of Common praier, but also in the calling and ordination of our Ministers, and in our
<pb facs="4"/>
Church gouernement, others affirme that I haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished the faults which are esteemed to be in these, and made them lighter, at the least by not reproouing them. The first sort I cannot but meruaile at, seeing I haue in that my former booke set downe expressie in these words, that the matter in question betweene the <hi>Brownists</hi> and me, is not about the controuersie in our Church, as whether there be imperfections, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and faults, in our Worship, Ministerie and Church gouernement, nor how many great or smal: but whether there be such heinous enormities as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the verie life, and being of a true Church, and make an vtter diuorse from Christ. I doo then lay open the state of this question so plainelie, as I know not how to make it more plaine: now vnles I should run through euerie particular which wee deale in, which I thought to be needlesse, but now I will a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle stand vpon it. They reckon Romish fasts, Ember dayes, Saincts eues and Lent: Idoll feasts, as Alhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, Candlemas, seuerall Ladie daies, Saincts daies, dedicating Churches vnto Saints. Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Rogations, and Purifications, Tithes, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, Mortuaries, howsling the sick, with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, absolution, and blasphemous dirges, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Sermons, ouer and for the dead. Corrupt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of administring the Sacraments, the Font, the crosse in Baptisme, Baptisme by women, gossippings, blasphemous and hereticall collects. These and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other haue they set downe, to bee in the Booke not vnder the termes of faults, blemishes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but as heresies, blasphemies, and abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that such as ouerturne the foundation of the
<pb facs="4"/>
Christian faith, destroy the substance of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and take away the life, and beeing of a true Church. To this I haue answered, that they be foule slaunderours liars, &amp; false accusers, shewing that our Church hath renounced in those former things that which is blasphemous and hereticall, or so abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as that it approacheth neerest to the destroying of the faith and holy worship of the Lord. As namelie the remission of sinnes, and merite of eternall life by fasting, which is the doctrine of the Romish church. The worship and inuocation of Saints and Angels, the power of expelling Diuels by the signe of the crosse, and such like things which the papacie is full of, but reiected by vs. If the <hi>Brownists</hi> in their replie against that I haue written, shall prooue by the word of God, that there be great corruptiōs in our praiers, in our fasts, in our keeping the Saints dayes, in the Crosse, and in manie other things which bee in our Church, as in our Ministerie and Church gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt. And further if their proofes be neuer so clere &amp; strong from the Scriptures, yet they answere not me at al, nor touch the question or controuersie between them and me, vnles they can prooue them to be such faults as destroy the worship of God, ouerturne the foundation of the faith, and take away the verie life and being of true Christianitie. If (I say) they do not prooue them, according as they haue set thē downe, to bee blasphemies, heresies, abominations, yea the verie worship and yoake of Antichrist, the marke of the beast, and his power: I remaine vnanswered, and they stand conuicted as liars, slanderers and most wicked false accusers not of particular persons, but of
<pb facs="5"/>
whole Churches. For I shewed in expresse wordes that I doo not meddle at all in these questions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there bee corruptions and faults in our Church condemned by Gods word, whether they bee manie or fewe, whether they bee small or great, but onelie thus farre whether they bee such or so great, as make our Churches Antichristian. Here therefore I doo intreate the Christian Reader to fixe his eyes in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my writings and theirs, onelie vppon this one question, whether there be in our Church any errors or faults that be found amentall? Looke if I haue in this point by denying that there bee swarued from the sacred word of God, from the iudgement of the holie Churches, and writings of the most worthy &amp; noble instruments which God hath at all times giuen to be the guides and lights in the same. And if it can be prooued, that I haue gone awrie from the trueth but an heire breadth, I will reuoke it: for trueth is to bee bowed vnto and reuerenced, wheresoeuer shee sheweth her sweete face, of all that looke to haue any part in her. Marke also their writings as they shall come foorth, and see wherein they can conuince me of any error, falsehood or corruption, touching this one forenamed question, vnto which they are to be held seeing we set all other controuersies aside.</p>
   <p>Then touching the second sorte, which finde fault about handling the matter, as if that I should mitigate or make lighter the faults of our Churches, at least in this, that I do not reprehend them. To this I answer, first, that vnles it can bee shewed, that our Church is guilty in some of those crimes which I stand to clere it in, I see no reason why I shoulde bee charged to
<pb facs="5"/>
make things lighter, which I medle not withall, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in shewing that they be not fundamentall. Secondlie, I intreate al men to consider that I stand to defend a Church, and not the infirmities or offences of a Church, in which as there be many bad mēbers, so the best are traile. If a godlie man because of some apparant sinnes, should be accused to be an Atheist, an infidell, a traitor, or a most vile and filthie wretch: might not he clere himselfe of such horrible crimes, but it must be saide, he dooth mittigate his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities or make them lighter? Thirdlie, I doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest them to consider the state of our people, how speedelie verie manie are carried into great euils and dangers, though not all in the same degree. I am of this minde, that where any thing is amisse in Gods Church, it is the part and duetie of the faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, all dutifull reuerence and submission being obserued towards Magistrates &amp; publique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, peaciblie to seeke redresse of the same, with godlie and charitable reprehension. I doo also holde that euery christian man is wiselie and soberly (with the like deuties of reuerence, submission, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able behauiour obserued) to seeke to haue his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence informed in all matters, which may any way concerne himselfe. But we see how farre some haue swarued and doo swarue from this. For the rule of charitie and christian dueties being neglected, the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet disgrace and contempt of men is sought, and that on either part. The warre is made as deadlie, as if the grounds of christianitie were in question: while some passing the bounds of modestie, others doo replie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them after the same manner. Our Sauiour saith Satan dooth not cast foorth Satan: and shall we
<pb facs="6"/>
thinke then that sinne, shall cast foorth sinne? Such as condemne and abhorre Schisme and errors, and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate dealing, must bee burthened and reproached with the same notwithstanding, which is iniurious. And what is in the mouthes of many against this, but that the Papists then may as well be excused, which condemne Master <hi>Luther</hi> and other as the fathers of heretiks, because swarmes of Anabaptists did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe immediatelie vpon their preaching the Gospel? When shall we then here come to an end? There wil bee contention in the Church: and humaine frailtie hath shewed it selfe this way, euen among the holie teachers of old, to the sharp reprehension, and in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reproaching one of another, as Master <hi>Beza</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the Epistle of his Booke against <hi>Erastus:</hi> but godlie men when they haue somewhat gone awrie, seek to amend their fault, by subduing their passions. Now looke also vpon the people, where wee may see verie many; who not regarding the chiefe chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian vertues &amp; godlie dueties, as namelie to be meek, to be patient, to be lowlie, to be full of loue and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, to deale vprightlie and iustly, to guide their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the feare of God, with wholsome instructions, and to stand fast in the calling, in which God hath set them) giue thēselues wholy to this, euen as if it were the summe and pith of religion, namelie to argue and talke continuallie against matters in the Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Bishops and Ministers, and one against another on both sides. Some are proceeded to this, that they will come to the assemblies to heare the Sermons and praiers of the Preacher, but not to the praiers of the booke, which I take to be a more grieuous sinne than manie doo suppose. But yet this is not the worst, for
<pb facs="6"/>
sundrie are gone further, and fallen into a damuable Schisme: and the same so much the more feareful &amp; dangerous, in that manie do not see the foulenes of it, but rather holde them as godlie Christians, and but a little ouershot in some matters. The sore is grieuous, and the wound is deepe; as I haue small ioy to behold it, so haue I lesse desire to make it deeper, wishing from my heart, that it might rather be cured. Such as bee of another minde, either in this, or in any thing that I haue writtē, I craue of them, that they wil giue me leaue, according to the doctrine and rule of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>fraterne dissentire,</hi> to dissent in some thing, without the breach and hindrance of brotherly loue. For as I do greatlie esteeme that rule of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> let as manie as be perfect be thus minded: if any be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise minded, God will reueale it. But so farre as we are come, let vs proceed by one rule, to be like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. so do I much lament to see it almost vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly neglected, and the breach of loue &amp; concord as violent among many, for euery matter wherein they dissent, as if some ground of christianity were in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion between them. I do not meane that a man ought to consent vnto any error, or vnto any euill commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by others, or to neglect the instructing and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, as his place and calling dooth require. But I had rather (as one saith) answer to God, if I must giue account, for mercie, rather than for rigour and seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. I knowe there be faults in extremities on both sides: as on the one side vnder a perswasion of loue, a man may be ouer fauorable in esteeming and bearing as brethren, such as hold the foundations of the faith, and yet erre in some things, and haue great faultes: so on the other side, vnder a perswasion of zeale against
<pb facs="7"/>
all falsehood and wickednes, they may fall into an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable rigour, as very many doo. The nature of man is more prone to this latter, and the fall is more grieuous than in that former; few are carried with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of godly loue, to offend in ouer fauorable iudging their brethren: and because the elect of God haue great infirmities, &amp; the Scripture doth not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men to be rigorous in condemning, if a man hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hatred &amp; zeale against all sin, iudge &amp; repute them as christian brethren, which it may be are not, his fall is not great, although he be ouer fauorable; for through humility he is below. Wheras on the other part, such as condemne with vncharitable rigor, they are lifted vp with swelling, and so their fall is deeper. This is my meaning in that I saide, I had rather an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to God for mercy than for rigour: now as I es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew it in my self, so would I be loath, seeing rigor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth among many, to giue any occasion to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the same by my writing. If I sin in this, yet I trust it is so, as no godly charitable man &amp; wel aduised wil make an outcry against me for it; if I shake hāds with sin let me be condēned for it, otherwise I craue that I may follow the rule of the Apostle. But now it wil be said by the third sort which finde fault with my book that I haue broken this rule towards the <hi>Brownists:</hi> as also that rule of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who willeth to instruct with patience such as be contrary minded, because I charg them not only with foule Schisme, but also with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, and for which I take it that obstinacie if it be found in thē, wil make them heretickes. They differ not frō vs, say some, in matters of faith, but doo ouer shoot thēselues, &amp; that on the right hand: for answer vnto these, first touching the rules of <hi>Paul,</hi> I know he
<pb facs="7"/>
himself did practize thē. And he that gaue these rules, so far as wee are come let vs proceed by one rule, &amp;c. and instructing with patience &amp;c. said also beware of dogs, beware of euill workmen, beware of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.</p>
   <p>Why did. S. <hi>Paule</hi> this, but mooued with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which the Churches were in by them? Men haue not now the consideration what it is to condemne the whole worship &amp; the Ministrie as Antichristian, and so vtterlie to take away the credite and power of the Ministrie and preaching Gods word. Will they esteeme it to bee lesse than that which the false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did? Againe, I see men are ignorant what the power of <hi>Donatisme</hi> was, how it preuailed and spread not onelie among the common sort, but had hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreths of preachers to publish and set it foorth. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doo men knowe the foulenes of <hi>Donatisme,</hi> nor the poynts of it, and that maketh them offended, that I terme the <hi>Brownists Donatists,</hi> &amp; hold it as a schisme and heresie. <hi>Cresconius</hi> the <hi>Donatist</hi> writing against <hi>Augustine,</hi> doth reprehend him for calling them he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; because they held the same doctrine, as hee saith, and if they offended, it could bee but as in a schisme. <hi>Augustine</hi> replieth, that <hi>Schisma inueteratum est haeresis,</hi> Inueterate schisme is heresie. And sheweth that some thinges they helde were hereticall. The Churches haue condemned it not only as a schisme, but also as an heresie. I haue out of large discourses of the controuersies betweene▪ the Churches and the <hi>Donatists,</hi> drawen foorth brieflie all the chiefe heads of <hi>Donatisme,</hi> and how they did stand to maintaine them, and with what scriptures. I compare the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> and them together in all poynts generallie held,
<pb facs="8"/>
and will stand to iustifie that they bee full <hi>Donatists,</hi> euen in the rankest <hi>Donatisme.</hi> If I haue not set down the <hi>Donatisme</hi> aright, and if the <hi>Brownisme</hi> be not the same, let me haue the shame for euer, that I haue giuē them the title, and can not iustifie that they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of it. Let the <hi>Brownists</hi> chuse which part they will, either to affirme that the <hi>Donatists</hi> had the truth, or else to cleere thēselues frō <hi>Donatisme,</hi> I will ioyne with them, or rather against them in either. And in the meane time I do exhort al other to be sober min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and discreet, and not to thrust the simpler sort headlong into it, by exclaiming that they bee ouer hardlie dealt withall. For what say some? If these that are called <hi>Brownists</hi> bee godly men, and but ouerseene in some matters, we will chuse to ioyne with thē, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thā with the publike assemblies of our Church. These men are they in compassion of whō I write. Now, the chiefe heads in which I compare them are these: The <hi>Donatists</hi> did falselie accuse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Churches and al the Ministers to be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie polluted, and al their worship, and separated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues without all order of discipline: So haue the <hi>Brownists</hi> done. The <hi>Donatists</hi> tooke beginning by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of one man, whom they held to be no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ, but after they made their defence that all were polluted, and all the Ministers the generatiōs of Traitors, Iudasses, and persecutors of the iust: that the Churches in the beginning after the times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution were not well ordered by separation of the faithfull from the wicked. For because there were many both Ministers and people which in time of persecution to saue their liues had denied the faith &amp; sacrificed to Idols, and deliuered the holie Scriptures
<pb facs="8"/>
to the persecutors: and when <hi>Constantine</hi> gaue peace, being become Christian, returned and were not cast foorth. Hereupon the <hi>Donatists</hi> said all were vtterlie polluted: &amp; that because some such did ordaine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, at least as they reported, they accused all the Ministers to bee the sons of traitors which ordained them, and so were no ministers of Christ, had no true praier, nor Sacraments. The <hi>Brownists</hi> affirme that all our assemblies which openlie committed Idolatrie, were at the sound of a Trumpet, at the coronation of the Queene called to be Churches: that the bad were not separated frō the good: that our ordainers were Idolaters, &amp; that we are their children; no Ministers of Christ, but Baals priests &amp; persecutors: &amp; so haue no word of God, nor no Sacraments, nor true church, all being polluted with the open sinnes committed. Thus both make the holie things of the Lord, which indeed are vnchangeable, or els we could haue no cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: as namely, the word of God, the praiers, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, &amp; the ordination of Ministers, to be pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; destroied by the wickednes of men. The <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> held that Princes were not to compell vnto reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, &amp; so cried out of persecution, &amp; gloried of their sufferings &amp; multitude of martyres. And what do the <hi>Brownists?</hi> These things with the rest will better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the seuerall comparisons, as they followe in my booke. I now intreate the reader not to iudge of any one thing vntill he haue read the whole. I also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that the sayings of the ancient writers which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage may be wel waied, for proofe of that for which I cite them. If any shall say, what shall we ground vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon men? I answer, I alleage them but to shew what the controuersie was &amp; how it was disputed on both
<pb facs="9"/>
sides: &amp; for this they are sufficient witnesses. Beleeue their reasons as ye find they be confirmed by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scriptures: I haue set downe the Latin, least any should thinke I haue not dealt plainlie. And touching the last part of this my booke which is an answer to Master <hi>Greenwood,</hi> concerning read prayer, peruse it throughlie and then iudge whether I haue charged him wrongfullie in any matter. I do lament that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our people which haue been hearers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, should be so ignorant, as to suck in such dregs as he offereth. Now to conclude, there are two things which deceiue many, which I desire thē to consider: one is that they are caried away with many true and notable sentences of Scripture &amp; worthie principles which the <hi>Brownists</hi> set down, not considering or not espying how they from them doo draw out false as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions, and thereupon cōclude that which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. The other is that they looke not vpō that which followeth vppon their wordes by consequence, but stand vpon this, O they hold no such thing, they haue wrong. Master <hi>Greenwood</hi> crieth out that he doth not condēneal Churches, he denieth not that the psalmes are to be sung to God, he saith not that the regenerate do not sin, he hath no such meaning, he hath wrong. But mark if I haue done him any wrong at all: looke vpon his sayings, and vpon that which must needes followe vpon them. The other <hi>Brownists</hi> crie out of the like wrōgs. Iudge not vntil both ye heare where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they haue wrong, and see mine answer. If I haue charged them with matter which either their words doo not expresse, or that followeth not from them by necessarie consequence, let me then bee iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged rash and vncharitable.</p>
