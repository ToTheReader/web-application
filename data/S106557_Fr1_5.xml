   <p>
      <hi>O</hi> Blessed God, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, whose deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercie to me hath been so infinite, that nothing in earth, which I enjoy, is worthy enough to be offered unto thee: yet because thou hast so plentifully rewarded the widow of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta, for sharing that little which she had, unto the Prophet; and hast promised even the kingdome of heaven to them, who in thy name give a cup of water, of cold water; and hast most graciously accepted the poorest oblations, both of the goats hair toward thy Tabernacle, and the widows two mites into the treasurie; receive (I most humbly beseech thee) the free-will-offering of my heart, and weak endeavours of my hand, in this intended service: and as thou didst fill Bezale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and Aholiab with an excellent spirit of wisdome and subtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, to finde out all curious works, to the beautifying of thy Tabernacle: so I most meekly desire thee, to enlighten my soul, to elevate my dull understanding; that I may search for such secret things as may be found, and finde such things as may be searched for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and modestly; and that I may, like Joshuahs good spies, acquaint my self and others with the desert wayes, and the severall tracts and paths, which our souls, immediately after death, must travell and passe over, toward the Celestiall Canaan. O God, my good God, grant me to accomplish this, through the safe conduct of Him, who is the faithfull Guide, the onely Way, the Light, and Joy of my soul, my Lord and Saviour JESƲS CHRIST. So be it, most gracious Redeemer, So be it.</p>
