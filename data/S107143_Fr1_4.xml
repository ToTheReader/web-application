   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit I acknowledge (most noble Prince) this Commentarie to be faithfully and aptly gathered from my ordinarie readings: yet in regard it was polished by another hand; at the first I feared, lest being published vnder the title of your name, it might seeme I had not furnished my selfe with a present worthie of your Maiestie. But one speciall reason among others, in the end freed mee from this feare; namely, that as this Princely Prophet descended of the blood Royall; and a most honourable Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of Christ the Soueraigne King, suted well with your person: so I hoped that my labours which I haue taken in expounding his prophecies, would bee accepted and esteemed of you.</p>
   <p>Moreouer, seeing he had good experience of the disposition of fiue Kings, far vnlike each other, to whom he continually preached: yet I need not aduertise you, which of these you ought to follow, neither yet to exhort you to the performance of such duties, vnto which you shew your selfe alreadie most willing.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Vzziah</hi> and <hi>Iotham</hi> fauoured him; and yet they wanted sufficient courage in erecting Gods pure worship: the greatest conflicts he sustained was with <hi>Ahaz:</hi> not that he was an open enemie; but a false hypocrite, full of dissimulation, and treacherie. And what ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (I pray you) gaule Gods seruants more then such? His successor <hi>Hezechiah</hi> not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced this holy personage, but also modestly, as one of the cōmon sort, submitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to his doctrine; obeyed his counsels, and suffered himself to be gouerned by his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions. Nay which is more, he willingly yeelded to be sharply reprooued by the Prophet when need required. The last, which was <hi>Manasses,</hi> who, as all the Iewes with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent affirme, was his father in law, wickedly slew him by cruell torments. Yea, euen during the time that good Kings aided him, and also vnder <hi>Hezechias;</hi> who shewed himselfe so godly a protector of pietie and godlinesse, yet then, was he continually vexed with sharpe and tedious trauels, and made to vndergoe very grieuous conflicts: so difficult and rare a thing is it to see men consent to wholsome doctrine. I say more; such as will faithfullie and vprightly discharge their duties in this propheticall function, must needes make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be at continuall oddes with the world. So much the more therefore ought faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Kings, by their defence, to succour the Ministers of Christ, that they be not molested nor pressed aboue measure, by the insolencie of the wicked.</p>
   <p>But by how much the more as this vertue is excellent, and truely heroicall; so if wee shall call to mind what hath past in all the ages from the first (till now;) how rarely hath it been found; or how few haue giuen themselues to the practise of it? Many being remisse and fainthearted, haue through meere negligence suffered Gods truth to be suppressed, as if the matter had not at all concerned them. The greater part shewing themselues aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, haue with furie and violence rushed against it. And would to God all those who at this day professe themselues Christians, had but so much heart to aduance the doctrine of saluation, as they are proude in glorying of this name.</p>
   <pb facs="6"/>
   <p>But to be silent touching others, we may yet at the last worthilie esteeme this comfort not as a common fauour, in the miseries wherein the Church now is, that you, most noble King, haue been raised vp of God, with this spirit, and excellent magnanimitie of mind, to maintaine the pure religion; and as effectually to offer vnto God your seruice in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, as you know he receiues and approoues the same at your Maiesties hands. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the affaires of the Kingdome be yet managed by your honourable Counsell: and that as wel the most noble Duke of Sommerset, your Maiesties Vncle, as also many others, haue taken the cause of religion so to heart, that they labour diligently (as it is very fit they should) to establish the same: yet doe you in such sort outgoe them all; that it well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, the zeale which they see in you prouokes them not a little to follow you. For you haue the same, not only to be of such a princely disposition as promiseth much, and to haue some seeds of vertues also, (which yet neuerthelesse seemes great in so young yeeres) but more then that, such a ripenesse of these vertues alreadie growne beyond your age; which to the most aged, gets not only rare praise, but also ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es them much to be admired. And aboue al, so greatly is your pietie commended, that I am very wel assured our Prophet shal haue one, that wil with like respect reuerence him being dead, as <hi>Hezekias</hi> did whilest he was liuing.</p>
   <p>As concerning the fruite which may happily redound vnto you thereby, it is best your selfe should learne it by your owne experience in reading of him: and yet I haue touched that also a little in the preface. There is only one thing which I haue determined to say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Maiestie, (and this it is:) After the Prophet hath laid foorth Gods iust complaints against this so vnthankfull a people, and hath threatned the Iewes with such chastisements as their disloyall reuolt, and desperate obstinacie deserued; namely, that the time appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, wherein they should be brought to an horrible ruine: foorthwith comming to set foorth the new and incredible restauration of the Church, hee promiseth that God will so respect the same, that in despite of all her enemies, shee shall alwaies flourish in beauty, and happinesse. Those which returned from the captiuitie of Babylon felt this ioyous and blessed estate, when the sacrifices being againe newly erected, they might conceiue some good hope of greater benefits, then those which they then enioyed: as when we behold the breake of day, wee expect the Sunne-rising soone after. But when Christ the sunne of righteousnesse appeared with his glorie in his Gospell, the thing it selfe greatly surpassed all that which had been highlie praised by the Prophets reuelations.</p>
   <p>Within short space the knowledge of the true God was dispersed almost throughout the whole world. The pure religion which before was despised and shut vp within the bounds of Iudeah (as in a narrow corner) now bega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o bee spread into al nations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, yea, so honoured, that God was called vpon with one consent of faith by infinit multitudes. The sonne of God hauing here and there gathered the Churches, set vp his royall throne, and aduanced the same into the highest degree to be seene of all from the East vnto the West. The Churches adorned with admirable graces of the holy Ghost, not onely tasted of the incomparable fruite of the diuine goodnesse, but were also faire and shining theaters to manifest the wonderfull power of God, euen to such as were blind. And albeit, Christ raigned vnder the crosse, yet amiddest the fierie conflicts and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, his glorie shined more gloriouslie, and his triumphs more stately, then if the Church had alwaies enioyed tranquillitie.</p>
   <p>In the end it came to passe, that that hautie pride of the Romane Empire submitting it self also vnto Christ, was a singular ornament to the house of God. But the malice &amp; ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men was the cause why this happinesse lasted not successiuely. And so the spouse of Christ as one stripped of so pretious a robe, spoiled of her dignitie, and depriued of her honourable attire, was brought backe againe to a miserable deformitie: yet God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies preserued some remainders, as it were in secret corners; but as touching the outward face of the Church, for the space of many yeeres, nothing appeared any where, but scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings and confused wasts. And we at this day behold how the Roman Antichrist, vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping farre and neere ouer the sanctuarie of the Lord, by a sacrilegious tyrannie holds it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet rent and oppressed. For seeing the puritie of doctrine is there corrupted by monstrous errors, and that Gods seruice being ouerturned, idolatries raigne there without number; that in stead of a gouernement rightly instituted, a cruell torture hath been
<pb facs="6"/> brought in, that the Sacraments be in part by grosse and absurd abuses corrupted, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shamefully set to sale: what remaine there (I pray you) but wofull ruines of that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall beautie of the spirituall building?</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding the Lord in our times hath begun againe to set vp that which was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len downe, that at least there might be some image of the true Temple where he was pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serued according as he hath ordained in the Gospel. To which end he hath selected out as it were from among the least of the common people, his chiefe builders, to aduance this worke by sincere doctrine. I grant, it is of it selfe a difficult worke, and of great waight, though Satan should let vs alone in quiet. But if euen now whilest some part of this buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is raised vp, he doth his vtmost to break it downe, is it any maruell if we labour much, and with great care, &amp; yet see little or no fruit for the present to come of our labors? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these mightie Giants proudly scorne vs: as if whilest we studying how to practise the ruine of the tyrannous Romane sea; wee should striue to ouerthrow the mount Olympus.</p>
   <p>These great wits also, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>o (as they thinke) know somewhat, deride our diligence; in regard we are so earnestly busied in restoring the Church to her first estate: as if in the same any certaine or setled estate were to be expected. For these (forsooth) imagine that they are so well founded, and on all sides so furnished, that it is no lesse easie to abolish poperie, then to mingle heauen and earth together. But the conceit of these wise men differs some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what. For in regard the peruersitie of the world is so great, that it cannot be held in awe, they thinke we trauel in vaine, and against the streame to seeke in correcting vices, to haue a pure and sincere administration of a Church. The flout of <hi>Erasmus</hi> is well enough knowne; What hopes <hi>Capito</hi> of the tenth which shall come after him? It cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but <hi>Wolfangus Capito</hi> was an holy man, who with a most sincere affection endeuoured to purge the Church. But because he was perswaded that the Ministers of Christ should no lesse lose their labour in correcting the stubbornenesse of the world, then if they should haue taken vpon them to haue forced the streame the contrarie way (for thus they are wont to thinke who talke of things in the shade) he taxeth vs all of inconsiderate zeale in the person of one. But both the one and the other are much deceiued, in that they consider not, that wee so imploy our selues in the Lords seruice, as he hath commanded, that in the meane while the restauration of the Church is meerely the worke of his owne hands. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it without cause that the whole Scripture commonly testifies, and that our Prophet againe and againe so carefully repeates it. Wherefore being mindfull of this doctrine, let vs no way be discouraged from vndertaking vnder Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> guidance, a businesse which farre surmounts our owne abilities; that so no encumbrances may either breake off our purpose, or so weaken vs, that we should d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>st from our enterprise.</p>
   <p>And here I doe expresly summon you, most excellent King, or rather God by the mouth of his Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> calles you, namely, to goe on in imploying whatsoeuer power and force God hath endued you withall; and with new encreases to set forward the restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, which is now so happily begun in your kingdome. First, you daily heare and reade that this charge is committed vnto you in that Kingdom ouer which God hath placed you. Yea, and <hi>Isaiah,</hi> as I haue said, calling Kings nurcing fathers of the Church, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not that the helpe which shee in this behalfe requires of you in her affliction, should now be wanting vnto her. Neither ought your heart to bee lightly touched with that, where the Prophet denounceth an heauie curse to fall vpon all Kings and nations, which shall defraud her of their aide.</p>
   <p>Againe, your Maiestie also euidently knowes, that euen the necessitie of these times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. And albeit by your endeuours, it may be you shall gaine little; yet knowing how acceptable a seruice this is vnto God, and that it is a sweete smelling sauour in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils, no dangers whatsoeuer ought to turne you from this enterprise.</p>
   <p>Seeing then that God thus exhorts you to behaue your selfe valiantly, and therewithall promiseth you an happy issue: why shuld you not cheerfully follow him whē he cals you? In another place our Prophet cries; <hi>Prepare, prepare the way for my people.</hi> It is wel enough knowne, how there was no hope that the poore captiues could bee restored home to their countrie againe, neither was this presently performed. But in regard the Prophet by the spirit of prophesie, then foresaw what the posteritie should effectually feele, lest by so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
<pb facs="7"/> a spectacle, the faithfull might be discouraged, he preuents them betimes; telling them that there are no obstacles or impediments, whatsoeuer (be they as firme and as close as they may be) thorow which God wil not make a way to deliuer his Church. Neither do we stand in lesse need of consolation to quicken vs vp at this day. And as for you, most noble King, it is very requisit that you be readie and watchfull, in respect of the charge which is committed vnto you, seeing <hi>Isaiah</hi> exhorts all Kings and Magistrates, in the person of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> to reach foorth their hand to the Church in her trauel, to the end shee may be restored to her former estate. Although in this regard your condition differs much from that of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in that he being but a stranger ouer the Lords flock was neuer taught expreslie, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and with a franke courage to offer himself to restore &amp; maintaine the Church: but you, whom the Lord hath not only vouchsafed to receiue by adoption, but hath also placed you in highest ranke among his children; the Prophet calles you to this office, as if he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched you out his hand. So much the more confidently therefore, and with the more ardent affection ought you to proceede on in this race. The matter (as I haue said) is in it selfe full of great difficulties, intangled with much tediousnesse, and mingled with dangers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Satan ceaseth not to broch his cunning shifts and deuices (if by any meane he might) either to ouerthrow, or destroy the holie temple of God; sometimes also God by such tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als will prooue our constancie. But if you be resolued, that hitherto you haue enterprised nothing by your most graue Counsell but by diuine authoritie from Gods word, and that for the present you so continue in restoring the estate of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Church, no doubt but you shall find by experience how wonderfully God will effect that which he hath giuen his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in charge: England shall receiue an incomparable fruit from this so happie a going forward: and we shall haue cause too, with you and your whole kingdome to reioyce. In the meane while I will not cease to further your holy endeuours, as there is good cause, by my poore prayers, in regard they are the best meanes I am able to afford you. Farewell most noble King. The Lord long preserue your flourishing estate, assist and guide you by his holy spirit, and in all things blesse and prosper you. So be it. From Geneua this fiue and twentieth of December. 1551.</p>
