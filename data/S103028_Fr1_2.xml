   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <head>To <hi>Theophilus</hi> the vnfeyned louer of Iesus Christ. <hi>Act.</hi> 1, 1. and To <hi>Lydia</hi> his wife, the painefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structer of her houshold. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.15.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE euill of <hi>ignorance,</hi> how great a sinne it is not rightlie to knowe God, the common course of all Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures in their order, duo partlie teach, that by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour we may in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge excell them, seeing by nature they excell vs. And for experience, if the soules and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of ignorant men were set open but one houre to the world, it would be a world and a warning for euer, to see their desolation, their feare, their sorrowe and resolute condemning of themselues to that place of perdition of bodie and soule prepared for the diuell and for them: not knowing which way to winde out, beeing brought in by <hi>Ariadnes</hi> thread, or rather by a corruptible seed, that although the light shineth in the darkenes of their hearts, yet they cannot comprehend it: because they eyther dispise or neglect the knowledge of their <hi>Creator,</hi> which
<pb facs="3"/> is not to be known to any, but by the knowledge of the holie Scriptures. <hi>What Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would not sigh, and sowne for hartie sorrowe to see their Children preparing themselues to hell: what Master so vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull that would not pittie to see their seruants hearts bleeding for sorrow?</hi> And what <hi>Pastor</hi> would not willinglie resigne all to redeeme one of his charge, although all the rest were saued? Beholde then how carefull ought <hi>Parents</hi> to bee in teaching their Children the instruction of the Lord? and how watchfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie <hi>Pastor</hi> to giue them their meate in due season. The Diuell hath receiued many into his Kingdome by ignorance of the Scriptures, and hee seeth it is the way to enlarge it: therefore he laboreth bodilie &amp; Ghostly, night and day, by craft and by crueltie, to holde men in that miserable thrall of darkenes, how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie the knowledge of holy Scriptures is for all people to comfort themselues, and to confirme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many places doo testifie. Leu. 19, 17. Deu. 3.12.13.2. Kings 23, 2, 3. Neh. 8, 2. Psal. 1, 1.2.3. Prou. 1, 1.2, &amp;c. 19, 2.29, 18. 1. Cor. 14, 20. Gal. 6, 1. 1. Thess. 5.14. 1. Tim. 2, 4. 2. Tim. 2, 24.25.26. Heb. 3.13. Iam. 5, 19.20. 1. Pet. 3, 15.16. Beware of false Prophets Math. 7, 15. Trie all things and keepe that which is good.
<pb facs="3"/> 1. Thess. 5, 21. But how can these things be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without the knowledge of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? How shall a seruant doo the will of his Master, when he knoweth it not? How shall a sonne rightlie obey his Father, wherein he is not taught? And how much lesse shall the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the seruant, the Father or the Sonne be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable to the Lord, and Father of all things, or by obedience please him when his will is not knowne by his word; who in deede is to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and obeyed according to the line and leuell thereof, and not according to mans fleshlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention or worldlie reason.</p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <label>Obiection.</label>
         <hi>Yet for all this many obiect and lay for themselues that the studie of Gods word dooth onelie appertaine to Diuines and men that are not busied with the affaires and cares of this world.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <p>Alas they are altogeather deceaued by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than who worketh in them that bee ill, alwaies to doubt their ill by preferring ignorance before knowledge: carnall things before spirituall, and earthlie before Heauenlie. But Parents must needes haue the knowledge of Scriptures to teach their Children. Gen. 18, 18.19. Exod. 12,
<pb facs="4"/> 26.27.13, 8.9 10. Deu. 4, 9.10. Psal. 78, 5. &amp;c. And it is also the duetie of euerie householder to instruct their families Gen. 18, 18.19. Act. 10, 2.16, 14.15. Romans. 15, 5. Colloss. 4.15. Phil. 2.</p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <label>Obiect.</label>
         <hi>Some doo holde themselues well excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as touching this account, by hard tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and paines taking in their vocation and calling.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>
         <label>Obiect.</label>
         <hi>Some by catechising in little Bookes, some by their worshipfull and honorable offices in the common weale, and some by frequenting Sermons earlie and late.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>
         <label>Obiect.</label>
         <hi>Some doo thinke themselues well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised, and their time well spent in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining &amp; searching other mens Bookes for faults and errours, thereby to get praise and profit: if they finde none, then they hew and strike fiercely at their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and conuersations, alwaies bearing armour defensiue to defend their owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; and armes offensiue to assaile the
<pb facs="4"/> good manners of others, whiles they should bee occupied in searching their owne errors and faults by the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>
         <label>Obiection.</label>
         <hi>Some doo spend the remainder of their liues in</hi> Enuie <hi>and</hi> Arrogancie <hi>enterprising impression against</hi> impression, <hi>Bookes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> Bookes, <hi>Sermon against</hi> Sermon.</p>
   </q>
   <p>And thus they bring some to neglect the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the sacred Bible: some to doubt of the trueth and dignitie thereof, and some to hate or to despise the professors of the same. If these <hi>Calummators</hi> and busie bodies were as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to put in practise their preaching, as they be to followe after a fault in their liuing, there should be no such neede of <hi>Prisons</hi> for Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, of <hi>Bridewells</hi> for Libellors, nor of <hi>Hatchets</hi> for traitors.</p>
   <q>
      <p>
         <label>Obiect.</label>
         <hi>Another sort there is (in their kinde worse then all these) who by their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doe disswade the vnlearned from that study and order of reading the Bible which is prescribed priuatlie and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquelie
<pb facs="5"/> by a man whose life is vnrebuke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, whose learning counteruaileth the best learned: whose good will to all men hath been published in his Preaching freelie, whose vndeserued and vnanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paynes hath beene set foorth by Printing, and whose godlie zeale and care doth plainelie appeare in those whom he hath taught in the knowledge of Gods most holie word, who are in deed as testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his truth &amp; infallible argumēts to proue the experience of his</hi> Method <hi>&amp; order of teaching, (which many ignorant men doo controule secretly) to be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall. And what should I say more, I doubt not of mildenesse of constancie, and of the vertue of Gods holy spirit in him, so as he may liue bouldlie euen at the faces of his aduersaries, still prospering in Gods busines, and verie well in his owne: In the meane time he is honored among them that bee honored, that fortune abateth without fault; and hee is ashamed among them that bee ashamed, that fortune en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunceth without merit; honorable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour resteth not in the dignitie that men haue, but in the good workes whereby they deserue.</hi>
      </p>
   </q>
   <pb facs="5"/>
   <p>Herein J commend not the best, the worst are not tollerable. There is no more comparison betwixt the <hi>Arke</hi> and the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> than is betweene <hi>Gods word &amp; worldly welth:</hi> the getting, the keeping and the spending of the one is sin, and the seeking of the other is not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: without the diligent reading of the old &amp; new Testament. <hi>Rethorick</hi> is good, I graunt you, to perswade: <hi>Astronomie</hi> is sit to know the course of the Starres. <hi>Geometrie</hi> is profitable to measure the Land. <hi>Musick</hi> is necessarie to recreate: <hi>Philosophie</hi> to take away the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of death. These and the rest, be they neuer so good, so fit, so profitable, and so necessarie: yet they are all but as dimme Starres, in respect of Diuinitie. The <hi>Phrigian</hi> Harmonie mooued to the Calendes, maketh a great noyse: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mooued to <hi>Apollo,</hi> is still calme and quiet. <hi>Hiarchion</hi> hearing <hi>Ruphinus</hi> blowe on his Pipe, would neuer after play on his flute, the <hi>Thrush</hi> although hauing manie good notes, will not sing in the companie of the <hi>Nightingall.</hi> Euen so, let all the world hold their peace, sit downe and heare Diuinitie. It is like the <hi>Piller of fire</hi> by night, and a <hi>cloudie piller</hi> by day: to conduct the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> through the wast wildernesse of this world, to that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and euerlasting kingdome of <hi>Canaan:</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/> from this miserable <hi>Mesapotamia,</hi> and out of the bondage of sinfull flesh, to a <hi>Gall</hi> anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the eies of the faithfull, that they may see and auoide that foule spirite <hi>Asmodeus.</hi> To a Starre, leading all wise men to the true worship of Iesus Christ: and it is a law to controle vs, a sheelde to defend vs, and a light to teach vs.</p>
   <p>Seing then it hath so manie good vses, how can we be without the knowledge thereof.</p>
   <p>Seing our iourney &amp; voyage is so dangerous, and we such vnskilfull trauailers: how shall we misse so good a guid?</p>
   <p>Seing wee are all ouerwhelmed with a cloud of darkenesse and ignorance: how can we want such a skilfull Schoolemaster?</p>
   <p>And seeing we haue all sorts of enemies hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering vs, &amp; we our selues so vnfurnished, how shall wee bee able to stand, not hauing on the whole armor of God? How shall we quench the fierie darts of the diuell? and what shall I say more? O that my mouth could cause my words to mount ouer all the world, for to make such a deepe impression in the hearts of all men; that neither things absent, present or to come in the losse of libertie, liuing, or life should make them to start one iot from the Christian delight, the holie and Heauenlie exercise of Gods word.</p>
   <p>Many, no doubt, would more willinglie giue
<pb facs="6"/> themselues to this godlie labor, seemed not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>ble so great and tedious.</p>
   <p>And manie might soone bee brought to the knowledge thereof, if their Minister had either will or abilitie to deuide vnto them the word of God aright.</p>
   <p>For the discharge of mine owne conscience and dutie, in some respect, hauing no oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or occasion otherwise offered mee to benefite my brethren: J will deliuer in this booke a short method, and easie rule, and a plaine passage throughout the Bible to great vse and profite.</p>
   <p>At the first veiw and sight iudge not rashlie, let christian modesty and the bands of loue hold you, vntill some time passe for proofe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite.</p>
   <p>And if in anie thing you mislke it, I humbly praie you mend it: I seeke not mine owne praise or profite, but in plaine and simple sort, to teach Christ Jesus: in whose name J begin and make an end.</p>
