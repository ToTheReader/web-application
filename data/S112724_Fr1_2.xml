And calling to ininde one of the graue sentences of Seneca, which sayeth, That the remembrance of benefites ought not to be forgotten, and that a smal thing geuen willingly, is more acceptable then great riches with euell will: And that the will of the geuer, and not the value of the gift, is to be regarded: rhese documentes and such like, vrged me to deuise some thing, whereby you might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in me, not only my obedience to fatherly parentage, but also to proue such a sonne (good will being first preferred) to be more worthy a benefite,<note place="margin">
