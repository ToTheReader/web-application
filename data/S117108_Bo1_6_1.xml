      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LTHOVGH (GENTLE
Reader) thou mayst perhaps thinke
mee arrogant, for that I onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
so many fine wittes and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
youth (with which Englād
this day florisheth) haue enterprised
to set forth in english this present
piece of the flowre of all writers,
Seneca, as who say, not fearing what grauer heads might
iudge of me, in attempting so hard a thing, yet vpon well
pondering what next ensueth, I trust both thy selfe shalt
cleare thine owne suspicion, and thy chaunged opinion shal
iudge of me more rightfull sentence. For neither haue I
taken this worke first in hand, as once entending it should
come to light (of well doynge wherof I vtterly dispayred)
and beynge done but for myne owne priuate exercise, I
am in myne opinion herein blameles, thoughe I haue
(to proue my selfe) priuately taken the part which pleased
me best of so excellent an author, for better is tyme spent
in the best then other, and at first to attempt the hardest
writers, shall make a mā more prompt to translate the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
with more facility. But now since by request, &amp; frēd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of those, to whom I could denye nothinge, this worke
agaynst my will extorted is out of my hands, I needes must
<pb facs="102"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>raue thy pacience in reading, and facility of iudgement:
when thou shalt apparantly se my witles lacke of learning,
prayng thee to consider how hard a thing it is for mee to
touch at ful in all poynts the authors mynd, (beyng in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places verye harde and doubtfull, and the worke much
corrupt by the default of euil printed Bookes) and also how
farre aboue my power to keepe that Grace and maiestye of
stile, that Seneca doth, when both so excellent a writer
hath past the reach of all imitation, and also this our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
toung (as many thinke, and I here fynd) is farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to compare with the Latten: but thou (good Reader)
if I in any place haue swerued from the true sence, or not
kept the roialty of speach, meete for a Tragedie, impute the
one to my youth and lacke of iudgement: the other to my
lacke of Eloquence. Now as concerninge sondrye places
augmented and some altered in this my translation. First
for asmuch as this worke seemed vnto mee in some places
vnperfite, whether left so of the Author, or parte of it
loste, as tyme deuoureth all thinges, I wot not, I haue
(where I thought good) with addition of myne owne
Penne supplied the wante of some thynges, as the firste
Chorus, after the first acte begynninge thus. O ye to whom
&amp;c. Also in the seconde Acte I haue added the speache
of Achilles Spright, rysyng from Hell to require the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifyce
of Polyxena begynning in this wyse. Forsakinge
now. &amp;c. Agayne the three laste staues of the Chorus
after the same Acte: and as for the thyrde Chorus
which in Seneca beginneth thus, QVE VOCAT SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DES?
For asmuch as nothing is therein but a heaped
number of farre and straunge Countries, considerynge
with my selfe, that the names of so manye vnknowen
<pb n="96" facs="102"/>
Countreyes, Mountaynes, Desertes, and VVoodes,
shoulde haue no grace in the Englishe tounge, but bee a
straunge and vnpleasant thinge to the Readers (excepte
I should expound the Historyes of each one, which would
be farre to tedious,) I haue in the place therof made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beginninge, in this manner. O Ioue that leadst. &amp;c.
VVhich alteration may be borne withall, seynge that Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
is no part of the substaunce of the matter. In the rest
I haue for my slender learninge endeuored to keepe touch
with the Latten, not worde for woorde or verse for verse,
as to expounde it, but neglectynge the placinge of the
wordes, obserued their sence. Take Gentle Reader this
in good woorth with all his faultes, fauour my first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninges,
and amende rather with good will such things
as herein are amisse, then to depraue or discommende my
labour and paynes, for the faultes, seyng that I haue
herein, but onelye made waye to other that
canne farre better doe this or like, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
them that as they can, so
they would. Farewel gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Reader and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
my good
will.</p>
