   <head>TO THE <hi>WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIPFVL M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. THOMAS EVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard of Heather, in the Countie of Leycester, <abbr>Esq</abbr>
      </hi> all increase of such Blessings as make this <hi>life happie and comfortable, and of such</hi> Graces, as may make the next Blessed and Glorious.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>YR,</hi> purposing to impose some taske on my wandring thoughts so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse their somewhat vncomfortable strayings, my rasher election sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly singled out this subiect, which though suting too neerely with my braine in barrennes, the product is this Pamphlet, which perused by some friends of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was pronounced worthy the Presse. Wherevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I the rather referr'd it, that dedicating the same vnto you, I might (at least) manifest my remembrance of that loue, kindnesse, and courtesie, which (while my resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was in loued <hi>Leycester-shire,</hi>) made mee so much affect that Familiaritie, which you then pleased to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord me, in regard wherof my loue leades me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent this to your patronage, and your affection to Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, makes mee presume of your acceptance: the grace you giue a Verse in reading it, makes it pleasing, if it be
<pb facs="3"/>but passable, therefore I doubt not your liking. And if this (which is not vnlike) gaine your approbation, I shall not passe for the Censures of such as are more apt to finde fault, then able to finde a faulte. Had I but the name of a Poet, and opinion on my side, I should relye therevpon as <hi>Caesar</hi> on his Fortune, yet doth not my obscuritie discourage mee, but rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for Fame is rather to be ventred for then ventred.</p>
   <p>An instigation to the writing hereof, was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation which I heard a Iudicious diuine giue of a yong Student in diuinity, for his dexteritie in English Poesie, who affirming it to be an ornament to any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, I was thereby induced to reduce that affection I bore it, to practise. And in publishing the same I haue imitated <hi>Apelles,</hi> who hauing drawne a picture plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to himselfe, hang'd it in open viewe, that he might heare the verdite of others. Nor is it vnlike but I also shall haue a shoo-maker Censuring the Legge, when his skill extends but to the latcher. So (referring it to your fauourable suruey, and kinde acceptance) I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly desire Almightie God to Crowne you, and your adopted-selfe, with his best blessings in this life, and with Immortall glory in the next.</p>
