Father in God, my L. of Cantur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Offer here vnto your
Grace a kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
which if it be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
by the greatnes,
is but small; if by the
goodnesse either of it
selfe, or of my duetifull affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
your Grace, is surely great. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Sermons are they of that reuerēd
learned Father of so worthy memorie
<hi>B. Iuel;</hi> which hauing receiued of a
friend, and reserued by me some good
time in writtē hand (howbeit faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
written, as I trust shal after appear) I
could no longer, no longer, I say, could
I be either so iniurious, or so enuious to
the publike good, as not to publish thē
to the glorie of God, and benefit of his
Church. And if the renowned Orator
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Tully</hi> could not indure to haue the
least &amp; meanest of his painfull trauells
perish or be lost, were it but some fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Epistle or letter, as is apparēt by that
he wrote to his friend <hi>Varro</hi> in the like
case: <hi>Etsi</hi>

      <hi>erat illa epistola,</hi> Albeit the
letter which <hi>Caninius</hi> caused mee to
write (but as I take it, had forgotten to
cal for) were stale and out of season, yet haue I sithēce deliuered it vnto him for thee: <hi>Quia nolui perire lucubrationē meā,</hi>
saith he. Norblame him pardy, for why
should so sweet a veine of wit and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
flow out in vaine? Then what
reason were it that these so many, so
learned, so godly, so eloquent Sermons
of this reuerēd Father &amp; great Diuine;
especially treating, not as <hi>Tully</hi> doth, of
matters earthly, but heauenly, not of
things temporal, but eternal, not of the
Commonwealth of the Romans, but
the sauing health of al christians: I say,
what pity were it that these his so sūdry
&amp; worthy labors, should either be smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb facs="3"/>

in obliuion, or <gap reason="foreign">

any one, &amp; not rather imparted, diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
&amp; made common vnto many one,
for the generall behoofe of the present
age, &amp; so of future posteritie? They are
in Philosophie (as your Grace well
knoweth) rules both antient &amp; authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike:
<hi>Bonum quo communius, quo diutur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
eo melius,</hi> Good things the more
they stretch themselues to the benefit
of many, &amp; the more durable they are,
the better they are. For as <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
saith, and saith verie well, <hi>Nostrae vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
&amp;c.</hi> Our words once vttered, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
&amp; vanish into ayre: but let them
be put in writing, <hi>or print,</hi> and for the
most part they remaine vnto all succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ages. Wherfore not long to hold
your Grace (being holden sufficiently
with your publike trauels for the good
both of Church and Commonweale;
for which to Almighty God, to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="4"/>
Maiestie, &amp; to your Grace we
are, and I trust, shalbe stil more &amp; more
beholden) It may please your Gr. to

next after God the meane liuelihood I

and ought to pray, and will not cease to
pray; that like as the Almightie hath in
