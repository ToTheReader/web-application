   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> You Lyons of the Wood! (you young Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers)
that are kept warme vnder the wings
of Princes and Kings of Christendome, well
may I call you the Lyons of the Wood: for
this yeare of 1609. shall you range vp and
downe the woods, Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ks, and Chases, which
were left vnto you by your ancestors, full of tall trees: that
stood like so many a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>medmen to defend your noble houses
from falling, and your Country from the cold stormes of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
But now I say and prophecie it (with a Rauen-like voice)
that like Lyons robd of their y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ung, shall you goe vp and
downe madding and raging to see your ancient honors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
and the memorie of your forefathers buried as it we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ly
Oakes, whose glories they▪ raysed to a full height, but now
haue their heads hid beneath the earth. The propertie of a
Lyon is to feare a Cocke; So likewise shall you this yeare (if
not be afraid) yet be loa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

Chamber dores for mony. And like a Bell-man (with
papers in their hands) watch to strike you downe with
heauy and vnconscionable Items. Gather your selues
therefore together in heards, and like Lyons indeed fright
them with your suttle lookes, or else like Elephants car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
whole Castles on your backes, and furnish those Castles
with good store of golde and siluer, so will they be affraide
to assault you: let not your strength or courage lye alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

makes as it were a Stage-play of the yeare, deuiding it
into fourepartes, or rather plaies the executioner with it, by
cutting it into quarters, To each one of you doe I therefore
send a quarter: climbe vp then and behold what nest my Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
hath builded (this yeare 1609.) But carrie the mindes
and manhood of true Patrons, neither suffer any critickes to

your selues. And thus because much fowle weather is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
(if any Calender tell no lyes) and that I am loath to
