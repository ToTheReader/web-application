      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Greatlie reioyce to see so manie of our English
Gentlemen, both of the Court and Countrie in
these dayes so earnestlie giuen to trauell aswell
by sea as land, into straunge and vnknowne
countries, and speciallie into the East and West
Indies, following therein the good example of
diuers worthy knightes and Gentlemen that
haue ventured their liues to discouer strange countries to the great
honour of their countrie, and to their owne immortall fame. And
because that to trauell by sea requireth skil in the Art of Nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in which it is vnpossible for any man to be perfect vnles he
first haue his Arithmetick, and also some knowledge in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Cosmographie, and specially to haue the vse of the Spheare,
of the two Globes, of the Astrolabe, and crosse staffe, and such like
instruments belonging to the Arte of Navigation, I thought
good therefore to write the Treatises before mentioned, to serue as
an introduction for such yoong Gentlemen as haue not bene exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in such kind of studies, which Treatises if they shall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to read with attentiue minde, and in such order as they are
before set downe, I doubt not but that it will cause them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to seeke for further knowledge therein. And in any wise I
wish them to begin with my Arithmeticke, the contents whereof
are declared in the next chapter following. In the meane time I
do earnestly request all yoong Gentlemen to take these my simple
pamphlets no lesse thankfullie than they haue done my horse booke,
and in so doing I shall haue iust cause to thinke my labour well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed.</p>
