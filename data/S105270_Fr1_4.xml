   <head>The Induction to the Booke.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Finde it written in that Booke where no vntruthes can be read: in that Booke whose leaues shall out-last sheetes of brasse, and whose lynes leade to eternity: yea euen in that Booke that was pend by the best Author of the best wisedome, allowed by a Deity, licensed by the Omnipotent, and published (in all Languages to all Nations) by the greatest, truest, and onely Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, thus I find it written, that for Sinne, Angels were throwne out of heauen; for Sinne, the first man that euer was made, was made an outcast: he was driuen ouf of his liuing that was left vnto him by his Creator: It was a goodlier liuing, than the Inheritance of Princes: he lost Paradice by it (he lost his house of pleasure:) hee lost <hi>Eden</hi> by it, a Garden, where Winter could neuer haue nipt him with cold, nor Summer haue scorcht him with heate. He had there all fruits growing to delight his taste, all flowers flourishing to allure his eye, all Birds singing to content his eare; he had more
<pb facs="4"/>
than he could desire: yet because he desired more than was fit for him, he lost all. For Sinne, all those buildings which that great Worke-master of the world had in sixe dayes raysed, were swallowed at the first by waters, and shall at last be consumed in fire. How many families hath this <hi>Leuiathan</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured? how many Cities? how many Kingdoms? Let vs a while leaue Kingdomes, and enter into Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were burnt to the ground with brinstone that dropt in flakes from heauen: a hot and dreadfull vengeance. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> hath not a stone left vpon another of her first glorious foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: a heauy and fearefull downefall. <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that was Gods owne dwelling house; the Schoole where those Hebrew Lectures, which he himselfe read, were taught; the very Nursery where the Prince of Heauen was brought vp; that <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whose Rulers were Princes, &amp; whose Citizens were like the sonnes of Kings: whose Temples were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with gold, and whose houses stood like rowes of tall Cedars; that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is now a dezert; It is vnhallowed, and vnt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> odden: no Monument is left to shew it was a Citty, but only the memoriall of the Iewes hard-hartednes, in making away their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: It is now a place for barbarous Turks, and poore despised Grecians; it is rather now (for the abominations committed in it) no place at all.</p>
   <p>Let vs hoyst vp more Sayles, and lanch into other Seas, till wee come in ken of our owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. <hi>Antwerp</hi> (the eldest daughter of <hi>Brabant</hi>) hath falne in her pride, the Citties of rich <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> in theyr greatnes. Those seuenteene Dutch Virgins of <hi>Belgia,</hi> (that had Kingdomes to theyr
<pb facs="4"/>
dowries, and were worthy to be courted by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) are now no more Virgins: the Souldier hath deflowred them, and robd them of theyr Mayden honor: Warre hath still vse of their noble bodyes, and discouereth theyr nakednes like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Strumpets. Famine hath dryed vp the fresh bloud in theyr cheekes, whilst the Pestilence digd vp theyr Fields, and turned them into Graues. Neither haue these punishments bin layd vpon them onely; for bloud hath bin also drawne of their very next neighbours. <hi>France</hi> lyes yet panting vnder the blowes which her owne Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue giuen her. Thirty yeeres together suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred she her bowels to be torne out by those that were bred within them: She was full of Princes, and saw them all lye mangled at her feete: She was full of people, and saw in one night a hundred thousand massacred in her streetes: her Kings were eaten vp by Ciuill warres, and her Subiects by fire and famine. O gallant Monarchy, what hard fate hadst thou, that when none were left to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer thee, thou shouldst triumph ouer thy selfe! Thou hast Wynes flowing in thy veynes: but thou madest thy selfe druncke with thine owne bloud. The English, the Dutch, and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, stoode aloofe and gaue ayme, whilst thou shotst arrowes vpright, that fell vpon thine owne head, and wounded thee to death. Wouldst thou (and the rest) know the reason, why your bones haue bin bruzed with rods of Iron? It was, because you haue risen in Arch-rebellion against the Supremest Soueraigne: You haue bin Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to your Lord, the King of heauen and earth, and haue armed your selues to fight against the
<pb facs="5"/>
Holy Land. Can the father of the world measure out his loue so vnequally, that one people (like to a mans yongest child) should be more made of than all the rest, being more vnruly than the rest? O <hi>London,</hi> thou art great in glory, and enuied for thy greatnes: thy Towers, thy Temples, and thy Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles stand vpon thy head like borders of fine gold, thy waters like frindges of siluer hang at the hemmes of thy garments. Thou art the goodliest of thy neighbors, but the prowdest; the welthiest, but the most wanton. Thou hast all things in thee to make thee fairest, and all things in thee to make thee foulest: for thou art attir'de like a Bride, dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing all that looke vpon thee, to be in loue with thee, but there is much harlot in thine eyes. Thou sitst in thy Gates heated with Wines, and in thy Chambers with lust. What miseries haue of late ouertaken thee? yet (like a foole that laughs when hee is putting on fetters) thou hast bin merry in height of thy misfortunes.<note place="margin">

She that wore thee alwayes on her brest as the richest Iewell in her kingdome, who had continually her eye vpon thee, and her heart with thee: whose chaste hand clothed thy Rulers in Scarlet, and thy Inhabitants in roabes of peace: euen she was taken from thee, when thou wert most in feare to lose her: when thou didst tremble (as at an earth-quake) to thinke that bloud should runne in thy Channels, that the Canon should make away through thy Portcullises, and fire rifle thy wealthy houses, then, euen then wert thou

left full of teares,<note place="margin">

      </note> and becamst an Orphan. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thou hadst not sat many howres on the banks of sorrow, but thou hadst a louing Father that adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee to be his owne: thy mourning turnd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to gladnes, thy terrors into triumphs. Yet, lest this fulnesse of ioy should beget in thee a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes, and to try how wisely thou couldst take vp affliction, Sicknes was sent to breathe her vnhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some ayres into thy nosthrils, so that thou, that wert before the only Gallant and Minion of the world, hadst in a short time more diseases (then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Harlot hath) hanging vpon thee; thou sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly becamst the by-talke of neighbors, the scorne and contempt of Nations.</p>
   <p>Heere could I make thee weepe thy selfe away into waters, by calling back those sad and dismall houres, wherein thou consumedst almost to nothing with shrikes and lamentations, in that <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>A Booke so called, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Author, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing the horror of the Plague in</hi> 1602, <hi>when there dyed</hi> 30578. <hi>of that disease.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>Wonderfull yeere,</hi> when these miserable calamities entred in at thy Gates, slaying 30000. and more as thou heldst them in thine armes, but they are fresh in thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and the story of them (but halfe read ouer) would strike so coldly to thy heart, and lay such heauy sorrow vpon mine (<hi>Namque animus meminisse horret, luctuque refugit</hi>) that I will not be thine and my owne tormentor with the memory of them. How quickly notwithstanding didst thou forget that beating? The wrath of him that smot thee, was no sooner (in meere pitty of thy stripes) appeased, but howrely (againe) thou wert in the company of euill doers, euen before thou couldst finde leysure to aske him forgiuenes.</p>
   <p>Euer since that time hath hee winckt at thy er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and suffred thee (though now thou art growne
<pb facs="6"/>
old, and lookest very ancient) to goe on still in the follyes of thy youth: he hath ten-fold restor'de thy lost sonnes and daughters, and such sweete, liuely, fresh colours hath hee put vpon thy cheekes, that Kings haue come to behold thee,<note place="margin">
         <hi>King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Christierne King of Denmarke.</hi>
      </note> and Princes to delight their eyes with thy bewty. None of all these fauours (for all this) can draw thee from thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes: Graces haue powrd downe out of heauen vpon thee, and thou art rich in all things, sauing in goodnes: So that now once againe hath he gone about (and but gone about) to call thee to the dreadfull Barre of his Iudgement. And no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: for whereas other Citties (as glorious as thy selfe,) and other people (as deare vnto him as thine) haue in his indignation bin quite taken from the face of the earth, for some one peculiar Sinne, what hope hast thou to grow vp still in the pride of thy strength, gallantnes and health, hauing seuen deadly and detestable sinnes lying night by night by thy lasciuious sides? O thou beawtifullest daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of two vnited Monarchies! from thy womb re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued I my being, frō thy brests my nourishment; yet giue me leaue to tell thee, that thou hast seuen Diuels within thee, and till they be cleane cast out, the Arrowes of Pestilence will fall vpon thee by day, and the hand of the Inuader strike thee by night. The Sunne will shine, but not be a comfort to thee, and the Moone looke pale with anger, whē she giues thee light. Thy Louers will disdayne to court thee: thy Temples will no more send out Diuine oracles: Iustice will take her flight, and dwell else-where; and that Desolation, which now for three yeeres together hath houered round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee, will at last enter, and turne thy Gardens
<pb facs="6"/>
of pleasure, into Church-yards; thy Fields that seru'd thee for walks, into <hi>Golgotha</hi>; and thy hye built houses, into heapes of dead mens Sculs. I call him to witnes, who is all Truth, I call the Cittizens of heauen to witnes, who are all spotlesse, that I slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee not, in saying thou nourishest seuen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents at thy brests, that will destroy thee: let all thy Magistrates and thy officers speake for me: let Strangers that haue but seene thy behauiour, be my Iudges: let all that are gathered vnder thy wings, and those that sleepe in thy bosome, giue their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict vpon me; yea, try me (as thy brabblings are) by all thy Petit and Graund Iurors, and if I belye thee, let my Country (when I expire) deny me her common blessing, Buriall, Lift vp therefore thy head (thou Mother of so many people:) awaken out of thy dead and dangerous slumbers, and with a full and fearelesse eye behold those seuen Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, that with extended iawes gape to swallow vp thy memory: for I will into so large a field single euery one of them, that thou and all the world shall see their vglinesse, for by seeing them, thou mayst auoyd them, and by auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, be the happiest and most renowned of Citties.</p>
