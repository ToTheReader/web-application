         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLEMEN,</hi> I haue enterprised to commit these ensuing Lines, my deceased Brothers Orphanes, vnto the Presse, at mine owne proper Charges, not to make them common; for I hold them better worth than to bee exposed to the vulgar View of euery <hi>Ignoramus</hi> or <hi>Non-intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git:</hi> The world already beeing full fraught and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with stuffe fit for their vnderstanding. What these are, I need not tell you that knew the Author; And for your sakes principally haue I made this Impression, of no more Copies than I thinke to distribute vnto yee, his (and some of mine owne) endeered &amp; worthy Friends. I hope you will vouchsafe them benigne Acceptance, and me condigne thankes: by which, I shall bee encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to publish other his larger Labours which I haue lying by mee. And so I wish you all an heartie <hi>Vale,</hi> and of you take my leaue.</p>
