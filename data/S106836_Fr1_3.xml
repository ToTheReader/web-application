   <head>THE TRANSLATOR to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, It is an vsuall custome for men in my case to write some Appologie or Preface vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Reader, either in commendation of the subiect he treats of, or for his owne justification and defence: I should be loath to be held lesse respectfull than other men, in omitting any necessarie comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that might giue you content. Touching the subiect of this Booke, I will speake little, myne Author hath giuen you full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in his Preface, the which I haue set downe at large; his Title shewes the profit you may reape by him, and euery dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and well aduised trauellor knows, That the true vse of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell into forraine countries, is to know that which he teacheth; wherein he hath shewed much diligence, and great reading, as I found by my owne trauell, confronting him with diuers good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that haue written of the same subiect: but I will leaue him to your iudicious censures, and to the mercie of the Booke-seller, who, it may be, will commend him in the sale, if he be not interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in some other booke of the like nature. My chiefest care is, to giue you an account of my labours: I may not aduow it to be a meere translation, for that I haue not tied my selfe strictly vnto the lawes, but haue added vnto it in diuers places, wheras by my owne search and studie, I haue found somethings (happily not seene by him) which might beautifie the worke, and giue content vnto the Reader. I haue also in other places omitted some things,<pb facs="4"/> wherein my Author had beene abused by the relations of others, and in some sort taxed the honour of some Nations, the which in mine owne knowledge were mistaken: it had beene no discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me, nor any good plea to haue said, I followed mine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as one did lately in the translation of Nassaus victories, where he hath fasly depraued an honest and worthie action at the seige of Berghen, the which was held by all the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders that were then present, to be honest and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I haue also, treating of the Religion of euery State, bin for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to varie something from his phrase, but not from the truth of the subiect. There remaines nothing but your kind acceptance of those my endeauous: giue them leaue to passe with the rest of my labours; and if you find it not written in elegant termes, consider that it is no Historicall discourse, but a Description of countries, and that mine Author studied more for matter than words. Such as it is, I bequeath vnto you as my last Legacie, if it shall giue you content, I shall thinke my paines well bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but if you find it defectiue in any thing that concernes me, let my desire to do well make satisfaction for that which is amisse. And so I rest.</p>
