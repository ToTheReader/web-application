   <head>THE EPISTLE DEDICATORIE TO THE
right excellent and renowmed Lorde, Don Phillip Prince of
Spaine, and of both Siciles, &amp;c. Set foorth by Maister Peter de Medina,
the Authour of the Arte of Nauigation.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE subiectes are accustomed to serue their Lorde right excellent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed
Prince and Lord, with that which seemeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> them to be most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to their will, and so some there bee that serue with thinges that
are delightfull to the eye, and others to the taste. Others there are whiche
doe imploye their persons in labours, and also others in diuers other matters:
And seeing I am desirous to bee of the number of those, I sought by what
meanes I might put it in effect, and for that my abilitie is not sufficient to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
greater seruice: I determined to make a booke of the Arte of Nauigation,
and to offer it in the seruice of your highnesse. Two thinges haue mooued
mee to this most mightie Lorde. The first is, to see howe great seruice your
highnesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> receiue by the Nauigation, at also howe great profite commeth thereby to all the common
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>alth of Christendome. And this beeing so, it appeareth that by the Nauigation, your Royall Seno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
is amplified and extented into so great parte of the worlde. And that whiche is newlye discouered is
more then fiue thousande leagues of the Sea coaste, where doeth containe so many regions, kingdomes, and
prouinces, where are founde so many nations and diuersitie of people, and many other thinges in suche sorte
by good reason it is called the newe worlde. So that by meanes of the Nauigation, there hath been brought
and is brought into your highnesse Countrye of Spaine, so many shippes laden with Golde and Siluer, that
the same thereof cannot bee accounted. As also such great quantitie of sweete Drugges, and other things
of great value and price: And this is litle in respect, right excellent Lorde, of the great number of people
whiche doe saile, not only to places knowne, but also to suche as are farre of, and vnknowne, and of such
at is no knowledge of, they procure by sailing to seeke and knowe, And seeing how long and dangerous wayes
they make by Sea, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>we of them that saile doe knowe what doeth appertaine to the Arte of Nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on▪
The cause is, there are no instructors thereof, nor bookes whereby they may attaine to it, so that your
highnesse may vnderstande, although the Nauigation bee of such antiquitie, and more then three thousande
yeares <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> it began, and a thing of such importance, that the life of man goeth therevpon. And who
can manifest the number of shippes and people, which only doe saile out of Spaine to all partes of the world,
or who can recken the multitude of people which doe consist only vpon the Nauigation, with their goodes,
riches, trades, merchandize, and other thinges: And for all this, there are no maisters whiche doe teache
this Arte, nor knowledge of an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> that vnto this daye haue written the manner of sailing: Euen so, the
most sorte of Pilottes haue the vse of Nauigation, no otherwise but euerie one following his owne opinion
and iudgement, where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>f it happeneth many times in one shippe two or three Pilottes, the one saith accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his reckoning, the shippe goeth sailing vpon the lande, the other sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eth, according to his reckoning,
the lande is farre of from him, and the cause thereof is, that there wanteth true knowledge of Nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and hereby it happeneth many times both shippes and people are loste, and others sustaine great dangers
and losses. All whiche beeing by mee considered, and chiefly seeing the Maiestie of the Emperour, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnto your highnesse, and our Lorde many tymes putteth his imperiall person vnto the danger of the
Sea. Wherefore I beeing desirous to serue your highnesse in this, and to doe good to suche as are Sailers,
by giuing them rules and aduises howe they may make their Nauigation certaine without hazarde of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
I haue framed and deuised an Arte of Nauigation so orderly, that the Pilottes and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whiche doe saile, shall finde them selues so able therewith, that of it selfe, or with verie litle helpe,
they shall knowe and verie plainly vnderstande that whiche they treate of, seeing it is so necessarie, and so
much standeth them vpon to knowe, as a thing whiche doeth importe to many their honours, liues, and
<pb facs="3"/>
goods: Truth it is, most mightie Lorde, that weying my strength with the waight of my iudgemēt, and
finding my selfe of small sufficiencie, I greatly disputed with my selfe, if for my small knowledge I should
holde my peace, seeing that I knewe it to bee ouermuche boldnesse to make a woorke and to directe it to
your highnesse, but animating my selfe, and trusting in your accustomed clemencie and magnanimitie, I
put my selfe vnder the shadowe of your fauour, and so most humbly beseeching you to receiue this my litle
seruice with that Royall curtesie that vnto others you are accustomed to doe. And beeing perused by
your highnesse, it maye winne so muche fauour whereby it maye passe safely through all
places, yelding great benefite and seruice vnto your highnesse, as also profite to
suche as vse the Nauigation, that thereby they may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
the perfect knowledge thereof.</p>
