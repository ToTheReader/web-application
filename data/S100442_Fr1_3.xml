   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orsomuch, the truth of historie, is
the foundation of faith, and of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
vnderstanding, (Christian
Reader,) and the history of things
donne, blinde and imperfect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the knowledge of places, the
which knowledge giueth muche
light, both to the truth of history, and also to the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
interpretation thereof: therefore I haue thought good
to obserue two things with great diligence in this worke.
First that I might portray and set forth the true and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Image of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> of all other citties the most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
and famous throughout the whole world, whereof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made in sacred and in prophane histories, as it flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in Christ his time; and also the forme of the temple,
(the fame whereof hath beene extolled aboue the heauens,
and was worthy of eternall memory) by the sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
by approued writers, and by auncient tradition of
faithfull and trusty men, in a liuely plot, or map, most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitly
drawn, together with the names, originalls, situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
and formes of euery place, and the most worthy hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
concerning the same, with all breuity. Secondly,
that I might rightly dispose the places of Christ his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and represent euery thing which he suffered in euery
place, euen as if they were now donne before our eies: and
so represented that I might, explaine it with plainenesse
and breuity. For hereby, all those thinges which he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for our sakes, wilbe both more plainely vnderstood,
and also more profitably remembred. But per aduenture
there wilbe some which will mislike this our endeuour,
and the rather bicause we haue many thinges by tradition
of elders: to whom I answere out of Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> where
<pb facs="5"/>
he saith, <hi>That ecclesiasticall traditions, which are no
hinderance to faith, are so to be kept, as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
by the auncients.</hi> In the meane time I will not
say, that they are too rash &amp; too too wicked, which wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that thing,<note place="margin">Hier. to. 1.</note> which hath beene godly receiued at al times
and of all men.<note place="margin">Epist. 28. ad Lucinium.</note> So many of vs therefore as washed with
the bloud of Christ, do beare his name and are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
if our faith be aunswering to our name, and our life
not disagreeing from the truth, hoping to be saued by the
merits &amp; grace of Christ our sauiour, let vs beleeue that,
which incorrupt and reuerend antiquity hath left, let vs
in no wise depart from those thinges which our auncestors
haue celebrated without superstition, and which by the
consent of the whole worlde, are come euen from them to
our hands, and with thankful godlines, and godly thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
let vs call to minde those places oftentimes, which
may put vs in rememberance of the passion of Christe: to
which places this mappe will leade vs, as it were by the
hande: and with the eies of faith and of our minde let vs
looke vpon the same sonne of God, and inwardly behoulde
him, who being vrged with the great loue of our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hauing finished his laste supper in the parlour of Sion
and being come into the Garden of Oliuet, prayed and
swet bloud, through the anguish and greuous considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Imminent afflictions. Immediately hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by the most wicked Iudas; he was taken, bounde,
and thrust forward by the Iewes, euen as a lambe by the
woolues, most cruelly amidst the noise of clamors and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and then was ledde to the house of <hi>Anna</hi> the high
priest: There hee was stricken: From thence hee was
drawne to the pallace of <hi>Caiphas:</hi> in the same, hee was
falsely accused, condemned, spyt vpon, blindfolded, buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with fistes, and sundry waies all the night scorned and
afflicted. In the morning he was violently caried through
the midst of the cittie to the house of <hi>Pilate.</hi> From thence
<pb facs="5"/>
he was led to the pallace of <hi>Herod</hi> and accufed againe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
of him, mocked, &amp; apparrelled like a foole in a white
garment, &amp; brought back again by another way of the city
to <hi>Pilate.</hi> There again he was accused of many faultes, strip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped,
and greuously whipped, cloathed with purple, crowned
with thornes, dyuersly derided, spitted vppon, buffetted
with fistes and stricken with a reede▪ and being thus mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used,
was made a gazeing stocke to the people and adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to death. Then he was loden with a heauie crosse, and
in the sight of all the people, with greeuous and bloudy steps
hee was drawen, punched: and vrged by the furiouse vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of the soldiers, through a great parte of the cittie,
and by the gate of Iudgement out of the cittie, by a harde
and stoany way, euen vnto mount, <hi>Caluarie.</hi> And being
come thither he was stripped againe, and being both faint
and weary, was refreshed with gaule in stede of drink: and
about high noone he was fastened to the crosse, &amp; so lifted
vpon high. And hanging on the crosse by the space of three
howers, was derided with taunts &amp; reproachfull woordes:
being thirstie, they gaue him vineger to drinke. Finally
he which could saue the world with one drop of his bloude
would needes bestowe vppon vs by the fiue Riuers of his
woundes, his life, with all his bloude. A figure hereof
was that brasen serpent,<note place="margin">Cant. 3.</note> which moses caused to be exalted
in the wildernes. To this spectacle also our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
calleth euery faithfull soule, <hi>Come forth</hi> (saith he)
<hi>ye daughters of Sion, and see king Salomon,</hi> Naye one
farre greater then <hi>Salomon.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lament. of Ieremy 3.</note> In like manner Christ han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
on the crosse crieth out <hi>O all ye which passe by the
way, behould and see, if there be any sorrow &amp; greefe
like myne.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And not onely to the consideration and meditation of
these things, but also to the Imitation, God in the holy
Scripture exhorteth vs in these woordes (spiritually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted)
saying, <hi>Looke, &amp; make all thinges according
<pb facs="6"/>
to the example or fashion which was shewed thee in
the mount.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Exod. 25.</note> For all the precepts of life, which our sauiour
taught all the time of his preaching,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.</note> as well by word as by
example, the same he expressed in himselfe in one day of
his passion: Wherefore if we would follow Christ, not onely
in woorde but also in woorke, we may, by his liuely crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Image on mount Caluarie, as it were out of a goulden
booke intituled with the noble title of three most principal
languages, written with the quils of the speare, of the nails
of the thornes, and of the whippes, in the most pure parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Immaculat lambe, and with the purple bloude
of the same, both learned and vnlearned, learne easely &amp;
breifly, perfect theologie, the most wholesome remedies of
Phisicke, the full knowledge of Lawe and of Iustice, the
science of liberall artes, of true humilitie, of obedience, of
pietie, of charitie, of patience, finally of all manner of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and of thinges most perfect: and may also bee inflamed
and drawen to loue and to follow Christ. Thus the blessed
virgin, standing nere to the crosse of Christ, did not onely
with bodely eies, but also in hart, through faith (which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
not in her) behould the woundes of her sonne and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
thinking thereon, was so comforted, that now, as
<hi>Ambrose</hi> saith she was prepared also to die for the good
of mankind.<note place="margin">Ambrose in Luc. ca. 23.</note> So saint Ihon both seing the side of Christ o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
with a speare,<note place="margin">Iohn. 19.</note> bloude with water comming foorth of
the same, and also giuing testimonie thereunto, did by the
meditation thereof so greatly profite, that at the last he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a most perfect diuine, and a soaring Eagle to behoulde
the most holy Trinitie.<note place="margin">Luk. 23, Hier. to. 1.</note> So the Theefe, when he sawe and
hearde Christ Iesus crucified,<note place="margin">Epist. 13. ad Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> in continently tourned vnto
Christ, and confessing him, he made the punishment of mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
martiredome, and chaunged the crosse for Paradice.
So also the <hi>Centurion</hi> by this spectacle,<note place="margin">Mar. 15.</note> receaued so great
strength of faith, that vnder the crosse he was made a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb facs="6"/>
confessor of Christ, and further (as <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
saith) was afterwarde crowned with <hi>Martyredome.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Chrisost. in Mat. ca. 27.</note>
Moreouer <hi>Thomas</hi> behoulding &amp; touching the wounds
of Christ crucified, was so illumined with faith, that hee
plainly and openly professed Christ, to be both his Lord and
his God.</p>
   <p>This beeing so, and loue procuring loue, euen as the
loadstone draweth Ironne: who is hee, I pray you, whome
so vehement loue of Christ, nay rather a heate and flame
will not affecte, kindell, and sette on fier? Who is he when
at the death of Christ all creatures do suffer with him, the
Sunne darkened, the vaile of the Temple rent in sonder,
the earth quaking, Rockes breaking, graues opening, and
the deade arising, who and what is hee (I say) that will
not woonder, and that will not be abasshed? Onely Adams
children, for whose cause he died are not moued with this
so great a benefite.</p>
   <p>The Adamente, that most harde stoane, is mollified
with the bloude of a goate: Iron with the heate of fier is
made softe:<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 10.</note> but the hartes of Christians more harde then
Adamant or Iron, are not mollified with the bloude and
fier of Christ▪ but do crucifie a fresh vnto themselues the
sonne of God, and do tread vnder their feete the bloude of
the testament.</p>
   <p>What I pray you can be more beseeming, more meete,
more Iuste, and more profitable for vs, then to loue againe
him that so loueth vs, and Imitate him whome wee loue?
For if any thing herein seme harde, if any thing greuous,
that thing, loue, the sweete yoke of the Lord, maketh light
and easie, for all labor is light, to him that loueth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that notable sentence of that auntiente father
saint <hi>Gregory, Nihil adeo graue est quod non aequani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter
toleretur, si Chrsti passio, ad memoriam reduca
tur.</hi> There is nothing so heauy &amp; burthensome but the same
<pb facs="7"/>
is willingly borne, if so be the passion of Christ be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered.</p>
   <p>For we will indure all thinges with patience as light
and easie, if we call to mynde what hard wordes, harder
stripes, and most harde paines and afflictions, he suffered
for vs, whose heade was crowned with thornes, his eyes
blinde foulded, his eares filled with reproaches, his mouth
with gaule and vineger, his face polluted with spitting,
his cheekes brused with buffetting, his kneese shaking, his
shoulders laden with the crosse, his hart replenished with
sorrow his bodie torne with whippes, his members racked,
his handes and feete bored,<note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> to be breefe from the crowne of
the heade to the soales of the foot, he sustained an Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
sort of woundes and sorrowes. Wherefore as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>Mara,</hi> being sometimes bitter, were made swete by
<hi>Moses,</hi> at what time he cast wood into them: euen so all
our tribulation, if we patiently indure the crosse of Christ,
will waxe sweete, and the gaule thereof will: tourne into
honny. For by the meditations of these afflictions of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
faith is illumined, hope strengthened, charitie infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and all vertue increased. Wherefore saint Augustine
a light of the Church, no lesse truly then godly, prouoking
vs by very forceable woordes therevnto: saith thus, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould
the woundes of him that hangeth, the bloud of
him that dieth,</hi>
      <note place="margin">August. in lib de virgi nitate.</note>
      <hi>the price of the redemer, the scarres of
him that ryseth: His heade boweth to kisse thee, his
hart is opened to loue thee, his armes stretched abroad
to imbrace thee, his whole bodie set forth to redeeme
thee. Consider what and how greate <gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>hese thinges be,
waigh them in the ballance of your heartes, that hee
may be wholy fastened in your hartes, who for vs was
wholy fastened on the crosse.</hi> Thus far <hi>Augustine.</hi> So
that it is not enough to meditate of these thinges once: but
it is profitable to thinke vpon them often: yea the oftener,
the more they auaile and profite. In the wholesome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
<pb facs="7"/>
of whose passion, although we profite much, yet
we shall neuer attaine to the perfite knowledge thereof,
but there will remaine still somewhat that we may seeke
for, the full knowledge wherof is reserued to our heauenly
countrey. In the meane tyme, let vs contemplate in these
thinges day and night, in these things let vs recreate and
busie our selues. In these let vs watch, in these let vs sleep,
yea to die in the meditation of these things, is most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and auaileable to euerlasting saluation.</p>
