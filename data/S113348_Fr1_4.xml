   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E do not well: this day
is a day of good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and we hold
our peace: if we tarry
till the morning light,
some mischief will come upon us:
now therefore come, that we may
go and tell the Kings houshold:</hi>—
Thus reasoned the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>pers that first
came to the knowledge of the <hi>Syrians</hi>
flight, and <hi>Israels</hi> deliveratice: And
the application of their arguments
hath (in a much like case) produced
now the like resolution.</p>
   <p>Having been a witnesse of the late
discoverie of a richer <hi>Mine,</hi> then any
of those which golden PERV af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords,

LIFE and HEALTH,
and vigarous STRENGTH of
Minde and Bodie, generall PLEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIE,
and private WEALTH,
yea and VERTVE it self (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> part, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the Minde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ollow the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Bodie) being to be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
thence with very little pain and
cost, and without any danger at all:
I have thought my self bound so give
publick notice thereof to the world.</p>
   <p>And so much the rather, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been a <hi>Spectatour</hi> onely, I finde
my self de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>arred from that plca of
modestie, wherewith the <hi>Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi>
excuse themselves from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of this <hi>Treasure.</hi> But who
knoweth whether I have not in part
been restrained from the credit of
partnership, to mine own private good;
to this intent, that I might be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to become the <hi>Publisher</hi> of it for
common benefit? Surely, me thinks,
as in some regard my want of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in the businesse makes my testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of the more validitie (for who
<pb facs="3"/>
will not beleeve a witnesse giving in
evidence to his own prejudice?) so it
seems to impose on me a kinde of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of acquainting the world there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
if happily by the promotion of
others good, I may help to redeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
mine own negligence. This good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
I hope, may follow to mine
own advantage upon this publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
as on the contrarie I might
justly be afraid of multip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ying da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and doubling punishment
upon my head, for the unjust con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment,
as well as for the not
practi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ing of that, which I cannot
but approve most excellent and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
to all those ends, that a wise
man and a Christian should aim at.
In this regard, I hope the pious and
charitable Reader (and none but
such I invite) will help me rather
with his prayers, and a fair acceptance
of my hearty desires of his good, then
censure or despise my want of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
conformitie to that which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ort
him unto. And thus much
touching my self, and the reasons
<pb facs="4"/>
that have moved me to the publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these ensuing Treatises.</p>
   <p>The middlemost of which, as it
was first written in order of time,
so it was in translation; and therefore
I will begin with it.</p>
   <p>Master <hi>George Herbert</hi> of blessed
memorie, having at the request of a
Noble Personage translated it into
English, sent a copie thereof, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moneths before his death, unto
some friends of his, who a good while
before had given an attempt of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
themselves in matter of <hi>Diet:</hi>
Which, although it was after a very
imperfect manner, in regard of that
exact course therein prescribed; yet
was of great advantage to them, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they were enabled, through
the good preparation that they had
thus made, to go immediately to the
practise of that pattern, which <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narus</hi>
had set them, and so have
reaped the benefit thereof, in a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and eminenter manner then could
otherwise possi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ly have been imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in so short a space.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>Not long after, <hi>Lessius</hi> his book,
by happie chance, or, to speak bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by gracious providence of the
<hi>Authour of Health</hi> and all other
good things, came to their hands:
Whereby receiving much instruction
and confirmation, they requested from
me the Translation of it into English.
Whereupon hath ensued what you
shall now receive.</p>
   <p>It was their desire to have the
Translation entire; and finding no
just reason to the contrary, 1 have
been willing to satisfie them therein.
Mast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>r <hi>Herbert</hi> professeth, and so it
is indeed apparant, that he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to leave out something out of
<hi>Cornarus:</hi> but it was not any thing
appertaining to the main subject of the
book, but chiefly certain extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
excursion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> of the Authour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Reformation of Religion,
which in his time was newly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.
Neither his old blinde zeal,
nor the new and dangerous profession
of <hi>Lessius,</hi> will (as we hope) breed
any scandal or discredit to these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb facs="5"/>
works of theirs, nor to the Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatours
of them, with any discreet and
sincere <hi>Protestants.</hi> That they wore
both <hi>Papists,</hi> and the one of them a
<hi>Jesuite,</hi> is no prejudice to the truth
of what they write concerning <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance:</hi>
In the prosecution whereof,
we ought not onely to agree with
them, but to seek to advance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
them, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>smuch as the puritie of
our Religion exacts a more perfect
endeavouring after all manner of
true vertue, then theirs can do. We
have not therefore judged it meet, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to wave, or to disguise the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
of the Authours, but rather to
give notice thereof; esteeming, that
as Treakle is made of Vipers, so
from this very poysonous superstition
on their parts, an excellent Cordiall
may be extracted, for the benefit of
all that truely feare God, and sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desire to serve him: who cannot but
make a conscience of being <hi>inferiour</hi>
in the practise of Vertue to them,
over whom they are so much <hi>superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
is the knowledge of the Truth,</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>The qualitie of the Authour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus known, the Iudicious Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
will not finde any cause of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
at his commendation of some
persons, or institutions, nor at his
use of some kinde of phrases answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his Religion. That which was
of notorious scandal, hath received
correction. In those thing which may
receive a favourable construction, or
are not of any great moment, it hath
not been thought fit to make any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration;
because it could not indeed
be well done without obsouring, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
utterly dissolving the frame of
the Discourse.</p>
   <p>The names of <hi>Hermites</hi> and
<hi>Monkes</hi> are perhaps offensive to
weak mindes, that have onely heard
of the superstition and villanie of
the late professours thereof, and have
not heard, or do not beleeve the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rue
and true holinesse of those in the
Primitive times. But since they are
not brought in here for proof of any
controversall points, but onely as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
to confirm the vertue and
<pb facs="6"/>
power of <hi>Temperance,</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Health;</hi> there
is so little cause of scandal to the
most scrupulous-minded that can be,
as it must needs be interpreted desire
of quarrell and contention in any that
shall sound Alarm on this ground.
And for the surer binding of such
it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hing fingers (if any such shall be)
to the Peace, I have thought it not
amisse to make use of the <hi>Decree</hi> of
that Great <hi>Chancellour</hi> of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
as well as of the <hi>Law,</hi> the lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>Vicount S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. Albans,</hi> as I finde it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred
in his Book which he entitles,
<hi>The Historie of Life and Death.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Which, serving not onely to bear
me out in this particular, but sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
ratifying the whole busines, I
have thought fit to prefix as a generall
Approbation; sheltring my self there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
as upon a warrant under the
great <hi>Seal</hi> of Learning and Ingenuity.</p>
   <p>And so I come to the third Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course:
which is added to the other,
as a banquet of Iunkets after a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
Feast. The Authour thereof was
<pb facs="6"/>
an <hi>Italian</hi> of great reputation, living
in the same age which <hi>Cornarus</hi> did.
The change of the time, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of our fashions, hath necessarily
caused some alterations and additions
in the English translation, to make it
more Domzon-like. If it give any
delight, we have as much as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire:
although there is no reason to
exclude the hope of benefiting. For
however it seems to play, yet in very
truth it strikes home, and pierceth to
the quick.
<q>
         <l>—Ridentem dicere verum</l>
         <l>Quid vetat?—</l>
      </q>
Oft-times lighter arguments effect,
what stronger and more serious can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do: and that is taken in good part
by way of mirth, which being done in
earnest would by no means be brooked.</p>
   <p>Thus (good Reader) thou hast as
much as I conceive needfull to be
known touching my self, or to be said
touching the work. As for the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners,
they forbid any more to be
spoken of them then this, That as
they finde all the benefits, which are
<pb facs="7"/>
promised by <hi>Cornarus</hi> and <hi>Lessius,</hi>
most true and reall; so by Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
they finde no difficultie at all in
the observation of this course. They
are sufficient witnesses in their own
affairs, and I hold them to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
And therefore making no doubt
of the truth of the latter part of their
report, as I can abundantly give testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the veritie of the former, I
commend both to thy belief and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;
and so commit thee to
Gods grace.</p>
