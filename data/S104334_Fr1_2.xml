      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Arvell not gentle Reader, though in a mad humour, I haue thus published the Blacke Dogge of Newgate, and here shewne his trickes to the wide world to wonder at; he is but a Curre indeed, not worth three halfe pence to be sold, but if you will accept of my Pen and Paper, it may countervaile the charge of sixe pence; it is no better then an ill favoured blacke Dogge, yet I desire you not to thinke your time ill bestowed in the reading, nor the price too great which you pay for it. When you have perusde it, and like it not, reward not my good will with a scoffe: But say the Dogge came from Newgate, hang him up and rend the Booke in peeces, and then I will be your debter in a Work of more worth, but let me
<pb facs="3"/>
tell you by the way, This Dog, with many Doggs of his kinde, have I knowne a great while, and have received by them great wrong: otherwise had I not bestowed so much time in deciphering a Cur; nay more, let me give you to understand, that this Dog, thus shadowed under the name of a servant at New-gate, was in my sight, by head and shoulders thrust out of Newgate: and now men chosen instead of Dogs of far more pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and honestie, than that hell-hound ever had.</p>
   <p>Therefore let me thus conclude, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cur in shape of man, in that place, shall commit the like abuses. No more for the Dog of Newgate: But for this Dog of mine, wish me well, and I will never doe you ill: Rest content, and I am well pleased.</p>
   <closer>Fare you Well.</closer>
