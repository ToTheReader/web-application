   <head>TO THE GENTLEMEN
STVDENTS OF BOTH
VNIVERSITIES.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Vrteous, and wise, whose iudgements (not
entangled with enuy) enlarge the deserts
of the learned, by your liberall censures:
vouchsafe to welcome your Scholler-like
Shepherd, with such Vniuersitie entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as either the nature of your bounty,
or the custome of your common ciuility may affoord. To
you he appeales that knew him <hi>ab extrema pueritia,</hi> whose
<hi>placet</hi> hee accounts the <hi>plaudite▪</hi> of his paines: thinking his
day-labour was not altogether lauisht <hi>siue linea,</hi> if there be
any thing at al in it, that doth <hi>olere Atticum</hi> in your estimate.
I am not ignorant how eloquent our gowned age is grown
of late, so that euery Mechanicall mate abhorreth the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
he was borne to, and plucks with a solemne periphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
his <hi>vt vales</hi> from the inke-horne: which I impute, not so
much to the perfection of Arts, as to the seruile imitation of
vaine-glorious Trag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>dians, who contend▪ not so seriously to
excell in action, as to embowell the cloudes in a speech of
comparison, thinking themselues more then initiated in
Poets immortality, if they but once get <hi>Boreas</hi> by the beard,
and the heauenly Bull by the deaw-lap. But herein I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so fully bequeath them to folly, as their ideot Art-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="3 letters">
         <desc>•••</desc>
      </gap>ude themselues to our eares, as the Alcumists
of eloquence, who (mounted on the stage of arrogance)
thinke to out-braue better Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s with the swelling bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bast

their imagination with a more then drunken resolution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not extemporall in the inuention of any other meanes
to vent their man-hood, commits the disgestion of their
cholericke incumbrances, to the spacious volubilitie of a
drumming decasillabon. Mongst this kinde of men, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
eternitie in the mouth of a Player, I can but ingrosse
some deep-read Schoolemen or Grammarians, who hauing
no more learning in their skull, then will serue to take vp a
commoditie, nor Art in their braiue, then was nourished in
a Seruing-mans idlenesse, will take vpon them to bee the
ironicall Censors of all, when God and Poetrie doth know
they are the simplest of all. To leaue all these to the mercy
of their Mother tongue, that feed on nought but the crums
that fall from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ranslators trencher, I come (sweet friend)
to thy <hi>Arcadian Menaphon,</hi> whose attyre (though not so
stately, yet comely) doth intitle thee aboue all other, to that
<hi>temperatum dicendi genus,</hi> which <hi>Tully</hi> in his Orator termeth
true eloquence. Let other men (as they please) praise the
Mountayne that in seuen yeeres bringeth forth a Mouse, or
the Italianate Pen, that of a packet of pilfris, affoords the
Presse a pamphlet or two in an Age, and then in disguised
array vaunts <hi>Ouids</hi> and <hi>Plutarchs</hi> plumes as their owne:
but giue mee the man, whose extemporall veine in any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
will excell our greatest Art-Masters deliberate
thoughts, whose inuentions quicker then his eye, will chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the prowdest Rhetorician, to the contention of like
perfection, with like expedition.</p>
   <p>What is he among Students so simple, that cannot bring
foorth (<hi>tanquam aliquando</hi>) some or other thing singular,
sleeping betwixt euery sentence? What is not <hi>Maroes</hi>
twelue yeeres toyle, that so famed his twelue <hi>Aeneidos?</hi> Or
<hi>Peter Ramus</hi> sixteene yeeres paines, that so praised his petty
Logicke? How is it then, our drowping wits should so
wonder at an exquisite line, that was his Masters day-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?
Indeede I must needs say, the descending yeeres from
the Philosophers <hi>Athens,</hi> haue not beene supplied with such
present Orators, as were able in any English veine to be elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb facs="3"/>
of their owne, but either they must borrow inuention
of <hi>Ariosto,</hi> &amp; his countrimen, take vp choice of words by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
in <hi>Tullies Tusculans,</hi> &amp; the Latine Historiographers
store-houses, similitudes, nay whole sheets, &amp; tractates <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim,</hi>
from the plentie of <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Plinie:</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
their whole methode of writing, from the libertie of
Comicall fictions, that haue succeeded to our Rhetoricians
by a second imitation; so that wel may the Adage, <hi>Nil dictum
quod non dictum prius,</hi> bee the most iudiciall estimate of our
latter Writers. But the hunger of our vnsatiate humorists,
being such as it is, ready to swallow all draffe without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
that insinuates it selfe to their senses vnder the name
of delights, imploies ofttimes many thredbare wits, to emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
their inuention of their Apish deuices, and talke most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially
of Policie, as those that neuer ware gowne in the
Vniuersitie; wherein they reuiue the old said Adage, <hi>Sus
Mineruam,</hi> and cause the wiser to quippe them with <hi>Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nui
ad lyram.</hi> Would Gentlemen and riper iudgements ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
my motion of moderation in a matter of folly, I would
perswade them to physicke their faculties of seeing and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
as the Sabaeans doe their dulled senses with smelling:
who (as <hi>Strabo</hi> reporteth) ouer-cloyd with such odoriferous
sauours as the naturall increase of their Country (Balsamum,
Amomum, with Myrrhe and Frankincense) sends forth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
their nostrills with the vnsauourie sent of the pitchy
flame, that <hi>Euphrates</hi> cast vp, &amp; the cōiagíous fumes of goats
beards burned: so would I haue them, being surfeited vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
with the sweet saciety of eloquence, which the lauish
of our copious language may procure, to vse the remedie of
contraries, and recreate their rebated wits; not as they did,
with the senting of slime or Goats beards burned, but with
the ouer-seeing of that <hi>sublime dicendi genus,</hi> which walkes
abroad for waste paper in each Seruing-mans pocket, and
the otherwhile pervsing of our Gothamists barbarisme; so
should the opposite comparison of <hi>Puritie,</hi> expell the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Absurditie,</hi> and their ouer-racked Rhetoricke, bee
the Ironicall recreation of the Reader.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
But so farre discrepant is the idle vsage of our vnexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
and illiterated Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>es from this prescription, that a
tale of <hi>Ioane</hi> of <hi>Brainfords</hi> will, and the vnlucky Frumenty,
will be as soone entertayned into their Libraries, as the best
Poeme that euer <hi>Tasso</hi> eterniz'd: which being the effect of
an vndiscerning iudgemēt, makes drosse as valuable as gold,
and losse as wel-come as gaine; the Glow-worme mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in <hi>Aesops</hi> Fables, namely, the Apes folly, to be mistaken
for fire, when as God wot, poore soules, they haue nought
but their toyle for their heate, their paines for their sweat,
and (to bring it to our English Prouerbe) their labour for
their trauell. Wherein I can but resemble them to the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who is so greedy of mens excrements, that if they bee
hanged vp in a vessell higher then his reach, hee soone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> kills
himselfe with the ouer-stretching of his windlesse body,
then hee will cease from his intended enterprise. Oft haue I
obserued what I now set downe: a secular wit that hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
all dayes of his life by, what doe you lack? to be more
iudiciall in matters of conceit, then our quadrant crepun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
that spit <hi>ergo</hi> in the mouth of euery one they meete:
yet those and these are affectionate to dogged detracting,
as the most poysonous <hi>Pasquils,</hi> any durty-mouthed <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
or <hi>Momus</hi> euer composed, is gathered vp with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

of our Greeke writers in the robes of the ancient Romanes;
in whose traces <hi>Philip Melancthon, Sadolet, Plantine,</hi> and
many other reuerend Germanes insisting, haue reedified the

Who euer my priuate opinion condemneth as saultie, Master
<hi>Gascoigne</hi> is not to bee abridged of his deserued esteeme,
who first beate the path to that perfection which our best
Poets haue aspired to since his departure, whereto hee did
ascend, by comparing the Italian with the English, as <hi>Tully</hi>
did <hi>Graeca cum Latinis.</hi> Neither was M. <hi>Turberuile</hi> the worst
of his time, though in translating hee attributed too much to
the necessitie of the time. And in this page of praise, I cannot
omit aged <hi>Arthur Golding,</hi> for his industrious toyle in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
<hi>Ouids Metamorphosis,</hi> besides many other exquisite e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of diuinitie, turned by him out of the French tongue
into our owne. M. <hi>Phaer</hi> likewise is not to be forgot, in regard
of his famous <hi>Virgil,</hi> whose heauenly verse, had it not beene
blemished by his hautie thoughts, England might haue long
insulted his wit, and <hi>corrigat qui potest</hi> haue beene subscribed
to his workes. But Fortune, the Mistris of change, with a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying

Tush, say our English Italians, the finest wits our climate sends
