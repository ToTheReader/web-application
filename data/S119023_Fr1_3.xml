   <head>A PREFACE TO all English Papists who approue <hi>not the Gun-powder Treason:</hi> aunswering the Preface of BECANE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>or as much as <hi>Becane</hi> hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of an English Iarre about the Supremacie, I am willing to vse a few words vnto you; but in no case to be troublesome with any tedious Oration. About two yeares since, <hi>Becane</hi> wrote two Libel-pamphlets touching the Kings Supremacie: th'one against the Apologie and monitorie Preface of our most mighty and gracious Soueraigne, IAMES, King of great Britanne: Th'other, against a booke called <hi>Tortura Torti;</hi> or rather against the author thereof, the most reuerend Bishop of <hi>Ely.</hi> The smoaky fumes of which Pamphlet (for they contained no solide matter in them) were dispelled by D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Tucker,</hi> M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>R. Tomson,</hi> M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. <hi>Rob. Burhill,</hi> and by <hi>Hainricus Salo-brigiensis.</hi> Notwithstanding, <hi>Martin Becane</hi> abideth conceitedly obstinate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="5"/>there be many things, which might haue cooled his heate, and taken from him all lust of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brawling. And principally these: First, the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his Cause. Then, your indifferent equitie. Lastly, the manifolde intestine Iarres and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Romane Writers, about the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie; and our full agreement in the Kings Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie. What shall I neede to speake of the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his Cause? For it fights against the Church of Christ, in the behalfe of the honour and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignetie of Antichrist; after the manner and biasse of Icsuits. And in this case, what one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named hath he not iust cause to feare? Againe, your indifferent equitie, wherein (with the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Parisian <hi>Sorbonists</hi>) you detest the Iesuites, who seeke to iustifie their Cause by the imprisonments, bonds, and deaths of Traitors, suffered for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions against their natiue Kings; whose hands (vnlesse they were the hands of this <hi>Becane</hi>) would it not shake, and cause to let fall the penne? whose spirits, though neuer so lofty, would it not depresse, infringe, and dissipate, saue onely of <hi>Becane?</hi> But, very impiously and impudently doth he apply, to the Gun-powder Traitors, that which Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. wrote of the persecuted Saints: <hi>viz. You are made a gazing stock to God, to Angels, and to Men.</hi> Let them be so, since the Iesuite will haue it so; 1. <hi>Agazing stock to God:</hi> who, beholding their trecherous and couert conspiracies against their most gracious Soueraigne, his Anointed (as the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite here confesseth) <hi>laugheth them to scorne;</hi> enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb facs="5"/>their forces, for our victory; and preparing hell fire, for their eternall punishment. 2. <hi>A specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to Angels:</hi> who [wondring there be any (so much as stiled with the name of Christians) that tremble not to call the royall Supremacies of Kings in the Church (ordained by God himselfe, grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scriptures, practised with commendation, by the best, both Kings of <hi>Israell,</hi> and Emperors Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian) <hi>Potentissimos Inferorum Principatus; The most potent principalities of hell:</hi>] reioyce to beholde such infamous and execrable Traitors committed to the safe custody and torture of spirituall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. Lastly, <hi>A spectacle to men:</hi> who (being disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through the whole world, and but hearing of these most inhumane and bloudie Iesuiticall conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, more sauage then cruelty it selfe) are infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the Lords Anointed to vndergo perpetuall combats with all these pestilent Emissaries of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. Moreouer, if you know not with what great varietie, inconstancy, and vanitie of opinions the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Writers trauell; and with what vniforme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all our Writers the Kings Supremacie is maintained; listen and read-ouer (but cursorily) this little Booke which here I present to you: and in it you shall finde particularly expressed before your eyes, wherein and in what heads they differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues, about the Popes Supremacie; and how we accord in the Supremacie of our King. And heere it much concernes your desire of peace and tranquillitie, to obscrue how gallantly this <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane</hi> presenteth himselfe to you, with his counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite
<pb facs="6"/>and childish wiles to entrappe you: wherein he playeth his prizes so skilfully and subtilly to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuent you, that by his onely cunning hopeth to gaine no small praises. But seeing he is ready for the combat, I will so prouide that he shall not finde me vnprepared; not only to meete with his blowes, but also to repell them, and to turne them backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vpon his owne head. Of which our conflict I desire you to be Spectators. In the meane time I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech the most mercifull heauenly Father to grant you zeale according to knowledge, &amp;c.</p>
