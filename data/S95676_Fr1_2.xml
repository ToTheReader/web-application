      </gap>heyre glorious liues, whose names, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Sainctes of God, are in the Roman Calender. This debt, I must confess, hath bin due this long time: but could not be discharged, vntill this present; wherein the grace of God hath freed our passage through a maine sea of difficulties. For such is the nature of all Catholi{que} writings in oure distressed countrie. what through penurie, pressure, and long imprisonment of theyre authors at home; ignorance neglect &amp; carelesnes of suche as are put in trust abroade; wee must wynde oure selues out of a laberynth of crosses, before wee can bring to light oure laboures. And euen then must they runne so manie hard fortunes, and haue suche bad well come and entertainment, that only this were able to check all endeuoures, not strengthned by the hand of God. And yett could I neuer finde anie reason, why this worke of ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res should not be wellcome to people of all sorts and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For yf the liues of those auncyent worthies, whose highest ayme was a fayned, shadowed, transitorie glorie, or els the loue and renowne of theyre natiue countrie, be so gratefull to most men, principally suche as follow theyre steppes: they, who, taking vp theyre crosse and following CHRISTE, did beate the narrow path, that leadeth to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; they whose ayme was euerlasting glorie, whose loue Hierusalem theyre mother citty in heauen; they whose va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and violence did winne the Kingdome purchased for them with the bloud of CHRISTE; why should not theyr liues be acceptable to all, whose name doth wittness theyr profession, to be nothing els but a following of CHRISTE? Or why should wee gleane, with a hungrie delight &amp; gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die appetite, some few barren eares of morall vertues, scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the liues of Heathnish authors; &amp; care not for the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efe croppe and principall haruest of all naturall &amp; superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall vertues, which are to be found in that hundreth-yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="3"/>field of the Churche of CHRISTE? Especially seing, that, what is most eminēt in suche as only walked by light of reason, may no wayes compare with the verie beginnings of those sainctes, that were guided by the light of faith. These God therefore hath placed in the churches firmament, to serue vs as light to guide oure steps: these he did leaue vs as patternes and myrrhoures, wherein wee might behold oure offences, to shunne them; theyre vertues, to embrace them. In them all callings &amp; professions shall finde how to rule and square theyre actions, to the honoure of God, and profi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>t of theyre soules. They will teache vs how to wage warre with oure enemies, VVorld, Flesh &amp; Deuill: how to preuent theyre wiles &amp; trappes, when they goe about to win vs with coloure of sanctity: how to arme, order, &amp; ward oure selues, when they assaile vs with open force and hostility. There wee shall see howe to behaue oure selues in the boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous stormes of aduersitie, how in the deceytfull calme of prosperitie. Finally theyre liues will be oure card com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, teaching vs how to direct oure course, that without suffering shipwracked of oure soules wee may arriue at the hauen of health &amp; saluatiō. VVherefore, deere Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ader, doubt not to wellcome &amp; entertain that ghuest, whose presence with pleasure will affoord thee such profitt. And when thou doest finde some few suche things as are more to be admired then imitated, past not thy iudgement vpon thē with passion: measure not the vertues of God his Sainctes by thy owne feeblenes: goe not about to weaken or discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the promisses of CHRISTE, nor confine the omnipotēt hand of God within the narrow bounds of humaine reason. for the holie Ghost hath all ready fore told vs, that God is admirable in his sainctes: and CHRISTE did promise, that his disciples should worke greater wonders, then theyre maisters.</p>
