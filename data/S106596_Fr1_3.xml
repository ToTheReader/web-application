   <head>A COMMENDATORY
Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Rts are the only helpes towards humane
perfection. Those therfore which are
the helps towards the easinesse, maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
perfection of Arts, deserue best of
mankinde. Whence it is, that God would not suffer
the first deuisers, so much as of shepheards tents, of
musical instruments, of Iron-works, to be vnknown
to the world:<note place="margin">Tubal-cain.</note> the last wherof euen heathen Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
hath in common iudgement continued, without
much difference of name, till this daie; although I
cannot beleeue that anie of the heathen gods were so
ancient. Yea, hence it is, that the holy Ghost chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
the faculty euen of manuary skill, to his
owne gifte; as beeing too good for Nature, and too
meritorious of men. That Bezaleel and Aholiab
can worke curiously in siluer and golde, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
Tabernacle, is from Gods spirit, and not
theirs: How much more is this true, in those scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which are so essentiall to the spirituall house of
God? As Arts are to perfection of knowledge; so
is Grammar to all Artes. Man differs but in speech
and reason (that is, Grammar and Logicke) from
<pb facs="6"/>
beasts: wherof reason is of Nature; speech (in respect
of the present variation) is of humane institution.
Neither is it vnsafe to say, that this later is the more
necessary of the two: For we both haue, and can vse
our reason alone; our speech we cannot, without a
guide I subscribe therfore to the iudgement of them,
that think God was the first Author of letters (which
are the simples of this Art) whether by the hand of
Moses; as Clement of Alexandria reports from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polemus:
or rather of the ancienter Progeny of Seth
in the first wotld; as Iosephus. Hee that gaue man
the faculty of speech, gaue him this meanes, to teach
his speech: And if he were so carefull to giue man
this helpe, while all the world was of one lip (as the
Hebrews speak) how much more, after that misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
confusion of tongues? wherein euery man was a
Grammar to himselfe; &amp; needed a new Grammar, to
be vnderstood of others. It is not therfore vnworthy
of obseruatiō, that God (knowing languages to be the
carryage of knowledge) as in his iudgement he diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the tongues of those presumptuous builders; so
contrarily hee sent his spirit in clouen tongues vpon
the heads of those master-builders of his Church.
What they were suddainly taught of God, we with
much leasure and industry learne of men; knowing
the tongues so necessarie for all knowledge, that it is
well, if but our younger yeeres be spent in this study.
How seruiceable therfore is this labor, which is here
vndertaken, and how beneficial, to make the way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all learning, both short, and faire! Our Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were so long vnder the ferule, till their beards
were growen as long as their pens: this age hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried
<pb facs="6"/>
a neerer way; yet not without much difficulty,
both to the schollars, and teacher: Now, time, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
and painfulnesse (which are the meanes to
bring all things to their height) haue taught this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
yet further, how to spare both time and paines
this way vnto others; and (that which is most to bee
approoued) without any change of the receiued
groūds. It is the cōmon enuy of men, by how much
richer treasure they haue found, so much more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to cōceale it. How commendable is the ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
of those spirits, which cannot ingrosse good expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
to their priuate aduantage? which had rather
doe then haue good: who can be content to cast at
once into the common Bank of the world, what the
studious obseruation, inquisition, reading, practice
of many yeeres haue inriched them withall: That,
which this Author hath so freely done; as one that
feares not, least knowledge should be made too easie,
or too vulgar. The Iesuites haue won much of their
reputation, and stollen many hearts with their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in this kinde. How happie shall it be for the
Chnrch and vs, if we excite our selues at least to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
this their forwardness? We may out-strip them,
if wee want not to our selues: Behold here, not feete
but wings, offered to vs. Neither are these directions
of meere speculation, whose promises are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as large, as the performance defectiue; but such as
(for the most part) to the knowledge of my selfe,
and manie abler Iudges, haue been, and are daily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in his experience, and practice, with more
then vsuall successe. What remaines therefore, but
that the thankfull acceptation of men, and his effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb facs="7"/>
labors should mutually reflect vpon each-other?
that he may be in couraged by the one, and they by
the other benefited: that, what hath been vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and furthered by the graue counsell of many,
and wise; and performed by the studious indeuours
of one so well deseruing; may be both vsed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the common good of all, and to the glorie
of him which giueth, and blesseth all.</p>
