   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN
Reader Grace and Peace.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving in my custodie (Christian
Reader) a coppie of <hi>M. Broughtons
Sermon on the Lords Prayer:</hi> I
found it upon perusall, to conteine the
<hi>Summe</hi> of all <hi>Divinitie:</hi> especially
being so fitly compared with the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>
which maketh the sence more
heauenly, and the harmonie more sweet:
and being composed together with much plainenes and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie,
and also garnished with much learning from the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Rabbins,</hi> which the <hi>New Testament</hi> alloweth: which
when I had wel considered, I began to reason with my self,
why so worthy a worke should be hidde from the world, and
not rather be communicated to all, for the common good of
all: especially considering that it was his continuall desire, &amp;
constant endeavour (not to hide his learning, but) to spende
him self, and his whole estate, in the service of Christ, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the Gospell, and expounding the Holy Schriptures,
both the <hi>Historie</hi> of them, and also the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
them.</p>
   <p>And first, for the <hi>Historie of the Scriptures,</hi> he compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it, in a most plaine and profitable manner, into one short
viewe, which he called <hi>A Consent of Scripture:</hi> and herein
<pb facs="3"/>
he did carefully explaine three necessarie <hi>Circumstances,</hi>
that is to say, <hi>Tyme, Place</hi> and <hi>Person:</hi> without the
knowledge of which <hi>Circumstances,</hi> the <hi>Historie</hi> of the
<hi>Bible</hi> can never rightly be understood: and therefore with
great paynes, and no lesse learning, he made many severall
<hi>Treatises,</hi> upon these three <hi>Circumstances;</hi> first, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
the truth of them by <hi>Scripture:</hi> and <hi>secondly,</hi> in
<hi>defending</hi> of that <hi>Truth,</hi> against the manifold <hi>Errors</hi> of
former <hi>Writers:</hi> and also against the manifold cavilations
of sundry late <hi>Opposers.</hi> And therefore all those that
upbraide his learned paynes with the terme of <hi>needlesse Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies,</hi>
and <hi>unprofitable Chronologie,</hi> they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to beare the burden of their owne ignorance: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
they thinke in their owne conceite, they know much,
yet in deede &amp; in truth they might know more, to their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
joy and comfort, if they did not despise the <hi>Holy Rules,</hi>
(I meane the afore-named <hi>Circumstances</hi>) wherewith <hi>God
hath garnished his blessed Word,</hi> as a speciall help to guide
everie wise hearted Reader in the true understanding of the
same.</p>
   <p>And secondly, this <hi>Learned Divine</hi> of blessed memorie,
hath also declared his speciall loue to the <hi>Church of God,</hi>
in adding much help, for the better understanding of the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Bible:</hi> although his manner was not to
make large <hi>Common-place bookes:</hi> because the most
Writers doe imploy their paynes about it: therefore he
thought it more necessarie to imploy himselfe, in giving
<hi>Rules</hi> for the true understanding of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and for
the right expounding of some <hi>Common places,</hi> wherein
many Writers doe not agree, because the scope of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>
is not rightly understood: and therefore he hath
giuen us warning, how to understand many <hi>Common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi>
as about <hi>Predestination,</hi> &amp; <hi>the Sufferings of Christ:</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/>
and about the <hi>Article,</hi> commonly called <hi>Christes Discent
into Hel:</hi> &amp;c. Also he speaketh much, and to great light,
upon the mysterie of the <hi>Holy Trinitie,</hi> and of the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Resurrection of Christ:</hi> as also of the <hi>Fall of
Man,</hi> and of the great mysterie of our <hi>Redemption:</hi> and
of many other weighty poynts: as appeareth in this insuing
<hi>Treatise:</hi> and in many other of his <hi>Works:</hi> as in <hi>Iob,
Ecclesiastes, Daniel, and his large Commentarie on the
Appocalypsis:</hi> &amp;c. Now if this be true, as it is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the aforenamed books, then it should stop the mouthes
of all those, that slander his learned paynes, because say they,
he teacheth no <hi>Sanctification:</hi> but they doe litle consider,
when they say so, that the <hi>Ground of Sanctification</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
in the <hi>Holy and right knowledge of the Word of
God,</hi> which must first be seated in the <hi>minde &amp; conscience,</hi>
before it can be practised in the life and conversation.</p>
   <p>O but, say some, his writings are not worth the reading,
because they are so difficult &amp; hard to understand: I answer
with S. Peter, that many things are hard to be understood in
<hi>Pauls Epistles, 2 Pet.</hi> 3, 16. shall we therfore not count them
worth the reading, because they are somewhat difficult? no,
no, God requires the paines of the mind for the understāding
of his word, for it is a treasure hid in the ground, &amp; therfore
they must take paynes to digge for it, that will haue it: so if
men could but endure the paynes of the minde, they would
speake more reverendly of this mans Writings: but because
men loue such ease, they cannot see the drift of his Writing:
and therefore well may his great Learning lamente, because
so fewe regarde it: for it is almost sollitarie and unknowne
to his owne <hi>Nation,</hi> because fewe doe knowe, what his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
paynes may further, which is more precious then
<hi>Rubies:</hi> Yea, therefore, his knowledge doth powre
teares downe her cheekes, because shee is understood of
<pb facs="4"/>
none. But I would to God, that some <hi>Learned man</hi> would
take the paynes to contriue al his <hi>Workes</hi> in to one <hi>Volume,</hi>
that so his great learning might not perish in <hi>Oblivion:</hi>
but that the ages to come may haue it in <hi>Record</hi> for their
help and furtherance in <hi>Divinitie studies,</hi> who wil doubtles
reape more fruit by them, then we doe, by reason of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes,
and so the God of all peace be with thee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Reader; and the Lord giue thee understanding in all
things. Amen.</p>
