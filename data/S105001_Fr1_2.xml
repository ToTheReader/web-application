Nor can I tell whether this worke was diuulged with his consent or no: but howsoeuer, since it hath past the Test of the stage with so generall an applause, pitty it were but it should likewise haue the honour of the Presse. As for Maister <hi>Greene,</hi> all that I will speake of him (and that without flattery) is this (if I were worthy to censure) there was not an Actor of his nature in his time of better ability in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of what he vndertooke; more applaudent by the Audience, of greater grace at the Court, or of more general loue in the Citty, and so with this briefe character of his memory, I commit him to his rest.</p>
