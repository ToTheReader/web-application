      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou hast here, gentle Reader, a true report of the whole substance of the conferences had in the Tower the last three dayes, faythfully gathered out of the notes of diuers that wrote there, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde perused by the learned men them selues, and nowe lastly published by authoritie. If any man be inquisitiue why they were set forth no sooner, he may vnderstande, that being priuate conferences, it was thought not much requisite to make thē publikely knowen, neither had they bin now set forth, if the importunitie of the aduersaries, by their sundry vntrue and contrary reportes made and scattered amongst their fauourites, had not euen perforce drawen thē forth. If Campions answeres be thought shorter thē they were, thou must knowe that he had much wast speach, which being impertinent, is nowe omitted: although I protest, nothing is cut off from the weight and substance of the matter: for of that, I made conscience, and had speciall regarde. Againe, if the repliers speaches seeme to be more ample: it is, because their authorities then allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged onely in Greeke or Latine, are nowe at large put downe, both in Greeke, Latine, and English. But for the arguments and answeres, I was euen religious faythfully to reporte them, as they were. Wherein, I appeale to all the hearers in Gods sight, to whose grace I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thee.</p>
