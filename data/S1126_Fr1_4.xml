      <l>But stay, I haue forgot to let you know</l>
      <l>His education, and to shew you how</l>
      <l>(Being nusled vp in Letters) he in sport</l>
      <l>His time wore out at <hi>Schoole</hi> and <hi>Innes</hi> of <hi>Court,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Yet so as once a <hi>Gipsie,</hi> who did looke</l>
      <l>Vpon his Palme, said he, should liue by's booke;</l>
      <l>Which fortune some conceiue hath doubtfull scope,</l>
      <l>As if his booke should saue him from the rope:</l>
      <l>But since he proues, it meant another thing,</l>
      <l>That teaching Tongues, he should liue like a King;</l>
      <l>And so he now doth, liuing as he lust,</l>
      <l>And by his owne will measuring what is iust.</l>
      <l>For being set to Schoole when he was young,</l>
      <l>He of all knowledge learn'd both taile and tongue.</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Th'</hi> Italian, Latin, Spanish <hi>and the</hi> French,</l>

      <l>
         <pb facs="10"/>
And now (growne ripe) he doth religion choose</l>
      <l>That's most in fashion, as our great ones vse:</l>
      <l>But otherwise for truth hee'le neuer burne,</l>
      <l>Th' aduantage of his wry-necke helps him turne:</l>
      <l>He knowes the way, and wills the world ne're doubt,</l>
      <l>That comming raw in, hee'le go rosted out.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>In youth he tooke to Wife a louely <hi>Dame,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Not hight the chast <hi>Penelope</hi> by name;</l>
      <l>But worthy such an attribute, for shee</l>
      <l>Her wandring loose <hi>Vlisses</hi> did not see</l>
      <l>In twenty yeeres, and yet t'is thought her bed</l>
      <l>Shee kept vnstain'd, and vn-ad-horn'd his head.</l>
      <l>But what a blessing was, he thought a curse,</l>
      <l>His wife had better beene, had shee been worse,</l>
      <l>Her goodnesse made him hate her; she had dide</l>
      <l>But that a dozen must be kil'd beside.</l>
      <l>He knew not then (as I haue heard him say)</l>
      <l>Th' Italian tricke, but the plaine English way,</l>
      <l>Of simple Country poysoning, now he knowes</l>
      <l>To do t by inches; Court perfection growes.</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Lopus</hi> and <hi>Squire,</hi> are not so skil'd as hee,</l>

      <l>His wife thus scap'd a scouring, so did he,</l>
      <l>When being merry once in company</l>
      <l>And passing Smith-field (then vnpau'd) too late</l>
      <l>With rich Canary hauing linde his pate,</l>
      <l>The owle-eyde <hi>Sharkers</hi> spi'd him, how he felt</l>
      <l>To finde a post; his meaning soone they smelt:</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="11"/>
And then the sturdiest knaue, with sodain'd rush,</l>
      <l>Our wauering <hi>Monsieur</hi> on his knees did push,</l>
      <l>The whil'st another kindly to him spoke;</l>
      <l>Help't him out of the durt, and chang'd his cloke.</l>
      <l>This cloke he wore next day, and passing by</l>
      <l>A Brokers shop, the prentice lowde gan cry</l>
      <l>Sirs stop the theefe, the cloake this fellow weares</l>
      <l>Is mine: with that they swarm'd about his eares,</l>
      <l>Conuayde him to a Iustice, where one swore</l>
      <l>He had been branded <hi>stagmaticke</hi> before.</l>
      <l>Another said, he was the man that hung</l>
      <l>Three dayes beyond Seas, as the ballad sang;</l>
      <l>The cause why he his necke awry, did hold,</l>
      <l>Was for he hang'd long, and was ta'ne downe cold</l>
      <l>But to the Iustice being throughly knowne,</l>
      <l>For carrying letters where't must not be showne,</l>
      <l>And for his skill, each moderne language speaking,</l>
      <l>And wondrous Art, to silence doores from squeaking,</l>
      <l>With losse of his good <hi>cloke,</hi> he slipt the hooke,</l>
      <l>And thus he once was saued by his booke.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Thus farre I stretch my lines, thus farre he liues,</l>
      <l>And more I'le write, when he direction giues.</l>
      <l>But if I die, these lines shall be the glasse</l>
      <l>His worth to shew, and how I thankfull was.</l>
