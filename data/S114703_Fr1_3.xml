   <head>THE PREFACE OF THE AVTHOR TO THE RELIGIOVS Seruants of God.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is my intention Religious Reader, in a simple and pers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picuous stile to write a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise no like vnto that which is intituled. <hi>The Imitation of Christ,</hi> composed by that learned and Religious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God <hi>Thomas à Kempis;</hi> but yet very fit and profitable to the profession of Religious Persons. Wherin certaine whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Admonitions, and Documents are by Christ our Lord prescribed vnto euery Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious person, as well for the knowledge of his owne defectes, as the attayning to that
<pb facs="6"/>
perfection of spirituall life, whereunto by obligation of his vocation he is bound to aspire.</p>
   <p>This little Worke of myne, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it is, as I haue compiled it by Gods assisting hand: so haue I thought good to dedicate the same to the seruants of God, to the end they may be the more incited &amp; stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to the reading therof. And though I must confesse, that there be already extant no small store of Bookes of this kind: yet I trust this of myne will be neither vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, nor vnpleasant. And as there is not one and the same gust of all, in reading and handling such spirituall affayres; so is it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that oftentymes the same matter be handled diuers and sundry wayes, that therby euery one may read, and affect what shall best agree with his tast. Almighty God vouchsafe of his infinite goodnes to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate vnto vs all so much of his Grace, as both by this, and other spirituall Treatises we may reap that fruit, which may preserue vs from all sinne in this life, and from all punishment in the next. Amen.</p>
