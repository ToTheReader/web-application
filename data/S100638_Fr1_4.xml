      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing the World, at this day, so generally transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with such dangerous, and strange Doctrines; and that all men (almost) hunting after nouelties, doe so eagerly desire that which is pestilent and noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; in the meane while loathing and reiecting, that which is wholsome and good. It therefore beseemeth all men, (that render the glory of God) but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb facs="5"/> the Ministers of his word, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to shew to the people, the true difference betweene <hi>verum,</hi> and <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens bonum,</hi> that is, between<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> that which is good indeed, and that which seemeth to be so▪ especially in all great and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall poynts of Saluation. To which purpose, I haue diuulged this little Treatise, which in it owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, shall (I doubt not) but performe this Office, to which end it is sent: and be as a defensatiue in health against the day of sicknesse, and as a preseruatiue in life, against the day of death. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I soare not with the towring Eagle, into the clouds, neither deale I with Questions of difficulty, (which respect the learned and great wits; let such as list climbe into the third Heauen, and shew from thence high misteries, and vnheard of Reuelations) but casting my selfe vpon the ground, with all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I study to informe the meanest of
<pb facs="5"/> Gods children (after a plaine and easie manner) in those things, which necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily appertaine to their eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And amongst the many behoofe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full points of Christian Religion, I find none at this day, more necessary to bee taught and embraced, then this of <hi>Faith</hi> and true <hi>Repentance;</hi> seeing that fancy is generally reputed Faith, and conceit Conscience, and that Hypocrisie wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in equall compare with Piety. I had no purpose at the first preaching heereof, to haue committed the same to Print, neither did I euer value it worth the Presse or publike view: only conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my selfe with the discharge of my duty, and edification of my priuate flocke. But being ouer-ruled heerein, by the importunate intreaty of some of my hearers, and louing friends, I could not denie their request, seeing it inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the publike good. Vse it therefore Godly Reader, and meditate therein for
<pb facs="6"/> thy comfort: If thou reapest any profit thereby, giue God the praise, and thou hast sufficiently rewarded my paines. Farewell.</p>
