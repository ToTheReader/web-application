         <head>☞ Beholde this table</head>
         <figDesc>gamut</figDesc>

   </p>
   <p>In this table, or <hi>gāma vt,</hi> is cōtey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned all, what is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri to the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of singing Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be diligent lie waid &amp; muste also bee perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cōmit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to memory, so that ye can redely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly say it without boke, both forwarde and backward: that is, vpward and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward And this is the greatest pain that ye nede to take in this trauayle.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
Ye must also note that the letters ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the left hande of the Table, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Kaies, or Cleuis: of whiche the first is a Greke letter, signifying <hi>g,</hi> &amp; is called <hi>gamma,</hi> (of whom the whole table or scale is called, the <hi>Gamma vt.)</hi> All the other ar lattin letters vii. in number. <hi>a, b, c, d, e, f, g,</hi> then repeting the same again, beginning at <hi>a,</hi> &amp; the third time repeting the same, till ye com to <hi>ee, la.</hi> which is the last, but all these Kayes ar not signed or set in these Psalmes: but onely ii. or three most commonly <hi>c,</hi> or <hi>e,</hi> or <hi>b. C,</hi> hath this form or signe, {C-clef} <hi>E,</hi> is signed after this maner {F-clef} <hi>B,</hi> hath thus, ▪ or thus sharpe. ♯</p>
   <p>The kayes of this Scale or Table, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided and set forth by thre diuers orders of letters. From <hi>gamma vt,</hi> to <hi>G, sol, re, vt,,</hi> ar sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with capitall letters, &amp; are called graue base, or capitall kayes: From <hi>G, sol, re, vt:</hi> to <hi>G, sol, re, vt,</hi> they are wrytten with small let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and are called meane or small kayes: And from <hi>g, sol, re, vt,</hi> to <hi>ee, la,</hi> they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with double letters, and are called dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kaies, and treble kaies.</p>
   <p>When it chaunceth ii. kaies to be of one letter, as <hi>G sol, re, vt:</hi> and <hi>g, sol, re, vt, A, la, mi, re</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
and, <hi>a, la, mi, re, E, fa, vt:</hi> and <hi>f, fa, vt: E, la, mi,</hi> &amp; <hi>e, la, mi,</hi> ye may (to put difference and distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiō betwene them) call the one, capitall <hi>G,</hi> or <hi>G, sol, re, vt,</hi> the lower: and tother small g, or g, sol, re, vt: the higher, and so of others.</p>
   <p>They are called kayes, because they opē, as it were the doore, and make awaye into song: for by the sight and place of the kaye, ye shall know easelye the whole songe, the nature of euery Note, in what kaie or place it standeth, and how ye shall name it. ye see also in the table, that some of the kayes be set in lines or rules, and other are set in spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwene the lines: as <hi>gamma, vt,</hi> is set in rule: <hi>a, re,</hi> in space:: <hi>b, mi,</hi> in rule. <hi>c, fa vt:</hi> in space <hi>d, sol, re,</hi> in rule, and so ascending to the ende: so also in the songs of your Boke, ye se rules and spaces: so that euery rule &amp; space in your boke, answereth to some one rule or space of your table or scale: and taketh the name of the same, whiche ye may easely fynde oute, eyther by ascending or descending from the kaye set and marked in your song.</p>
   <p>Moreouer it is to be noted, that there are vi. voyces, or Notes, signified and expressed by these vi. sillables: <hi>vt: re mi, fa, sol, la,</hi> by whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che through repetition of them, may be sōg


<pb facs="6"/>
al songes of what compasse so euer they be, which vi. notes, ye must learn to tune aptely of some one that can already sing, or by som Instrument of musike, as the Uirginals, or some other suche like, Which thing wel lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, ye shal nede none other teaching of any</p>
   <p>And for a plainer learning therof, I haue set before your eyes, those vi. notes ascēding and descending: and again with a litle vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie from theyr naturall order, to the end ye may attayne to the iust tunes of them, how so euer they be placed. For these two exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples well had, and tuned a righte, all other songes and Psalmes, with little vse and a small labour will sone be attayned vnto <gap reason="music">
         <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
      </gap>
   </p>
   <p>Firste ye muste diligently searche out, in what kaie euery note of your song stōdeth: Which ye may easely do, in beholding your signed kaie (cōmōly called the cleaue) which is set in the beginning of euery song: &amp; that lyne or, space wherin the signed kaie is set, beareth the name of the same kaie: and all Notes standinge in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> line or space, are saide


<pb facs="7"/>
to stand in that kaie: and so ascending or des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cēding from that kaie, ye shall straight way see wherin, or in what kaie euery Note of your song standeth. As in this present exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. if ye will know wherin your first Note standeth, consider youre kaie, signed &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with this letter <hi>C.</hi> in the second rule (and because it standeth in rule, ye finde, by youre Table that it is <hi>C, sol, fa, vt:</hi> For thother two <hi>c, c,</hi> whiche are, <hi>c, fa, vt:</hi> and, <hi>cc, sol fa:</hi> stande in space) wherfore that seconde lyne through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, is called, <hi>c, sol, fa, vt,</hi> and all the notes pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that line, are counted to stand in <hi>c, sol, fa, vt:</hi> Then discend frō that kaie to the next space, which (as your table telleth you) is <hi>b, fa, ♯, mi.</hi> from thence to the next rule, whiche is <hi>a, la, mi, re,</hi> &amp; from thence to the nexte space wherin your first Note standeth, which is <hi>G, sol, re vt:</hi> so finde ye by descending in order beginning at youre signed kaye, after thys sorte: <hi>c, sol, fa, vt,: b, fa, ♯, mi: a, la, mi, re: G, sol, re, vt:</hi> ye find that your first note standeth in <hi>G, sol, re, vt:</hi> wherfore ye may sing it by anye of these iii. Notes <hi>sol, re,</hi> or <hi>vt:</hi> But because this note <hi>vt,</hi> in this place is most aptest to ascend withall: ye shall call it <hi>vt:</hi> by the same triall ye shal find that your second Note standeth


<pb facs="7"/>
in <hi>a, la, mi, re,</hi> ye shall expresse in singing by this voice <hi>re,</hi> rather then by <hi>la,</hi> or <hi>mi,</hi> because <hi>re,</hi> is in order next aboue <hi>vt,</hi> so shall ye finde the thirde Note to stand in <hi>b, fa, ♯, mi,</hi> which ye shall expresse by <hi>mi,</hi> The fourth standeth in the signed kaie or cleaue, wherfore it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in <hi>c, sol, fa, vt,</hi> whiche ye must expresse by <hi>fa.</hi> The fift in <hi>d, la, sol, re:</hi> and is to be expressed by <hi>sol.</hi> The sixt and highest Note, ye shall by ascending from your keie, finde to stande in <hi>e, la, mi:</hi> and is to be expressed in voice by <hi>la,</hi> so haue youthe whole compasse of your sōg▪ and as in order of notes, and sound of voice, ye ascendid, so contrarie wise; ye must defcēd till ye come to the last Note of your song.</p>
   <p>Here note that when <hi>b, fa, ♯, mi,</hi> is formed and sighed in this maner, with this letter <hi>b,</hi> whiche is called <hi>b,</hi> flat, it must be expressed with this voice or note, <hi>fa,</hi> but if it be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and signed with this forme ♯, whiche is called <hi>b,</hi> sharpe: or if it haue no signe at all, then must ye expres it in singing with thys voyce or Note. <hi>mi.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Like wise may ye practise; placing youre first Note <hi>vt,</hi> in anye other kaye, wherin ye finde <hi>vt,</hi> whiche are. vii. <hi>Gāma, vt, C, fa, vt: E; fa vt,</hi> graue: <hi>G, sol, re, vt,</hi> graue: <hi>c, sol, fa, vt: E, fa, vt,</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
sharpe: <hi>g, sol, re, vt,</hi> sharpe, ascending vp to <hi>la,</hi> and descending as in your former example. These vii. seuerall ascensions and descensy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon diuers groundes or cleues, are cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye called of writers vii. deductions, whiche ye may playnlye and distinctlye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde in your table, or Scale.</p>
   <p>One example more haue I set, wherin ye sing <hi>fa,</hi> in <hi>b, fa, ♯, mi.</hi> Whose deductions begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in <hi>vt:</hi> placed in, <hi>E, fa, vt,</hi> graue or capital as ye see. <gap reason="music">
         <desc>〈♫〉</desc>

   <p>Ye haue also in youre songes diuers four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and figures of Notes. Of which all, it behoueth you to knowe bothe the names and value.</p>
   <p>Diuers forms of Notes. <gap reason="music">
         <desc>〈♫〉</desc>

   <p>The firste of these is cassed a Large: the secōd a Long. The third a Brief the fourth a Semibrief: the fift a Minime: the sixt a Crochet: The seuenth and laste a Quauer. The first is worth in value two of the seconde, that is, two Longes: and one


<pb facs="8"/>

   <p>The first which is drawen from the firste line to the iii. is called a longe Rest: &amp; signifyeth that ye must pause while that a longe is song, whiche is worthe iiii. plaine song Notes, or foure Semibreues. The second which is from one lyne to a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is called a Breue rest, &amp; requireth the pauling of a breue or of ii. semibreues.
