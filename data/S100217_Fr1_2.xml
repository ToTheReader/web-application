   <head>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Arious are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts and Judgements of Men: Nature teacheth each to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his Owne; Hence it is, that the number of Bookes multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, insomuch, that, according to the Wise-man; <hi>Thereof, is no end.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>To expect new Matter, were to give the old Proverb the Lie; <hi>Nihil jam dictum, &amp;c.</hi> It's enough, if what was before, be now so changed by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb facs="3"/>
and Application, that it shewes as new, and becomes more ready for Ʋse. Habit and Apparell alter the Shape, sometimes the Conditions of Men. An old Theame in a new dresse inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously contrived makes the Composer an Author. Why then should this Booke blush to shew it selfe? or doubt to bee servant to the Printer, whose Master neverthelesse it is?</p>
   <p>To give it as absolute, or free from faults, were to make it more then the Worke of Man, whose incident is Error: Such as it hath, are rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall then originall, and may bee fairly excused; Not to insist, That the Author's dead, That it was long since collected, Alteration of some Cases by Moderne Statutes, Or this the first Impression. Goodnesse is the Parent of Confidence; The Act is crowned by
<pb facs="3"/>
the End, which was this, A publique Advantage and peculiar Service to that <hi>Sexe</hi> generally beloved, and by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had in venerable estimation. To implore their Patronage, and prevaile, were to guard this <hi>Booke</hi> beyond Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. The strong neither needs nor desires a Champion; Meeknes protects it selfe: What here you finde reall and perfect, therefore accept; It will subsist; Remit the rest, the rather for that nor the <hi>Tract,</hi> nor <hi>This</hi> is peremptory, But onely proposed for your favorable sense and Approbation.</p>
