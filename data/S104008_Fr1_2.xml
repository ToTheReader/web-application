   <p>YOVR LORDSHIPS GRACIOVS ACCEP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of my former Booke, intituled <hi>The Principles of the
Art militarie,</hi> hath giuen mee encouragement, to annex a
second addition to it, in the Practick of the famous seige, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in of <hi>Breda</hi> this yeere, by his Highnesse the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> our
Generall. <hi>Marquesse Spinola</hi> of famous memorie, one of the best
Generals that euer his Maiestie the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> had, in his Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landish
warres blockt it vp in the yeeres 1624, and 1625 eleuen
months, and odd daies, and had his <hi>Herman Hugo</hi> a Jesuite, who in
commendations of the Marquesse, wrot a relation of some memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
actions touching this seige to posteritie and did it well.</p>
   <p>It is now my turne (according to my weake ability) to writ some
thing also to succeeding ages, in the honour and memoriall of his
Highnesse the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> and those chiefe Commanders,
Gentlemen, and Souldiers vnder his Commaund, that were at the
seige this yeare, and I hope truely without giving offence to any man:
Heere your honour shall see, the difference betweene a Towne
blocked vp, which is a languishing death, and a Towne brauely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seiged,
&amp; taken in by Approaches, which in a Souldiers opinion, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb facs="3"/>
more honorable. Againe, if your Lordship compare the
times of the one, and of the other Generall together, you shall finde
that there was neuer Towne so strongly fortified, hauing 3000 able
men to defend it, regained in so short a time, to wit, in 50 daies,
from the 18 of August, (namely the night, that wee first brak ground
against this towne) till the sixth of October following, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
cald for a parley, your Honor may see the admirable expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(notwithstanding all opposition within and without to relieue it)
his hignesse made which the oldest souldiers in these Warres haue not
seene the like. This breife relation then craues that vnder your
Lo: gracious patronage, it may finde fauour to come out in English
to the view of the world, &amp; to giue satisfaction to some of our owne
nation, that were at this seige, which if it be acceptable to your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
as my former was, then I am bound in a double Obligation to
pray vnto the Almighty, to blesse your noble family with much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of honour in this world, and to crowne you with eternall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in the next, resting.</p>
