   <head>THE PREFACE to the Readers.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F neyther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of elder age, nor present authoritie of Scripture were, to put vs in minde of the sleyghtes of Sathan, howe he continuallie doth bend his force, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the forte of our afflicted soules: yet y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> subtile conspiracies of these yonger dayes, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> practise of the Papist, that Martials now the Diuels hoste, and marcheth forward with a forged Ensigne, appearing outwardly to be the frend of Christ, whose fayth &amp; religion he vtterly subuerteth, may serue as a warning piece out of the watch tower, to make vs runne to the walles of fayth, betaking our selues eche man to his defence, in the certaine truth of Gods eternal testamēt. For if the groundwork be shaken once, whervpon we builde our health and saluation (which is the affiaunce in Christ our God, and credite to his worde) then enters our ennimy with banner displayed, and beateth vs downe to the pit of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherefore he séeking to supplant Christ, and pul our hearts from seruice of him: cōpasseth by al meanes to winne him selfe some credite with vs: and the knowledge of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in his worde, by a little and a little to be taken frō vs. But he hath of him selfe to ill a name to be estéemed so: and therefore vnder viser of that that he is not, he winnes men to yelde to that that they should not. He becommeth therefore in all his workes an Ape of God, to imitate and resemble af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="8"/> his hellish maner, to the vtter ouerthrowe and destruction of our soules, that which our heauenly father hath prouided for our health, saluation and blysse. Herein hath he handled himself so workmanly, that he lokes very narrowly that can discerne the difference. Yea the eyes of his heart must be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cleared, than by the light of reason, or else he shal be blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the myst. We sée that euen from the beginning, after Gods spirit had moued Abell, and the holy Patriarks, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer sacrifice vnto him, that should be figures all of that one sacrifice, which Christ according to the prefixed pleasure of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> eterne Deitie, should at his time on the Crosse perfourme: The Diuel in worshipping of his Idols did come so néere the same, that the self same did séeme to be doone in both. Yea ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in all the superstitions and detestable rytes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then folke, he toke his paterne out of the ordinaunce of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes and maners of the Christians. Which thing Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulian among the Latin writers the most auncient and chiefe right well declareth:<note place="margin">De Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tionibus ad uers. Heret.</note>
      <hi>Ipsas quo{que} res Sacramentorum diuinorum in Idolorum mysterijs emulatur. &amp;c.</hi> Yea the very matter and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the diuine Sacraments he counterfeyts in his Idol seruice. He hath his baptisme whereby such as do beleue in him, haue forgiuenesse promised them: He marketh his men with signes in the forehead: he hath his offrings, his sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, his virgins, and his votaries. That if we loke on the supersticiōs of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the badges, the priuileges, the offices of his priestes, the vessels, the ceremonies, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of his sacrifices, we shal sée how the Diuell <hi>Morositatem illam,</hi> as Tertullian termeth it, <hi>Iudeae gentis imitatus est:</hi> did imitate y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fansies and selfe wilnesse of the Iewes. As Moses went vp into the mount Syna and there receyued the Law tables, whereof the author God him self should be: So <hi>Minos</hi> afterward among the Grecians hyding him selfe a while, in Iupiters caue, came forth at length, and gaue them lawes, from mighty Ioue, as he pretended. And to the ende, the
<pb n="2" facs="8"/> people might the more be bounde in obedience, the lyke practise had the Romaine King, of whom I spake before, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: that in the night time he had secrete conference with <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geria,</hi> and she deliuered him such holesome lawes as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Gods had decréed on. Whereby what other thing was attempted of the Diuell, but that all credite should be denied to Moses, in asmuch as <hi>Minos</hi> and <hi>Numa</hi> to, did alleage the like authoritie for themselues, &amp; yet it was euident they were but fables. Will ye go to the circūstances of place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? Then as God ordayned his seruice to be had first in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> tabernacle, then in the temple at Hierusalem, so would the Diuell haue his hilles and groues. As God did raise vp his holy men and Prophetes, that being inspired with the holy Ghost might declare his will, and by force of miracles winne the more credite: So hath the Diuell his coniurers, his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, his figure flingers and his sorcerers, with the spirite of illusion to worke straunge effectes. As we haue a place of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall rest, so haue they their heauen. <hi>Elisios campos et amaena vireta fortunatorum nemorum,</hi> the swéete pleasant Paradise and places of good hap: As we haue hell: euen so haue they: that if we preach the blessednesse of the faythful by the merits and mercies of Christ our Sauiour, then step the godlesse out, &amp; take it as a tale of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Poets Paradise. If we threaten venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the misbeleuers, and extreme torment of hell fier, the Diuels limmes laugh vs to scorne againe, and doe resemble it to Plato his Purgatorie, or to the scalding of <hi>Pyriphlegeton,</hi> a riuer so deuised by the heathen folke, to burne in hell wyth flames vnquenchable. Such sleights hath Sathan to put vs in securitie of any further payne: to pull vs from the hope of perfecter estate, that here we may liue, as the Diuell would haue vs: in the ende to receiue as the Diuel can rewarde vs. And he hath not wanted his instrumentes of olde. He hath made himself ministers from time to time, that in the worlds eye were most worthy reuerence, and likelier than the rest to
<pb facs="9"/> compasse his desire. Among them all to the Diuels behoofe neuer so faythfull seruaunts, to the destruction of the people neuer so pestilent instruments, as the Papists are: for what haue they not done, to the vtter subuersion of al true religiō? As Christ cōmaunded the beleuers in his name to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: So they in the Diuels name haue baptised Bels, with the same ceremonies &amp; solēnities, that they would vse in Infants christening: saue that the Diuel would haue in his sacramēt, a certaine more Maiesty, than God in his. Therfore the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes by the spirite of the Diuel, ordained that a byshop must needes christen a Bell, where as euery poore priest may christē a childe. And bycause that through water consecrated by the word of God, sinnes are remitted, not by the force of water, but power of the spirit: therefore the Diuell would haue his consecration of water and of salt,<note place="margin">De Consecr. Dist. <hi>3.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>qua cuncti sanctificentur ac pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificentur aspersi:</hi> as it is written in the Popes decrées, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer are sprinkled therewith, are by and by sanctified, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, made cleane and holy: go no further than to their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses, and you shal sée how they approue it. <hi>Aqua benedicta, deleantur tua delicta. Aqua benedicta, sit tibi salus &amp; vita. <hi>By the holy vvater so, be thy offences put the fro. Let the holy vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be, saluation and life to thee.</hi>
      </hi> These words were in their daily seruice. But O blasphemous mouthes to attribute that to their inuentions, which is the work of God alone, the price of the bloud of Christ our sauiour. Yet wil they haue as their father had, when he came forth with <hi>Scriptum est,</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for them: applied I promise you, to as good a purpose, as when the Witch by hir <hi>Pater noster</hi> made hir payle goe a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. For why should I not compare the Priests, (that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate Crosses and ashes, water and salte, oyle and creame, bowes and bones, stockes and stones, that christen bels that hang in the stéeple, that coniure wormes that créepe in the fielde, that giue S. Iohns gospels to hang about mens nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes) to the vilest Witches and Sorcerers of the earth. Eche
<pb n="3" facs="9"/> Prince hath his people: &amp; deliuereth his lawes to be obserued of them: which if they kepe, they shew they are his. And God (that his seruants might be knowen to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world, by walking according to his wil) ordayned some works, wherin he would haue vs to exercise our selues: As y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> feare, the faith, the loue to Godwarde, the repentance of our euils, the profession of the Gospel, the furtherance of the same, praier, thankesgiuing, &amp; praise of God, pacience, perseuerance, iustice, charity, and such other like. What doth the diuell now? To seale his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants into league with him, he deuiseth ordinaunces to make thē to be knowen by: As, strange attire, difference of meates, refusal of mariage, rising at midnight, shutting vp in a cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, erecting of Images, worshipping of saincts, seruice in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, gadding on Pilgrimage, making of vowes, most wilful beggery, most vile hipocrisy. Hereby the simple haue bene so deluded, that they thought gods seruice to consist herein: and so, the diuel for God was honored. Hereby the diuels children haue so magnified themselues, that (Gods law neglected) their beastly fansies haue ben had in reuerence. For prouse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, go no further than to this. Sole life is not by God cōmaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: The diuel doth exact it in his ministers.<note place="margin">Genes. 26. Exod. 20. 1. Cor. 6. Heb. 13</note> Adultry is by god condemned: The diuell in his ministers makes a trifle of it. That filthy vice which by the testimony of the Apostle Paule doth quite exclude vs from y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> kingdome of heauen, they make but a game of, or a sinne <hi>veniall.</hi> If ye credit me not, read the the decrée, of Alexander the .iij. of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> name:<note place="margin">Cap. At si Clerici. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragra. de Adult.</note> there he affirmeth that as for adultery &amp; such other faults, which he accompteth by expresse word, <hi>crimina leuiora,</hi> trifling offences, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bishop may dispēse with. And yet some good fellowes, wil say y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we preach liberty. We, or y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Papists? Iudge ye.<note place="margin">Dist. <hi>24.</hi> cap. Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis</note>
      <hi>Pelagi{us}</hi> the Pope as we read in a certain decretal of his (&amp; when I speake of decrees &amp; decretals, think y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I speake of no other matter, than y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> papists haue in as souerain a price as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bible) giues a worthy cēsure in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> like case. A man y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> had ben maried, wold nedes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> decease of his wife become a priest: &amp; sued for his orders.
<pb facs="10"/> The Prelates fell of examining the matter whether he were <hi>Bigamus</hi> or no: that is to say, whether his wife was a maid when he maried hir, or whether he himselfe had maried a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond wyfe. For if eyther of these had bene found in hym, he had bene vnméete to enter into orders. But found he was to be an adulterer, who after his wiues death, had a childe by an other woman. Nowe what sayth the holy father. <hi>In as much as he is not found to be Bigamus, but yet proued incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, vve hope vvel of him: let him haue his orders. As for his lechery, vve beare vvith him, in respect of the vveak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this our age.</hi> Sée the religion of Poperie. If it had bene his hap to haue maried a wydowe, or the second time to haue entred into y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy state of matrimonie, this man shuld haue had no orders: Nowe that he is become a whorema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he hath them. Here cōmes in place, the famous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēt of him that makes the gloze, not in mockery, but in good earnest. <hi>Ecce casus, vbi plus valet Luxuria quam Castitas</hi> Beholde a case, where Incontinence hath a more priuilege, than Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie. Thus I suppose ye sée how the Diuel doth aduaunce his workes, and by the ministerie of the Papists set vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in place of God. Nowe that his religion should in all points, to the worldes eye, be as perfect as Gods, and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> men should not want helpes ynowe to hel: As God appointed the prayers vnto him to be made through Christ our mediatour: So when the Diuell will be serued best, he deputeth sainctes to be intercessors, and euery one of them hath his charge ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. One to deliuer vs from the feuer Quartane, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to preserue vs from the daunger of the sea. One to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the goods that we haue lost, another to defēde our foldes from the Fox. One for the plague, another for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> purse. One for our selues, another for our swyne. And is not this mere Gentilitie? Yet is it right Poperie. As they had <hi>Iuno</hi> for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mē in childbed, so we y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> blessed virgin in hir place with vs. As they had <hi>Esculapius</hi> to saue them from diseases: so had we S.
<pb n="4" facs="10"/> Roke to supply that rome. As they had <hi>Mars</hi> to help them in warfare: so had we S. George to make vs win the fielde. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, least there should want any thing to please the wanton world: As God of his mercy did make man, after the image and likenesse of himselfe: so the Diuel hath put in the minde of man, to make Images after the likenesse of God, and so to transferre his honor vnto creatures. The blockish Images, the dead crosses, haue bene crept to, bene worshipped. The liuely Images of Christ himselfe, haue bene brought to the crosse, and burned cruelly. May I not therefore wyth Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Apostles successor say. <hi>Quis est iste honor dei, per lapide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as &amp; ligneas formas discurrere, at{que} exanimes figuras venerari,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Recog. li. <hi>5.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>&amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem in quo vera Dei Imago est spernere?</hi> What honor of God is this, to runne about the counterfets of tymber and of stone, &amp; to worship the shapes that are without soule, and despise mā, in whome the true shape of God is? Yet haue we oftē heard and sometime to our griefe haue séene, that for the quarrell of stocks and stones, many learned men haue lost their liues: and where the learned and godly bookes, contayning Gods vndoubted worde, haue bene torne in pieces and despitefully burned: these Lay mennes bookes haue with no griefe at al bene suffered to stand, but for the pulling downe haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the death and destruction of many. Thus for the Idol sake the true Image of Christ hath bene defaced, and painted Images bene suffered to the abuse: the thing taken from vs that should teach vs the right vse. It is not vnknowen to all the world, with what crueltie &amp; rage, Sathan hath vpholden &amp; maintayned his deuise, by executing of thousands, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of an Image: But for the contempt of God and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of his saincts, what conscience was there euer in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piste? When the people of Antioch,<note place="margin">Theodoret. lib. <hi>5.</hi> Cap. <hi>19.</hi> &amp;. <hi>20.</hi>
      </note> had in despite pulled downe the brasen Image of Theodosius his wife, (who then was Emperour) for this their outrage and disobedience, they were threatned (as they well deserued) to lose their liberties, &amp;
<pb facs="11"/> be committed to the sword. But when the men of warre ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched, a silly man whose name was <hi>Macedonius,</hi> deuoid of learning &amp; great skyll, but vertuous otherwise, did stay their rage with this kinde of oration. <hi>Tel the Emperor (my frends) that he is not only an Emperor, but a man to: Therefore he ought not onely to respecte his Empire and rule, but also his ovvne condition and nature. For vvheras he is a man, he hath subiectes of the like estate vvith himselfe: and the nature of man, is made after the Image and likenesse of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ought not so cruelly &amp; outragiously to slay the image of god, least the maker of that image shuld be incensed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to vvrath. He should rather consider that this extremitie is vsed only for an image of brasse: and none there is, vnlesse he be mad, but can tel the difference betvvene a dead &amp; sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thing, and that vvhich hath both life and soule. Let him also remēber this, that it is easy for vs, for one Image of brasse to restore many. But he for al his povver, is not able to make one heare of them that shal be destroyed for it.</hi> With reporte hereof, the good Emperor was quieted, &amp; in steade of crueltie extended curtesie. But since Idolatrie hath taken roote, howe many thousand christians haue without redēption bene bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and hanged, only for disprouing y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> abuse of Imagry? And with them that be wedded to their owne wills, yet to this day a greater fault it is, to speake against an Image of any kinde of metall, than doing of a trespasse against the maiestie of God. And therefore we sée that pictures and Images which partly of Gentilitie, partly of a blinde and foolish zeale, were receiued at the first to be signes of good wil, &amp; prouocations to vertue, haue bene in processe, the destruction of Religion, and maintenance of grosse Idolatrie. I omit y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> offence and cause of stumbling vnto the weake,<note place="margin">Deut. 20. Leuit. 19. Math. 18.</note> which in the scripture is oft ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed. <hi>Iustinus</hi> in his boke <hi>de Monarchia,</hi> sheweth how mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes nature had vnderstanding at the first graunted, to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> end that the trueth might be learned of them, &amp; the true worship
<pb n="5" facs="11"/> of the one God, the only maker and Lord of all. But the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels malice craftely came in place, and caused men to forget their owne estate, and the maisty of God, for their owne ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. Which thing, experiēce it self hath taught vs, that the flesh deliting in hir owne deuises, hath made vs prone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue al other faults, to supersticion &amp; wicked worshippings. Esay sayth,<note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note>
      <hi>Their land vvas full of Idols and they vvorship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the vvorke of their ovvne handes.</hi> Wherin, the order of words is to be noted, howe first the Prophet doth name the matter, be it siluer or golde: then afterward he cōmes to the vse, which consequently alwayes doth follow. For it cā not be chosen, but with the Idol must go the abuse: as of the fier if ye lay on wood, ariseth flame. Nor onely in our dayes this vile corruption hath had the vpper hand, but by the same deceitful traine, euer frō the beginning, Sathan hath inuegled y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> harts of the simple. Ezechiell affirmeth,<note place="margin">Cap. 20.</note> that when the Israelites were yet in Egipt, they had rebelled against y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lord, they had not cast away the abhominations of their eyes, nor yet forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Idols of the countrey: wherefore God intending to weane them from the breast of fornicatiō, to leaue the sucking of such dregs of Idolatry, for this only respect, deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them most parte of his ceremonies. Yet all they were not able to kepe them within the compasse of Gods true seruice, but that they would fall to their owne inuentions. We sée how they forced Aaron,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> afore his brother Moses could descēd from the mount, to make them a golden Calfe, to fal downe &amp; do worship to it. We sée how when they were in the land of promise, vnder their Iudges &amp; their Kings, they went a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding after their Idols. We sée that after y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> zelous kings Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias &amp; Iosias had reformed religion,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 21. &amp; .23.</note> y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> people were so prone to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> cōtrary, that immediatly vpō their deceasse, they returned again to their old vomit. Yea when y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ten tribes were brought to captiuity, for seruing God otherwise than he would, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> tribe of Iuda, was not by this their brethrens plague amended:
<pb facs="12"/> nor when they were brought vnder yoke themselues, they cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered any whit the cause of their distresse, which was y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of their Lord and God. For being in Babilon, they went as nere as they could to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> rytes of Gentilitie: &amp; restored agayne vnto the land of promise, vnder Antiochus they fell agayne. Such is the violent persuasion of error, such is the force of supersticion, that assone as euer occasiō is ministred, our corrupt nature enclineth to it. Wherof we néede to fetch no further proufe, than our owne dayes. That Idol of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester Stephen Gardyner, subscribed in king Edwardes raigne agaynst the vse of Images, comparing them to a chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des booke, that ought to be taken from him if he onely delited in the golden couer: Yet in Quéene Maries dayes, he forgat himselfe, and commaunded them euery where to be erected. For .xiiij. yeare together, as by good depositiōs it is to be séene, he preached against the Popes supremacie, vehemently, py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, earnestly, very earnestly, forwardly: but as sone as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer oportunitie serued him, he brought (in the Diuels name) the Idol in agayne. What shall I speake of mens priuate doings? generally we heard in our Iosias raigne, when he had pulled downe the hie places, that our affections had bene layd to lowe, that we had bene deceiued. And as for Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, pardons, and suche ydle toyes, who would defende them? who would not confesse, that they had bene abused by them? yet in that terrible Interraigne of Antichrist, a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage in Wales was straight erected. Faire fruite follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. Much resort vnto it: &amp; neuer any of the learned fathers opened once his mouth against it. Such is the trust to men: So ready and apt we are, to followe (as the Prophet sayth, &amp; as I did alleage before) the abhominations of our owne eies, attempering Gods seruice vnto our outward senses.

For where as other liuing creatures, in that they haue not receiued wit and reason, bende groueling to the grounde, but we haue an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right state, a countenaunce aloft, from God our maker giuē vs: it appeareth that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> religion, and seruice of God accordeth not vnto mens reason, which bends and bowes the heauenly creature, to worship, to knéele, to knocke to the earthly.

Afterward they crept into the Church, by a zeale not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as by <hi>Paulinus</hi> at <hi>Nola:</hi> yet nothing lesse was meant, than worship of them.

Yet if we had not séene that effect follow, which in dede we haue, to lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, to the desperate destruction of many christen soules, we might notwithstanding iustly condemne the whole faithlesse and fond inuention.

      </note> and that doth <hi>Eusebius</hi> proue. For he repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that he sawe in the City of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> a certayne Image.

Nowe come to the iudgement of the ecclesiasticall writer on it. <hi>Nec mirum videri debet, eos qui ex gentibus olim a serua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore nostro curati sunt, ista fecisse: quando et Apostolorum illius ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, Pauli videlicet et Petri, dem{que} et ipsius Christi, in tabulis colori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus depictas asseruari vidimus: quod veteres ex gentili consuetudine, eos quos seruatores putarunt, ad hunc modum honorare soliti fuerint.</hi> that is to say. Nor it ought to séeme any maruel, that they which from among the Gentiles were cured of our Sauiour, did these things: where as we haue séene the pictures of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, of Paule and Peter, of Christ himselfe, reserued in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, set forth with coloures, bycause men of olde time (by custome that came from the Gentiles) were wonte to honour on this sorte them, that they thought to be the helpers and preseruers of them. In which wordes .ij. things are especially to be obserued. First that erecting of Images came frō Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganisme, when such as were newly conuerted to the christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, could not clearly be weaned from all their Gentilitie: no more than we returning from popery, can willingly leaue the rags of Rome. And surely many things might be borne withall in them, which being farre stepte in yeares, came at length to the truth, and hardly forsoke that, that all their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues they had bene inured to. And therfore as in Paganisme they made Images of them that had well deserued: so in Christianitie, they did the like obseruaunce to Christ and his Apostles. Furthermore by the testimony of <hi>Eusebius</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
<pb n="8" facs="14"/> that in his time (which was thrée hundred and .xxv. yeare after Christ,) neyther Images nor pictures, nor any such counterfets, were brought into the Churches: nor yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued of all Christians, (for he made a wonder and straunge sight, of that that he there saw) but onely priuately some toke it vp: not for religion, not for Gods seruice, but for a wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their owne good wils: as we in our houses haue the pictures of them whome we holde dearest, and doe loue beste. The first that euer we do reade of, to haue brought in Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry into the Church, was <hi>Pontius Paulinus</hi> a byshop of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> which liued in the raigne of <hi>Theodosius</hi> &amp; <hi>Martian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, foure hundred and thrée score yeare after Christ. The occasion of his inconsiderate zeale was this. The people were accustomed euery yeare once, to celebrate the feaste of <hi>Faelix</hi> the martir: and in the church to banquet &amp; make good chéere. The byshop seing some abuse therein, to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> end he might kepe them from surfetting and riot, caused the walles of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be painted with stories, taken out of the olde testament: that they beholding and considering the pictures, might giue themselues the more to temperance and sobrietie. About the same time, <hi>Prudentius</hi> reporteth, how he saw paynted &amp; por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed in the Church, the historie of S. Cassian. Thus Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry came from priuate houses, to publique places: frō payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting also, to embossing: yet neyther priuately nor openly, paynted or embossed, we reade that they were honored: Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it was about six hundreth yeare after Christ, when through barbaritie, of Gothes and Vandales (which burst into Italy, spoyled all places, and burned libraries) vertue decayed, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning went to wreck, Religion was little séene vnto: Then by commen ignoraunce of Gods worde, negligence of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and vnruly raigne of barbarous aliens, Images were not onely set vp, but began to be worshipped. Therfore <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus</hi> byshop of Massile the head towne of <hi>Gallia Narbonen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> now called the Prouince, séeing the people by occasion of
<pb facs="15"/> Images, fal to Idolatry, brake al that were in that City, to pieces: were they either of Christ, or of his saincts. And was therfore cōplained vpon, to Gregory y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first of that name then byshop of Rome. And as this was y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> first learned byshop, that did allow the open hauing of Images in Churches: so vpon him, doe all image worshippers at this day ground their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.<note place="margin">Epist. libr <hi>7</hi> Indict. <hi>2.</hi> Cap. <hi>109.</hi>
      </note> He reproued <hi>Serenus,</hi> for breaking downe of them: he cōmended the hauing of them, but the worshipping of them, he vtterly condemned. He would not haue had it to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, which was set vp not to be worshipped, but onely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the mindes of the ignorant. He would haue had y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sight of the Storie, but the seruice and honor to the thing that was séene, he willed by all meanes to be auoyded. How wel this doctrine toke place afterward, how sone the thing wherein he minded best, came to wickedest ende, the horrible mischieues that in the East &amp; Weast Churches insued, are a lamētable example to vs. For although the Images taught not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but blinded them in dede: though contrary to Gregories determinatiō, they were abused to most damnable Idolatry: yet haue they had, and yet haue, their defenders, yea wyth such zeale, such earnest affection this quarell of Images hath bene maintayned,<note place="margin">Fruites of Images.</note> that it bred a schisme betwene the East &amp; the Weast Churches: that it engendred hatred betwene one christian and another: set Counsel against counsel: Church against Church: Prince against Prince. Hence rose rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, treasons, vnnaturall and cruell murders: the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter digging vppe, and burning hir father the Emperor his bones: the mother murdering hir own sonne, being an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. At the last the tearing in sunder of Christendome and the Empire, into two pieces: till the Infidels, the Turkes, (the common enimies to both partes) haue most cruelly van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished, destroyed and subdued, the one whole parte, all the Empire of Grece: and haue wonne a great piece of the other Empire, and put all Christendome in most dreadfull feare &amp;
<pb n="9" facs="15"/> horrible daunger. Al which matters are in the discourse more at large opened. Gregory therefore, if he had liued but a while longer, &amp; séene the least parte of al the miseries, which all the worlde hath felt since, onely for maintenance of those Mammots: he would, and well might haue cursed himselfe, for leauing behinde him so leude a President. But by the way, to prosecute a little the two poyntes of Gregories de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. First, that they teach not according to his wil: then, that they be worshipped contrary to his wil: If any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction might be taken of them, and there were no peril an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them, God that omitted nothing, necessary for our saluation and comforte, would not so earnestly in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue forbidden them. I referre you to the places them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, most manifest in that behalf, to many to be rehearsed.

Yet seking it is not, but rather forsaking: whatsoeuer pretext, or good intent go with it.<note place="margin">Iud. 17.</note> Michah when he had stolne the .xj.C.

His mother was glad, and as the story wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, did dedicate straight the syluer for hir sonne: not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny idoll, but to God himself, &amp; made an image of it. Whē this was don, Michah set it vp in his own house, builded a chapel, made an altare, prepared furniture, appointed seruice for it,
<pb facs="16"/> the <hi>Ephod,</hi> the <hi>Teraphin,</hi> the Albe, &amp; the Vestement, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite of Bethlehem, the Priest deputed for it.

But I know that by the names of <hi>Ephod</hi> &amp; <hi>Teraphin,</hi> all superstitious attire is signified. Thus they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to serue God with an Image. Thus theft gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of superstitions. Thus Idols brought in Oratories, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels and altares, sacrifices, vestementes and suche lyke, which al be vtterly condemned of the Lord.

      <note place="margin">Deut. 12.</note>
      <hi>vvhich semeth good in his ovvn eyes.</hi> Wherfore in the same chapter a certaine place is prescribed, where Gods seruice should be. And afterward to the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, first the tabernacle &amp; the one onely altare, then the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it selfe was builded by Salomon. Nor the temple was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reared, than a certaine &amp; due forme of Gods seruice was appoynted: from which if the people any deale swarued, it was holden fornication. And the Prophetes cryed out: <hi>Dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquistis dominum &amp; seruijstis Dijs alienis.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iere. 2.5.11.13.</note> Ye haue forsaken the Lord and serued strange Gods. This as Michah did for deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Ieroboam afterward did for policy. For when y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Israell was pityfully diuided, by the worke of God, for Idolatry sake: and that onely the tribe of Iuda, with a fewe of the Beniamites, cleaued to the house of Dauid: the rest of the ten tribes followed this wicked tirant. He, fearing greatly least by the doctrine of the Leuits, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> kingdome might growe agayne into one body, if the people according to their auncient order, went vp to Hierusalem to serue God: to the ende he might estraunge the people both from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and discipline of the lawe, partly for feare, partly for am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, instituted a newe religion, different from that which they had receyued: another than that which God appoynted.
<pb n="10" facs="16"/> Wherefore he made them two golden Calues,<note place="margin">1.

He bringeth forth Images. He doth not vse any new sacrifice or solemnities vnto them. But as the Israelites in the wildernesse cryed to their one Calfe. <hi>These are thy Gods O Israell,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note>
      <hi>that brought thee out of the land of Egipt,</hi> So doe they now cry out to their two Calues, <hi>These are thy Gods O Israell, that brought thee out of the land of Egipt.</hi> But as they before were not so diuelishe and beastly, to think that Aarons Calfe, deliuered them frō Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao his bondage (for Aaron himself at that time sayde, <hi>Festum domini cras est,</hi> To morrowe is the feaste of the Lorde, not the feaste of the Calfe or of the Oxe) so nowe Ieroboam taught not, the people beléeued not, that those molten thinges were Gods in déede, but attributed to the signe, the name peculiar to the thing that was signified: &amp; although they directed their words to the Images, yet they erected their hearts vnto God.

For God seing the inconuenience that should by them aryse vnto vs, vtterly forbad them: as the places aboue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed, proue. Let not therefore the disguising cloke of a good intent, make vs shake of the true garment of God, to transgresse his commaundement, and derogate from his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Who soeuer leade vs but a little awry, frō the path that Christ hath willed vs to treade in, leade vs the right way to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Diuell of hell. Beware ye therefore of these <hi>Syrene</hi> times, these enchaunting charmes, that wise men of the worlde are wont to vse, saying: <hi>Beare for a time. Vse discretion. Be not to rash in reformation.</hi> We ought rather to hearkē to Christ himself,<note place="margin">Iean. 12.</note> which willes vs <hi>To vvalke vvhilest vve haue the light.</hi> If we suffer mistes to be ouercaste the cleare shyning sunne, darkenesse shall soner ouertake vs than we woulde. There is but one gate whereby we muste enter into eternall life. There is but one way to bring vs to our iourneyes end. The least strayning in the world, shall make vs come neuer thyther. And yet not onely for our owne sakes, but also for Christes cause, we must take a wise way herein. For they that goe about to bereue vs of our life (which is hydden in Christ) would as well that God should be disgraced in vs. Wherefore in controuersies of our religion, we should not
<pb n="11" facs="17"/> onely haue respecte to this, howe deare our own saluation is to vs, but also how farre, we further and aduaunce the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our God. Then if it were so, that Images were cōmaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (as they are not) and had their ende to teach (as they doe not) both our owne profite, &amp; honour of our God, might make vs the willinger to embrace them. But as they are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maūded, but accursed: so bring they no knowledge, but blind in ignoraunce. For if they do teach, it is for the shape and not for the substance. Otherwise, the trées in the woode, &amp; sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the shop, might teach as well as they. If the shape do worke an vnderstanding in vs, bycause it is made, as the Image of a man, or of a woman: then why not one Image teach as well as another? Shall the gayer coate, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs peraduenture more couetously disposed, or more wā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly affected, strike a more zeale of deuotion into vs? We haue séene Images in euery Church: specially of Ladies, and of the Crosse: then, why did they gadde from London, to Wilsdon, from Wilsdon to Walsingham, to séeke for other Ladies? Coulde not the one teache as muche as the other? Their eloquence, their voyce, and diligence, was all alyke. Why did my countrey men, from their own parishes, where they had crosses ynowe, come on pilgrimage so oft, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Crosse of Ludlowe? Why did they runne from euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their owne countrey, to the Roode of Chester? Vnlesse ye will say (as many thought in déede) that the yron chayne, of that sturdy champion, put about the necke, might saue them from the hempen halter: which other could not doe. Then must it néedes be somewhat else than teaching, that maketh this people, to giue vnequal honor, to signes of equal saincts. Alexander the Coppersmyth will come in with his band, and there will be a styrre, which shall be the dearest <hi>Diana</hi> to thē. Otherwise, they woulde no more crouche to this Image or that, than they do to the Bible, which teacheth (me thinke) as much as they. Agayne if they teach, let me aske them, whom?
<pb facs="18"/> Learned? or vnlearned? If they teache the vnlearned, howe can they knowe the picture of Christ, from the picture of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Bycause of the Crosse? Why, both were crucified. But not after one sorte. Howe knowe they that? They haue learned it of other. But here they haue loste the state that they were in, for they are nowe become to be learned. Of other also they might haue learned moe lessons than that, and of more certaynty. But the crowne of Thorne, the woūd in the syde, doe make the matter playne. Alas howe shall the simple knowe, that Christ was crowned, was wounded for vs? They haue hearde it of M. Parson: let M. Parson then preache it to them. If he preache not a truthe with his tong, the picture by and by will teache a lye. I remember howe Stephen Gardiner<note place="margin">Stephen Gardiner</note> (whose authoritie I vse in aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him who was Vsher of the schoole where he was Byshoppe of the Sée) was fowly once abused by an Image. Where as the King in his great seale was set on both sydes, on the one syde as in warre the chiefe captaine, on the other syde as in peace the liege soueraine: that famous byshop had found out there S. George on horsebacke, which the grauer neuer made in it, nor the Sealer neuer sealed with it. Yet in his letters to M. Vaugham of Portesmouth, aunswered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by the Counsell, concerning the same matter which we haue now in hand: He vseth these words. <hi>He that can not reade the scripture about the Kings broade seale, eyther by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he can not reade it at all, or bycause the vvay doth not expresse it, yet he can reade S. George on horsebacke on the one syde.</hi> If his learned Lordshippe, could not reade aright such a cōmon Image, if the inscription could escape his eyes: no maruell if the lay people were deceyued in the like. I will tell you what these bokes doe teach them. Carnall and grosse ymaginations of God: and giue further occasion to féede their owne wicked humour. When <hi>Amadys</hi>
      <note place="margin">Amadys.</note> a Goldsmith of London, lay at the poynt of death, his Parson presented him
<pb n="12" facs="18"/> with the Crosse, to put him at the least, in remembraunce of his maker. But what his remembrance was helped thereby, his answere declares. For he raised himself in his bed &amp; said, <hi>What is the price of an ovvnce?</hi> Such is the fruite that the vnlearned receiue by Images, yea, though they be of the best sorte. As for the learned, they haue better bokes: they nede not to be warned with such ydle workemanship. A liuely I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage is more to purpose than a deade. And if the proportion and shape of a man, may moue vs, then why not of the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, rather than the deade? If I sée a poore man stretched on the Crosse in déede, enimies scorning him, power oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him: &amp; death aflicting him: he may for the remembrance doe me more good, and for perill lesse harme. For I néede not to doubt Idolatrie to him. But if I nayle a dead picture, on the materiall Crosse, and set it vp in the Church, my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie is little mended. I may peraduenture, and not like to the cōtrary but I shal be misse led by it. Now suppose it were so, that a Crucifixe in the Church did tel me in déede in most significant and plaine letters, that Christ on the Crosse died? what am I the better for that, vnlesse I knowe that he dyed for me, and the meane how his death may be applyed to me? But thys by no picture can be expressed. The promises in the worde must declare me that, without the which nothing is the image, yea, worse than nothing. Will ye then haue vs to be put in minde of our estate and condition, of oure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in Christ? No picture can represent it, no piece of metall can set out that, which all the preaching, all the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the worlde, is not able sufficiently to beate into oure dull and forgetfull heades.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiectiō.</note> But ofte we sée that by the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or Storie, our memorie is holpen. Hereto I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, fyrste, that it is an extraordinarie, and therefore an vnlawfull meane: condemning the negligence of them that should be perfecter and liuely remembrauncers: and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (as it were) the worde of God, from his proper function.
<pb facs="19"/> Then also there ought not any such forgetfulnesse to reste in vs: Christ hath willed vs thereof to be mindefull euer: we should not stand in néede of more outwarde helpes, than he (expert of our infirmities) hath of his mercy prouided for vs. Consider this with your selues, that if an Image be put, it is an Image of God, or an Image of man. God is inuisible, &amp; hath no body: how can he then be portrayed? Shal we giue a shape to him, that hath no shape? <hi>The Lorde spake vnto you</hi> (sayth Moses) <hi>out of the middle of fier.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note>
      <hi>You heard the voice or soūd of his vvords, but you did see no form or shape at al.</hi> And by &amp; by followeth. <hi>Take heede therefore diligently vnto your soules. You savve no maner of Image, in the day in the vvhich the Lorde spake vnto you in Horeb, out of the middest of the fier: least peraduenture you being deceiued, should make to your selues any grauen Image, or likenesse of man or vvoman.</hi> And agayne in the same chapter. <hi>Bevvare that thou forgette not the couenaunt of the Lorde thy God, vvhich he made vvith them, and so make to thy self any car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Image, vvhich the Lord hath forbidden to be made. For the Lord thy God is a consuming fier, &amp; a ielous God.</hi> Thus God doth earnestly and ofte call vpon vs, to marke, and take héede, and that vppon the perill of our soules, to the charge that he giueth vs. Then by a solemne and long rehearsall of all things in heauen, in earth, and in the water, he forbiddeth any Image or likenesse of any thing to be made. There fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth also the penalty: the horrible destruction, with a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne inuocation of heauen and earth to recorde, denounced and threatned to all transgressours of this commaundement. Therefore in the olde lawe, the myddle of the propitiatorie (which represented Gods seate) was empty: least any should take occasion to make any similitude or likenesse of him. Esay after he hath set forth the incomprehensible Maiestie of God, he asketh:<note place="margin">Esay. 40.</note>
      <hi>To vvhom then vvil ye make God like, or vvhat similitude vvil ye set vp vnto him? Shall the caruer make
<pb n="13" facs="19"/> him a carued image, and shall the goldesmith couer it vvith golde, or cast him into a forme of siluer plates? And for the poore man, shall the Image maker frame an Image of tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he may haue somevvhat to set vp also?</hi> And after this he cryeth out. <hi>O vvretches, heard ye neuer of this? hath it not bene preached to you sith the beginning, hovve by the creation of the vvorld, and the greatnesse of the vvork, they might vnderstande the maiestie of God, the maker and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all, to be greater than that it could be expressed or set forth in any Image or bodyly similitude?</hi> Thus farre the Prophet Esay, who from the <hi>.44.</hi> Chapter to the <hi>.45.</hi> entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in a maner of no other thing.<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note> And S. Paule euidently teacheth the same, that no similitude can be made vnto God, in gold, siluer, stone, or any other matter. By these and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places of scripture, it is euident, that no Image ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought, or can be made vnto God. For howe can God a most pure spirit, whome man neuer sawe,<note place="margin">Ioan. 1.</note> be expressed by a grosse, bodyly and visible similitude? Howe can the infinite maiestie and greatnesse of God, incomprehensible to mannes minde, much more not able to be compassed with the sense, be expressed in a finite and little Image? How can a deade and a dumbe Image, expresse the liuing God? What can an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which, when it is fallen, can not rise vp agayne, which can neyther help his frends, nor hurt his enimies, expresse of the most puissant and mighty God, who alone is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde his frends, and destroy his enimies euerlastingly? S. Paul sayth: that such as haue framed any similitude of god,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> like a mortall man, or any other Image of him in tymber, stone, or other matter, haue chaunged his truthe into a lye. Wherefore they that make any Image of God, are playnly conuicte to be godlesse persons. I may reason with them as <hi>Arnobius</hi> doth with the Gentiles. <hi>Si certum est,</hi>

So farre <hi>Lactantius.</hi> Wherefore synce God is not like vnto these, for he is lyuing, but these are deade: hée hath neyther hande nor foote, but these haue both, though they neyther strike, nor stande of them selues: he is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther olde nor yong, but these are paynted, some gracious, some grisley, some lustye, some rustye: it followeth that they are not the Images of God, which are made by the hād of man. For as <hi>Lactantius</hi> sayth: <hi>Simulachrum a similitudine nomen accepit.</hi> An Image, hath taken his name of lykenesse.</p>
   <p>But some of the aduersaries will not in this contende wyth mée. They maye perhappes graunte an abuse in the Image of the Father (whome notwithstanding they haue suffered to stande in euery Churche and Chappell, like an olde man, wyth a grey bearde, and a furred gowne, euen as the Paynters conceyte did serue him) But the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Sonne, bicause he is made man for our sakes, may (as a man) be sette forth vnto vs. And therefore they wryte, howe Christ did sende his picture to <hi>Abgar</hi> King of <hi>Edissenes.</hi> But as it is not like, that any suche matter should be, and <hi>Eusebius</hi> writing the historie at the full, omit it: so that we neyther may, nor ought, make any Image of Christ himself, shal by good reason appeare.

<pb n="16" facs="22"/> his humanity, wher as we are by Christs own words cōmaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that al should so honor the sonne, as they honor y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> father.<note place="margin">Io. 5.</note> But agaynst this, a crafty Papist may reply and say, that by the same reason, it is not lawful to paynt a man, for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of soule and body: and the soule which is the chief part of him, no arte or cunning is able to expresse. But I answere to this, that the reason is nothing like. For the soule may be seuered from the body: as dayly, by death, we sée experience: nor it is impietie to think vpon or beholde, the shape of a man without a soule: But the Diuinitie of Christ can not be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from his humanitie: neyther is it lawful to imagine an humanitie without a Diuinitie, least we fall into the heresie of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> as in the third Article, where I shall haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to speake of the Counsell assembled by commaundement of Constantine the fifth, at more large is opened. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And where as Christ hath caried his flesh vppe into heauen with him, no more to be knowen according to the fleshe, we fleshly creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res do fall from his will, and make a counterfet of a mortall fleshe, where as his, is glorified. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Furthermore vnknowen it is, what was the forme and countenaunce of Christ. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places: so many Images, and euery one of them (as they affirme) the true and liuely Image of Christ, and yet neuer a one of them like to an other: wherefore as sone as an Image of Christ is made, by and by a lye is made, which is forbiddē by Gods worde. Wherefore since our Religion ought to be grounded vpon truth, Images which can not be without lies ought not to be made, or put to any vse of Religion. Thus haue I declared the vnlawfulnesse of Images, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect they are intollerable. Now a word for the folly of them, which among vs is nothing sufferable.<note place="margin">Oratione contra Idol.</note>
      <hi>Athanasius</hi> appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth two wayes to come to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> knowledge of God. <hi>Animam, &amp; Opera,</hi> the Soule of man, which by the word, may beholde the word, and so enter into the priuy chambre of the Almighty: and if that suffise not, the workes of God, whereby the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb facs="23"/> things of his eterne vertue &amp; Diuinitie may be séene of vs.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> Then, vs to seke any new wayes, since these are ordayned euer since the beginning &amp; creation of the worlde, is to much foolishnesse. If we seke for comparisons, &amp; will haue one thing set forth by an other, why shuld we not rather follow Christs institution, than be addicted to our own deuises? Christ in the Scripture hath resembled himselfe to many of his creatures, which dayly &amp; hourely, are before our eyes: And can we not be contented with them, but make newe creatures of our owne heads, to put vs in minde of our bounden dueties? We sée the light &amp; shining sunne: and sée we not the power of Christ in it? We see the wayes &amp; dores to our houses: and sée we not Christ the ready path to heauen? We sée the hennes clocking of their chickens: &amp; sée we not Christ continually calling vs? We sèe pore shepherds féeding of their shéepe: and sée we not Christ the true feder of our soules? We sée our selues y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> liuely Images, &amp; perfect coūterfets of Christ himself: &amp; shal Christ be forgottē vnlesse we haue a crucifix? There is nothing I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise you, but madnesse in this meaning. Ther is nothing that can so liuely expresse the affects, (as I may terme them) &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Christ, as those things, which he thought good to serue our vnderstanding. Shal we then refuse the more euident ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, &amp; fal to the darker signification? Shal we contemne Christ and his order, &amp; set so much store by a blinde picture? <hi>Nero,</hi> I remember, was sometime so wanton, <hi>vt gladiatorum pugnas spectaret in Smaragdo.</hi> He had an Emeraud in his ring, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> would giue to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> eye the resemblances of things that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. Wherfore when y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> masters of defēce, came to play their prises, he would beholde thē in his ring. I wis he might haue discerned them better if he had loked on their own selues, and not haue footed in a stone to sée thē. But nothing can content the curious: &amp; the flesh delighteth in hir own deuises. Thus is it proued that Images do not according to Gregories mind, teach: but in al respects be vaine &amp; foolish: &amp; if they did teach,
<pb n="17" facs="23"/> yet by the scripture and word of God, such scholemasters are forbidden to vs. Now that they are honoured contrary to his minde: experience of long time hath proued, and the Popish doctrine hath confirmed. For,<note place="margin">In Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali.</note> order is taken how they shal be hallowed. First with exorcisme of water &amp; of salte, then with hypocriticall &amp; blasphemous prayer: afterward with sensing, anoynting, kyssing, erecting, and an hūdreth other most vile obseruances: Priuyleges and pardons be graunted to them: Candels and tapers be lighted afore them: Much golde and Iewels are bestowed on them: And leaste authoritie shoulde want to error, in all their sayings, in all their writings, and in their generall Counsels, they haue confirmed the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of them: as in the seconde at <hi>Nice,</hi> and that which was assembled at Rome by Gregorie the thirde. But of these Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous déedes and doctrines, I shall haue occasion hereafter to entreate. Suffiseth now that I haue shewed, how the Diuel abuseth the works of God to his own purpose: how Images haue crept into the Church: how necssarily they are naught: both by the word of God, &amp; authority of good men condemned. And sith they teache not, otherwise than lies: &amp; are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing honored, to the shame of vs, and derogation of gods glory, they ought in generall to be remoued from the place of perill: the place of Gods seruice. We must not giue place to our owne reason: we must not measure God with the line of our fansies, but builde according to the plat layed before vs, &amp; shew our thankfulnesse by obedience. If we once giue place to our enimy which dayly doth assault vs, I confesse (with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall) that we giue occasion of our owne fall. If we be not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect and wise in Christ, we shall vnwares be set vpon &amp; betrayed. We sée how he suborneth his ministers by al crafty meanes to seduce vs if he can. They were wont to say, <hi>There is smal store of Saincts, vvhen the Diuell carieth the Crosse.</hi> But we may iustely suspect, that there is small goodnesse in the Crosse, when it is caried by the Diuell and hys Sainctes.

When this hath not taken the desired effecte: (God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wonderfull and glad successe to the noble furtherer of his worde and glory) they haue thought it most gaynefull for them, to come in with a newe battaile: a battaile of bokes: whereof some already be come into oure sighte, and they say, that more doe lye in ambushe. Thankes be to God they shead no bloude, though they breath nothing else but sedition and lies. If it haue pleased God, at any time to raise, more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table instrumentes in his Church, as <hi>Luther, Zvvinglius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Caluin</hi> were: as <hi>Knokes, Latymer,</hi> and <hi>Cranmer</hi> haue bene, to beate downe the walles of the malignant Church: &amp; most of them, with their bloud to beare witnesse to the truth: then are they condemned of the Antichristians, and with al words of beastlinesse, and reproch, slaundered. But nowe they haue vttered themselues so farre, their malice and impudence is so apparant, that their tong in déede is no slaunder at all. They were wont to saye, that a man should not béelye the Diuell. What shame is it then for M.

      <hi>&amp; in veritate non extitit, quia veritas in illo non est.</hi> He was a manqueller from the beginning, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode not in the truth, bicause there is no truth in him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, dearly beloued, although this Ape come forth with ten Articles, in imitation of ten Commaundements, yet God be thanked, they neyther be the Commaundements, therfore to be folowed: nor articles of our faith, therefore to be beleued. But rather, (as in the processe it shall well appere) euery one (as he consters them) swarues from the faith: and therefore by commaundement we ought to beware of them, iudge you indifferently. I appeale to the conscience of euery Christian, whether we (auoiding the occasion of Idolatrye) tende anye whit to Paganisme, as the Papistes by their deuises doe, or whether (we by remouing al Images, and consequently the Crosse to) doe derogate from Christ and from his passion, as they doe: which hauing the materiall Crosse, can not come to the knowledge and fayth of the crucified. I confesse that I am more aspre in my writing, than otherwise I woulde, or modesty requireth. But no such bitternesse is tasted in me, as the beastlinesse of them (with whome I haue to do) deserueth. Beare with mée therfore, (I beséeche you) beare with a truth in plaine speeche vttered. Bayarde hath forgot that hée is a Horse: and therefore if I make the stumbling iades sydes to bléede, blame mée not. Impute not to malice, &amp; impacience, that which is grounded of hatred to the crime, but loue to the persons which be toucht. I hope by this meanes, that seyng their own shame, they will come to more honesty: or hearing their owne euill doings, surceasse (at leaste wyse) theire euill
<pb n="19" facs="25"/> speaking. They haue nothing so rife in their deprauing mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, wherwithall to burden our ministerie in Englande, as heaping togither all base occupations: to shew,<note place="margin">Fol. 9. a. b.</note> that the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes men thereof be our preachers. I wis I might aunswere &amp; iustify the same, that as great a number of learned, as euer were: as auncient in standing and degrée as they, supply the greatest roomes, and places of most credite. Wherefore they doe vs wrong to match the simplest of our syde, with the best of theirs. As for their famous writers, <hi>Rascall, Dorman, Martiall</hi> &amp; <hi>Stapleton</hi> which now with such confidence make their challenges, be knowen vnto vs, what they are. But they which at home be no more knowen than contemned, as sone as euer they taste y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> good liquor of Louain, they be great clarkes, Bachelers of Diuinitie, studentes of the same, they must be magnified, they muste be reuerenced, as if <hi>Apollo</hi> sodainly had cast his cortayne about them. But to graūt that the inferior sort of our ministers were such in déede, as these men of spyte ymagine, such as came from the shop, from the forge, from the whyrry, from the loome: should ye not (think you) finde more sincerity and learning in them, than in al the rable of their Popish chaplens, their massemongers, &amp; their soulepriests? I lament y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> ther are not so many good preachers as parishes: I am sory that some, to vnskilfull, be preferred. But I neuer saw, that simple reader, admitted in our church: but in the time of Popery, ye should haue found in euery dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, forty six Iohns in euery respect, worse. I could exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their case alike, and proue it better, how Bawdes, Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardes, and beastly abused Boyes, haue bene called to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops among them. Sorcerers, Simoniakes, Sodomites, Pestilent, Periured, Poysoners, haue bene aduaunced to be Popes among them? Shal this derogate from their holy sée. Yet none of oures, of any calling, or name amongst vs, can, of enuy it selfe, be burdened with the like. As for the Rascall of their religion, what were they? what are they? Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb facs="26"/> Blasphemous, Couetous, Desperate, Extreme, Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, Gluttons, Harlots, Ignoraunts: and so go through the crosse rowe of letters, and truly end it with <hi>Est Amen.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they vrge vs any further, with imperfectiō in our state, thereby to bring vs into contempt and harred: we wil descēd to particularities, and detecte their filth to the whole worlde. We are not (deare Christians) the men,<note place="margin">Folio. 9. b,</note> that the aduersaries of the truth reporte vs: we doe not leane to our owne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: we preferre not our sayings before the decrées of auncient Fathers. But after the aduise of the fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, we preferre the Scriptures before mennes pleasures. This may we do without offence (I trust.) The Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues haue permitted vs this. <hi>Eleutherius</hi> the Pope, writing to <hi>Lucius</hi> King of England, sayd thus vnto him. <hi>Petijstu a nobis leges Romanas &amp; Caesaris,</hi>

For ye haue receyued through the mercy of God, the lawe and fayth of Christe into your kingdome: You haue both the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes in your realme: Take out of them by the grace of God, and aduise of your subiectes, a lawe: and by that lawe, through Gods sufferaunce, rule your realme. But be you Gods Vicar in that kingdome. And so forth. If the Loua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes had but a mangled piece of suche a Presidente for the Pope, as here is for euery Prince: Lorde, howe they would
<pb n="20" facs="26"/> triumphe. They would desiphre, and by rethorique resolue euery letter of it. But let that passe. It is ynough for thys place, to shewe the Popes owne decree: that all mennes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, be they neuer so worthied, with the name of Fathers, may iustly be repelled, and ought to giue place to the lawe of God. Wherefore, if any of their owne imagination, haue brought in any thing to Gods seruice not altogether conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the worde: not we, but the worde doth wipe it quite away.<note place="margin">Dist. <hi>11.</hi> cap.

The common place of our aduersaries, is to exhorte the Prince and other, to kepe the aunciente tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Fathers. And I beséech them wyth al my heart, that they will defende and mayntayne those thinges, which they receyued according to truthe. If tyranny of men hath brought in any thing agaynst the Gospell, let not the name of Fathers, and vaine opinion of antiquitie, bereue vs of the sacred and euerlastyng veritie. What greater follie can there be than this, to measure Gods matters with the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rule of mannes discretion, where the pleasure of God, reuealed in his word, should only direct vs? They that pleade at the barre in ciuile causes, will not be ruled ouer by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but by law. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> sayd very well: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Wherfore, to conclude,<note place="margin">Folio, 9. b. Ioan. 4.</note> the only swete water to quench our thyrsts, must be fet from the fountayne of Gods eternall wyl.
