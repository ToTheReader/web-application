   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsidering in my mynd the great decay of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes churche that hathe contynewed of a longe season (beynge the fayth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful congregacyon,<note place="margin">

         </gap> Cor vi</note> which Paule cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his temple.) It hath impelled me of a true &amp; vnfayned herte to take payne (as the cōmon sayeng is) wher at mought more truely be counted a pleasure, to wryte this litel volume. But for as moche as I stode in stay and doubted the iudgementes of the vnlearned multitude lackynge yet knowledge to deserne the spirituall lyght from darkenesse, ye &amp; not that onely, but also doubted the iudgmen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes of suche as haue lernyng, which in tyme past feared not to peruerte y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scriptures. Truely it troubled so my mynde, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> I was in .xx. wyttes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="3"/> I mought set forthe this worke acordyng to my fyrst purpose, eyther els let fall my labours, kepyng it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to my selfe and takyng onely to my rewarde my payne for my trauel. Thus stageryng as a man beyng in an open, large, and wylde forest kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng not whiche waye to resorte or ryde to his lodgyng, sometyme fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the vncertaynty of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> way, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme doubtyng whether y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ende of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> way dyd lede vnto a wood or couert full of busshes and bryers, somtyme fearynge robbers, theues, and cruell beastes to spoyle and deuoure hym. And last of all fearyng lest the nyght shulde come vpō him before he came to his iourneys ende. So I beynge in this opē forest of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worlde though I knowe the way of the scrypture to be certayne, and y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> ende therof to lede to quietnes and rest, and that it is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> onely rule for all men to frame theyr workes thervnto. By the which rule
<pb facs="4"/> I haue facyoned &amp; framed this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke (as nere as God hathe gyuen me grace. yet I doubted the vncertayne Iudgementes of other men, the one sorte that knowe not the waye, &amp; the other sorte knowyng it hauynge no pleasure to walke therin, taking vpō them to be guydes vnto the symple &amp; vnlerned. Where in very dede many of them haue rather played the part of cruyll spoylers and deuourers as it may appere to all thē whō it hathe pleased god, eyther to preserue from spoylyng or els of his infinyte good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to call &amp; conducte from false &amp; fayned pathes, vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> true &amp; perfyte way which Christ hath apoynted vs to walke in. Vnto the whiche way to conforte, counsell, &amp; courage all men. I haue applyed this my labour, fyrst to conforte them in the trueth, to cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rage them to stycke vnto the trueth, &amp; to counsel them to folowe the same<note place="margin">i. cor vi. ii. cor. vi</note> that the lordes temple may be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="4"/> and repayred agayne. But after my labours ended, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> thynge y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hathe incouraged me to set forth my good wyll vnto all men (beyng in this ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny doubtes &amp; troubles of mynde) I wyll shewe you. I counsayled w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> my selfe and yf it were best for me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate it vnto some noble man, as ye may se in dyuers prefaces &amp; prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of bokes, some are dedycated vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to one man, and some vnto an other, whiche thyng truely I wolde that al men dyd no lesse prayse &amp; alowe then my selfe, for it is an occasion to al thē which vnfaynedly bere louyng myn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des vnto the person whom the thyng is dedicated to haue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> more fauoure and loue vnto it, and to be the more desyrous to rede &amp; peruse it for his sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke. But as there is in this worlde no pleasure without payne, no conforte without care, no ioy without sorowe and to be short nothyng without his contrary. So in this I was not so
<pb facs="5"/> moch incouraged forwarde one way but I was more dyscouraged back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde an other way. For when I cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led to my remembraunce y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> frowarde ymagynacyons and vntrewe repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of suche as be euyll whiche also haue cedused the poore and vnlerned to thynke all thyng to be as true as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> gospell y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they speake my herte was quyte discouraged to dedycate it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any noble man. The lacke of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to set forth this worke and to make it more mete and conuenyent to be presented vnto suche an estate or person (for as moche as I haue cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pared and framed it to the infallible truthe of goddes blessed worde) dyd lytell or nothyng dyscomforte me. But because I wolde not haue the truthe to be sclaundered by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycyous tonges of those that wolde saye. This felowe hath taken payne to set forth a worke to please suche a mā withal. I was at a playne poynt
<pb facs="5"/> with my selfe to kepe it vndefamed that waye, and not onely to saue the truthe from false suspicion, but suche persons also from offendyng y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> wold vntruely reporte it. For it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted that many whiche haue not feared to speake euyll of the gospell, (sayeng it wold make mē heretykes) wold not passe vpon the sclaundryng of ony good purpose or {pre}tence of mā. Thus wayeng the matter as it were in a ballaunce, I perceyued yet in all thynges that the truthe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh at length, and then consyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the ioyful and acceptable tyme that is nowe,<note place="margin">ii. cor. vi.</note> so that the euangelycal lyght shyneth ouer vs,<note place="margin">Ro. xiii.</note> the nyght be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng past and the daye come to gyue lyght vnto al men that lyst to labour in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lordes worke, it entred in to my herte (thoughe I mystrusted not the comyng of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> nyght agayne) yet that I ought not to be neglygent in the lordes worke accordyng to the gyfte
<pb facs="6"/> which is gyuē me. But whē I coulde fynde nothyng to quyet my mynde for the settyng forth therof, without the daunger of some euyll reporte, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worde of god (beynge the true salue for all maner of sores, and the perfyt medesyne for all maner spiritual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases) gaue me comforte prouokyng me to stay no longer therin by the pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable of certayne men whiche recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their lord and mayster sundry talentes to be put in vse for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage vntyll his retourne out of a straunge countre, in to the whiche he toke his iourney. And after a long season the lorde of those seruauntes came and rekened with them. Then he that had receyued .v. talentes said mayster thou delyueredest vnto me v.<note place="margin">mat. xxv</note> talentes, beholde I haue gayned with them .v. talentes mo. Then his mayster sayd vnto hym, well good seruaunt and faythful, thou hast ben faythfull in lytell, I wyl constitute y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      <pb facs="6"/> ouer moche, entre in to thy maysters ioy. And he that had receyued .ii. ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes had gottē other .ii. vnto whō lyke answere was made. But the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt whiche had receyued but one talent and applyed it to no profyte, but hyd it in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> erthe came and sayd. Mayster I cōsydered that thou wast an harde man, whiche repest where thou sowest not, and gathered where thou strowest not, wherfore I was afrayde beholde, y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> hast thyne awne. But for his slouthfull and euyll ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce he was rebuked, his talent ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from hym and gyuen to hym y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> had many, and the vnprofytable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt cast in to vtter darknes. Whē I remembred this sayeng of the lord which haue receyued but one symple talent in comparyson of other which haue applyed their wyttes and ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to fulfyl the lordes pleasure as it appereth by their excellent workes and bokes that they haue wrytten,
<pb facs="7"/> yet feryng lest this smal talent shuld be taken from me, and so to receyue the dyspleasure of my lorde, whiche ought more to be feared then the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasures and dysprayses of all men, and his fauour and loue more to be extemed desyred and sought for, then y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fauour of all creatures. I thought it more conuenyent to folow his wyl then to regarde the false iudgemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and the vntrue reportes of suche as knowe not the trouthe. And also of them whiche knowe it abusynge theyr knowledge to theyr great daū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and parell. Wherfore as one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendyng to saue al thyng as vpright as maye be, I haue attempted to set forth this my rude worke, beyng as the cōmon terme gothe as playne as a packe staffe. And for it shall appere that I seke not the fauour of man, I haue not dedycate it vnto one man. But because I wolde that all men shuld seke the fauour of god I haue
<pb facs="7"/> dedycate it vnto all men, ye I wolde that the poorest begget whiche can rede or here it red shulde haue it. But whether they be poore or ryche, to whose handes this lytell boke shall happen to come I her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The one is that I haue herde by reporte of other men that diuers be offended with sundry bokes, whiche beynge withoute name or aucthor haue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther troubled theyr conscyence then set it in a quyetnesse, and that many haue ben suspected to be doers therof whiche were neuer of counsell nor knowledge therin. And I maye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue the thyng to be y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> more true, for in a small peice of worke or twayne whiche I haue set forth my selfe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge it no certayne name, dyuers persones of dyuers men haue had y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fame &amp; reporte to be doers of it.
