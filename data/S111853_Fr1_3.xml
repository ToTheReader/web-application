   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>QUestionlesse some men will blame mee for making this Authour speake in our vulgar tongue. For his maximes and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents are condemnd of all, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to all Christian States, and hurtfull to all humane Societies. Herein I shall answer for my selfe with the Comoedian, <hi>Placere stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo bonis quam plurimis, &amp; minimè multos laedere:</hi> I endeavour to give content to the most I can of those that are well disposed, and no scandall to any. I grant, I find him blam'd and condemnd: I doe no lesse my selfe. Reader, either doe thou read him with a prejudicate opinion, &amp; out of thy own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment tax his errors; or at least, if thou canst stoop so low, make use of my paines to helpe thee. I
<pb facs="5"/> will promise thee this reward for thy labour: if thou consider well the actions of the world, thou shalt find him much practisd by those that condemne him; who willingly would walk as theeves doe with close lanternes in the night, that they being undescried, and yet seeing all, might surprise the unwary in the dark. Surely this book will infect no man: out of the wicked treasure of a mans own wicked heart, he drawes his malice and mischiefe. From the same flower the Bee sucks hony, from whence the Spider hath his poyson. And he that means well, shall be here warnd, where the deceitfull man learnes to set his snares. A judge who hath often usd to examine theeves, becomes the more expert to sift out their tricks. If mischiefe come hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, blame not me, nor blame my Authour: lay the saddle on the right horse: but <hi>Hony soit qui mal y pense:</hi> let shame light on him that hatcht the mischiefe.</p>
