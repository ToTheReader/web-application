   <head>¶ Vnto the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>THERE was written (gentle Reader) manie yeares agoe, a short declaration of the right and onely lawfull Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which our Sauior Christ hath ordayned for the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Church. Which declaration being not published at the time it was prepared for, hath come since into the handes of some, who considering the Treatise to be modestlie and learnedlie writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and discerning a fitte time and occasion for the purpose, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it in the yeare 84. to be printed. Since which time it hath bin read and considered of by many, but, either because the trueth of it seemed cleare, or because the doctrine conteyned in it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, without particuler application to the state of our Church, or for some other like respect (as I suppose) it hath had quiet and free passage hitherto, without anie replication made vnto it.</p>
   <p>Nowe commeth out one after so many yeares, belike hauing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughlie in all the time studied the matter: who replieth to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and vndertaketh to shewe that there is no such Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline appointed by our Sauior Christ, as is there declared to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned by his authoritie. This Treatise the Author calleth, <hi>A defence of the gouernement established in the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glande for ecclesiasticall matters.</hi> Which tytle, whether he were mooued to giue his booke as most plausible, or as most profitable: hoping peraduenture for no small recompence of such a seruice as he taketh vpon him to performe, or what other reason soeuer it were, because I could not discerne anie sufficient reason for it, (the booke he would confute, declaring onely a generall doctrine for all Churches, and dealing litle more with this Church, then anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, much lesse impugning it, that it should neede his defence) I haue thought good, rather to call his booke, A replie to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, as it is in deede, and as the nature of the writing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<pb n="4" facs="3"/> he should haue called it, then to keepe the name whiche hee hath giuen it. The declaration he hath diuided into manie small pieces and sections, and so setteth it downe all before him: wherin he seemeth to vndertake to proue, that there is not a worde in that godlie learned Treatise, which hee will not shewe to be reprouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: which howe he performeth, and what honor he is to carie out of this fielde, wherein he is entred with great triumphe, I leaue to the Christian Reader by this answere to consider.</p>
   <p>His first section (because nothing should escape him) is vppon these wordes set after the preface and before the first sentence of the booke, &amp; vpon the toppe of euerie leafe, <hi>A learned discourse of ecclesiasticall gouernement.</hi> This Title both here and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout the Replie is much iested at and played withall. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere wherevnto, the Reader is to vnderstande, the right title of the booke set downe in the first page thereof, is, A briefe &amp; plain declaration, &amp;c. The other is of like the Printers, or some others to whose hande the copie might come, a thing vsuallie done, and without anie iust note of ostentation in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, who is seldome or neuer priuie to such addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But let vs leaue the Title, and passe on to the Booke.</p>
