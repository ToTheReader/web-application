   <head>An aduertisement to the Christian Reader, how
to make vse of these defensiue Armes against Poperie,
how to imploy this Powder and Shot, against
the Pope, his Cardinals, Byshops,

of Sorbone. &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendly Reader, although wee may
(to our griefe) behold, that in many
places of Christendom, the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
and labours of the Apostles
are much demolished and ruined:<note place="margin">Good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are the Masons of Gods Church.</note>
yet to comfort vs againe, our Lord
God hath raised many good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and excellent worke-men, to
reestablish the same in the former
forme and estate.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.</note> Whose paines (God bee praysed therefore)
we may dayly see, by the plentie of good bookes and learned en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours,
that shew themselues in this cleare light of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
each man labouring about the building, according to the
gift and measure he hath receiued of our Lorde. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
likewise, that diuers men of great reading and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
haue very amply discoursed on the difference, betweene
the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> deliuering the
true title and right of the one, and as apparantly reproouing
the shamefull insolence of the other:<note place="margin">1. Tit. 3. 6.</note> wherefore my paines im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the same argument,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Neophytes,</hi> are as Noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in faith, or yong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, that haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defence, put <hi>Pa, pa,</hi> like yong children.</note> may appeare but as a repetition
of their former actions. But when this small trauaile of mine
with iugement and aduise shall be considered on, those former
labours (perhaps) may be found not so apt and commodious for
diuers <hi>Neophytes:</hi> yong Schollers, newly instructed in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of faith, that as children feeding on milke, most vsually
can cry but <hi>Pa, Pa.</hi> As much to say, as that they will defend
themselues alwayes, by the faith of their Fathers and Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors:
<pb facs="8"/>
not hauing any other warant or buckler, But thus did
our fathers, being vtterly ignorant, both how they were instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and who were their true Fathers and guiders in the faith.</p>
   <p>In regard whereof, as the weakest and most vnworthe labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
to trauile in the businesse of Gods building, I haue collected
this little Volume, principally applying the same to such as are
not for strong meates, but (as children) are to be fed with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
milke, for their better digesting the word of God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
But if they will not forget their childish custome,<note place="margin">Such as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert to the Gospell, do often cry Pa, Pa. but they are children.</note> or
cease from Infants behauiour, crying yet <hi>Pa, Pa:</hi> why then,
they shall finde, their true fathers and lawfull Seniors, not only
the Apostles themselues, but likewise the auncient Fathers and
Doctours of Gods Church, from whom, their bad Nurses had
good hope to hide and hood-wincke them still, in their old Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
wolues skinnes, but that (God bee thanked) the truth in
them hath clearely appeared, euen to beate these pretenders,
with their owne staues and weapons,<note place="margin">The Papists are beaten with their owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</note> as wee vse it for a common
Prouerbe.</p>
   <p>And this is the maine reason, of publishing this <hi>Shot and
Powder</hi> against the Pope, by way of Antithesis or comparison
in opposition, for better distinguishing the right of either part.
And because (in iustice) the Apostles doe deserue the cheefe
and eminent place,<note place="margin">The order and methode obserued in the booke.</note> wee preferre them to lead the way in euery
cause, and then the Pope followes with his allegations, vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and without any partialtie. Commend both me and this
worke to God in thy praiers, and desire his blessing on
it for generall benefit. From <hi>Egypt,</hi> neere
the red Sea, this yeere of grace 1608.
