      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y your Lordships and the rest of the Councels Letters at <hi>Kinsale,</hi> bearing date the 27. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> last, 1601. directed to the right H. the Lord Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour, and the rest of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie Councel here your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe aduertised your happy and blessed successe (by Gods most gracious prouidence) obtained ouer the Arch-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels <hi>Tyrone, Oddonell,</hi> and the rest of the rebels and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish inuadours, vpon Christmas Eaue, being the 24. of <hi>December:</hi> which most famous victorie and great hand of the Almightie, I had aduertisement the sixt of this present, that 14. Priests of the rebels were dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, to perswade and incense the vulgar and common sort, that the rebels &amp; Spanyards receiued no such losse or damage as your Lordships said Letter deliuered: nor as the common brute most confidently conceiued and knew to be: by which practise they meant the more soūd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to holde in and continue their faction. Whereupon I thought it both reasonable, and discourse agreeing to the nature of trueth, to make knowne to the world, that
<pb facs="3"/> the rebels losse &amp; damage was not lesse then your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships said Letter mentioned, but in higher measure and greater preiudice to thē then that Letter expressed: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the world may see the falshood and deceipt of these beastly Priests, &amp; the drift of these rebels and traitours to drawe vnconstant men and wauering subiectes to their cursed purposes: I confesse I haue very coldly &amp; barely handled this subiect, and rather dimmed and diminished the worth &amp; dignitie thereof, then beautified and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the same with matter or method: wherein I humbly beseech your Lordshippes pardon, as also in my boldnes in presuming vpon so nice an argument. But pearles and precious stones require no ornaments to set them forth: neither doth the originall cause of my writing, neede or aske any florish my selfe or any other mortall man can make in the same, being a worke directed and purposed by the power &amp; strength of Iehoua, the great God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth: and effected &amp; performed by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships valour and worthinesse, being Gods instrument appointed for the accomplishment thereof: which are matters more then sufficient in themselues to recōmend the cause to the world. And so in all humble manner I wil leaue my poore labour to your Lordships Honourable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and fauourable censure, and your Lordships person to be protected vnder the blessed wings of the Almighty. From my house in <hi>Dublin</hi> the 30. of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> 1601.</p>
