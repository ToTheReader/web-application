   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>RVELY</hi> I am, and euer haue bene of this opynion, mooste noble, moste puissaunt, and moste vertuouse Prynce, that the Royall astate of a kynge here in erth, next vnto god, is of men moste to be honoured, loued, and feared in an incomparable degree and facion. For no man hauynge the free vse of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, beholdynge at his eien the disposition moste wonderfull sette by diuine prouydence in thynges aboue vs, aboute vs, and vndernethe vs, with the sondry alternations of tyme, wyll denye, to be of those thynges one principall ruler and moderatour, by whose eternall sapience all thynges ben gouerned. Vnto that office of gouernance is (as it were by the generall consent of al people) one name appropried, in the which although by diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of langages, the letters and syllables are oftentymes chaunged, yet the worde spoken hath one signification, which implieth as moche as a <hi>KINGE</hi> in englyshe, as it may appere to them, which do rede holy scripture, and will marke howe often god is there callid kinge, and also the prophetes do so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently name hym. More ouer the paynims beinge onely ladde with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affections, callyd Iupiter, to whome aboue other their goddis,<note place="margin">

      </note> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued the power vniuersall, kynge of goddis and of men: as who saythe, there may be no greatter name gyuen vnto hym, whome they supposed to be the gyuer of lyfe vnto creatures. To the whiche example, for the similitude of that diuine office men dyd attribute vnto their soueraygne gouernours that excellent denomination, calling them semblably kynges, and assigning to them the cōmune distribution of Iustyce: Wherby the people vnder their gouernaunce, shulde be kepte and preserued in quiete lyfe, not exercysed in bestiall appetite, but passed forth in all partes of honestie, they fynally shuld of god be rewarded with immortalitie. This wel consydred, it shall be to all men apparant, that they, whiche rebell agaynst kynges, be ennemies to god, and in wyll confounders of naturall order and prouidence. But aboue all thinges, I haue in mooste admiration, the maiestie of you, whiche be verye kynges raygnyng in Iustice, whan I consyder, that therin semeth to be a thynge supernaturall, or (if it may be spoken without derogation vnto god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis honour) a diuine influence or sparke of diuinitie: whiche late appered to all them that behelde your grace syttyng in the Throne of your royal astate, as supreme heed of the churche of Englande nexte vnder <hi>CHRIST,</hi> about the descision and condemnation of the pernicious errours, of the moste de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable heretyke Iohn̄ Nicolson, callyd also Lambert, at the whyche tyme your hyghnesse, more excellently than my tunge or penne can expresse, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be in your royall persone the perfite image of kyngely maiestie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacte
<pb facs="3"/>
of these excellent qualities, trewe Religion, Sapience, Iustice, and Mercy, all men reioycinge at the manifeste and most honorable declaration of your euangelicall faythe: meruaylynge at the fulmination of the moste vehement argumentes procedyng from your hyghnes in the confutation of abhomynable heresyes: extollynge the iuste reprehencions of the peruerse opinions and interpretations of the arrogant masters of the said Lambert, in whose writynges, and his owne propre wytte, he more trusted (as your hyghnesse trewely alledged agaynste hym) than in the playne context of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scripture, and the determinate sentence of holy and great lerned doctours: Inioyenge also as well at your gracis mooste wonderfull pacyence, in the longe sustayninge of the folyshe and tediouse obiections of the sayde Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, as also at your most christian charitie, in mouynge and exhortynge so stubborne an heretike, with the most gentyll and perswasible langage, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and forsake his myscheuouse heresies. This maiestie your true and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge subiectes beholdynge, and than herynge the spirite of god speakyng in you, his enoynted Kynge, and mynister elected: they were with ioy so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenyshed, that whan they desyred to expresse eche to other the comforte, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they than receyued, the same comforte was of suche importaunce, that it mought none otherwyse be declared, but by abundance of teares, sent out of theyr eyen by vnspekable gladnes. More ouer the presence of you, whyche are kynges, do minyster to them that be inferiours vnto you, an amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of powers callyd naturall, contayned as well in the wytte and senses, as in the force or puissance of corporall membres. to the confirmation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, howe many men haue ben knowen, whyche er they haue attayned to the familyar acquayntaunce of kynges, haue bene demed to be, some but of a meane wytte and knowlege, some but of a base courage or prowesse, whiche afterwarde haue exceded in wytte or courage all mens expectations, and fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally bene of all men allowed for honourable and notable personages. Of this wonderfull maiestie in your royall person, most gracious souerayn lorde, I haue my selfe, in my selfe, late founde a meruaylous experience. For about a yere passed, I beganne a Dictionarie, declaryng latine by englishe, wherin I vsed lyttell study, beinge than occupied about my necessarye busy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whiche letted me from the exacte labour and study requisyte to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge of a perfyte Dictionarie: But whyles it was in printyng, and vneth the half deale performed, your hyghnes being informed therof, by the repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of gentyll maister Antony Denny, for his wysedome and diligence wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily callyd by your highnesse into your priuie Chamber, and of Wyllyam Tildisley, keper of your gracis Lybrarie, and after mooste specially by the recommendation of the most honourable lorde Crumwell, lorde priuie seale, fauourer of honestie, and next to your highnesse chiefe patron of vertue and cunnyng, conceyued of my labours a good expectation, and declaryng your moste noble and beneuolent nature, in fauouryng them that wyll be well oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, your hyghnesse in the presence of dyuers your noble men, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge myne enterprise, affirmed, that if I wolde ernestely trauayle therin,
<pb facs="3"/>
your highnes, as well with your excellent counsaile, as with suche bokes as your grace had, and I lacked, wold therin ayde me: with the which wordes, I confesse, I receiued a newe spirite, as me semed: wherby I founde forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with an augmentation of myn vnderstandynge, in so moche, as I iuged all that, whiche I had writen, not worthy to come in your gracis presence, with out an addition. Wherfore incontinent I caused the printes to cesse, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge at the letter M, where I lefte, I passed forth to the last letter with a more diligent study. And that done, I eftesones returned to the fyrst letter, and with a semblable diligence performed the temenant. In the whiche my proceding, I well perceyued, that all though dictionaries had ben gathered one of an other, yet nethelesse in eche of them ar omitted some latin wordes, interpreted in the bokes, whiche in order preceded. For Festus hath manye, whiche are not in Varros Analogi: Nonius hath some, whiche Festus lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: Nestor toke nat all that he founde in them bothe. Tortellius is not so abundant as he is diligent: Laurentius Valla wrate only of wordes, which are called elegancies, wherin he is vndoubtedly excellent: Perottus in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucopie, dyd omitte almost none that before him were written, but in wordis compounde he is to compendiouse: Fryere Calepine (but where he is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by other) nothyng amended, but rather appaired that which Perot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus had studiousely gathered: Nebressensis was both well lerned and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, as it appereth in some wordes, which he declareth in latin: but bicause in his dictionarie wordes are expounde in the spainyshe tunge, whiche I do nat vnderstand, I can nat of hym shewe myn opinion: Budeus in the exact triall of the natiue sence of wordes, aswell greke as latine, is assuredly right cōmendable, but he is moste occupied in the conference of phrasis of bothe the tunges, whiche in comparison are but in a fewe wordes: Dyuers other men haue written sondry annotations and commentaries on olde latine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, among whom also is discorde in their expositions. Whan I consydred all this, I was attached with an horrible feare, remembryng my dangerous enterprise (I being of so smal reputation in lernyng in comparison of them, whom I haue rehersed) as well for the difficultie in the true expressynge the lyuely sence of the latine wordes, as also the importable labours in serching expending and discussing the sentences of ancient writers. This premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abated my courage, and desperation was euen at hand to rent al in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that I had written, had nat the beames of your royal maiestie entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my harte, by remembraunce of the comforte, whiche I of your grace had lately receyued, wherwith my spirite was reuyued, and hath set vp the sayle of good courage, and vnder your graces gouernance, your highnesse being myn onely mayster, and styrer of the shyppe of all my good fortune, I am entred the goulfe of disdaynous enuie, hauynge fynished for this tyme this symple Dictionarie, wherin I dare affirme, may be founde a thousande mo latine wordes, than were togither in any one Dictionarie publyshed in this royalme at the tyme whan I fyrste began to write this commentarie, which is almost two yeres passed. For beside the conference of phrases or fourmes
<pb facs="4"/>
of speakynge latin and englishe, I haue also added proper termes belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge to lawe and phisike, the names of diuers herbes knowen among vs: also a good number of fishes founden as wel in our occean, as in our riuers: Moreouer sondrie poysis, coyne, and measures, sometyme vsed among the auncient Romaynes, Grekes, and Hebrues, whiche knowlege to the reders not only of histories and orations of Tullie, but also of holy scripture, and the bokes of auncient phisitions, shall be founde pleasant and also commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouse. Nor I haue omitted prouerbes, callyd Adagia, or other quicke sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, whiche I thought necessarie to be had in remembraunce. All be it for as moche as partely by negligence at the begynnynge, partly by vntrue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of them, whom I trusted, also by to moche trust had in Calepine, some fautes may be founden by dilygent redynge, I therfore most humbly beseche your excellent maiestie, that where your hyghnesse shall happen to doubte of any one worde in the fyrste parte of this warke, or perchance do lacke any worde, whiche your maiestie shall happen to rede in any good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that it maye lyke your grace to repayre incontinente vnto the seconde parte, whiche is myn addition, sekyng there for the same worde in the letter, wherwith he begynneth, trustynge veryly, that your highnes there shall be satisfied. And for as moche as by haste made in printyng, some letters may happen to lacke, some to be sette in wronge places, or the ortography nat to be truely obserued, I therfore haue put all those fautes in a table folowing this preface: wherby they may be easily corrected: and that done, I truste in god no manne shall fynde cause to reiect this boke, but rather thankefully to take my good wyll and labours, gyuynge to your maiestie mooste hartye thankes, as to the chiefe author therof, by whose gracious meanes menne beinge studious, may vnderstande better the latine tunge in syxe monethes, than they mought haue doone afore in thre yeres, withoute perfyte instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, whyche are not many, and suche as be, are not easy to come by: the cause I nede not to reherse, sens I ones declared it in my booke called the Gouernour, whiche about .viii. yeres passed, I dydde dedicate vnto your hyghnesse. And for my parte, I render most humble thankes vnto your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, for the good estimation that your grace retayneth of my poore lerning and honestie, promysynge therfore to your highnes, that duryng my lyfe naturall, I shall faythfully employe all the powers of my wytte and body, to serue truely your maiestie in euery thynge, wherto your mooste excellent iudgement, shall thynke my seruyce conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient &amp; necessary, In the meane tyme and alway, as your bounden seruant, I shal hartily pray vnto god, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spere your hyghenes in all your vertuouse proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynges, grauntynge also that your maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie may longe raigne ouer vs, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable comforte and ioye of all your naturall and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge subiectes. <hi>AMEN.</hi>
