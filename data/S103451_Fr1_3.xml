   <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT to the Reader.</head>
   <p>CHristian Reader, I take not vpon me to speake so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Author, or his labour, as may match their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, or raise mens thoughts to any higher straine of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or admiration of the same. Yet if my wordes were of so great weight, and my testimony of that worth, that I might in discharge of this dutie, procure them their due: It were a labour neither mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed nor mispent: seeing <hi>that</hi> is no lesse due to the Gratious man, then to the vertuous woman, <hi>Giue him of the fruits of his hands and let his owne workes praise him in the Gates.</hi> Howsoever, for my own part, I cannot but speake what I haue found and felt. <hi>Wisdome herselfe</hi> (it seemeth) had a purpose to broach <hi>some of her best wines</hi> when she made a vent in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>is Vessell, and called so earnestly vpon <hi>all that thirst, to come, and buy wine without mony, and drinke freely.</hi> It is now about <hi>12</hi> yeares ago since first I tasted of this wine, aboue <hi>30</hi> since first it was mingled, &amp; reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to cheere the hearts of Gods children: and yet, old as it is, it is so pleasant, and wholsome at this houre, that hee that drinkes of this old, will not streight desire new, but will doubtlesse acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the old is better. It was then a <hi>cup of salvation and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> first tempred for, and ministred vnto the Spouse of Christ, as a <hi>Preservatiue</hi> against the <hi>cup of abhominatiō in the whores fist</hi>; and as a <hi>Confortatiue</hi> against the cup of <hi>Affliction in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hand,</hi> whereof she must needs tast and pledg her <hi>Lord,</hi> that had himselfe begunne so deepe vnto her. And I nothing doubt but as the tast yet remaineth, so the vigor and vertue will bee now no lesse effectuall then before. Is any weake and feeble, wanting a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall appetite vnto heavenly Manna and wholsome food? let him drinke a little of this wine for his stomacke sake, and for his often infirmities. It shall refresh his spirits, warme his heart, &amp; quicken his desires vnto good things. Hath any drunk so deep of the whores Chalice, that being giddy therewithall, hee reeles and staggers in opinion, &amp; religion, as a drunken man? and is ready to sinke downe
<pb facs="4"/>
and perish in his sinne? O then giue him of this soveraigne &amp; sweet wine; <hi>and stay him with these flagons, comfort him with these apples</hi>; and if once <hi>he thirst, and drinke of this fountaine,</hi> if once <hi>he hunger and eat of this fruit,</hi> he shall be sicke of loue, &amp; his soul shall liue. I adde no more.</p>
   <p>Only be advertised, Christian Reader, that albeit the copy which I had, was for the Bulke and body of it, reasonable intire, yet was it not without some blemishes, &amp; breaches as it came to my hands, which by some other helpe that I had, I laboured to repair. For Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, &amp; Proofes, I found it very naked &amp; bare, &amp; haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made such supply in the marg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nt out of mine own observation, &amp; provisiō, as might giue some better cōtentment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o such as should desire to see, and search farther into such things. Which I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mention, that if any thing in the margent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ee not so well and fitly suited, &amp; matched with the tenour of the Text: the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and my selfe might divide the fault betwixt vs, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor might be free Wahtsoever my paines haue beene in searching out, and setting downe testimonies of Scripture and Controversie recordes of Story and Antiquitie (as the great varietie of matter herein contained did evidently require) The comfort I haue taken in the booke it selfe, the loue I haue ever borne vnto the Author, and the hope I haue conceaued of the benefit that may grow vnto many thousands by putting it forth vnto publike view, haue light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and lessened▪ yea swallowed vp, and devoured all. Wherefore Christian Reader, commending this to thy vse, and thy selfe to Gods Grace, I intreat a favorable acceptance of my poore labours, and a portion in thy hearty prayers, and so ever rest,</p>
