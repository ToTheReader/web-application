For the worth of the books of <hi>Offices</hi> themselues, I referre thee to the Epistle Dedicatory. For the slips which thou shalt meete with herein, which I know to be very many (as in all the rest of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, chiefly through want of meete helps of bookes and conference, and also time to peruse in the midst of my continuall imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in my Calling, vvherein I am still labouring as God vouchsafes mercy, not only for the priuate, but for thine and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke good, as also thorow my absence from the Presse) let me intreat thy curteous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and direction to the Printer, that hee may conuey it vnto me, as some louingly haue done: future Editions may reforme it.
