   <p>The Conclusion of the Booke: to the Reader.</p>
   <p>THus farre (gentle Reader) I thought good, out of my slender capacitie, to acquaint thée with a briefe and plaine discourse of my Trauell, which though it be rude, as comming from a barren brayne, which professeth nothing lesse then lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: yet assure thy selfe it containes vndoubted truth, being no more then I haue séene, knowne, and to my griefe and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill felt. And if any, as well or better acquainted with these Parts, or any of them, whereof I make mention, disliking the rudenesse of my stile, will vndertake to refine it, hée giues me no discontent, so he derogate not from the truth thereof. And whereas I made promise in the beginning of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, in these twelue discourses, to touch or speake something of the rest of the places, specified in the Table, I haue partly performed it: but to haue written of them at large, would haue béene but friuolous and superfluous, partly because they are places of no extraordinary note, but specially because they doe in most, or all things, agrée with the Countries to which they are annexed, and tributaries, or vassalls: as the Ilands tributary to the Spaniards, follow their manner of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, customes, and orders. The Turkish tributaries imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them in most things: and so you may iudge of the rest, according as they are seuerally distinguished. And so much may suffice to cléere that doubt. Now the reasons that vrged me to publish this Booke are manifold, but chiefly three: The first was, to keepe in record, and make knowne my owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, lest with the forgetfull Butler in Pharaos Prison, who being deliuered forgat his promise made to <hi>Ioseph.</hi> that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his deliuery: so I (such is infirmitie and frailtie of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature) might (cheaked with worldly prosperitie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my mercifull and mightie Deliuerer. The second was, that others (warned by my misery) might shun the like. The last and chiefest reason was, to glorifie God, especially heere in England, which aboue all earthly Countries and Nations is most bound to extend and set forth his glory. For what


<pb facs="21"/>
Christian, reading but the extreame thraldome and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath inflicted vpon the Jewes, euen to this houre, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Nation he had once selected to himselfe from amongst all the Nations of the earth. Or the present misery of the Gréekes, who once were Monarches of the Earth, and one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Churches of Christendome, being the first fruits of the Gentiles, whose extreame bondage is now lamentable, yet not with the Israelites, sacrificing their children to Idols, but forced to giue as well the tenth of their children, as of their substance to that monstrous <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Idoll the Turke. Or who, duly pondering the blindnesse and obstinacie of the Spaniards, Pope, and Italians, with the horrible and absurd sinnes that God hath giuen them ouer to: Or who, séeing the Infidelitie of the simple <hi>Indian</hi> (well may I call him sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, because his errour grows more of want of true knowledge then obstinacie) who worships the creature, being ignorant of the Almightie Creator? What English heart (I say) duly pondering these things in generall, or any one of these things in particular, can otherwise choose but falling downe on his bended knées, yéeld God immortall and innumerable thanks and prayse-giuing, not onely for electing him aboue all other Nations of the Earth, to the true and perfect knowledge of his blessed Gospell, but also for preseruing him so long from so many miseries and wretched thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, whereunto most Nations of the Earth are subiect?</p>
