   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>SEing these Epistles are now at length made publique, it is imagined that I ought to bee accountable to the world of my priuate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, chiefely for mine own discharge, least being mistaken, I fall in hazard of a iust &amp; vniuersall reprehension, for — <hi>Itae nugae seria ducent In mala derisum semel exceptumque sinistre.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Three poynts are especially therefore to bee explaned. First, why I entitle this worke <hi>Englands heroicall Epistles;</hi> then why I obserue not the persons dignitie in the dedication; lastlie, why I haue annexed notes to euery Epistles end. For the first, the title I hope carrieth reason in it selfe, for that the most and greatest persons berein were English, or else, that theyr loues were obtained in England. And though (heroicall) be properly vnderstood of demi-gods, as of <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> whose Parents were said to be the one celestiall, the other mortall, yet is it also transferred to them who for the greatnes of minde come neere to Gods. For to be borne of a celestiall Incubus, is nothing els but to haue a great and mightie spirit, farre aboue the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakenes of men, in which sence <hi>Ouid</hi> (whose imitator I partly professe to be) dooth also vse heroicall. For the second, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none to whom I haue dedicated any two Epistles, but haue their states ouer-matched by them who are made to speake in the Epistles, how euer the order is in dedication, yet in respect of
<pb facs="3"/>
theyr degrees in my deuotion, &amp; the cause before recited, I hope they suffer no disparagement, seeing euery one is the first in theyr particuler interest, hauing in some sort, sorted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection of the Epistles, to the character of theyr iudgements to whom I dedicate them; excepting onely the blamefulnes of the persons passion, in those poynts wherein the passion is blameful. Lastly, such manifest difference beeing betwixt euery one of thē, where or howsoeuer they be marshaled, how can I be iustly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached of vnaduisement. For the third, because the worke might in truth be iudged brainish, if nothing but amorous humor were handled therein, I haue inter-wouen matters historicall, which vnexplaned, might defraud the minde of much content; as for example, in Queene <hi>Margarits</hi> Epistle to <hi>VVilliam de la Pole,</hi>
   </p>
   <p>My Daizie flower, which once perfum'd the ayre,</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Margarite</hi> in french signifies a Dazie, which for the allusion to her name, this Queene did giue for her deuise: and this as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more, haue seemed to mee not vnwoorthy the explaning. Now, though no doubt I had need to excuse other things beside, yet these most especially, the rest Iouer-passe to eschue tedious recitall, or to speake as malicious enuie may, for that in truth I ouer-see them. If they bee as harmelesly taken as I meant them, it shall suffise to haue onely tonched the cause of the title, of the dedications, and of the notes, whereby emboldned to publish the residue, (these not beeing accounted in mens opinions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 words">
         <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
      </gap>) I shall not lastly be afraid to beleeue &amp; acknowledge thee a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reader.</p>
