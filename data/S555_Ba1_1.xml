   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause there is mention made in this
Sermon of a Ring sent vnto that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
person by his most sacred Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
the humble acceptance whereof is
set downe with so gratefull remembrance of his dutie
and deuotion to his Highnesse; and because the words
otherwise imply a great deale of obseruable matter, I
haue thought it not amisse to offer them to more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
view, as they are deliuered by his Lordship in his
last will: which is as followeth.</p>
   <div type="will">
      <p>ALso I giue, will and bequeath vnto my sayd wel-beloued
sonne ROBERT Lord BVCKHVRST
after my decease for and during his life onely, out of
those Iewels of Golde, Pearle and Precious stone,
which I keepe and reserue as Iewels for my selfe, the
sole vse and occupation only of one Ring of Golde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameled
blacke, and set round ouer all the whole Ring
with Diamonds to the number of twentie, whereof
fiue Diamonds being placed in the vppermost part of
the said Ring do represent the fashion of a Crosse; and
the other fifteene are set round and ouer all the sayd
<pb n="28" facs="17"/>
Ring. And after the decease of my said sonne BVCK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HVRST,
then I giue, will, and bequeath the like sole
vse and occupation only of the said Ring vnto my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
RICHARD SACKVILLE, his eldest sonne, for
and during his life only. And after his decease, then
vnto the next heire male begotten of the bodie of the
sayd RICHARD SACKVILLE my Nephew,
for and during his life only. And so from heire male
to heire male of the SACKVILLS, after the decease of
euery of them seuerally and successiuely for and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the life and liues only of euery such heire male se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally
and successiuely: charging and earnestly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all and euery of my said heire males before speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
euen as they regard the last request of him by
whose great trauell, care and industrie (if the Diuine
prouidence of God that hath vouchsafed to giue it,
shall so please to continue it) they are like to receiue
the addition and aduancement of so great honor, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
and patrimonie, that although percase in this
strict course of the common lawes of this Realme, the
Entaile of goods and chattels may hardly stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
that yet for the preseruation and continuance of
this gift of mine intended by mee to remaine as an
heire-lome to the house and familie of the SACK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VILLS,
so long as almightie God (according to the
effects of his former goodnesse vnto that house, by the
continuance thereof during the space of so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres past) shall please to vpholde the same, they
and euery of them will forbeare in any sort to oppugne
it, or to bring it in question, or to brandle and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
the will of their so well deseruing Ancestour, and
specially in a matter so honest, reasonable, fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
<pb n="29" facs="17"/>
as this is, but rather with all willing, readie
and contented mindes to suffer the same to passe as an
heire-lome, from heire male to heire male, according
to the true intent and meaning of this my last will and
Testament in that behalfe. Which said Ring set all
ouer with twentie Diamonds, as is aforesaid, I desire &amp;
charge my said sonne BVCKHVRST vpon my bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and in like sort all other the heires male, whom
God shall vouchsafe from age to age to raise vnto my
house and familie, and vnto whom (if the Highest so
please) my heartie desire and meaning is, the said Ring
set with twenty Diamonds, as is aforesaid, may lineally
and successiuely descend and come for euer, namely,
that with all prouident care and heedfull circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
they will safely keepe, retaine, and preserue the
said Ring whensoeuer and as often as he shall come to
their hands and possession, euen as one of the greatest
gifts and iewels which (in true estimation) all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
considered, I haue to leaue vnto them. And
to the intent they may know how iust and great cause
both they and I haue to holde the said Ring in so high
esteeme, it is most requisite that I doe heere set downe
the whole course and circumstance how and from
whom the said Ring did come to my possession, which
was thus: In the beginning of the moneth of Iune
1607 this Ring thus set with twentie Diamonds, as
is aforesaid, was sent vnto me from my most gracious
Souereigne King Iames, by that honorable personage
the Lord <hi>Hay,</hi> one of the Gentlemen of his Highnesse
Bed-chamber, the Court then being at <hi>Whitehall</hi> in
<hi>London,</hi> and I at that time remaining at <hi>Horsley</hi> house
in <hi>Surrey,</hi> twentie miles from <hi>London,</hi> where I lay in
<pb n="30" facs="18"/>
such extremitie of sicknesse as it was a common and a
constant report ouer all <hi>London,</hi> that I was dead, and
the same confidently affirmed euen vnto the Kings
Highnesse himselfe. Vpon which occasion it pleased
his most excellent Maiestie, in token of his gratious
goodnesse and great fauour towards me, to send the
said Lord <hi>Haie</hi> with the sayd Ring, and this royall mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
vnto me; namely, <hi>That his Highnesse
heartily wished a speedie and perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie
of my health, with all happie and
good successe vnto me; and that I might
liue as long as the Diamonds of that
Ring (which therewithall he deliuered
vnto me) did endure: And in token
thereof required me to we are it and keepe
it for his sake.</hi> This most gratious and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
message restored a new life vnto me, as comming
from so renowmed and benigne a Souereigne, vnto a
seruant so farre vnworthy of so great a fauour; and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom, not long before, it had pleased his Maiestie,
yea in that very first day wherein we all had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
to beholde him, not only to bestow the honor
of a Priuie Counseller, but also without any answerable
desert or merit of mine preceding, to confirme that
most honourable place of High Treasurer of England
vnto me, which the late Queene ELIZABETH after
foureteene yeeres seruice and ten yeeres following her
<pb n="31" facs="18"/>
Court (but not before) vouchsafed (I must needs yet
say most gratiously so soon as it became void) to grant
vnto me, and likewise within a short time after to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
both me and my succession to the high honor &amp;
degree of an Earle; which is and shall be to me, my
house and posteritie, an euerliuing demonstration, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
of his great benefit to vs, as of our infinite bond
to him thereby for euer. The which inexplicable
goodnesse of his Maiestie towards me, besides many
lustres of his bright shining fauours, from time to time
cast vpon me, doe giue me iust cause to agnize, that I
am no waies able to merit, no not the least part of
them, but onely with the humble and infinite earnestie
of my heart in desire to deserue; which I can yet no
waies manifest, but by that faithfull testimonie which
shall neuer faile in me, namely, by demonstration of
mine incessant cares, labours and actuall indeuors for
the behoofe and furtherance of his Maiestiesâª ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices,
at the least thereby to shew that good will which
is in me, though I cannot shew that effect which is due
to him, since all that I possibly can or may doe, is but
meere debt and dutie, and so in that course to spend
such remaine of life as is left vnto me, yea euen to the
very last of my daies here, &amp; when I am dead &amp; gone,
if euer occasion may or shall be offered to any of my
posteritie to doe his Maiestie or any of his any accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
seruice heereafter, then let them hold &amp; esteeme
themselues most happie, if with the expence of life, &amp;
of all the fortunes that this world shall giue them, they
may actually approoue and witnesse with effect, that
they are not onely most loyall and dutifull vassals to
this Imperiall Crowne, but also the most humble,
<pb n="32" facs="19"/>
faithfull, and thankfull sonnes and sequell of such a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
as was more bound vnto King IAMES, his liege
Master, than euer subiect was vnto his Soueraigne,
especially he being such a Soueraigne, adorned with
such excellent parts of iustice, clemencie, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
indued with so admirable gifts of memory, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and iudgement, and finally beautified with so
many other regall graces and vertues so farre beyond
all the Kings and Princes that either written storie or
this present age hath to present vnto vs, as I know not
how any greater honor and felicitie can possiblie be
added to the imperiall Crowne of and in this <hi>Great
Britaine,</hi> by his vndoubted right so happily vnited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, than we now presently possesse and enioy in the
Royall person of this our so renowmed and so rare a
King. Beseeching the eternall God, that he and his
may euermore both rule and raigne ouer vs, yea euen
as long as the Sunne and Moone endureth: and that
I and mine may for euer and euer become more and
more thankfull, (at the least if it be possibly in me) for
so great honors, graces, and fauors, as this most cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and renowmed King hath thus most gratiously
vouchsafed vnto me; the remembrance of which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it may neuer die but be perpetually recorded in
the mindes of those, that by the grace &amp; goodnesse of
almighty God, both now are, &amp; hereafter shall be the
lineall stirpe and succession of my house and family, to
serue both him &amp; his: I haue heere therefore set downe
this short narration, of the true state and circumstance
of the whole matter, to the intent it may remaine to
my posterity heereafter, as a faithfull memorie thereof
euen in this my last Will and Testament for euer.</p>
