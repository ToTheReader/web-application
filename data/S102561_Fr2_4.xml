   <head>The Commentarie of Iohn Caluine,
vpon the Gospel after Iohn.</head>
   <head type="sub">The Preface.</head>
   <head type="sub">¶To the right honorable Lordes, the Syndiques and Senate of
Geneua, his right reuerende Lordes Iohn Caluine wisheth
from the Lorde, the spirit of wisdome and strength, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
successe of gouernement.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S often as I call to mynde that saying of
Christe, wherin he maketh so great accoūt
of that dutie of humanitie which is besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
vpon the gathering together of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
that he maketh account of it as done
to him: I do therewithall remember vnto
how great honour hee hath vouchsafed to promote you,
who hath made your Citie a place not for one or a few to
dwell in, but a common Inne for his Church to lodge in,
Hospitalitie hath not only been cōmended amongst the
Heathen, but it hath also bin accounted one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
vertues: and therfore in whomsoeuer they wold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
extreeme barbarisme and manner altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuill,
they called them <hi>axenous,</hi> or men which were not
giuen to hospitalitie. But farre more excellent is
your praise, bicause the Lord hath appointed you in these
troublesome &amp; miserable times, to be those vnto whose
tuition the godly might cōmit thēselues, &amp; vnder whose
feathers the innocent might be shrouded, whom the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
of Antichrist, being no lesse sauage then sacriligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
doth chase &amp; driue away out of their own countries
&amp; natiue soyle. And this is not all, but he hath also dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
an holy house amongest you vnto his owne name,
where he may be worshipped sincerely. Whosoeuer he be
that indeuoureth either publikelie to cut off, or priuilie
to take away the least part of these two, he doth not only
goe about to disfigure your Citie beeing spoyled of her
principal ornaments, but also he maliciously enuieth the
helth therof. For althogh those godly good turnes which
<pb n="2" facs="439"/>
are here done vnto Christ &amp; his dispearsed members doe
cause the wicked like dogs to bark against you, yet ought
this one recōpence to suffice you y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the angels frō heauen
&amp; the childrē of God out of all partes of the worlde doe
blesse you: so that you may freely despise their rotten rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
who make no more conscience, neither are more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to spue out whatsoeuer, against God himself, thē
against you: &amp; which, going about to slander you, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
first to blaspheme God. Althogh this self same occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth inflame y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> hatred of many against you, yet ought
you to be no whit afraid therfore, so long as he wil assist
you against their fury, who hath promised y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he will faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
keepe those cities, wherin the doctrine of his gospel
is preached, and any resting place is prepared for those
godly mē whō the world cānot away with. I omit to speak
of this, that you neede not to care for pacifying of this
kinde of enemies, seeing that there is no mā who hateth
you for the gospels sake, who wold not either haue you de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stroied
or oppressed. But admit we graunt that the sworn
enimies of soūd doctrine do hate you for no other cause
saue this, because they see you defend the same: yet set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
light by their practises &amp; threatnings, you must vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
maintain these two inuincible fortresses, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> worship
of pure religiō, &amp; the godly care to nourish the Church,
which Christ hath cōmitted to you, that you may broude
the same vnder your wings. As touching those railinges
wherwith the pope his meritorious brawlers doe molest
vs, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we are fallē away frō the Church, because we dissent
frō the Sea of Rome: would to God we could testifie with
full cōfidēce, before God &amp; his angels, that wee are most
far distāt frō that pollutiō, as we can acquit our selues of
y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> crime which they vse to lay to our charge. They make
their boast of the catholike church, who haue left no part
of al the doctrine of the law &amp; the gospel free from filthy
corruptions, who haue prophaned the whole worship of
God with the stink of superstition, who haue not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to corrupt all god his decrees with their inuētions.
<pb n="3" facs="439"/>
Yea, the multitude of errors wherwith they haue subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
al religiō is so vniuersal, that they are sufficiēt to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme
&amp; destroy the church an 100. times. Therfore we
cā neuer extol so highly as it deserueth, the infinit good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of God, wherby it is come to passe, that wee escaping
myraculously out of that deadly gulf, haue the anchor of
our faith firmly fixed in the soūd &amp; eternal truth of god.
And truly this one Cōmentarie shall sufficiētly testifie (as
I hope) that papistrie is nothing els but a monster com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of innumerable errors of Satā, &amp; that that church
which they obiect vnto vs is more confused thē <hi>Babylō.</hi> In
the mean season I wil freely cōfes y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> truth: that we are not
far enough distāt from the filth of that pit, whose conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
doth spread it self too far. Antichrist doth cōplayne
that we are slipt away from him: but we are compelled to
mourne, for that too too many of his vices, wherwith he
hath infected the world, do remaine amongst vs. Vnto vs
is restored the sincere puritie of doctrine, perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the simple worship of God, the right order of the
sacramēts, which was deliuered by Christ. But the chifest
cause why there is not amongst vs such reformatiō of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ners
&amp; amēdment of life as there ought to be, is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a great part being as yet mindful of that vnbride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
libertie, wherewith the Papistes doe freely waxe wā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
against God, cannot accustome thēselues to Christes
yoke. Therefore whereas our aduersaries (to the ende
they may cause the vnskilful vniustly to hate vs) do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously
crie out that we haue broken all good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
&amp; discipline, their false slander is refuted sufficiently
with this one thynge (though wee doe hold our peace,)
in that there is nothyng, aboute whiche wee haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contention amongest our selues, then this: namely,
our rigour, which, as some men thynke, is immoderate.
But seeinge that you are able verye well to witnesse
with mee, and those who are my fellowes in office,
that wee are no more seuere or straite then the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of our office doeth require, and also inforce vs
<pb n="4" facs="440"/>
to bee as we doe rest safely in the iudgement of your cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scicience,
so on the otherside you may easily iudge, as
though the matter were before you, how ridiculous the
impudencie of our aduersaries is on this behalfe,</p>
   <p>Now (that I may speake somewhat particularly of my
selfe) although I am persuaded that all the worlde doeth
know how I haue instructed this church with many of my
writings, yet I thoght it would be worth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> paines if there
should some monumēt therof be extant, which should be
dedicated vnto you. For it skilleth much that that kinde
of doctrine be set before all men, which you know, I haue
taught. And although I haue endeuoured to profite you
&amp; the people which is cōmitted vnto you euen after my
death, in those bookes which I haue hitherto published,
&amp; it is not meete that that doctrine, whiche hath flowed
out of your Citie vnto other nations far &amp; wyde shoulde
bring foorth fruit pentifully, &amp; be neglected in her owne
place: yet I hope that this cōmentarie which is peculiarly
cōsecrated vnto your name, wil take deeper root in your
memory. And that this thing may com to passe, I beseech
the liuing God so deeply to write the same in your harts,
that it may not bee blotted out by any subtile sleight of
Satā. For it is in his hands to giue successe vnto my labors
who hath of late giuen mee this minde, to desire nothing
more, thē faithfully to care for the saluatiō of you al. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
as I profes before the world, that I am far frō
that diligēce of a good shepheard, which is exacted, &amp; frō
other vertues which the greatnes &amp; excellēcy of mine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
do require, &amp; do cōtinually before god bewaile mine
estate, for that I am troubled with so many vices whiche
do hinder my course: so I dare prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>st that I wāt no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
&amp; good will. And if in the meane while the wicked
do not cease to repine &amp; speak against me, as it is my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
by well doing to refute their slanders, so it shalbe your
part to suppresse the same by that holy authoritie wherin
you excell. Farewell my right honorable Lordes, whom
I ought to reuerence in Christ, vnto whose tuition I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
you. At <hi>Geneua</hi> the first of Ianuary, 1553.</p>
