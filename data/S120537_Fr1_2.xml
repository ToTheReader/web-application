      <salute>❧ TO THE RIGHT Worsh. Sir <hi>WILLIAM AYLOFE,</hi> Knight Barronet, and chiefe Iustice of the liberties of <hi>HAVERING vpon the Bower: Grace</hi> and peace from the Father, Prince, and Spirit of Peace, <hi>AMEN.</hi>
      </salute>

   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>RVTH</hi> speakes with <hi>plainnesse,</hi> and <hi>modestie</hi> beares with <hi>patience;</hi> the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the one, might disturbe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the other; but truth keepes modestie from <hi>blushing,</hi> and modestie preserues truth from <hi>shaming:</hi> No shame for plainnesse, whose plainnesse is the truth; nor blushing for modesty, whose forbearance is patience; which is hardly angred, but soone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled; easily iniured, but seldome offending; sparing much, but stirring little: these two are so priuiledged, that they may keep their court where they please, without controlment of the proudest. But alas, the <hi>fashion</hi> of this world is changed, and all is become <hi>complement;</hi> hee is no compleat <hi>Gentleman,</hi> that cannot be as humble as the <hi>toe;</hi> as <hi>plaine,</hi> as if he meant to open all his heart; and as <hi>modest,</hi> as though hee had learned a whole yeare to compose his gesture: but <hi>nature</hi> forced, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies most vnruly; and the face that hath most flushings of heat, hath the coldest heart; and burnings without, are coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers within. <hi>Maskes</hi> once serued for sporting, but I feare them now to bee vsed in good earnest: <hi>painting</hi> was but a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb facs="3"/>but now it's the best substance: yet let me tell this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered age, that painting is meeter for <hi>ragged walls,</hi> then fine marble; for an unruly <hi>Iezebel,</hi> then a chast matron: in a word, all strange complements, they are no better then court holy water, or a Popes blessing; and I am sure, where hee blesseth, God curseth. The earth is full of faire <hi>words,</hi> but they pay no <hi>debts,</hi> neither is any man the richer for them. And I would to God the fashion had rested in the bodie; but woe is me, it is crept into the soule, and makes all learning but a flourish: Therefore I thought it (right Worsh.) verie good to abstaine from the fashion, because in all kinds, we may finde them by experience to he but a daies wearing: The <hi>Taylors</hi> care is ouer, if he hit the cut; the <hi>Shooemaker,</hi> if his shooe hold the pulling on: and euery trades-man thinkes his shop then best furnished, when his wares wil serue the time: but for my part, I know not how to cut out the truth, better then by <hi>plainnesse;</hi> to plucke it on, then by <hi>modestie;</hi> and make it serue the time, then by <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi> I care for no more, if so be I may but be a friend of the bridegroome, to wooe his spouse; or as one of his eunuches to trimme her for himselfe: neither euer did I intend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for welcome by flatterie, which is alwaies intertained as long as selfe-loue is at home: and to what purpose should I be more curious? I am sure that the painting of windowes stops the light, and that plainer <hi>glasse,</hi> would permit the sunne a clearer entrance: a <hi>black ground</hi> best beseemes a <hi>white counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit;</hi> and a faire <hi>countenance</hi> needs no varnish: where the wine is neate, there needeth no ivy-bush; neither the right <hi>corall</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny colouring: So where the <hi>truth</hi> it selfe bringeth credit, the man with his glosse, winneth small commendation: where the matter is of sufficient excellencie, there is more shew of a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant wit, then perfect wisedome to vse superfluous eloquence: the naked tale most sets forth the naked truth, and the plainest style, is the soonest vnderstood. I do not condemn eloquence or humane learning in diuine mysteries; it is lawful, I confesse, for the Israelites to take <hi>iewels, gold, siluer,</hi> and other precious <hi>ornaments;</hi> but let them take heede how they vse them, least they make a <hi>calfe,</hi> and then they loose their beautie, hauing
<pb facs="3"/>lost their true seruice. Neither would I be so curious in trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vp of the truth, as though my greatest care should be for the habit of words: for I know that skilfull <hi>Apelles,</hi> coueting to mend the <hi>nose,</hi> marred the <hi>cheeke;</hi> and often the foolish dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is not content with the die of his cloth, vntill he haue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it. I know the <hi>word of God</hi> hath been sufficiently tryed to my hands, and the holy Ghost hath giuen it a sufficient tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of beautie. Indeede, in nature there is no <hi>tree,</hi> but hath some blast; no <hi>countenance,</hi> but hath some blemish; the fairest <hi>leopard</hi> is not without his spots; the finest cloth is made with his list, and the smoothest <hi>shooe</hi> with his laste: But the word of God is a <hi>tree of life</hi> that is neuer blasted, a <hi>glasse</hi> that doth neuer shew vs a blemished countenance, a <hi>store-house</hi> of all garments to be worne without list or seame; and as strong as a leopard, without any spot or blemish; a gospel of peace, prepared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any wooden laste of humane eloquence, and yet sits as close to the feete of the soule, as heart can wish. Neither doe I speake this to excuse my selfe; for I might well learne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the <hi>Estrich,</hi> that though she taketh greatest pride in her feathers, yet is content to picke some of the worst out, and burne them: so might I picke out many things and purge them in the fire. <hi>Alexander</hi> laid his singer on his cheeke, least <hi>Apelles</hi> should paint his skarre: but it is my mind to hold my finger off my skarres, least some skilfull <hi>Apelles</hi> paint the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not couering but pointing at the skarre; and so lay open as much hypocrisie in the writer, as blemishes in the writing. Therefore (right Worsh.) seeing I am to vndergoe censure, and bee brought before euerie mans iudgement seat, I haue great cause to seek out my <hi>aduocate</hi> and patron: <hi>Iudicem aditu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus? patronum quare;</hi> must you before a Iudge? seeke out your patron. In duty and loue I could seeke none beside your selfe, &amp; my confidence of your acceptation is so strong, that I feare not the least deniall: you gaue me the first entertainement that euer I had abroad, and therefore in reason I could not but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you with the first fruits of my labours. I doubt not but that your selfe doth both see and bewaile the miserie of these wretched times, in which <hi>Atheisme,</hi> and <hi>Policie</hi> (falsly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb facs="4"/>beeing indeed little better then plaine villanie) and <hi>Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing,</hi> haue like a canker, fretted out the verie heart of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Few there are that seeke for established hearts, and to know precisely whether <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Baal</hi> bee the true God: and for resolution, they resolue that the best course is to <hi>halt betweene two opinions,</hi> that so all times might serue their turnes. But <hi>you haue not so learned Christ:</hi> for this can I testifie of your paine &amp; diligence, that you labour for nothing more, then the gaining of <hi>aduised resolution.</hi> If I should say all that I know, the world would censure me of flattery: and if I knewe that selfe-loue were at home with your selfe, then should I neuer feare want of intertainment in learning to dissemble: but both the world, and your selfe must pardon my boldnesse; for I speake not to blaze abroad your praise, but to intreat that kindnesse, that men would admit of your <hi>example,</hi> as a <hi>patterne for imitation.</hi> Three things constraine mee to vtter my mind: First, that continuall care which you haue for resolution of many difficulties in <hi>diuinity:</hi> the means which you haue vsed are but practised of few: one is, that you haue not bin content to take your resolution of diuine truth from <hi>translations;</hi> but haue taken that paines, that you are able to fetch it from the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall,</hi> and drinke of the purest fountaine: A second meanes is, that of the Philosopher, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, to make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of matters of <hi>religion,</hi> whensoeuer you haue seene iust op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, and fit persons to resolue; neither haue you been content to admit of <hi>superficiall answers,</hi> but haue pressed <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> vpon them to see the true tryall; and often your own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions haue bin more agreeable with the truth and <hi>context of Sciptures,</hi> then that which others haue said: let this teach men of your place, besides their continuall imploiments, to set some time apart, for this excellent knowledge of the <hi>originalls of the Bible,</hi> and knowledge of that art. A second good example is, your continual care that the <hi>legges of iustice</hi> may not lie broken in the <hi>streets,</hi> and no man to raise it vp: A happie thing when men of place count their dignities to be conferred, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good for <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> Thirdly, for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>election,</hi> this you onely haue not affirmed by word, but
<pb facs="4"/>performed by action, that the place, more then the person, might haue cause to reioyce. For my selfe, I confesse I had no cause to be i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ticed from you, as the <hi>Leuite</hi> was from <hi>Micah,</hi> Iudg. 17. to become a <hi>Priest vnto a Tribe or familie in Israel:</hi> but least through ignorance I should as soon serue in the ministery of <hi>Idols,</hi> as the <hi>true God,</hi> I desired to be a little longer trained vp in the <hi>schooles of the Prophets.</hi> For my loue vnto your <hi>familie,</hi> whereof once I was a member, it is this, that all of them might <hi>knowe the God of their fathers, and serue him with a perfect heart, &amp; a willing mind.</hi> For your <hi>vertuous Lady,</hi> whō God hath made as a <hi>fruitful vine on the sides of your house,</hi> that she might likewise grow into the true Vine, <hi>Christ Iesus;</hi> and be fruitfull vnto her owne saluation. For all your <hi>children,</hi> that they might be as the <hi>Oliue plants of God round about your table.</hi> For your eldest son <hi>Beniamin;</hi> (I hope in name and nature the <hi>sonne</hi> of your <hi>right hand</hi>) the Lord make him the <hi>strength and crowne of your age,</hi> the <hi>excellencie of your dignitie,</hi> and the <hi>excellencie of your power.</hi> But I feare I haue alreadie offended; your desire is breuitie: therefore to conclude, I commend and commit this small la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to your <hi>patronage:</hi> the text I am sure is excellent for these dayes: but for my manner of handling it, I leaue it to the <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Gods Church:</hi> How-euer it be, I do more then hope, that you will kindly accept it from me, and entertaine it as a <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of my loue;</hi> and not onely so, but vse it for your comfort. Now <hi>the God of peace that brought againe from the dead our Lord Iesus, the great Shepheard of the sheepe, through the blood of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting couenant; make you perfect in all good workes, to doe his will, working in you that which is pleasant in his sight: to whom be praise for euer, and euer.</hi> Amen.</p>
