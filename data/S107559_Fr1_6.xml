   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no man liuing vnder the Sun, which feeleth not the painfull effect of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, in the bitter sence of wofull miseries. But the godly and best disposed persons, in whatsoeuer time, place, or calling they liue, are constrained with <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cirene</hi> to beare the Crosse after their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Christ. For why, there be not only ministred vnto them many mightie causes of <hi>Discontentation,</hi> through those greeuous oppressiōs vrged on them by the vngodly, whom the Lord maketh his roddes to correct and punish his owne when they offende him: wherby the very heart of <hi>Mary</hi> is pearced with the sword, as <hi>Simeon</hi> prophesied: but also the holie spirit in them is moued, through the horrible sinnes and greeuous offences of the ingratefull against God, to driue the mestiue mill of lamentation, with flouds of weeping teares. All rhe which (neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse) the Lord of mercie, and God of consolation, mittigateth and moderateth in them that feare and loue him, both by the inward comforts of his spirit, and by the externall ministerie of his word. But as for the vngodly (which are meere straungers from the wombe, and naturally deuoyd of peace, like the raging waues of the sea that cast out their own filth) the Lord suffreth Satan to rule them at his pleasure: he giueth them ouer, to be destroyed in their owne lusts, as such of whom he hath no regard, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them to speake lyes, to prophane his holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to sway in their abhominable sinnes, vntil
<pb facs="8"/>
their wickednesse be full, when he is willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them with his iust iudgements in displeasure. In the meane time, waxing proud, and climbing on high through hautie presumptiō of the Lords long suffring (which should rather drawe sinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) they take no meane pleasure and glory to oppresse and offend the Lords little ones, and daily deuise and endeuour to disturbe &amp; trouble the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable tranquilitie and peace of the Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale: wheras placing the Lord Iesus on the high Pinacle of the Temple, they assaie how they might cast him downe headlong, to the great griefe of the godly thereby offended, the dishonour of Christ, therby contemned: and the prouocation of the God of heauen, thereby displeased and vrged to powre downe his terrible vengeance and vnhappie woe vppon them by whome those offences come. The state &amp; condition not only of other times and nations, but also of this our owne, yeeld vs too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pittifull examples of this Argument. Wherein, we see how the rough raging waues of humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, suggested and prouoked by the high blustring winds of diuellish Ambition, haue not a litle mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and perplexed (I say not those Marriners that embarqued <hi>Ionas</hi> towardes <hi>Tharsus</hi> only, but also) <hi>Noah</hi> and his familie in the Arke: the Apostles of Christ in the ship, and such as are passengers euen in the same vessell with Christ towardes the Hauen of happinesse. Besides that, we may see, how that on the very maine land, litle <hi>Dauid</hi> hath very much ado to rescue the seely sheepe from the hungrie Lyons teeth. An house is much sooner throwne downe, then reedified: a Citie is not so easily reduced into
<pb facs="8"/>
vnitie and concorde, as it is diuided. And surely there, where the distracted mindes and wandering opinions of ambitious heads, haue not only contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and commenced, but also drawne foorth and twisted the odious threede of <hi>Discontentation,</hi> wee may expect none other thing therof, but vtter sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertions of Townes, Cities, Countries, Churches, Kingdomes, without speedie preuention. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this is that, which in the account of all wise men is vnhappie, and after the iudgement of all the godly, most vngodly, and the occasion of greater courage and boldnesse to the forraign enemy, then the feeblest resistances of them that be combined in true concord and peace.</p>
   <p>But what is that to vs? I would (indeede) that these things did neither touch vs, nor were found rowsting in our houses! but, when the vizard of hautie conceit and proper integritie, is remooued from our bleared eyes, we cannot but plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that the Church (notwithstanding the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere preaching of the word of God in the same) is intollerably burthened with Sectes opinions, and dangerous Scismes: and that the whole Common-wealth is no lesse vnhappily pestred with discords, dissentions, seditions, and many other huge enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and euilles of this last age and wane of the worlde, wherein the bande of Christian Charitie is broken, he Truth (though so strong and aboue all) is entertained but as a wandering Pilgrime on the earth, euen with them that fawne on her presence: the right faith is sorely cōtemned by them that haue taken vp weapons vnder pretence to defende her: and the Prince of darknesse groweth stronger and
<pb facs="9"/>
stronger without resistance, towards the end of his raigne in the world, who hath vehemently enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and strongly prouoked the enemies of the Church against the Church: to the which they threaten fire and sword, and daily endeuor destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this to compasse &amp; effect, they haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hands with mightie Potentates, they haue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wel waged souldiers, they haue prepared their strong barbed Horses, their swift Chariots, and a thousand warlike engins, to the terror of the weake in spirit, to the affliction of poore <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and to the dishonor of the name of God: who laugheth them to scorne, and knoweth wel how to confound them in their owne deuises, when it shall please him to expresse his displeasure towards them, and his loue to his children. But what inconueniences may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the present mischiefes, who knoweth not, that hath wisedome to discerne thereof? and what good Christian would not endeuour to stop and preuent the same? Therfore (though after many others, yet with and among some others) to meete with those desperate maladies, and to assay to preuent whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer greater euils may thereof ensue (according to that meane wisedome and abilitie the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me) I haue confected <hi>A Preparatiue to Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> and made the same Applicatory to this our time, Nation, and the present occasion. An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment most necessary to be vrged, and a thing in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest expectation of all good mindes, within whom the holy spirit of discipline is made sad and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, through the considerarion of the manifold dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and huge inconueniences of noysome <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentation,</hi> and to whose good natures, the true
<pb facs="9"/>
      <hi>Contentation,</hi> is euery way both profitable and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, in the feare of God, and honour of the Prince, (howsoeuer harrish and vnpleasant it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the taste of him that is oppressed with the humor of singular conceit) as those potions which are in taste bitter and sowre, may be more wholsom for the distressed patient, then such as are sweet and wallowish. And (indeed) although I could not be so briefe as <hi>Phocian</hi> was in the Citie of <hi>Athenes:</hi> nor (if I could) would I be either so copious as <hi>Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> with the <hi>Graecians,</hi> or so eloquent as <hi>Cicero</hi> with the <hi>Romains,</hi> to whose learned immitatours I referre both the lapping vp of plaine things in obscuritie, and the handling of publique controuersies in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple discourses: yet haue I wished and indeuoured to be rather modest with <hi>Paule,</hi> and charitable with <hi>Iohn,</hi> then impudent with <hi>Tartullus,</hi> and curious with <hi>Peter</hi>: hazarding al my credit &amp; ease, in regard of your profit and peace. Moreouer, albeit I know wel, that to many of you, this my present <hi>Preparatiue</hi> shalbe but like the glimmering light of a Candle set in the bright Sun shining, hauing (indeed) litle need of this meane helpe: yet I perswade, that ye which loue brotherly fellowship, feare God, and honour the Prince, will not disdaine it, but rather, that ye will be the more readie vpon this, and such like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casiōs, to stand vp in the defence of the truth against all erronious opinions, vaine deuises, and synister practises of man, as it best becommeth you with all such as be of the houshold of faith. Neither doubt I, but that also the sooner by the force of this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiue,</hi> the rage and rygour of the Discontented wil be asswaged, the domesticall enemy in part, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
<pb facs="10"/>
the seditious Aduersary of our state quailed, or at the least made ashamed, and the forreine foe the better obserued and resisted: that so, both in the one and the other, the Lord of heauen may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely glorified. For these causes haue I the rather published this <hi>Preparatiue,</hi> the which also I pray and beseech you (Christian Readers) before the Lord Iesus, and his holy Angels, to take in good part, and to construe therof indifferently, to apply it discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to vse it in all points charitably, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quiet of conscience, the peace of the Church, and safetie of the Common-wealth, in the feare of God: vnto whose goodnesse, let vs daily pray for the true <hi>Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
