Michaells in the said Citty, which is not onely worthy: but also very requisite &amp; meete to be made knowne and manyfested vnto all men, in regard of the sinnes and wickednes which now in thiese dayes remaineth to common amongst all nations, and forasmuch as of late the foule Finde (by Gods permission) shewed his wrath and indingnation against the same Citty by consuming and spoyling of a great part of the Cloyster there, as it is most truely made knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers and sundry persons already, as well by letters as otherwise: Therefore to the ende that all persons should vnderstand of the strange Accidents there happened, I thought it meete to set foorth a small
