   <head>The Preface to the READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an opinion amongst some, not so erronious as ignorant, That Coppy-Bookes of this nature are of no validitie. What reason they can alledge to strengthen so fond a conceit, I know not; sure it is some priuate one, they are so loath to produce it. For mine owne part, I see no reason why these that are grauen should not bee as profitable to a Learner, as those that are meerely written; so they bee exactly performed according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall straine of a true Artist; each Letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut according to its true proportion, and losing not the life deliuered in the Example.</p>
   <pb facs="4"/>
   <p> Certaine I am, there is no man liuing can write so exactly, but that euen in the writing of sixe lines, hee himselfe shall bee conscious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of some imperfections: which, by directions to the Grauer (being a good Worke-man and carefull) may bee easily helped and made perfect for imitation. Howbeit I deny not, but that oftentimes the Grauer may wrong the Writer, if hee bee not very obseruant in euery touch of a Letter: and the amends which hee may make him in the well cutting of some one or two Hands, will not counteruaile the credit which hee shall lose by his ill grauing and vnnaturall mishaping of some few Letters in one very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
   <p>For this Booke ensuing, I know there are some (through an enuious Curiositie, rather then a true Iudgement) which will herein finde many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: yet let me tell them, it is an easier matter to pry into the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of another, then it is to amend their owne errours: and hee that findes the greatest faults, commonly is the vnablest to amend the least; since Art hath no greater enemy then Ignorance. This is my glory, That I haue not plaid the Theefe with any man, (though it were in my power to haue done it,) But <hi>quicquid scripsi, scripsi:</hi> whatsoeuer I haue written, I haue done it my selfe: For I would bee much ashamed, that any man should thinke, I had beene brought vp in a place of such scarcitie, and vnder so bad a Master, or that there were in mee such a pouerty, that I must needes goe a thieuing for my skill. I thanke God there is nothing in it, which I am not able vpon an
<pb facs="4"/> instant to better. And therefore if any man list to be contentious, let him be contentious; but let him not wrong him in his doings, who is able to doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then himselfe: I speake of those that thinke themselues excellent and past compare, who indeed (be their names neuer so famous) beare about them but the shadow of Art. And howsoeuer the spirits of such men are so eleuated and raysed euen beyond themselues, that they thinke basely of euery mans doings but their owne; though their consciences tell them they are but as empty vessels, which alwayes make the greatest sound. It shall suffice mee, that (I) know what they haue in them, and how farre their skill extendeth; and so rest my selfe contented, till Time and Truth (the Tryers of all mens actions) shall distribute to euery one according to his desert. In the meane time, as this little Booke hath found gracious acceptation at the hands of him to whom it was first pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately intended: So I hope it will haue the approbation of all such as are well disposed, and beare affection to so excellent, commendable and necessary an Art: assuring them, that had I had my right, I should haue giuen them better content, and greater satisfaction of the <hi>Penns</hi> perfection: As for Carpers and ouer-curious-ey'd men, I passe not, as knowing my selfe euery way (in the Art I professe) a Worke-man that needeth not to be ashamed.</p>
