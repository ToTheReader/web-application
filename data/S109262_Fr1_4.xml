   <head>To the Fauourers of the Voyage for <hi>Guiana.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N thinges earnestly desired, though neuer so likelie, we are still suspicious: thinking it more credite to our common wisdome, to discredit most noble and profitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours with distrust; then touch to our valures and safeties to lie wilfullie idle. So that howsoeuer an action well and iudiciallie attempted, be esteemed halfe performed: yet, is this my iealous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt concerning the <hi>Guiana,</hi> that nothing is begun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all be ended. In this regarde (gentle Reader) I haue presumed to burthen thine eares, with the weake plea of a good cause, and in steede of opening it throughlie, to thy prudent consideration, to note onlie mine own vnsatisfied affection: hoping that because I do name the <hi>Guiana</hi> vnto thee, thou wilt vouchsafe, <hi>hoc nomine,</hi> to vaile and couer all other my defectes in the deserte of a good meaning. In publishing this treatise, my labour principallie tendeth to this end: to remooue all fig-leaues from our vnbeleefe; that either it may haue cause to shake off the colourable preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ignorance: or, if we will not be perswaded; that our selfe-wil may rest inexcusable. They that shall applie, and construe this my doing, to serue the Spaniard his turne so well as our owne; in so much as it may seeme to instruct, warne, and arme him: for their satisfaction heerein, they must not be ignorant, that his eyes in seeing our shipping there, doe as effectuallie informe him, that manie of our heartes are toward that place: as if it should bee crediblie aduertised, by some corrupt hireling that we thinke, write and discourse of nothing els. Neither can I imagine, that to conceale our knowledge herein (which to conceale may perhaps prooue, and bee hereafter taken for worse then paricide) would be of better purpose, then to hoodwincke our selues, as who would say, no man shall see vs. Besides:
<pb facs="4"/>
if the action were whollie to bee effected at her Maiesties charge: then might it at her Highneesse pleasure, be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with some other drift, and neuer bee discouered, vntill it were acted: But since it craueth the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and purses of manie Aduenturers: who cannot be so prodigall, both of their possessions and liues as voluntarily to run themselues out of breath, in pursuing they knowe not what: great reason it is, that where assistance is to be asked, due causes bee yeelded, to perswade &amp; induce them vnto it. The Spaniard is not so simple, vnsetled, and vncertaine in his determinations; as to build them on our breath, or to make our papers his Bulwarkes; nor so slowe, as to expect a president of our forwardnesse. His proceedings are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie strengthened with the trauailes, reportes, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanciall proofs of his own men, that haue aboue 60. yeares beaten round about this bush. And, to say a truth, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he hath vsed, in sending so manie ships in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruarie last, to people this countrey, and disappoint vs: as it doth consequentlie shew, that he findeth his chiefest force and sinewes to consist in golde: so doth he thereby plainly to our faces exprobate our remissnesse and long deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that in twelue monethes space haue done, or sought to doe nothing woorthie the ancient fame, and reputation of our English nation, interressed in so waightie businesse<note place="margin">In Iune last</note> His late prouision of a new supplie of whole familes to the number of sixe hundred persons, bound for <hi>Guiana,</hi> but that it pleased God, that by meanes of that right honourable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice most resolutelie performed in the sea-fight, and sacking of <hi>Cades,</hi> the ships, wherein they should haue beene conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were conuerted into ashes: what might it signifie? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, as it doth euidentlie prooue, that <hi>El Dorado</hi> hath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted credite and account in their iudgements: so poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it at vs, whilest we onlie to entertaine idle time, sit li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening for <hi>Guiana</hi> newes, and instantlie forget it, as if it were nought els, but a pleasing dreame of a golden fancie.
<pb facs="5"/>
If we with our selues shall expostulate, how this commeth to passe that the aduantage wholie resting on our side, in respect that <hi>Berrec</hi> was this last yeare beaten out, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try throughlie discouered and the Inhabitantes made desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of her sacred Maiesties happie gouernment; they not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding by entring before vs: haue nowe gotten the start of vs: what may we thinke? shall wee iudge that their natiue country is lesse deare, or more wearisome vnto them, then ours is vnto vs? Their <hi>Peruleri</hi> who going bare and emptie out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> do againe within three or foure years returne from <hi>Peru,</hi> rich and in good estate, do apparantlie disprooue all such conceipts of them. Shall we say that they haue more spare men to be imployed in such actions? It is no secrete to know the contrarie. Are they subiect to penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? In all partes of Christendome, where money is not scant, all other things are plentifull. Or is their land not able to sustain their numbers of people? They buy many slaues to follow their husbandrie, and themselues disdaining base idlenesse, and beggerie, do all honour militarie profession, highlie esteeming it, in their mercenaries and strangers. Is it then want of abilitie, in those that are willing? lacke of incouragement. Or default of speedie order and direction for those that doe voluntarile offer themselues, their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and best indeuour to further this cause; that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs to be thus coated by the Spaniard? The first is no question. The latter needeth no answere. The profit then by their example to be gathered, is, not to loose opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie by delay, or to seeme fearfull and dismayed, where there is no cause of doubt. For as yet their post hast doth no way preiudice our aduised leysure in setting forward, since their preparations of <hi>Negroes</hi> to worke in the mynes, their horses, cattel, and other necessaries, may, (by the fauour of God) at our first comming, both store vs with quantities of gold oare, and ease vs of much trouble, paines, and trauaile. If we should suppose our selues now to liue in the dayes of King
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth of famous memorie and the strange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a West <hi>Indies,</hi> or new world abounding with great treasure should entice vs to beleeue it: perhaps it might be imputed for some blame to the grauitie of wise men, lightly to be carried with the perswasion and hope of a new found <hi>Vtopia,</hi> by such a one as <hi>Columbus</hi> was being an alien and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie wayes subiect to suspition. But since the penance of that incredulity lyeth euen now heauie on out shoulders; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample forethreatning. I know not what; repentance: and that we haue the personall triall of so honorable and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient a Reporter, our owne Countriman: let it bee farre from vs to condemne our selues in that, which so worthilie we reprooue in our predecessors; and to let our idle know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge content it selfe with naked contemplation like a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren womb in a Monasterie. We cannot denie that the chiefe commendation of vertue doth consist in action: we truly say that <hi>Otium</hi> is <hi>animae viuae sepultura:</hi> we beleeue, that perfect wisdome in this mobility of al humain affaires refuseth not with anie price to purchase safetie: and wee iustlie doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the Castilians from barelegged mountey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners haue attained to their greatnesse, by labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie: To sleep then, because it costeth nothing, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the present time, because it flattereth vs with deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full contentment, &amp; to kisse securitie saying what euill hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth vnto vs? is the plaine high-way to a fearfull downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall: from which the Lord in his mercie deliuer vs, and giue vs an vnderstanding heart, in time to see, and to seeke that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto our peace.</p>
