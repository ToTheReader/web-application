                 <title>The peace of Rome : Proclaimed to all the world, by her famous Cardinall Bellarmine, and the no lesse famous casuist Nauarre. Whereof the one acknowledgeth, and numbers vp aboue three hundred differences of opinion, maintained in the popish church. The other confesses neere threescore differences amongst their owne doctors in one onely point of their religion. Gathered faithfully out of their writings in their own words, and diuided into foure bookes, and those into seuerall decads. Whereto is prefixed a serious disswasiue from poperie. By I.H</title>

   <head>ADVERTISEMENTS to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>NDERSTAND (good reader) that in all these passages follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, I haue brought in C. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in his owne words, except in some few plaine references, where I mention him in the third person.</p>
   <p n="2">2 That the edition of C. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> which I haue followed, and


<pb facs="26"/>
quoted in euery page, is that in octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uo (the commonest, I thinke) set forth at Ingolstadt, from the presse of <hi>Adam Sartorius,</hi> in the yeare <hi>M.D.XCIX.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="3">3 That all those Authors which thou seest named ouer the head of euery Section, are Papists of note: whose quarrels C. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth.</p>
   <p n="4">4 That such great Doctors could not be singular in their iudgements, but must needes, in all probability, (which yet is not confessed) be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with many followers, in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point of variance: euery Master hath the fauour of his owne schoole: the sides taken by their Scholers is not more secret, then likely.</p>
   <p n="5">5 That one Doctor <hi>Pappus,</hi> a


<pb facs="26"/>
learned German, hath vndertaken the like taske, but somewhat vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly: for of my 303 contradictions he hath noted but 237. the edition followed by him was not the same, and therefore his trust could not be so helpfull to mee: Besides, that two or three of Card. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> workes are since published.</p>
   <p n="6">6 That I haue willingly omitted diuers small differences, which (if I had regarded number) might haue caused the Sum to swell yet higher.</p>
   <p n="7">7 That thou mayest not looke to finde all these acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged differences, maine and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall: All Religion consists not of so many stones in her foundation; it is enough, that deepe and material dissensions are intermingled with


<pb facs="27"/>
the rest; and that scarce any point is free from some.</p>
   <p n="8">8 That Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges those dissensions only, which fall into the compasse of his owne Controuersies (if all those:) omitting all others. For instance: of all those sixtie and two differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in the matter of penance, which I haue here gathered out of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> and <hi>Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>a Victoria,</hi> he hath not confessed aboue fiue or sixe: So that, by the same proportion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as three hundred and three Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions are acknowledged, there cannot but be many hundreds wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly by him concealed.</p>
