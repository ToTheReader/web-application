   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>GEntle Reader, although I doubt not, but al that be wise and iudicious especially if they duly consider the occasion and state of the question, lately treated (in a Conference betwixt D. <hi>White</hi> and D. <hi>Featly</hi> Ministers; and M. <hi>Fisher</hi> and M. <hi>Sweet</hi> Iesuits) wil ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily discerne (euen by that false Relation, which is set out in print by a Protestant) that the Protestants Cause hath not gained any thing: Neuerthelesse, because those who be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially affected, or of meane capacitte, may (as it is to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diuers doe) conceiue and speake amisse of this matter, to the disgrace of the Catholike Cause, and the preiudice of their owne and other mens soules: I haue thought it needful to set out a true Relation of the occasion, progresse, and issue of that Conference, and this in such sort, as diuers falsehoods of the Protestant Relator, may be easily perceiued, and the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Protestants Cause may be euidently discouered; which is also so bad, as it seemeth it cannot be supported, but by setting out such lying Relations; the sight and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, maketh me more easily beleeue that to be true which I haue read, viz. <hi>That a decree was made by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines<note place="margin">Eudaimon Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens. p. H. Garn.</note> in Geneua, defyning it lawful to lye for the honor or credit of the Gospel;</hi> and that conformably to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, an English Minister being told that one of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes had made lyes in stead of proofes of his Protestant Religion, did answer, saying: <hi>He cannot lye too much in<note place="margin">D. Bishop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Rob. Abbots.</note> this cause.</hi> It must needes be a weake and bad cause, that needeth to be supported by such weake and bad shifts. I for my part wil not promise, to haue perfectly remembred and
<pb facs="3"/>
set downe euery word that passed in this Conference, especially spoken by by-standers; nor to haue strictly obserued the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise order of euerie passage: but for the substance, and truth of the matter that I doe relate, I assure, that there shal not be found any falsehood, vnlesse it be in some of those Parcels; which I doe not relate of my selfe, but out of the Protestant Relator: whose Relation ordinarily as I doe not contradict, vnlesse it be vpon necessarie occasion; so I doe not intend to approue: but simply relating what it saith, I wil leaue it to others to iudge, what they thinke fit of it. Onely this I wil say, That euerie one may beleeue it so farre, as it relateth any thing, which may aduantage the <hi>Catholique Defendants,</hi> and their Cause, or disaduantage the <hi>Protestant Disputants,</hi> and their Cause. For it is certaine, that no man wil lye for the aduantage of his Aduersarie, or his Cause; nor for his owne disaduantage. But in such things as it hath set downe aduantagiously for the <hi>Protestant Disputant,</hi> or his Cause, there is iust reason to suspect it; in regard I am told, that <hi>D. Featly</hi> himselfe (who is said to be the Author) hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, That more is said in the Relation, then was said in the Conference it selfe; and I am sure something is left out, which was said, and something mis-reported. This being premised, by way of Preface, I wil begin to discourse of the matter it selfe.</p>
