      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, being incouraged through your gentle acceptance of my <hi>Cynthia,</hi> I haue once more ventred on your curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: hoping to find you (as I haue done heretofore) friendly. Being determined to writ of something, and yet not resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of anything, I considered with my selfe, if one should write of Loue (they will say) euerie one writes of Loue: if of vertue, why, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards vertue; To be short, I could thinke of nothing, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was common, or not at all in request. At length I bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoght my selfe of a Subiect, both new (as hauing neuer been written vpon before) and pleasing (as I thought) because Mans Nature commonlye) loues to heare that praised, with whose presence, he is most pleased.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Erasmus</hi> (the glory of Netherland, and the refiner of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Tongue) wrote a whole Booke, in <hi>the praise of follye.</hi> Then if so excellent a Scholler, writ in praise of vanity, why maye not I write in praise of that which is profitable? There are not two Countreys, where Gold is esteemed, lesse than in India, and more then in England: the reason is, because the Indians are barbarous, and our Nation ciuill.</p>
   <p>I haue giuen Pecunia the title of a Woman, Both for the termination of the Word, because (as Women are) shee is lou'd of men. The brauest voyages in the World, haue been made for Gold: for it, men haue ventured (by Sea) o the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest

partes of the earth: In the pursute whereof, Englandes Nestor and Neptune <hi>(Hawkins</hi> and Drake) lost their liues. vpon the Deaths of the which two, of the first I writ this:
<q>
         <l>The Waters were his winding Sheete, the Sea was made his Toombe,</l>
         <l>Yes for his Fame the Ocean Sea, was not sufficient roome.</l>
      </q>
Of the latter this:
<q>
         <l>England his Hart, his Corps the Waters haue,</l>
         <l>And that which raisd his Fame, became his graue.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>The Praetorians (after the death of Pertinax) in the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a new Emperour, more esteemed the money of Iulia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, then either the vertue of Seuerus, or the valour of Pessen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nius. Then of what great estimation, this Lady Pecunia, both hath beene in the world, and is at this present, I leaue to your Iudgement. But what speak I so much of her praise in my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, that haue commended her so at large, in my Booke; To the reading whereof, (Gentlemen) I refer you.</p>
