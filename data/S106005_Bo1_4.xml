   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>ALthough; good Reader I wryte in playne termes,
and not so playnely as truely, concerninge the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
meaning honestly to all men, and wish them as
much good, as to myne owne harte, yet as there hathe
bene, so there is now, and hereafter wilbe curious heades
to fynde faultes: wherefore I thought it necessary nowe
at this second Impression, to acquaynt thee with a great
faulte, as some taketh it, but not as I meane it, callinge
these Uagabondes Cursetors, in the Intytuling of my
booke, as runners or rangers about the Countrey, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of this Latin word (<hi>C V R R O</hi>) neyther do I write it
Cooresetores with a double oo, or Cowresetors wyth a
w, which hath an other signification: is there no diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
betwene a gardein, and a garden, maynteynance, and
maintenance: Streytes, &amp; stretes: those that haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
knowe there is a great difference: who is so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
in these dayes, as knoweth not the meanynge
of a vagabone? and if any ydell leuterar should so bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of any man, woulde not hee thinke it bothe odyous
and reprochfull? will he not shon the name? ye and where
as he may and dare with bent browes, will reuenge that
name of ignominy: yet this playn name vagabone is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
as others be of Latin wordes, and now vse makes
it common to all men: but let vs loke backe foure hundred
yeares sithens, and let vs see whether this playne worde
vagabon, was vsed or no? I beleue not, and why? because
I read of no such name in the old estatuts of this realme,
vnlesse it be in the margent of the Booke, or in the Table,
which in the collection and printing was set in, but these
were then the common names of these leud leuterars, say
tores, Robardesmen, Drawlatches, &amp; valiant beggers.
If I should haue vsed such wordes, or the same order of
<pb facs="5"/>
writing, as this realme vsed in King Henry the thyrd, or
Edward the firstes time. Oh what a grose, barbarous fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
haue we here, his writing is both homely &amp; darke,
that we had nede to haue an enterpreter, yet then it was
very well and in short season, a great change we see, well
this delycatage shall haue his time on the othersyde, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
haue I none, I neuer was acquaynted with the
Muses. I neuer tasted of Helycon. But accordinge to my
playne order, I haue set forth this worke, simply and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with such vsuall wordes and termes, as is amonge vs
well knowne and frequented. So that as the prouerbe
sayth (althoughe truth bee blamed, it shall neuer bee sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,)
well good reader, I meane not to be tedious vnto
thee but haue added fyue or sixe more tales, because some
of them were donne whyle my Booke was fyrste in the
presse, and as I truste I haue deserued no rebuke, for my
good will, euen so I desire no prayse for my payne, coste,
and trauell. But faythfully for the profyt and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte
of my country, I haue donne it, that the
whole bodye of the Realme, may see and
vnderstand their leud lyfe and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
practises, that all maye
speedely helpe to amende
that is amisse. Amen
say all with me.</p>
