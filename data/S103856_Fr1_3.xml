the more generall benefit of my
countrymen to publish in two eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
treatises (the first whereof I
do heere in title <hi>Phlebotomy:</hi> and
the other, godwilling, hereafter,
as soone as leysure shall serue, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartice</hi>)
as compandiously and as orderly as doth or
shall lye in my power, all the chiefest aphorismes and
conclusions, which haue bin handled and written by
the most famous Phisitions of all ages, as concerning
such cautions and circumstances as are to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in letting of bloud, or purging the body of man:
Although in practise it doth in many cases fall out,
that purging ought to take place before the opening
of any vayne (as shall h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

most excellent and principall humour that is disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

      <hi>the best and most familiar iuice in man is bloud.</hi>
I haue therefore thought good in my methode of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring

to follow the example of diuers learned men
of our time, to wit, in respect of the disposing of them,
to giue vnto bloud the first place and preheminence.
These two remedyes are not onely accompted the

amongst all other corporall helps prescribed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented

are applyed vnto great diseases, and also because
(howsoeuer they beeing abused do bring the greatest
harmes) yet beeing well and rightlie administred,
they do bring the greatest and most present cases and
remedyes, that euer either inwardlie or outwardlie
were deuised for mans health.</p>
   <p>This my first part of the <hi>Remedia magna</hi> in
Phisick, I haue comprehended in two bookes, the
summe and contents whereof, as also of euery part
thereof, I haue thought it not amisse first briefely
to prefix and lay open to the view of the well willing
reader.</p>
   <p>The first booke shewing what Phlebotomy is, and
to what vse it serueth in seuerall diseases, conteyneth
tenne Chapters.</p>
   <p>The first, what Phlebotomy is, and of the foure
distinct kinds and vses thereof.</p>
   <p>The second, how letting of bloud ought to
<pb facs="6"/>
be vsed in continuall agues, as also in burning fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</p>
   <p>The third, how bloud-letting may be admitted in
some kinds of diary agues made by obstructions.</p>
   <p>The fourth, how farre letting of bloud may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in intermitting agues, quotidians, tertians, and
quartaines.</p>
   <p>The fift, whether letting of bloud be to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Plague, and pestilent feuer, as also in the
Poxe, measels, and such other contagious infirmities,
and when and how.</p>
   <p>The sixt, how letting of bloud is to be vsed in phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
quinsies, pleurisies, inflammations of the raynes
or wombe, and other inward inflammations, as they
are considered in themselues without agues.</p>
   <p>The seauenth, in these dangerous inflammations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresayd,
whether euacuation or reuulsion be more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
on whether side the vayne is to be taken for
reuulsion, and what is the meaning of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
his rule <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, to flow rightly, or with a right
course.</p>
   <p>The eight, whether letting of bloud be to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in cold diseases, as palsies, cramps, apoplexies, and
whether it may fitly be vsed in melancholick windes,
colicks, and dropsies.</p>
   <p>The ninth, whether in rheumes and distillations, as
also in the gout and in <hi>Morbus Gallicus,</hi> any benefit
may ensue by letting of bloud.</p>
   <p>The tenth, whether letting of bloud be expedient
for such as haue hoat liuers and cold stomacks, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
for such as haue itches and scabbes, and such other
faults of the skinne. Further, whether it be fit for the
disease called of sea-faring men the skuruy, and for
<pb facs="6"/>
the cachexia, or bad habit of body: and finally, what
and how many are the drifts and scopes in letting of
bloud.</p>
   <p>The second booke concerning the rules and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
which are to be obserued, when for the preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or curing of a disease any vayne is to be opened,
conteyneth likewise ten Chapters.</p>
   <p>The first, whether the party that is to be let bloud
haue truly that distented plenitude which is called of
Phisitions <hi>corpus plethoricum,</hi> and how the seuerall
kinds of plenitude may be knowne.</p>
   <p>The second, of the consideration of the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the party, what it is by manner of diet, or by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
or by place of aboad, or by custome, or by habit,
or by constitution of body.</p>
   <p>The third, whether the body haue neede to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
before letting of bloud.</p>
   <p>The fourth, of the age, sexe, and solubilitie of the
party, whether old men, or children, or women being
either with child, or hauing their termes, may be let
bloud. Also, whether any hauing bodies either too
costiue or too soluble, may be let bloud.</p>
   <p>The fift, of the state and time of the disease, what
consideration is to be bad thereof in bloud-letting, and
which we must regard most of the powers, the animal,
the naturall, or the vitall.</p>
   <p>The sixt, of the time of the yeare, the time of the
constellations of the planets, and the time of the day
most fit for letting of bloud.</p>
   <p>The seauenth, on whether side the vayne is to be
taken when we let bloud to preuent diseases, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd
or deriue their matter, as also what vayne must
<pb facs="7"/>
chiefely be chosen for sundry infirmities.</p>
   <p>The eight, what manner of incision must be made,
how large, how small, how deepe, what quantity of bloud
may be taken, and therein of the meaning of <hi>Galens</hi>
word to let bloud <hi>ad animi deliquium.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The ninth, what order must be taken with them that
are let bloud, as well in the act it selfe to preuent swou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
as also afterward for their gouernment and
diet.</p>
   <p>The tenth, how defects and errors are to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
and mended, and how the Phisition, and in his
absence the Chirurgian may know by the bloud being
a little while reserued, what course is further to be
taken with the patient.</p>
   <p>Before I enter into the discourse vpon these seuerall
arguments, I must pray the reader first to giue me leaue
briefely to answere certaine doubts and occasions of
offences which perhaps might arise vpon the publishing
of this treatise. First therefore if any (because I ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
heretofore committed to the pressse certaine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and matters of Diuinity, do now begin to set
forth a Phisick worke) do therefore gather or suspect
that I haue conuerted my studies from the scriptures
vnto <hi>Galen,</hi> let him know that in this point I am vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
mistaken by him, for most of my phisick obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were then collected when first I gaue my mind
that way, which was long before I published any matter
of Diuinity: so that if there haue bin any alteration
or conuersion of studies, it hath bin from the perusing
of Phisick auctors to the reading of writers wholy theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall.
And yet still (the coniunction betwixt the
body and soule being so ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>re, and the sympathy so
great) I see no cause but that he which studieth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity,
<pb facs="7"/>
may lawfully now and then so bestow a spare
houre in viewing of the remedyes ordeyned by God for
mans infirmities, that he may be able in corporall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
to yeeld reliefe as well particularly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
as in common to his good friends. If any do
thinke otherwise, if he be a Deuine, I pray him that
he will graunt me licence to compare small enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to those which were so farre more noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
and to offer to his consideration that example
of <hi>Moses,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 7. 22. Aug. de ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate dei lib. 8. cap. 38. Basilius pag. 404.</note> which was learned in all the wisedome of
the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> that is (as <hi>Augustine</hi> doth expound
it) in Astronomy, Geometry, Arithmetick, and such
like, which knowledges, though they came sometimes
from heathen men, yet were they the gifts of God, <hi>Qui
operatur per malos non in malis.</hi> Or to call to his
remembrance <hi>Salomon,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Eccl. 1. 1.</note> whome the holy Ghost doth
entitle with the name of Preacher: and yet God gaue
him wisdome also to discourse vpon philosophicall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
concerning beasts,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 4. 31.</note> birds, fishes, and euery sort of
simples euen from the greatest to the least, from the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar
tree to the mosse that groweth vpon the wall. If he
be a Phisition, which supposeth that the study of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
can not be tolerated in them whose vocation is
spirituall, then doo I onely oppose against him the
auctoritie of the most worthie Phisition and graue
interpretour of <hi>Plato, Marsilius Ficinus,</hi> who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some did obiect agaynst him, <hi>Nonne est
Marsilius sacerdos? Quid sacerdotibus cum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decina?
Quid cum astrologia commercij? Ficinus</hi>
maketh an apologie for himselfe,<note place="margin">Marsil. Fici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in apologia praefixa lib. 1. de studiosorum sanitate tuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</note> proouing euidently,
<hi>Antiquissimos quondam sacerdotes fuisse medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos
pariter &amp; astronomos.</hi> He addeth for proofe,
<hi>quod sanè Chaldaeorum, Persarum, Aegyptiorum
<pb facs="8"/>
testantur historiae. Ad nullum praetereà magis
quàm ad pium sacerdotem pertinere singularis
charitatis officia.</hi> He concludeth, <hi>officium verè prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantissimum
est procul dubio, &amp; maximè neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarium,
&amp; inprimis ab hominibus exoptatum,
efficere videlicet vt sit mens sana in corpore sano,
id autem tum demum praestare possumus si con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ungimus
sacerdotio medicinam.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now if there be any that shall thinke it strange
that I do so often alleage the testimonies of <hi>Ferne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
Fuchsius, Montanus,</hi> and others (as relying
much vpon them) and yet do in some poynts a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from them, I wish them to be certified, that I haue
a reuerend opinion of those writers, and am very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that in those positions which are best determined
by them, they should in no wise be frustrated of their
due prayse and glory. But if others in some doubts
haue found out more then they, then do I chalenge
liberty as neere as I can to make choyce of the soundest,
and in these humaine matters to be as the Poet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of himselfe:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Horat. epist. libr. 1. epist. 1.</note>
Where <hi>Galen</hi> doth well, I must needs giue him his
due commendations, and euen admire those singular
gifts of nature which God bestowed vpon him, but
where he skoffeth (as he doth sometimes) at Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie,<note place="margin">Gal. de diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentus puis. lib. 2. &amp; lib. 3. de sectis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruis medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum.</note>
there I detest and abhorre his blasphemies,
and leaue him to the iudgement of that God, to whome
only it is knowne, whether euer before his death his
heart were better lightened with some beames of
sparkles of his grace. The words of those excellent
Greeke and Latin Phisitions (vpon whose auctorities
and the reasons deliuered by them these my assertions
<pb facs="8"/>
are grounded) I haue not set them downe in the proper
languages of the first auctors, because my purpose was,
as neere as I could, to reduce the whole matter into a
briefe and compendious treatise: but I haue both faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Verbatim translated them, and also in most places
caused the chiefest parts of their arguments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
by a seuerall print to be apparantly distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
very plainely to be discerned. By which distinct
forme of character, as also by the bookes and discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
cited in the margent, it may euidently appeere,
that howsoeuer (to put some difference betwixt this
my labour and an other english Phlebotomy heretofore
published) I haue prefixed my name to the title of the
whole worke, yet I do not presume to cary away the
matter as of my selfe, but am very desirous that the
louing reader should be satisfied with the iudgements
of those worthie and famous writers, whose counsailes
and aduises can not (I hope) but be welcome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, which with modest and well affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mindes shall desire to imbrace
the truth.</p>
