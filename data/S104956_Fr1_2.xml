For not onely castelles, tounes and citees haue been blasted with the deadly breath of this poyso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned serpente, but also whole and soundrye prouinces, realmes and nacions, haue so dronken in his cākerde venome, that it hath been harde for the verye chosen to escape his terrible stynges.

Reade Mahumettes actes who so luste, and he shall fynde suche pryde and arrogācie suche ambicion, such bloudynesse and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, suche hypocrisye and supersticion, briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suche a mynde to deface, abholyshe and destroye the kyngdome of the sonne of the lyuyng God (I meane Iesus our sauyoure) as in the chiefest membre of Antichrist, he calleth hym selfe the moost excellent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete and counceler of God: he denyeth that Christ dyed (in whose onlye deathe standeth oure whole hope of remission of synnes) he taught his disciples to faste all daye, and at night to geue theimselues tooe immoderate eatynge and drynckynge: he was not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to saye, that God spake to hym from heauen and gaue hym lycence to abuse as many wemenne as coulde phantasie hym: he counted his wicked lawes so good that no Christian manne myghte open hys mouthe agaynst theim without shedynge of bloude: he was a treytoure and made insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reccion agaynst his prynce. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye other false, deuelishe and abhomynable doctrynes whyche this monster taught and meynteyned: but it is more necessarie for vs to lamente the miserable case of Christes people and to flye to goddes mercye for ayde
<pb facs="3"/>
then to reherce his deceytes, gyles, delusions treasons and conspiracies agaynst the true and euerlastynge Messias and his chosen beleuers. For we ought to knowe that for our synfull lyuynge and open contempte of Goddes holy woorde, this cruell woolfe hath been suffered so piteouslye to haue stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his mouthe with Christian blood. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, yf we which professe the name of Christe (the promysed seede of Dauid) ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly consyderynge these myseryes, woulde retourne to our mercyfull father wyth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayned purpose to chaunge our lyues and to embrace with all reuerēce his blissed worde, he woulde shake of from our brethrens nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes these intollerable yokes. Let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre that he hath not onely promysed delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce to theim that caste awaye theyr vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faythfulnesse and earnestlye crye vpon hym for helpe, but also hath perfourmed it in dede heretofore that we shulde in no wise doubte of his prompt and readie goodnesse.</p>
   <p>When the Israelites were cruellye and miserably oppressed of the Egyptians, and cryed faythfully to God for succoure, he stir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red vp Moses and Aaron to bee theyr cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, and to leade theim oute of that fyrye furnace. Lykewise, when the Emperour Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liane
<pb facs="4"/>
tormented the good Christians, at the contynual prayer of his repentaunt seruaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: God without any delaye plucked from theim that terrible tormentoure: For at what tyme Iuliane tooke hys iorneye into Persia threatenynge the Christians, that at hys retourne he woulde sacryfice theyr bloude to his false goddes: by the prouisyon of the true God, he was ledde asyde by a manne of Persia, into a wyldernesse where he receaued hys deathes wounde, and was constreigned to confesse wyth hys blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous mouthe, that it was the manyfeste plage of God. For he tooke clottes of bloude and threwe theim vp to the skyewarde, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge: thou hast ouercommed O Galilean, thou haste ouercommed, callynge Christe a Galilean, because he was broughte vp in Galile.</p>
   <p>There is also another later example, which semeth more notable than that I can ouerpasse it. Whē the Saracens with theyr captayne zulimus, greuouslye assaulted Cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stantinople in the tyme of the Emperoure Leo, a greate pestilence also piteouslye wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stynge the toune in extreme desperacion of mannes helpe, they wholye fled to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyfull
<pb facs="4"/>
goodnesse of God, leauynge theyr su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persticious religions, and buyrying all their abused ymages of the toune, and apointyng all the rest in theyr kyngdome to the fyre. Then oure mercyfull God seynge theyr repentaunt heartes, deferred no lenger from theym hys presente helpe. For all these thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges foorthwyth came together vpon the Saracenes, colde, hunger, pestilence, sedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amonge theimselues, the death of theyr captayne, theyr shyppes partelye brente vp with fyre from heauen, partely bonged and drouned with an horrible tempest.</p>
   <p>These examples oughte to moue vs, bothe to abhorre and deteste oure wycked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and supersticion, and also to conceaue a sure truste, that God wyll shyne vpon vs wyth hys fauourable countenaunce and delyuer vs from our moost cruell enemyes, yf we begynne a newe lyfe and turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feynedlye vnto hym. And yf there bee anye manne that earnestlye doothe not consyder the miseryes and calamiteis of Christian people, let theim reade this lytle treatyse, wherin they shall perceaue, howe myghtye Mahumettes supersticious impietee hathe preueyled: how ample regions the Cristians
<pb facs="5"/>
haue loste, in what bondage they lyue, and whereunto that base and vyle nacyon the Turckes haue increased, through oure syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Vpon the consyderacion wherof they and all other maye be sturred to call vpon our heauenlye father, that he wyll sende hys lyuynge spirite amonge vs, to woorke true faythe and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce in al mennes heartes to rayse vp true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> kyngdome of Christ, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ with all his heretiquall and damnable sectes, and to dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his people from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable bondage.</p>
