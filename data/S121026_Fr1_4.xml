      <hi>Neither haue only Catholicke fathers and councels, had this reuerent opinion of blessed Pope</hi> Gregory: <hi>but Protestants also, iudge him worthy of honour, and commendation.

      <hi>in his Chronicle intreating of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of our country from Idolatry, and paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,
<pb facs="14"/> to the faith of Christ, writteth thus.</hi> Gregory sent Austen, Melitus, and Iohn, with other godly and well lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, to preach the christian faith to the Angles: which were first recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, of Ethelbert king of kent: whom they conuerted to the faith, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of his people. <hi>Finally his memory is continued in the church of</hi> England, <hi>and him selfe enrold in the callendar for a Saint in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: and I verily thinke, fewe Protestants yet so far waded in malice, that they dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him of false doctrine, and heresy: or without blushing affirme him for infidelity to be damned in hell.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>This being so, what better vmpiere in this cause can be had then he? what arbiter more indifferent to tell vs what religion florished, not only in his time, but also in the agesprecedent? and so consequently, which is the true faith of</hi> Iesus Christ? <hi>For by common confession, what religion was in those pure times, by holy men taught, beleued, and practised, is that, which the only bogottē Sonne, brought from the bosome of his Father: that which the Apostles, planted in the world, and registred in the writinges of the newe testament: and that, which euery one, that desireth to come to heauen, ought with his hart firmely to embrace, and in his life sincerely</hi>
      <pb facs="15"/> and constantly to followe, and professe.

   <p>Here it may be, that some to the discredit

To this may be added, that seing <hi>S. Gregory,</hi> was a man of great learning, and had by reason of his high place, the best kinde of intelligence, easily coulde he not be deceaued: and being besides of great vertue and holines, neuer woulde he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly deceiue others. Nay to free vs from all feare of any suspition, him selfe was so carefull of truth, that being about to write this booke, of the miraculous lines and deathes of Italian Saints, inuited thereunto by the vertuous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of his familiar friends, he directed his letters to others, for certaine information the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein: as namely to <hi>Maximinianus,</hi> Bishope of <hi>Syracusis</hi> in <hi>Sicilie:</hi> to whom he wrotte tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this matter, in these very wordes. <hi>My</hi>

      <hi>brethren that liue familiarly with me, do enforce me by all meanes, briefly to commit vnto writing, some miracles of those fathers, which we haue heard
<pb facs="16"/> done in Italy. For the effecting wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I stande in very great nede of your charitable assistance: to witt, that you woulde signify vnto me such things, as come to your memory, or it hath bene your chance to knowe. For I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <note place="margin">See lib. 1. cap 7.</note> well, that you tolde me some thinges, concerning Abbot Nonnosus, who liued nere vnto Anastasius of Pentumis, which I haue quite forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Wherefore I desire you, to write vnto me both that, and whatsoeuer els you knowe of like quality, and spedily to sende them, vnlesse you determine to be here shortly your selfe in person.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This was the great care, and singular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection, which he vsed in this heauenly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines: by reason whereof, he was the better able to performe that thinge, which abundantly he hath done, and that is, diligently to sett downe howe, and by what meanes, he came to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities, of whatsoeuer in his <hi>Dialogues</hi> he reporteth: a greater thinge then which, to giue credit to his writinges, none can be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: and therefore thosE that will doubtfully descant of his stories; will hardly euer beleeue any, further then shall please their owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor: for a more certayne, and sure course can not be deuised: neither do I remember, the like
<pb facs="17"/> to haue bene so obserued of any other auncient histriographers whatsoeuer. And surely, those which be so captious, as to controll what fitteth not their fancy, woulde I make no doubte, as liberally speake their pleasure, (as in truth so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in like cases haue) and deliuer their quicke censure, against many stories, no lesse strange then any reported by <hi>S. Gregory,</hi> who yet when they shall vnderstand, from whence they be taken, must of necessity vaile bonnet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them selues sor too lauish of tongue, or desperatly fall to gracelesse infidelity or Atheis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. For example: tell them that there was a certayne barren woman, which receiued a message from God by an Angell, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>o mans estate, slewe, him selfe alone, with the iawe bone of an asse, many hundreds of his enemies that sett vpon him: and afterward being pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thirsty, and in great extremity for lacke of water, he praied to God, and suddainely a fountaine sprung out of one of the great teeth of the saide iawe bone: by meanes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof he was refreshed, and recouered his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer strength. Tell this story, I say, to many Protestantes, that knowe not with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb facs="18"/> authority it is backed, and a man had nede of a broade backe, to bare the frumppes and scoffes which they will loade vpon him, for giuing credit to such an olde wiues tale: and yet in fine, their chekes must consesse their incredulous folly, yf any christian bloud be left, when they shall know, that it is recorded by the holy Ghost in sacred scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. <note place="margin">Ind. cap. 13. and cap. 15. Iosue cap. 10. v. 12.</note> The like affections will they shewe, and the same liberty of speech will they vse, to heare, that at the commandement of an holy man, the sunne did stoppe his course and for some time stoode still: that the iron heade of an hatchet, was made by an other, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende of it selfe from the bottome of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">4. Reg. 6. v. 6.</note> and to swimme in the toppe: that a great seruant of God, did many hundreds of yeares after his death, appeare in body to <note place="margin">Math. 17. v. 3.</note> an other, and talke with him in the presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of diuers: that there were two famous and holy preachers, which wrought such wounder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miracles, that the very shadowe of the <note place="margin">Act. 5. v. 15. Act. 19. v. 12.</note> one, cured all sicke persons, ouer whom it passed: and the napkins of the other, brought from his body, healed diseases, and dispossessed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils. These and such like, be as strange, and far more incredible, then any repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this booke, and therefore will they
<pb facs="19"/> as quickly be reiected for fables of many, that heare them, vntill they vnderstand that Gods worde doth giue them authority.</p>
   <p>Yf then such miracles as these, find credit at the Protestants handes: why shoulde they contemne those here mentioned, being in them selues no more strange or improbable: especially our Sauiour him selfe hauing made this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, to his Church. <hi>Amen Amen I say to</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ioan. 14. v. 12.</note>
      <hi>you, he that beleueth in me, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes that I do he also shall do, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then these shall he do:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lib. de Babila Martiri.</note> which <hi>S.

Babilas,</hi> of whom he there intreateth. Seing then we finde, such wonderfull thinges wrought in the time of the olde testament, and in the Gospell by our Sauiour, as that the very touching of the <note place="margin">Math. 14. 2. 36.</note> hemme of his garment, cured infirmities: and him selfe assuresh vs that such as bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ued in him, should worke greater, what reason is the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, to discredit those thinges, that are reported by auncient, holy and learned men: for as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue vncertayne legendes, and apocriphall stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, not commended to vs by any sufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb facs="17"/> is not commendable, bnt an argument of ignorance or great leuity: so to be so straight la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as not to credit that, which is published by them that be of knowne antiquity, learning, and vertue, and haue besides vsed all those mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which mans witt can deuise, is passing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to Godes Saints, openeth the gate to the vtter deniall of all monuments of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and all stories of former times whatsoeuer, and is in very truth (not to say more) a plaine demonstration, at least of a cauilling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
   <p>For more light of that which hath bene saide, let vs a litle descende to somewhat in particular. <hi>S. Gregory</hi> in this thrid booke, <note place="margin">Cap. 15.</note> telleth how an holy monke called <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> liued a solirary life, whose cell vpon a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, was enuironed with a huge number of sna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, which yet God at the praiers of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, destroied with a tempest, and afterward by his diuine prouidence, caused to be caried away by a great multitude of birds. The story by some, may be thought ridiculous, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incredible, and perchance, not many in all his booke more improbable: yet no reason, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hastily to censure so worthy a man, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter was, to seede our owne foolish fancy: more zealous of Gods glory I thinke we be not, then he was, nor more sharpe of iudgement, to
<pb facs="18"/> discerne betwixt truth and falshoode, nor yet more religious to auoide fabulous relations: why then should we be so captious, or curious as to doubt of that, whereof he made no scruple at all? Doth he not also note, by what meanes he came to the knowledge thereof, which was not by any vncertayne rumor; or flying tale, but from the mouth (as him selfe saith) of a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and faithfull Priest called <hi>Sanctusus,</hi> who dwelt in the same prouince of <hi>Valeria,</hi> where <hi>Florentius</hi> also led his life, and where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>he fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resaide miracle happened. By all which who seeth not, that none can, with any colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, quarrell at the truth of his narration. And, that Gods pleasure vouch saseth sometymes, in such small thinges as these, to shew his power, for the honour of his seruants, we learne out of holy scripture. For not only a small pece of groū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, as in this our case, nor an whole towne or prouince, but almost all the country of <hi>Egipt</hi> was pestered with fragges, and the face of the earth so couered with locusts, that they did cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume and spoile all herbes, and fruits of trees: which yet at the intercession of <hi>Moises,</hi> were<note place="margin">Exod. cap. 8. and cap. 10.</note> all by a westerne winde cast into the sea, so that not one remayned in all that lande.</p>
   <p>And not only in Gods word, but also in our owne chronicles, and that yet fresh in memory, we reade of as prodigious a thinge, concerning mice and owles: as that which <hi>S. Gregory</hi>
      <pb facs="20"/> telleth of snakes and birds. The strange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <note place="margin">Anno Domini 1581. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gni Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zab. 23.</note> is by <hi>Stovve</hi> thus sett downe. <hi>About hallowtide last past, in the marshes of Dansey hūdrec, in a place called South, minster, in the country of Essex, a strange thinge happened: there sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly appeared an infinite multitude of mice, which ouerwhelming the whole earth in the saide marshes, did sheare &amp; gnawe the grasse by the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, spoiling &amp; tainting the same, with their venimous teeth, in such sort, that the cattel which grased thereon were smitte, with a murrin, &amp; died thereof: which vermin by pollicy of man could not be destroied, till at lēgth it came to passe, that there flocked together, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same marshes, such a number of owles, as al the shire was not able to yelde, wherby the marshholders, were shortly deliuered from the vexation of the said mice.</hi> Hauing then the like miracle recorded in scripture, which no christian can deny: and an other accident as wonder full, though haply without any miracle at all, which fell out in our owne dayes: shall we be yet for all this, so wedd to our owne will, or peruersely setled in opinion, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue these, and to discredite the other: and in plaine termes, without all reason admit
<pb facs="21"/> what wee like, and reiect what wee please. This indeede may be the humor, of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant conceipt: but neuer can be the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, of a sober and staide iudgement.</p>
   <p>But what do I dispute in a matter so clere, as though the authority of one only <hi>S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> were not of more waight, to discharge him from falshoode, then the empty wordes of thousandes, that nowe liue to impeach him of that crime. Yet let vs graunt a thinge not to be graunted: to witt, that there be diuers false thinges reported in his booke, which is vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: that the most of his stories be not true, which is incredible: nay that they be all false and fables, which is monstrous and intollerable: yet this being admitted, of necessity for all that, graunted it must be, that all those points of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion before mentioned, as praier to Saints: praier for the deade: visitation of relickes: and the rest, were then belieued, and practised throughout the worlde: for otherwise, how coulde he haue spoken of them so familiarly, yf no such thinges had then bene in vse, which is sufficient to proue the antiquity of our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that it was the currant doctrine of the primatiue Church, which is the principall and maine pointe, that I intended now to proue.</p>
   <p>VVhat hath beue saide, I hope may yelde
<pb facs="19"/> full satisfaction, to any indisserent and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te man, that rather desireth truth for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his soule, then to contende in wordes, not to lose the victory. Yet for a more clere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of our saith, and to shew, that what religion <hi>S. Gregory</hi> speaketh of, was also long before his dayes generally taught, and receiued: I haue to the ende of this booke, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned an other small treatise taken out of the most famous and renowned doctor of Gods Church glorious <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> who liued two hundred yeares before the other: the contents whereof shall declare, that the faith of his dayes, was in these very points, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants condemne for most abhominable, the very selfe same which <hi>S. Gregory</hi> taught, and we now prosesse and mainetayne: and that so plainly, and perspicuously, as none shall deny it, that haue so much conscience, that their tongue can truly report what their harts do thinke: so that no doubt can be made, but that it was our religion which the Apostles planted in the world: and consequently, that which hath from them descended vnto vs, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall succession of Pastors and Doctors, as we can plentifully shew out of diuers histories, and the notable monuments of approued anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Much more concerning this matter might be saide, but a Preface giueth not scope
<pb facs="20"/> to large discourses: hereafter Gods grace assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting me, I intende more plentifully and exactly to intreate of this subiect.</p>
   <p>Before I conclude, I cannot but lightely touch one pointe which in reading, may somwhat trouble such as be not of learning, nor beaten in matters of controuersie. And it is concerning <note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 14. pag. 385.</note> one <hi>Seruulus</hi> registred in this booke for a Saincte, who albeit he knewe neuer a letter in the booke, yet did he cause the worde of God to be readd vnto him, and did much profit therein: which fact of his, may seme to some to controull the custome of the Catholicke churche, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liketh, nor alloweth, the promiscuall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the scriptures by ignorāt vulgar people. But the endes of this difficultie are so open, that the knot is soone loosed. For the Church neuer forbad the scripture in the three learned ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, of the Latin, Greke, &amp; Hebrewe: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Latin being the vulgar language in <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Seruulus</hi> liued, (thoughe som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what decayed by the mixture of forraine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation) lawfully might he doe that, which by no lawe was then forbidden. But suppose it had bene a vulgar translation, yet certaine it is, that the text was syncere, and not fashioned by certaine vpstart teachers to fitt that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which most pleased the ytching eares of
<pb facs="21"/> their newe disciples nor inuenimed with the deadly drugges, of hereticall inuention, as the translations of our aduersaries english Bibles be (not to speake of any other) as any that please, may sone finde in the <hi>Rhemes</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the latter edition, straight after the Preface, in a speciall rable made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: <note place="margin">Printed at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerp. 1600.

God forbidde.</p>
   <p>Besides all this I do not finde, that in those daies there was any such prohibition enacted against vulgar translations: no such necessitie then occurring, which might moue the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, to make any such lawe, men in those tymes generally proceedinge, with more discretion and moderation. But the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnes of latter times hath herein bene so exorbitant, that requisite it was, the precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te headines of mens vnbridled affections, shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de be restrained, and curbed by the seueritie of lawe. So in old tyme, not only fasting, but also watching in the Church vpon the Eues of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall feastes, was with greate deuotion obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: and <hi>Vigilantius</hi> the hereticke, about <note place="margin">Contra Vigilant.</note> that very pointe, taxed by the famous doctor <hi>S. Hieron:</hi> yet the greate abuses, which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tymes brought forth, caused that custome to be quite abandoned: for God hath left that
<pb facs="23"/> authoritye with his Church, in such matters as these, to commande or sorbidde, as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of tymes and edification of mens soules shoulde require.</p>
   <p>Lastly, neuer did the Church so forbidde vulgar translations, that they might no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies in priuate be readde of lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for euene in these our daies, they be founde generally in all languages translated by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes, and may be redde of those, that haue licence, which is easily graunted to such, as are knowne to be of staide iudgement, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and likely to reade them with spirituall profitt to theire soules, yea in those countries, which be not infested with the late doctrine of Protestants: marry where that infection ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, the reason of reading is more apparant, and consequently the libertie more inlarged. This being so, the fact of <hi>Seruulus</hi> giueth no shelter of refuge to the vnruly practise of our tymes, both because the scripture readde to him, was in the latin tongue, which neuer any lawe interdicted: and thoughe it had bene in an other vulgar language yet was it not tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the leuin of hereticall noueltie, against which kinde of Bibles in those daies, I suppose no prohibiting decree can be produced and though there coulde, yet not so strict, but that deuoute people and of an humble spirit.
