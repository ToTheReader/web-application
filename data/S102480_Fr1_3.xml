   <head>To the godly Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are at this day <hi>nine</hi> sorts of <hi>book-readers</hi> to be found amongst vs, &amp; but one of them to be commended.</p>
   <p>The first and worst are they, that reade to see, and see to carpe and cauil; like the <hi>Curre,</hi> that takes most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in biting and in baulling; or not vnlike the <hi>flesh-flie,</hi> that delighteth alwaies in sucking bloud, or sitting on the sore.</p>
   <p>The second are they, that account more of smoake then fire, and of a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming wit, then of solide wisedome, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting nothing in a manner but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties &amp; new conceipts; how rotten, vaine, idle &amp; scurrilous they care not,
<pb facs="9"/>
so they feed their fancie, and procure meriment; like the <hi>cow,</hi> that had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drinke puddle then pure water.</p>
   <p>The third are they, that will reade things indeed, which may stand them in some slead▪ but they vse to reade by snatches, here and there, euery where and no where; like the <hi>Dogges</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> that dranke running, taking here and there a lap as they went: Or if they reade without skipping, it is then with such fury, like <hi>Iehues</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, as that they swallow downe their bookes without chewing, and so let their good digesting.</p>
   <p>The fourth are they, that preferre the shell before the kernel, and the dish before the meat, regarding the sound rather then the sence, &amp; the outward shape of the worke more then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward substance; as if a man should delight more in the colour then in the corps: and not much vnlike to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that turne ouer their bookes,
<pb facs="9"/>
but please themselues best with the painted <hi>Babies</hi> in them.</p>
   <p>A fift kind there are, that reade much, but practise nothing; as if a man should take meat into his mouth to please his tast, but let none goe downe into his stomack to comfort na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Or if they do practise any thing it is worse then nothing, base and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; like a filthy <hi>Chanell,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues the sweet light and heate of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> but affoords nothing but stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fumes and infectious smels.</p>
   <p>The sixt are they, that had rather reade naturall or humane and ciuill histories, and treatises of arts and sciences liberall and mechanicall, then Ecclesiasticall and diuine discourses; it seemes esteeming more of the <hi>Maide</hi> then of the <hi>Mistris,</hi> of humanity more then of diuinity, &amp; of the body more then of the soule; like <hi>Aesops Cocke,</hi> that set more by a barly corne, thē by all the <hi>gemmes</hi> and iewels in the
<pb facs="10"/>
world besides.</p>
   <p>The seauenth are they, which reade to talke, and talke to shew themselues (and yet we know that empty barrels and the hollow <hi>Drums</hi> do make the greatest sounds) as if they read for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to know to talke, and that by talking they might be knowne; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding more (it seemes) the floating knowledge of the braine, then the soundnesse of the heart and life, and affecting rather to seeme to be, then to be indeed; vsually dealing with their bookes as ful-fed children do with their bread, which either play with it, or cast it to the <hi>Dogges.</hi> So all their religion is placed in their tong, and their substance is but shews and shadowes, like that counterfait of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and stuft vp with wind like a bladder. Though they deuoure whole bookes, yet are they (like <hi>Pharoahs kine</hi>) as ill fauoured, and as leane &amp; lank for true grace (as by their liues
<pb facs="10"/>
appeareth) as they were before, and worse thē many of the heathen, which neuer truly knew what <hi>Christian</hi> vertue meant.</p>
   <p>There are others, that reade much and profit nothing, but cast vp their morsels like a crazy stomack. They come to the <hi>well</hi> without their pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, or else with riuen vessels, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their thoughts distracted, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>heir head fraught with impertinent studies; like <hi>Table-bookes,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eing written ful already, wil receiue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o new letters, till the old be razed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ut in whole, or in part. Or else it is because they run on, and neither looke backe, nor minde their way (but onely labour to ridde ground) nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hew their cadde, nor call on God for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>is benigne assistance; which of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>en ought in all holy enterprises to be desired with earnest suite vpon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>nces of their soules.</p>
   <p>The ninth, which are the onely
<pb facs="11"/>
good, are they that reade attentiuely, throughly and discreetly, to reap some good, whereby they may do good to themselues and other also, as occasion &amp; their calling serueth, and to these I do propose this booke.</p>
   <p>If thou wouldest behold the office of Gods Workmē, &amp; the honour which of duty ought to be performed to them: if thou wouldest know the resemblance betwixt the <hi>Church</hi> and a <hi>Field</hi> &amp; <hi>House</hi>: if thou wouldest see the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and honour of all her children, or wouldest learne how thou maist be rich in the fruits of righteousnesse, &amp; how to giue the Lord such entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as is well pleasing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>im; thou maist, if it ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se thee to reade, reuolue and ponder these few instructions, which were summarily not long since deliuered to a few by word, and now more largely published to the common view of all by writing VVherein I do professe plaine dealing and the profit
<pb facs="11"/>
of the simplest, rather then obscure and curious exactnesse; euer iudging it better to walke in the open aire, then to run inuisibly in the clouds, &amp; to leaue some milke in the brests, then to sucke them dry, or presse them till they bleed.</p>
   <p>The God of heauen and earth make them profitable to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e, that walking by thē in this vale of misery, through the wildernesse of this wofull world, thou maist one day come, and that in season, into celestiall <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of promise, and rest vpon his holy mountaine. <hi>Amen,</hi>
