   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eere Christians, if euer good <hi>Dauid</hi> had iust cause to crie out &amp; say, <hi>My eies gush out with riuers of waters because they keep not the law.</hi> Psa. 119.136. If the same Prophets heart did tremble and shake for feare of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when he saw the flowing wickednesse of his time, and the heauie hand of God for the same; for these are his words, <hi>Thou hast tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den downe all them that depart from thy statutes: for their deceit is vain. Thou hast taken away all the wicked of the earth like drosse; therefore I loue thy testimonies,
<pb facs="3"/>
my flesh trembleth for feare of thee, and I am afraid of thy iudgments,</hi> Psal. 119.118, 119, 120. Jf euer <hi>Lot, Ieremie,</hi> and the godlie men that are recorded in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> had iust cause to mourne &amp; pine awaie with great griefe and zeale, in beholding the contempt and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Gods sacred lawe, &amp; the most abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable life of the people in their daies. How much more may the godlie Ministers, and all good people weepe and consume themselues away and send foorth euerie daie fountaines of teares, to behold, and continuallie to see this our age and time, (which should be a most happie time for knowledge, faith, and holinesse of life, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how long a season God hath lent vnto vs his holie word, and powred his benefites vppon vs) which are yet a most crooked and stiff-nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked generation: for the hearts of the people are not onely become hard and stonie, but also their eares (as the Prophet Ieremie saith) are become vncircumcised, that they cannot abide to heare Gods word: yea it is a reproach vnto them, and they haue no delight therein: <hi>Iere. 6.10.</hi> also how sinne aboundeth J neede not to shew: for this our land lieth in sinnes, and is frosen in the dregges thereof: <hi>Zephaniah, 1.12.</hi> Euen so
<pb facs="4"/>
much that we iustifie <hi>Zodama</hi> and <hi>Gomora, Ezeki. 16.</hi> for iust and holie Cities: for such are the sinnes of <hi>England,</hi> and so vile, that it maie rather be accounted a polluted Land, and a seat of iniquitie: for (alack) how deepelie is she sunken in the sinke of sinne, and how abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablie doth shee send foorth euerie day more &amp; more all kindes of Pride, Whoredomes, Incests, Murthers, Theftes, Couetousnes, Oppressions, Vsuries, Cursings, Periuries, Blaesphemies, and such like: in so much that we may saie with the holie &amp; good Prophet <hi>Hosea, Hear the word of the Lord ye childrē of Israel</hi> (yea rather ye children &amp; inhabitants of England) <hi>for the Lord hath a controuersie with the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the lande because there is no truth nor mercie, nor knowledge of God in the lande. By swearing and lying killing and stealing, and whoring, they breake out, and bloud toucheth bloud: Therefore shall the land mourne &amp; euerie one that dwelleth therein shall bee cut off with the beasts of the field, and the foules of the Heauen, and also the fishes of the sea shall be taken away: yet let none rebuke nor reprooue other, for thy people are as
<pb facs="4"/>
they that rebuke the Priests.</hi> Hosea 4.1, 2, 3, 4. and what is the fountaine and cause of these euils and rebellious transgressions: suerly infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie and ignorance of Gods word (as the good Apostle <hi>S. Paule</hi> affirmeth in these wordes). <hi>This I say therefore and testifie in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles walk in vanitie of their minde, hauing their cogitation darkned, and being stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the life of God, through the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norāce that is in thē, because of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their heart, which beeing past fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, haue giuen themselues vnto wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to worke all vncleannesse euen with greedinesse.</hi> Eph. 4.17, 18, 19. <hi>I beseech you therefore deare brethren,</hi> and good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>by the mercies of God, that ye giue vp your bodies a liuing sacrifice, holy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, which is your resonable seruing of God; &amp; fashion not your selues like vnto this world, but be yee changed by the renuing of your minde, that ye may proue what is the good will of God, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and perfect.</hi> Rom. 12.1, 2. And this time of ignorance (as the same Apostle testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) God regardeth not: but he admonisheth al
<pb facs="5"/>
men euerie where to repent. Act. 17.30. Againe, <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, and stand vp frō the dead, and Christ shall giue thee light: wherefore be not vnwise, but vnderstand what the will of the Lord is.</hi> Eph. 5.14, 17. <hi>That we being filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisedome and spirituall vnderstanding, may walke worthie of the Lord, and please him in all things, beeing fruitful in all good works.</hi> Col. 1.9, 10. And that this knowledge, faith, and fruitfulnesse in all good workes may abound in vs, as the elect &amp; deer childrē of God, let vs diligētly read the book of god, &amp; cōtinually meditate on the same for the Prophet saith. <hi>Blessed is the man, that doth not walke in the counsell of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seate of the scorneful: but his delight is in the Lawe of the Lord, and in his Lawe doth he meditate day &amp; night: for he shall be like a tree planted by the riuers of waters that wil bring foorth her fruite in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: whose leafe shall not fade, so whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he shall do, shall prosper. Psal. 1.1.2, 3.</hi> Now, for the common benefit, and better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Gods people and thy selfe: (christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb facs="5"/>
reader) J haue caused this little and short treatise of christian points of religion, to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and published: and although, it bee but small in volume, yet I doubt not, but if it be well read and printed in minde, it shall minister great good, to further thy knowledge, to confirm thy faith, and to increase true holines in thee. And this I dare promise thee, that there are some things handled in this Catechisme, both in matter and manner, which other Catechismes dooth not as once meddle and intreate of, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which are intreated of some in their bookes, haue J drawne in a briefe method, for the benifit of the reader. And whereas many things are yet in doubt among the multitude and great controuersies doo rise by them, I haue breefely, yet soundly opened the trueth of them: finally there is not that point, which I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of, but I haue first defined the same, and haue set downe the definitions, of all the hardest words, which are commonly vsed by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the word, and in the large and great volumes of the learned; that the simple, who is altogether ignorant of the true sense of them, may vnderstand, not onely the Preacher and bookes, which they both heare and read, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb facs="6"/>
the verie words as iustification, sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, grace, redemption, law and such like. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing my purpose is onely to doo good vnto Gods Church, and my paine great herein, yet godly, I hope all faithfull people will accept the same and both praise God for this litle worke, and pray vnto God for mee, to increase his good gifts and graces in my soule vnto my liues end. Amen. Thus I take my leaue from my house at <hi>Kingswood</hi> the second of <hi>September.</hi>
