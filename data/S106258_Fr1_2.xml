   <p>In the former Workes of this Author you may observe his <hi>Eloquence</hi> for GOD: In this for his <hi>Prince</hi>: in vindicating the Soveraignty of <hi>Kings,</hi> as the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Ordinance of GOD against those

proud usurpations upon them by that <hi>Man of sinne,</hi> and in extolling Piety, which is then set in the highest place, when it wisely rules, and directs in the <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>wayes</hi> of righteous Governours.</p>
   <p>I will say no more of this <hi>Worke,</hi> nor of the <hi>Workeman</hi>: for neither <hi>he</hi> nor <hi>it</hi> stand in need of my praise, it onely contents me that I have lived, to see him live againe, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his <hi>will,</hi> to execute his <hi>trust</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me; though it might have beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter done by another if hee had so pleased. The law of reason and right pardons some aberrations in the <hi>Worke</hi> where there is a necessity of <hi>Doing,</hi> and I doubt not but a <hi>loving Reader</hi> will performe this <hi>right</hi> to me, that am content thus to expose my selfe for his sake.
