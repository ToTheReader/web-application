   <head>¶ The Preface vnto the Subseqnent.</head>
   <p>WIth edged tooles (saith the old Prouerbe) it is ill spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; but farre more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: yea damnable is it to dally with Scripture,<note place="margin">Hebr. 4. 12.</note> the two-edged Sword of the <hi>Eternall:</hi> for so to doe is a breach of the third Commandement; <hi>and he<note place="margin">Iames 2. 10.</note> that failes in one point, is guiltie of all.</hi> If the magnitude of this sinne had beene considered by the Bayter of Women, the lamentable, yet iust reward thereof, as of all other sinnes without repentance, would, if he had but a seruile feare, haue restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him from transgressing herein. But as one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide of all true feare of Gods indignation against wilfull sinners (for as ignorance doth somewhat extenuate a fault, so doth knowledge much aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate it) he hath made the <hi>exordium</hi> of his braine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke exhalation against women, to be a peruerting of a part of holy Writ; <hi>ex v<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>guibus leonem,</hi> iudge of this Lion by his pawe. For if the fore foot be mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, doubtlesse the whole bodie is correspondent

thereto. The Porch indeede is fowle, but hee that viewes the sequel, as I haue done, shall find a lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall of heathenish Assertions, Similies, and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, illiterate composition, irreligious inuectiues, and (which is worst) impious blasphemies therein included, filthy rubbish, more fitte to be heaped vp by a Pagan, then one that beareth the name of a Christian.</p>
   <p>But lest it should not onely be thought, but also said, that I finde fault where none is; or that I do ill to mislike the Worke, and not make the Author therewith acquainted, that if he please, hee may answer for himselfe: I thinke it not amisse to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose some few <hi>Quaeres</hi> vnto the Bayter of Women, which I haue abstracted out of his infamous Booke, as himselfe confesseth it to be in his Epistle to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
