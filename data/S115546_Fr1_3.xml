                 <title>The summe of the conference betwene Iohn Rainoldes and Iohn Hart : touching the head and the faith of the Church. Wherein by the way are handled sundrie points, of the sufficiencie and right expounding of the Scriptures, the ministerie of the Church, the function of priesthood, the sacrifice of the masse, with other controuerises of religion: but chiefly and purposely the point of Church-gouernment ... Penned by Iohn Rainoldes, according to the notes set downe in writing by them both: perused by Iohn Hart, and (after things supplied, &amp; altered, as he thought good) allowed for the faithfull report of that which past in conference betwene them. Whereto is annexed a treatise intitled, Six conclusions touching the Holie Scripture and the Church, writen by Iohn Rainoldes. With a defence of such thinges as Thomas Stapleton and Gregorie Martin haue carped at therein</title>

   <head>Iohn Hart to the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ehold (gentle Reader) the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which thou hast so long loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, betweene M. Rainoldes and me, at length ended: as also it had beene more then twelue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes since, had not my selfe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the cōming of it foorth, when it was nigh readie to be deliuered to the Printer. For it is now aboue two yeares ago, that the right honorable, Syr <hi>Francis Wal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>singham,</hi> as he had shewed me great fauour from the time that I was apprehended, in graunting me libertie of conference at home, first in mine owne countrie, and afterwarde in prison: so, when the sentence of death was past vpon me, hee ceased not still to offer me the same fauour if I would admit it. VVhich I, grounding my selfe vpon the most certayne foundation of the Church so strengthened by God that it shall stand for euer, did gladly yeeld to, and (as became me) accepted of it with all dutie. VVherevpon his Honour sent for <hi>M. Rainoldes</hi> to conferre with me: taking order also that I should be furnished with whatsoeuer bookes I did neede thereto. But after we had spent certayne
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>
weekes together in conference by word of mouth, and I continued still in my former mind: he desired to haue the summe thereof in writing, that he might see the groundes on which I stood. And to this intent we set downe together breefe notes of the points that we dealt in: I shewing my reasons with the places of the autours whose iudgement and learning I rather trusted too, then to my owne skill; and <hi>M. Rainoldes</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them in such sort as he thought good. Howbeit, those notes being so short (as pointing to thinges ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then vnfolding them) that they could not well bee vnderstood by any, but our selues onely, vnlesse they were drawne more largely and at full: my selfe being troubled then with more necessary cogitations of death, (as altogether vncertaine when I might be called to yeeld vp mine account before God and man,) requested <hi>M. Rainoldes</hi> to take paines to penne them according to our notes thereof. Promising him that I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use it when he had doon it, and allow of it, if it were to my mind; or otherwise correct, if I misliked ought in it. This paines he vndertooke, and sending me the partes thereof from time to time as he finished them, I noted such thinges as I would haue added, or altered therein, and he performed it accordingly. But when I perceiued that it was prepared to be set foorth in print: I sought meanes to stay it all that I could, for some considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="11" facs="6"/>
which seemed to me very great and important. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry since that againe vnderstāding it to be his Honours pleasure that it should go forward, wherevnto he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me also by speciall warrant the vse of such bookes as I should call for to helpe my selfe withall: I set afresh vpon it, &amp; by letters written vnto <hi>M. Rainoldes</hi> &amp; receiued from him, I had mine owne speeches &amp; reasons perfitted, as I would. VVherefore, I acknowledge that he hath set downe herein a true report of those things which past in conference betweene vs, according to the grounds and places of the autours, which I had quoted &amp; referred my self too. As for that which he af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmeth <note n="*" place="margin">

      </note> in one place, that <hi>I haue told him, that my opinion is, the Pope may not depose Princes</hi>: in deede I told him so much. And in truth I thinke that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the spiritual power be more excellēt &amp; worthie thē the temporall; yet they are both of God, neither doth the one depend of the other. VVherevpon I gather as a certaine conclusion, that the opinion of them, who holde the Pope to be a temporall Lord ouer Kings &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is vnreasonable and vnprobable altogether. For he hath not to meddle with thē or theirs ciuilly, much lesse to depose them or giue away their kingdomes: that is no part of his commission. He hath in my iudgment the Fatherhoode of the Church, not a Princehood of the world: Christ himself taking no such title vpon him,
<pb n="12" facs="7"/>
nor giuing it to Peter, or any other of his disciples. And that is it which I meant to defend in him, and no other soueraintie. Humbly desiring pardon of her Maiestie, my gratious soueraine Lady, for my plaine dealing in that, which (so Christ helpe me) I take to be Gods cause, and the Churches only. As I do also most willingly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my selfe to the curteous correction of all men, who, through greater skill, and perfitter iudgement, see more then I doe in the depth of these matters whereof I haue conferred. Farewell, gentle Reader: and now that I haue shewed thee my dealing herein, let me obtaine this little request at thy handes, that thou be not too hasty in giuing thy iudgemēt, before thou hast weighed all things sincerely and vprightly. </p>
