   <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NORABLE, JOHN LORD FINCHE, BARON OF FORDWICH, Lord Keeper of the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> and one of his Majesties most honorable Privie Councell, &amp;c.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His little Booke being written by so excellent a person as the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and treating of so weighty a Subject as the <hi>Interest of the Princes and States of Christendome,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived also with good esteeme by some judicious men, I thought it not amisse to communicate the same, imploying the advantage of so many spare minutes (during my abode in <hi>France</hi>) as to make it speake <hi>English.</hi> Then being invited to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it to the light, to the publike view, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like voyce taught it to implore your <hi>Lordships</hi> protection, whether be considered the <hi>quality</hi> of the Author, the <hi>gravity</hi> of the Matter, or
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>Knowledge</hi> in the Originall wherein it was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For as the Author was noble, and eminent in his place; in like manner is your Honour, shining in your orb as a starre of the first Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, lending a most benigne and gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to the just causes of the oppressed, distressed, fatherlesse, and widow. The Matter is of politick maximes, and divers remarkable occurrences in sundry Republikes: and to whom now can this be more aptly addressed then to a principall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of State, in whom Prudence, Science, and Integrity (in a sweet harmony) doe all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to make a perfect conduct of affaires, for the glory of God, the honour of the King, and the good of this Church and Common-wealth? Lastly, the Originall from whence it was derived, being <hi>French:</hi> your admired knowledge, and unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd expressions in the same language, may speake you as well a <hi>patterne</hi> in the originall, as a <hi>Patron</hi> in this translation. For my owne part (if it may be permitted to say any thing of my selfe) I speak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently <hi>(My Lord)</hi> with your permission, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I had not so much vanity as to perswade my selfe that any thing could proceed from me, worthy your reception, or advantagious to your Honour,
<pb facs="3"/>
(since that my act herein shewed more of duty then merit, and its insufficiencie demanded rather par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don then remuneration;) yet had I some kinde of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, that a favourable acceptation would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine what I most humbly present, seeing the most heroick minde disdaines not the meanest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, but like the Sunne (that nobler Planet) spreads his indifferent rayes upon all, as well on ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as glorious objects. These and such like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations made me adventure (but with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and humility) to prefix here your most Honorable Name, that thereby this Book might live; and withall incessantly beseeching him whose name is <hi>I AM,</hi> to preserve and continue Yours in perpetuall <hi>being,</hi> in all honour and prosperity, and to <hi>write</hi> your <hi>name</hi> in a larger volume, <hi>the Book of life.</hi> For which end the <hi>Lord</hi> be still your <hi>Keeper,</hi> and <hi>Seale you with</hi> that great <hi>Seale, the holy Spirit of promise, to the day of redemption.</hi> So prayeth</p>
