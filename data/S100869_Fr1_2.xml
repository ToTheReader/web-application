WORTHIE, SIR HORACE VERE,
Knight, Lord Gouernour of his Maiesties Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionarie
Towne of Briel in Holland; and chiefe

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honourable, and my best
Lord; it shal not offend any that
know your Lordship, how God
hath honoured you with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
markes of Honour in your noble
Birth, great Exploits, true vertues, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
godlinesse, (so much the greater, by
how much the rarer dignities) that I stile
you, right Honourable: and I trust it will
not offend you, that I call you my best
Lord, whom I haue long followed, and next
vnder God doe depend vpon. If ought
need excuse, it is then this boldnesse, that I
presume vpon your fauour so much, as to
dedicate this Treatise vnto your name, and
that without your Lordships priuitie.</p>
   <p>The Treatise (right worthy) being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
<pb facs="3"/>
in it selfe, is not vnworthie a noble
Patron, being written of a notable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by a notable Minister, and in my
opinion so much the more agreeable vnto
you, by how much you declare your self a
zealous louer of that Truth which this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
maintaineth, and haue with losse of
blood and hazard of life, defended with
your sword, what this man by his pen.</p>
   <p>As touching my part therein, which is
the least, and the translation; though it be
not so well worthie of you: yet because it
is due to you, being done by one of your
Lordships Companie, and in the towne of
your Garrison, where it was also penned,
and by me that haue deuoted my selfe vnto
your seruice in any dutie I can performe: I
hope your Lordship will not only pardon
my boldnesse, but accept my dutifull affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in this, which in my prayers to
God for you shall euer shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to be such as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
me.</p>
