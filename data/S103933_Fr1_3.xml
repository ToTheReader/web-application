      <salute>GENTLE READER,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>Hauing lately translated the life of <hi>S. Aldegond,</hi> with title of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse &amp; Abbesse, proposing her as a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely imitable patterne of Religious women to either Sex: I thought good of my self, now to select likewise an other of the blessed Saints of heauen, to exhibit, as an excellent Modell, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>dea, to frame the life by, in al those honourable states of that Sex. Which I haue done with no litle hazard, I feare mee, of my owne reputation to giue satisfaction to some freinds, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> sweetely I must confesse, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, haue extorted it from mee. Ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> remaynes now (<hi>Good courteous Reader▪</hi> to giue thee accompt of the manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> most Writers of the Liues of Saints.</p>
   <p>Some there are so scrupulous in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>
      <pb facs="4"/>
matter of History, who as if they were to make an Inuentory of goods, or to Coppy out a Court Role of good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; wil not haue a word more or lesse, then they find auerred by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours from point to point.</p>
   <p>Whereas this heere is meerely of an other kind, not copied forth, or lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally extracted from any Precedent of her Life, but drawne and deriued from the golden Mines of the approued Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of Saints, as <hi>Surius,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Basil Santor,</hi> in his Booke entituled <hi>Pratum Spirituale,</hi> who both, had borrowed the same from <hi>Iacobus Montanus</hi> of the citty of <hi>Spire</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> not wel to be contradicted.</p>
   <p>Behold the foundation of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; as for the lineaments which are nothing substantiall to the matter, they stand rather as ornamēts thereof, and proceede from the liberty of him, who assumes so much vpon himself, to embellish and couer the nakednes of a bare Narration, which breedes but a loathing and tedious fastidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the Reader: These I say are
<pb facs="5"/>
stroakes of my pencel to highten and adorne it or els borrowed from the rudiments of some Maisters of spirit; to edify withall; which, next to the liuely example of the Saint, is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary scope I ayme at in this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke: Being otherwise a pious story, and of it self powerfull to excite the will, and moue deuotion to the Saint; On which (as I sayd) I haue layd some colours, as a Limmer on a simple cutt of black and white.</p>
   <p>This haue I said to let thee see, <hi>freindly Reader,</hi> my sincerity in this point, and to winne a confidence in thee towardes mee. Whereas indeed, as it is not the custome in the Exchequer to peize so scrupulously each light peece of siluer, to find whether it be weight or no; but to passe them togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the other peeces of more weight, currant with the rest. And as in traffique and commerce it were too importune, to be still calling for scales for euery single penny; so is it likewise in handling the pen, to be put to the iustify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>ng of euery litle thing
<pb facs="5"/>
which makes not much to the purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se whether true or false. It is only in dauncing the cinque pace and measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, that men stand numbring their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and not in performing of long voyages.</p>
   <p>True resemblance as the Daughter of Truth, &amp; coniecture the Daughter of true resemblāce, being al as Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, &amp; Daughter, haue great sympathyes and powerfull correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencyes with each other. So as if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant impossibility, absurdity, or extreame vnlikelyhoods cause not a breach, there will appeare a goodly harmony amongst them. And truly wee should bee too precize, to set downe a List here of all the scruples that might be made of trifling exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions in this kind, by such as are cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and curious censurers of things indifferent; who haue their eyes filled with a noxious humour, that makes them behold al things of the colour the defluxion is. Who should doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like those, that listen to a Lute, with a iudicious eare, that meeting by
<pb facs="6"/>
chaunce, with some light touch or other, scarce sensible, among a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of better stroakes, through the prompt volubility of the Lutenests hand in running his diuisions, dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the same and reflect on the rest, which loose not their grace awhit for so light a fault, and hold such slurrs as ornaments, rather to the rest, and as moles in a beautifull face, which grace the same.</p>
   <p>Thus, <hi>gentle Reader,</hi> you haue the full satisfaction I can giue you heerin: This only I must needes admonish you, that you bee not troubled, when you meete with another Treatise of this <hi>Saint,</hi> more curiously and elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly written by a neater quill, but to accompt the same as it is; an Abstract rather of her Life directed to a noble Lady, and consequently most apt for such, who likely affoard not leysure to attend to treatises of greater bulke. Whereas this same here is meant for all, and intended as I sayd, as a model and patterne of the three states &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiōs of Women lyuing in the world:
<pb facs="6"/>
While here if they be Virgins, they shal find very notable Examples in her life, being a Virgin: If Wiues, they may see how to carry themselues, and to leade a life meritoriously with their husbands: if Widowes they may lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by her to contemne the vanityes of the world, and if they be Ladyes and Princesses, they may behold how great a Lady shee was, notwithstanding her so great annihilation of her self, as shall appeare in the Treatise. Shee being the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> a mighty Monarchy, Dutches, and wife of the <hi>Lantgraue</hi> of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> and Princesse of <hi>Hassia,</hi> Protectresse, and Patronesse of the Nunnes and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of the third Order of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of <hi>S. Frauncis.</hi> To whom I fly for succour and assistance in these my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in her seruice, and to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable acceptance of that litle I am able to performe to serue you with.</p>
