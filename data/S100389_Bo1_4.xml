Wherein all the principall arguments which haue hitherto beene brought by Cardinall Bellarmine, Iacobus Gretzer, Leonard Lessius, Martin Becanus, and diuers others, against the new oath of allegiance, lately established in England by act of Parliament, are sincerely, perspicuously, and exactly examined. By Roger Widdrington, an English Catholike. Translated out of Latin into English by the author himselfe,whereunto hee hath also added an appendix, wherein all the arguments, whach that most learned diuine Franciscus Suarez, hath lately brought for the Popes power to depose princes, and against the aforesaid oath of allegiance, are sincerely rehearsed, and answered</title>

   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not long since <hi>(Christian Reader)</hi> that I did set foorth an <hi>Apologie</hi> for the <hi>Soueraignty of Princes</hi> against the reasons of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who endeuoureth to <hi>demonstrate,</hi> that his opinion for the <hi>Popes</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to depose Princes <hi>is certaine as a point of faith,</hi> and to impugne the contrary opinion of certaine Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes <hi>as hereticall.</hi> The which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie</hi> (being made by me, God is my witnesse, not vpon desire either to contradict or to traduce Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whom I doe greatly honour, but onely to find out the truth, and to free from that foule imputation of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie some vertuous and learned Catholikes, and who haue very well deserued of the Catholike Church, who if they were liuing would nothing neede the patronage of other men to defend themselues) is taken in very euill part by some, who both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues doe wonderfully exclaime against it, and withall doe set on children, women, and also men especially who bee vnlearned and doe scarcely vnderstand a syllable thereof, to vse all manner of reproachfull and execrable speeches against it For they say, to omit slanders of lesse moment, that it is a <hi>temerarious, scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> and <hi>erroneous</hi> booke, <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>(flat hereticall,)</hi> or <hi>wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Catholike faith.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="2">2 <hi>For what greater temeritie,</hi> say they, <hi>can be imagined, then that one or two obscure Authors should oppose themselues against threescore and ten most famous Doctors, whose names cardinall Bellarmine doth
<pb facs="233"/>
relate, yea and</hi> as Cardinall Bellarmine himselfe affirmeth,<note n="a" place="margin">In praefat. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Barcl.</note>

         </gap>re to prouoke the whole campe of Catholikes? Is it not also an incredible arrogancie not onely not to yeeld to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon receiued opinion of so many most graue, most learned, and most holy men, but also to lay vpon them an imputation of treason, as it is cleere</hi> say they, <hi>that</hi> Widdrington <hi>hath done, who oftentimes in his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie seemeth to auerre, that all those who giue authority to the Pope to depose Princes, doe very great wrong to Soueraigne Princes, and if there are Subiects doe commit the detestable crime of treason?</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="3">3 <hi>And that</hi> this Apologie <hi>of</hi> Widdrington <hi>is very scandalous, it is</hi> say they, <hi>too too manifest, seeing that he giueth licence to Secular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to forbid bookes, which seemeth onely to belong to the Popes Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and other Bishops, and to those who are put in authority by them for that purpose; and also be giueth scope to the said Princes to persecute the Church of God, and freely to commit any wickednesse whatsoeuer without being subiect to any temporall punishment for the same: yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to reiect at their owne pleasure such Preachers, who are sent by the Popes holinesse to aduance the Catholike saith in their Dominions, from which doubtlesse no man can deny but that very great scandalls will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise. And moreouer he seemeth to reprehend very saucily Cardinall</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, <hi>the cheefe champion at this day of the Catholike Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Sectaries, both by giuing such an ignominious title to his Apologie, and also bp pretending to confute him by his owne grounds, as hauing handled this so great a question with little sincerity, and also in many things contradicted himselfe, which assuredly not without great scandall seemeth to giue too ample occasion both to Catholikes, not to haue his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bookes of Controuersie in that good estimation, wherewith hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they haue beene respected by all men, and also to the aduersaries of the Catholike Church not to returne so speedily to the vnity therof whiles they see Catholikes to be at variance among themselues, and to write and speake so bitterly one against an other.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="4">4 Lastly, <hi>that</hi> Widdringtons <hi>booke is flat hereticall and wholly repugnant to the Catholike faith, or at leastwise erroneous,</hi> Cardinall Bellarmine <hi>doth euidently prooue by nine Councells approued by the Pope, whereof three of them were Generall Councells: Neither can hee doubtlesse be excused from heresie, or at leastwise from</hi> error, <hi>who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth to heare the voice of the Church, and wittingly and willing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth to contradict so many Councells, which doe manifestly declare what Catholike doctrine teacheth in this point.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="5">5 These be princpal obiections which these seuere censurers out of ouermuch heate of spirit doe make against my <hi>Apologie,</hi> which to confute and so to cleere my selfe of these there slanders I thinke it to be a very easie matter. And if in cleering my selfe of these imputations I shall seeme to be ouerlong, and to exceed
<pb facs="233"/>
the due proportion beseeming a Preface of so small a booke, I humbly craue pardon of the <hi>Curteous Reader,</hi> for that hauing so fit an opportunity offered me at this present to cleere my selfe of such most wicked accusations, I thought it not conuenient to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer it any longer.</p>
   <p n="6">6 And to runne ouer all the particular heads in the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as they are propounded, and with as much breuity as may be, I will first of all take the definition of <hi>temerarious</hi> as it is now vsed by Diuines (omitting diuers other acceptions of <hi>temeritie</hi> which they doe alleage) from <hi>Dominicus Ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>es</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">2. 2. q. 11. ar 2.</note> a most learned Diuine, and who very lately since <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> whom hee ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth hath written of this matter: <hi>If,</hi> saith he, <hi>we do consider the definition of this word</hi> temerarious, <hi>euery proposition which is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall or erroneus, is too much</hi> temerarious, <hi>but yet more properly a</hi> temerarious <hi>proposition is said to bee that, when one in a matter of weight doth without good authority affirme any thing against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of the Church or of Diuines.</hi> Now whether this definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>temerarious,</hi> as it is taken properly, which Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> as I suppose, will admit, or at the least not reiect as <hi>improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> may rightly be applied to <hi>Widdringtons</hi> Apologie, it is to bee examined.</p>
   <p n="7">7 The matter doubtlesse whereof we now doe treat, I confesse to be of very great waight, as beeing a thing which concerneth the supreame authorities of the Ecclesiasticall and ciuill power, neither of this is there any controuersie betweene vs. Wherfore these two things remaine onely to be examined; the first, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing is contained in <hi>Widdringtons</hi> booke, which is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to the common opinion of the Church or of Diuines; the second, whether if there be any such thing contained therein it bee affirmed without good authority. For if it containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is contrary to the common opinion of the Church, or of Diuines, or if therein any such thing be affirmed, it is not affirmed without good authority, hee will doubtlesse auoid the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid imputation of <hi>temerity,</hi> and by the Law of <hi>Talio</hi> hee will with greater reason returne it backe vpon his Aduersaries.</p>
   <p n="8">8 But first of all thou must obserue, <hi>Learned Reader,</hi> (for to thee especially I do direct my speech) what is the marke at which <hi>Widdrington</hi> in his <hi>Apology for the Soueraignty of Princes</hi> doth aime, and what is the state of the controuersie betwixt him and Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> for this once being knowne, thou maist more easily iudge whether iustly or wrongfully the aforesaid crimes are laid to his charge. It is not therefore <hi>Widdringtons</hi> meaning, as some doe imagine, to impugne the more common opinion of Diuines, which granteth to the <hi>Pope</hi> authority to depose Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as <hi>apparantly false,</hi> and with <hi>inuincible arguments</hi> to <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi>
      <pb facs="234"/>
the contrarie to be true, but whereas some very few later Diuines, and especially Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> haue so egerly, and with such vehemencie taken vpon them to defend this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the <hi>Popes</hi> Holinesse to depose Princes, that they imagine to haue most cleerely conuinced the same, and feare not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to charge with <hi>heresie</hi> all those Catholikes, who in this point doe not run with them, this only was my intent to giue at the least a <hi>probable answere</hi> to the arguments of Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and to free vertuous and learned Catholikes from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable crime of <hi>heresie,</hi> whereof they are wrongfully taxed, and so to shew out of his owne grounds, not by <hi>conuincing,</hi> but by <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi> reasons, that his arguments are not altogether so <hi>certaine</hi> and inuincible, as that they doe <hi>euidently demonstrate,</hi> that those who deny such an authoritie, are not to be accounted of the companie of the faithfull, or to be excluded from the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments.</p>
   <p n="9">9 Wherefore the present controuersie which is betweene me and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> is not concerning this <hi>absolute question</hi> or proposition, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> can or cannot depose Princes for heresie or no, but concerning this <hi>modall proposition,</hi> whether it be so certaine, that the Pope by Christ his institution hath such an authoritie to depose Princes, as that those who defend the contrarie opinion, doe expose themselues to manifest danger of <hi>heresie, error,</hi> or of any other <hi>mortall sin.</hi> Whereupon although in my <hi>Apologie</hi> I brought certain arguments drawne from incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, which the Logicians call <hi>ad impossibile,</hi> to proue that <hi>Christ</hi> our Lord did not grant such an authoritie to the <hi>Pope,</hi> yet whosoeuer will diligently peruse my <hi>Apologie,</hi> will presently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that my intent was not to bring <hi>conuincing reasons,</hi> which doe cause a <hi>firme &amp; vndoubtfull assent,</hi> but only <hi>probable</hi> and such as are grounded vpon credible principles, and which are able to cause a <hi>probable perswasion.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="10">10 And from hence any man may plainly perceiue, that <hi>Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington</hi> doth not oppose himselfe either against all Diuines, or against the common opinion of the Church or of Doctors, but only against very few writers; considering that among those 70. <hi>Authors</hi> who are related by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> very few are to be found who (although they are perchance of opinion that the <hi>Pope</hi> by <hi>Christ</hi> his institution hath authoritie to depose Princes for enormious crimes) yet they doe not so peremptorily adhere to that opinion, as to taxe them with <hi>heresie</hi> who doe maintaine the contrary. And if Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the later Editions of his Bookes, yet bringing no new reason to confirme his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer opinion had no condemned the contrary opinion of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes as <hi>hereticall,</hi> but had suffered euery man to perseuere
<pb facs="234"/>
without danger of <hi>heresie</hi> in his owne opinion which he should thinke to be the truer, he had not truly had <hi>Widdrington</hi> to be his Aduersarie, or to haue attempted to ouerthrow his reasons as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to <hi>demonstrate an vndoubted point of faith.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="11">11 Moreouer, neither also is the opinion of Doctor <hi>Barclay</hi> to be reputed contrarie to the common opinion of the Church or of Doctors: for a cōmon opinion as it is taken in the defi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ion of <hi>temerarious,</hi> is not that which is opposite to a <hi>lesse common,</hi> but which is opposite to a <hi>singular opinion.</hi> But it is euident that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniō of Doctor <hi>Barclay</hi> is not a <hi>singular opinion</hi> of one ot two Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors only, whatsoeuer Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> so often repeating, <hi>one Barclay, only Barclay as an other Goliath against all Catholike writers</hi> doth affirme, seeing y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I haue in my <hi>Apologie</hi> related many Authors who are of that opinion, and as very well writeth <hi>Trithemius</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">In Chronico monasterij Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sang. ad annum 1106.</note>, <hi>it is a controuersie among Schoolmen, and it is not as yet decided by the Iudge whether the Pope hath authoritie to depose the Emperour</hi> or no</p>
   <p n="12">12 <hi>The testimonie of many Schoole-Diuines,</hi> saith <hi>Canus</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Lib 8. de locis cap. 4.</note>, <hi>if other learned men dot stand against them, is of no greater force to make men to beleeue them, then either their reason, or grauer authoritie shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme. Whereupon in a Schoole disputation a Diuine ought not to bee ouerborne with the authoritie of many, but if he haue a few graue men of his opinion, he may doubtlesse stand against the opinion of very many.</hi> And passing well saith <hi>Nauarre</hi>
      <note n="e" place="margin">In Manuali cap. 27. nu. 289.</note>, It is not enough for an opini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on to be called the common opinion (to this effect to preiudice an other) for that cause only that many doe follow it, as in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of birds <hi>one flying all the rest doe follow. For I should thinke that opinion to be the more common to this effect, which sixe or seuen Classike Authors who purposely handle the matter should approue, then that which is allowed by fiftie, who are carried away almost only with the authoritie of those who haue written before them. For an opinion is not made a common opinion by the number of them who follow it, but by the waight of authority: Yea and I do thinke that either of the opinions may to this purpose be called a common opinion,</hi> when either <hi>of them hath eight or tenne graue Authors and who with iudgement doe embrace it</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">But this doctrine <hi>Nauarre</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth in the exteriour Court, for in the Court of Conscience he affirmeth in the same place nu. 288. that to auoid sinne it sufficeth to follow the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of one <hi>Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> whom wee thinke to be a vertuous and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man.</note>. Did not three or foure Bishops in the Generall Councell of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> in the cause of the Popes Primacie oppose themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst almost sixe hundred Bishops and the whole Councell, which three or foure doubtlesse Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly affirme are not therefore to be stained with any spot of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritie? Now if any man doe diligently consider the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and processe of this opinion, which granteth to the <hi>Pope</hi> power to depose Princes he will easily perceiue, that the later maintainers of this opinion were not so much moued to follow it by force of reason, as drawne thereunto by the authoritie of those, who held it before them.</p>
   <p n="13">
      <pb facs="235"/>13 Neither can it also be sufficiently proued that this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depose Princes is so common, as Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth suppose for certaine. For it is not so cleere, that those 70. Authors, whom he bringeth as so many armed sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in defence of his opinion (and doth artificially place them in the forefront of his booke as it were in battell aray, to cause a terror in his Aduersarie discrying at the first to many troupes of armed men) doe altogether fauour his opinion. For to omit that most of them doe vehemently impugne Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion for the <hi>Popes</hi> indirect dominion or power in temporals, &amp; with <hi>great</hi> applause do approue the <hi>Popes</hi> direct power in tēporals, which Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth greatly mislike: <hi>first,</hi> it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that <hi>Alexander of Hales</hi> called the <hi>irrefragable Doctour (affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>
      <note n="g" place="margin">3. part q. 40. membr. 5. q. 4. ad primum, secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum et tertium argumentum, see beneath in the Answere nu. 190.</note>
      <hi>that Kings if they offend are by God alone</hi> [&amp; not by the <hi>Pope] to be punished with temporall punishments)</hi> doth in expresse words impugne both the direct and indirect dominion or authoritie of the <hi>Pope</hi> in temporals, neither is it as yet apparant, as I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heeretofre<note n="h" place="margin">In my Apologie nu. 122.</note>, what was <hi>Almaines</hi> owne proper opinion. <hi>[And as for Ioannes Parisiensis it is euident</hi>

      <hi>that hee did limit the</hi> Popes <hi>chastising power to Ecclesiasticall censures.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="14">14 Besides, some of those 70. Authors doe vse such generall words, to wit, that <hi>the spirituall power doth extend to temporals,</hi> that <hi>the temporall power is subiect to the spirituall,</hi> and that <hi>the sword is vnder the sword,</hi> &amp;c. as that they may very well be vnderstood of subiection to be punished only spiritually not temporally, and of a power to command temporals, but not to dispose of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. Some others of the 70. Authors doe not speake Vniuersally of Kings, but only and expresly of the <hi>Romane Emperour;</hi> Now whether there be altogether the same reason of other Kings, as there is of him by reason of some pact or couenāt agreed vpō be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Pope</hi> &amp; the <hi>Emperour,</hi> &amp; by reason of a certaine <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> which he sweareth to the <hi>Pope,</hi> it may doubtlesse be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in questiō. But what the <hi>Emperour</hi> doth promise to the <hi>Pope</hi> by vertue of that Oath, which the <hi>Councell of Vienna</hi> doth declare to be <hi>truly an Oath of Allegiance,</hi> &amp; in what that allegiance doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly consist, it is not to our purpose to examine at this present.</p>
   <p n="15">15 <hi>Moreouer,</hi> what hindereth, that very many of those 70. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who teach that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depose <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperours,</hi> may not be vnderstood in that manner, as those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours related in my <hi>Apologie</hi>
      <note n="k" place="margin">A nu. 404.</note> together with the <hi>Glosse</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood those plaine words of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth, when he said, that <hi>Pope Zacharie did depose the King of France from his Kingdome,</hi> that is, say they, <hi>did consent to them who did depose him,</hi> or <hi>did declare him worthy to be deposed,</hi> or did counsell his deposition as lawfull, and did approue it by his authoritie? So that very few of those 70.

Authors except those who wrote of this matter in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age doe so expresly follow Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> opinion, but that their words may very wel be applied to some one of the aforesaid senses.</p>
   <p n="16">16 But be it so, let vs admit this opinion of Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> to bee commonly receiued by those 70. and also by other Doctors besides them, yet if one mooued with good authority doth stand against the common opiniō of the Church or of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, he is not according to the aforesaid definition to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>temerarious.</hi> But whether <hi>Widdrington</hi> hath brought suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reasons to free those Catholikes from <hi>temerity,</hi> who doe not grant to the <hi>Pope</hi> power to depose Princes, the prudent Reader will easily iudge by his <hi>Apologie,</hi> wherein he doth vtterly ouerthrow those pretended demonstrations of Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and also alleageth many authorities of holy Fathers, Popes and other Doctors, who doe affirme, that the Ecclesiastical pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath onely the spirituall and not the materiall sword, &amp; that Soueraigne Princes are to bee punished with temporall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by God alone, and moreouer hee produceth against the aforesaid opinion of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which is vulgarly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the common opinion, eight at the least graue Authors (yea and the whole kingdome of France, if credit may bee giuen to <hi>Petrus Pithaeus</hi>) who according to the doctrine of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> before <note n="l" place="margin">Nu. 12.</note> related, are sufficient to make that opinion which they follow to be accounted a common opinion to this purpose or effect, that we may lawfully and with a secure conscience follow it: &amp; lastly he assigneth diuers reasons, why this opinion which doth fauor the <hi>Popes</hi> power in temporalls, is so common, and hath so greatly increased from the first beginning therof vnto these times, which reasons of his whosoeuer will dulie consider, may doubtles haue iust cause to wonder, how that in any books of Catholike writers there is left any memory at all, whereby euen obscurely it is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that this temporal power of the <hi>Pope</hi> was euer by Schoole Diuines called in question.</p>
   <p n="17">17 But my aduersaries doe obiect, that Widdrington <hi>neither hath euidenly conuinced by his reasons, that the Pope hath not the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid power to depose Princes, neither hath hee faithfully related the authority of those Doctors whom he citeth for his opinion, for that some of them, and especially</hi> Gregorius Tholosanus, and <hi>Antonius de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellis doe in expresse words affirme, that the Pope hath power to depriue hereticall Kings of their Kingdomes.</hi> Neuerthelesse that these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections are friuolous any learned man, who will attentiuely read his Apologie, will manifestly perceiue. For it was not <hi>Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dringtons</hi> meaning to bring demonstratiue arguments, which should euidently conuince his owne opinion, but his principall
<pb n="402" facs="236"/>
intent was onely to answere probably Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. But because the answering to arguments can not of it selfe produce a positiue assent of the contrary opinion, although it doth in some sort prepare the vnderstanding to yeeld assent, <hi>Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drington</hi> thought it conuenient not onely to confute Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reasons, but also to produce against the common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion certaine probable arguments drawne both from extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secall, and also intrinsecall grounds, which although they doe not altogether conuince the vnderstanding, yet they doe proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>y incline it to yeeld assent.</p>
   <p n="18">18 And for this cause hee alleaged <hi>Gregorius Tholosanus,</hi> &amp; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius de Rosellis</hi> against Cardinal <hi>Bellarmines</hi> opinion, for that he intended to produce not onely such authors, who doe expresly follow the contrary opinion, but also who doe fauour it. Now it is manifest that the aforesaid Doctors are most plainely against Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this, that they are of opinion, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath not authority to depose Soueraigne Princes for meere secular crimes, which neuerthelesse are very preiudiciall to the spirituall good of soules. Besides that <hi>Antonius de Rosellis</hi> doth doubtfully and vnder a disiunction affirme,<note n="m" place="margin">In sua monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia. part. 1. ca. 63.</note> that the <hi>Pope can either depriue the Emperour of his Empire, or declare him to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,</hi> so that he seemeth to incline to the opinion of <hi>Ioannes Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siensis,</hi> who granteth power to the Common-wealth, but not to the <hi>Pope</hi> to depose Princes.</p>
   <p n="19">19 To conclude that second crime of temerity, which they obiect against <hi>Widdrington,</hi> to wit, that he accuseth those Doctors of treason, who maintaine the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depose Princes, is a meere slander, and imposture. For <hi>Widdrington</hi> in his fifth reason,<note n="n" place="margin">Nu. 63. of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie.</note> which these men doe calumniate, doth onely affirme, <hi>that there cannot be assigned any sufficient reason, for which any man can put the necks of Soueraigne Princes vnder the yoake of any other power without doing those Princes very great wrong, and doth confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and freely auerre what seemeth to him more probable, that such plots and attempts against the Scepters of Princes are in themselues and of their own nature vnlawfull, and exceedingly iniurious to Soueraigne Princes: and</hi> thereupon he affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

      <hi>that he cannot as yet suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently vnderstand, by what way those Subiects can be freed from treason (what opinion soeuer they doe speculatiuely maintaine concerning the Popes power in temporalls) who practically vnder colour perchance of Religion and deuotion to the Sea Apostolike, not weighing with equall balance their bound dutie to Soueraign Princes, should notwithstanding any sentence of Excommunication or depriuation denounced by the Pope attempt to thrust their lawfull Prince out of the possession of his kingdome, so long as this question concerning the Popes power to depose Princes remaineth vndecided.</hi>

   <p n="21">21 Now that we haue cleered our selues of this first imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of temerity, let vs come to the second accusation which is of scandall. There be some now adaies who are so addicted to their owne opinions, that whatsoeuer they haue once determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with themselues to be vnlawfull, they would presently haue all men euen with their great temporall detriment also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it as vnlawfull.

   </p>
   <p n="22">22 <hi>Scandall is an euill word or deede which giueth occasion to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man to fall,</hi> as the Diuines<note n="r" place="margin">S. Hieronym. in c 15. Matth S. <hi>Thom.</hi> 2. 2. q. 43. ar. 1 et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alij Theologi. ibid</note> do define it: yet in declaring the sense of this definition they labour much, and in assigning all the conditions which are required to make an action to bee scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous they doe not as yet agree among themselues, But all do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in this, that no action at all which is commanded especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Law of nature can giue a true occasion of ruine or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending; and if one thereby doe take occasion to sinne, it is a scandall not giuen, but taken, as all Diuines do confesse. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to giue to euery man his right, <hi>to Caesar those things which are Caesars, and to God those things which are Gods,</hi> can giue occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to no man of offending, but rather to take away from Princes their right, which the Law of nature doth giue them is very scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and greatly repugnant to the Law of God and nature.</p>
   <p n="22">
      <pb n="404" facs="237"/>22 And vpon this ground all the imputation of scandall, which these seuere Censures doe lay to <hi>Widdringtons</hi> charge, may easily be retorted vpon themselues: For it is agreed vpon by all Diuines, that the ciuill Common-wealth hath sufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to punish vices, to prouide for the peace of the citizens, to preserue her selfe, and by meanes of the temporall sword, which is agreeable to a temporall power, to defend her selfe from all present wrongs, and to reuenge those wrongs which are already done her. From which principle, euen most euident by the light it selfe of nature, it doth most cleerely follow that the ciuil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth may, vnder paine of temporall punishments, forbid all sorts of seditious bookes,<note n="s" place="margin">Of this we haue a late example in the King of Spain that now is who vnder great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall punishmēts did prohibite the eleuenth tome of Cardinall <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Story vntill it were corrected.</note> as they are seditious, &amp; do wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully infringe the lawfull rights of Princes, (as also the <hi>Pope,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der spirituall punishments, may prohibit the same books as they are preiudiciall to the spirituall health of soules) and also that shee is not bound to admit into her dominions turbulent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and who are truely enemies to her temporall State, and who doe vnlawfully disturbe the temporall quietnesse of the Common wealth by other vnlawfull practises, then by the pure preaching of the Gospel, which being performed in due manner is iniurious to no man: neither can these in my iudgement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very great scandall be called in question.</p>
   <p n="23">23 Neither doth <hi>Widdrington</hi> giue more scope to princes to persecute the Church, or to liue more licentiously, then doe those other Doctors whom he citeth in his Apologie, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hales</hi> a man of singular vertue and learning (whose doctrine was approued as not disagreeing in any thing from the Catholike truth by <hi>Pope Alexander</hi> the fourth, &amp; three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and ten Deuines<note n="t" place="margin">Posseuine in the word <hi>Alexander Holensis.</hi> See beneath in the answere nu. 190. in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</note>) who in expresse words affirmeth, <hi>that Kings if they doe offend, can with temporall punishments bee punished by God alone:</hi> From which doctrine if perchance any Princes should take occasion to offend, that is not to bee imputed to any fault of the Doctors, but to the humane frailty of those Princes. <hi>Lastly,</hi> to defend innocent persons, to vphold the truth, which is as it were by maine force beaten downe, and to free from that most wicked crime of <hi>heresie,</hi> vertuous and learned Catholikes, and those who being now dead cannot defend their innocencie, although their accusers doe thereby suffer perchance some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment in their good name, can giue no iust occasion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
   <p n="24">24 As concerning the title, which <hi>Widdrington</hi> gaue to his <hi>Apologie</hi> for this end, that it might be sought after more greedily, and read more attentiuely, seeing that it is agreeable to the end, scope, and subiect of the booke, it cannot bee no more displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, then is the booke it selfe. But if I haue offended the most
<pb n="405" facs="237"/>
      <hi>Illustrious</hi> Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in any thing, I am heartily sorrie for it: for truely I did not write any thing, God is my witnesse, with purpose to wrong any man, but with desire to finde out the truth, and to free innocent men of all imputation of deadly sin. And although both Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and many other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines haue by their writings meruailously enlightned the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian common-wealth (for which all Catholikes are bound to giue them exceeding great thanks) yet I doe not imagine that there can bee found any Catholike Doctor, of what learning or dignity soeuer he be, who, considering that he is a man and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to humane ignorance, would haue all other men without further examination to giue vndoubted credit to euery one of his opinions: but rather it would be very scandalous, and an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of no small errour to those persons, who should without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther search build their faith, which is necessary to eternall salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vpon the bare word of any Doctor whatsoeuer as vpon a most firme and sure foundation.</p>
   <p n="25">25 Neither can it bee any scandall either to Catholikes, or not Catholikes, to dispute probably of those things, <hi>which are in controuersie among Schoole men, and as yet the Iudge hath not decided the question;</hi> but rather it is too too scandalous, and greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christian charity, to which scandall is flat opposite, to condemne the probable opinions of Doctors as hereticall. <hi>Our Schoole,</hi> saith <hi>Canus,</hi>
      <note n="u" place="margin">Lib. 8. de locis cap. 4.</note>
      <hi>giueth vs doubtlesse great liberty, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer seemeth to be most probable we may by our right defend, but it is not lawfull for vs to condemne rashly and lightly those, who do hold against vs.</hi> And let this suffice to free my <hi>Apologie</hi> from all suspition of scandall; neither will I at this present retort vpon the books of other men a deserued blame of <hi>scandall,</hi> returning backe the same measure to them wherwith they haue measured me.</p>
   <p n="26">26 <hi>Lastly,</hi> to purge my selfe of those last, but of all the most hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous crimes of <hi>heresie</hi> and errour, it is a knowne and common principle among Diuines, that error is distinguished from here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in this, that heresie is repugnant to <hi>Diuine faith,</hi> the certainty whereof doth depend wholly vpon Diuine reuelation, but error is repugnant to a Theologicall conclusion, the certainty wherof is partly grounded vpon diuine reuelation, and partly vpon the light of naturall reason; yet all Diuines doe with one consent agree in this, that as both a <hi>Theologicall conclusion, and supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall faith</hi> are certainly and euidently true, so both error and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie doe containe an vndoubted and manifest falshood: So that if this doctrine concerning the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depose Princes cannot be conuinced of manifest falshood, it cannot iustly bee taxed with heresie or error.</p>
   <p n="27">27 Now therfore let vs examine what certainty can be gathered
<pb n="406" facs="238"/>
from the Councels, to proue this authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> to depose Princes. All the Councels as well prouinciall as Generall, which are confirmed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> I doe honour with all dutifull reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, neuerthelesse I doe not thinke that equall honour and credit is to be giuen to them both. For all Catholikes doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that Generall Councels beeing assisted by the holy Ghost cannot erre in their definitions: but that prouinciall Councells are as well in decrees of faith as of manners subiect to errour, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry graue Diuines doe constantly auerre. And although some ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry learned men doe affirme, <hi>that this opinion, concerning the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of the councell aboue the Pope, and of the Popes fallible iudgment if be define without a Generall Councell, doth sound ill in the eares of Catholikes, in so much that it is commonly accounted to bee erroneous &amp; very neere to heresie, and is onely tolerated by the Church,</hi> yet in my iudgement their speeches are very equiuocall, neither doe they plainly enough declare what by those words they do vnderstand. For that this opinion doth both sound ill in the eares of some Catholikes, to wit, the Romanes, and also that it doth sound well in the eares of other Catholikes, to wit, the <hi>Diuines</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that it is not accounted in al places, and by al men erroneous or neer to heresie, it is too too manifest.</p>
   <p n="28">28 For <hi>Nauarre</hi> a writer of our time, <hi>and a famous Diuine and most skilfull in the Canon Law</hi>
      <note n="x" place="margin">Posseuine verbo Martinus ab Az<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilcueta.</note> doth most plainly teach, that this question is probably disputed by the Diuines of Rome and of Paris, neither doth hee more incline to the one side then to the other. <hi>There is,</hi> saith he,<note n="y" place="margin">Iu. cap. <hi>Nouit</hi> de Iudicijs notab. 3. nu. 84.</note>
      <hi>a great contention betwixt the Romanes &amp; them of Paris, to whom the Ecclesiasticall power was more principally giuen by Christ, whether to the whole Church, or else to S.</hi> Peter <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. For the Romanes hold that this power was giuen to S.</hi> Peter <hi>and to his Successours, and that therefore the Pope is aboue a Councell, but these whom Gerson followeth, do affirme that it was giuen to the whole Church, although to be exercised by one, and that therefore at leastwise in some cases a Councell is aboue the Pope. The opinion of the Romanes is approued by</hi> S. Thomas, Thomas a Vio, <hi>who more deepely &amp; more profoundly then any other, doth endeuour to demonstrate the same: But the other opinion is approued by</hi> Panormitane, <hi>who stādeth for them of Paris,</hi>
      <note n="z" place="margin">That is, <hi>the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>whom ours do more commonly follow, as</hi> Decius <hi>affirmeth. Which opinion</hi> Iacobus Almainus <hi>a Diuine of Sorbone doth eagerly maintain, who hath answered</hi> Thomas a Vio <hi>in a booke of a competent bignes, &amp;</hi> Iohn Maior, <hi>who doth the like, affirming that it is not permitted at Rome for any man to hold the opinion of those of Paris, and of</hi> Panormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, <hi>and againe that the Vniuersity of Paris doth not suffer that the contrary opinion be maintained there.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="29">29 And although he, who maketh the additions to <hi>Nauarre,</hi> doth labour to draw <hi>Nauarre</hi> (who is wauering and very doubtful
<pb n="407" facs="238"/>
of this question <hi>whether the Pope be aboue a Councell</hi>) to be of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> yet hee writeth farre more temperately, and although he thinketh the opinion of the <hi>Romanes</hi> to bee the more probable, yet hee leaueth the opinion of them of <hi>Paris</hi> as probable. But farre more plainely and modestly writeth most learned <hi>Victoria, There are two opinions,</hi> saith hee,<note n="a" place="margin">Relect. 4. de <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
               <desc>•</desc>
            </gap>e et Conc.</hi> propositio. 3.</note>
      <hi>concerning the comparison of the Popes power, the one is of S.</hi> Thomas <hi>and many his followers and of other learned Doctors both Diuines and Canonists, that the Pope is aboue a Councell; the other is the common opinion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines of Paris, and also of many Doctors, both Diuines and Canonists, as of</hi> Panormitane, <hi>and others contrary to the former, that a Councell is aboue the Pope. It is no place at this present to dispute whether of them be the truer. I thinke that both of them is a probable opinion: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause either of them hath great followers, wee must not proceede in this question which is in hand only according to one of these opinions, but we must determine what is to be said what opinion soeuer of these two we do follow.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="30">30 I could therfore wish, that these seuere Censours would in plaine and expresse words declare their opinion, and that they would not with cunning ambiguity of words keepe the Reader in suspence, but sincerely &amp; perspicuously explaine their minds, and answere directly, whether those that defend the opinion of the Doctors of Paris as probable, are in that manner <hi>tolerated by the Church</hi> as harlots, vsurers, and such like notorious sinners are sometimes for the auoiding of greater scandals tolerated or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited in the common-wealth, who although oftentimes they are not punished with ordinary punishments ordained by the lawes, yet they are altogether excluded from the participation of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments so long as they persist in their wicked life; or whether those who are resolued to follow the opinion of the Doctors of Paris may enioy the benefite of Sacramentall absolution? For if they will admit this last, they must of necessity confesse, that the opinion of the Doctours of Paris is not onely tolerated by the Church, but also allowed by the Church as probable, and which may be maintained without any danger of heresie, errour or any other deadly sinne.</p>
   <p n="31">31 Now that those Doctors, who defend the opinion of the Diuines of Paris, are admitted to the Sacraments of the Church, the practise of the Church of France (which practise no man without great temerity and scandall can condemne as temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or scandalous) doth giue apparant testimonie. Wherefore it seemeth in my opinion to bee farre more agreeable to Christian charity, that vertuous and learned Catholikes should as much as may bee, bee freed from error and heresie, and more beseeming the sincerity of Christ his Gospel, that Catholike Doctors should
<pb n="408" facs="239"/>
plainly and perspicuously, without so many ambiguities of words, declare to Christian people what euery Christian is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue concerning those things which appertaine to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith, and that they should not so easily thrust vpon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people doubtfull and vncertaine opinions, and which may be defended without preiudice to faith, for a certaine and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted doctrine of the Catholike faith. And from hence it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the authoritie of no Prouinciall Councell, although it bee confirmed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> if it be taken <hi>soly by it selfe</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">I said <hi>soly by it selfe,</hi> for if it be approued by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the whole Church it bindeth in that manner as a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell doth, as it is insinuated in the next number.</note>, can bee such a sufficient argument to Catholikes, to giue vndoubted cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to her definitions, but that without note of <hi>heresie</hi> or <hi>error</hi> they may be contradicted.</p>
   <p n="32">32 Neither is that obiection of the aduerse part of any great moment: <hi>if the Pope,</hi> say they, <hi>defining without a Generall Councell doth not make that doctrine, which he defineth to be certaine of faith, but that he may erre, there could no certaintie haue beene had concerning many opinions which were taught in the three first hundred yeares, wherein many heresies were put downe by the Pope, as it is euident in the errors of the</hi> Priscillianists, <hi>of</hi> Vigilantius, <hi>of</hi> Iouinian, <hi>of the</hi> Maniches, <hi>and of many others.</hi> For according to the doctrine of the Diuines of <hi>Paris,</hi> the aforesaid opinions of the <hi>Priscillianists,</hi> and of the rest before mentioned, are not to be accounted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall for that cause precisely, because they were condemned on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the <hi>Pope</hi> or by <hi>Prouinciall Councels,</hi> but because the whole Church receiued and approued their condemnation, which at this present for breuities sake may suffice to haue insinuated to the learned, being likely hereafter, if neede shall require, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it more at large.</p>
   <p n="33">33 Now let vs briefly examine what certaintie can be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from <hi>Councels</hi> for the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie to depose Princes. Six <hi>Prouinciall Councels</hi> and three <hi>Generall</hi> are produced by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to confirme this his opinion. And although <hi>Prouinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Councels,</hi> according to the probable opinion of many, as wee now haue seene, doe not make the doctrine which they define to be certaine of faith, and therefore no conuincing argument can be drawne from them to condemne any doctrine of heresie or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: yet that the truth may the better appeare, let vs grant for disputation sake that they cannot erre in their definitions, and let vs see how soundly Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth by them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his doctrine to be certaine of faith.</p>
   <p n="34">34 The first <hi>Councell</hi> which is alleaged by Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> is a Romane Councell holden vnder <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth, in the yeare 1080, <hi>wherein</hi> Gregorie <hi>with the consent and applause of all,</hi> as <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine saith</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">Contra Barclai. pag. 29.</note>, <hi>did publikely and with a solemne rite and ceremonie excommunicate and depriue Henry the fourth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<pb n="409" facs="239"/>
of his Empire and Kingdome.</hi> I haue read indeed that <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> did depose <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth in that Romane Synode, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="d" place="margin">Bertoldus in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 1080. et tom. 3.

      <hi>in the end of the absolution of the Synode did annexe the deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Henry,</hi> but that he was deposed by that Synode, or that all the Fathers gaue their consent and applause I haue not read as yet. In the other fiue Councels, to wit, at <hi>Beneuentum</hi> vnder Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> at <hi>Placentia</hi> vnder <hi>Vrbanus,</hi> an other at <hi>Rome</hi> vnder <hi>Paschalis,</hi> at <hi>Collen</hi> vnder <hi>Gelasius,</hi> and at <hi>Rhemes</hi> vnder <hi>Calixtus</hi> I finde not so much as one word of the deposition of <hi>Henry,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse wee will confound deposition with Excommunication. And although the Emperour had beene deposed not only <hi>in,</hi> but also <hi>by</hi> those six aforesaid Councels, yet from hence no certaine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith can be concluded, seeing that the aforesaid deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Henry,</hi> was not a matter of faith but only of fact, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as well those <hi>Popes,</hi> as those Fathers of the Councels follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own opiniōs might erre, as a little beneath<note n="e" place="margin">Nu. 50.</note> in the like answere to the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> I will declare more at large.</p>
   <p n="35">35 Three <hi>Generall Councels</hi> are alleaged by Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> of <hi>Claramont,</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and of <hi>Lyons.</hi> To the Councell of <hi>Lyons</hi> I haue answered sufficiently in my <hi>Apologie</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">See also aboue in the Appendix to <hi>Suarez</hi> &amp;c. part. 1. sec. 4. nu. 6.</note>, to wit, that it cannot be effectually proued, that the deposition of <hi>Frederike</hi> was done by the Councell, but only by the <hi>Pope</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, neither the Councell approuing it, but only being present at the same.</p>
   <p n="36">36 From the Councell of <hi>Claramont</hi> Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth in this manner: <hi>Pope</hi> Vrbanus <hi>the second in a most frequent Councel at</hi> Claramont <hi>did excommunicate and depriue</hi> Philip <hi>the first King of France of the crowne of his Kingdome, for hauing put away his lawfull wife and married an adultresse, and being admonished thereof did refuse to obey, as</hi> Sigebert <hi>doth testifie in his Chronicle in the yeare</hi> 1095, <hi>and more plainly</hi> Matthew Paris <hi>relateth the same in the life of</hi> William <hi>the second in the yeare</hi> 1095.</p>
   <p n="37">37 But neither out of this Councell can be concluded any thing for certaine for the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depose Princes.

   <p n="38">38 <hi>But that together with Excommunication was ioyned the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

See the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of</hi> Ioannes Nauclerus <hi>generat.</hi> 37. <hi>in Rege</hi> 38.

      </note>, <hi>but</hi> in the reigne of Christ, <hi>because the people held</hi> Philip <hi>being excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for no King.</hi> Thus Cardinall Bellarmine.</p>
   <p n="39">39 Neuerthelesse I cannot sufficiently vnderstand, how Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth effectually proue from hence, that <hi>Philip</hi> was either by the Councell or in the Councell depriued of his Kingdome. For <hi>first</hi> of all supposing, but not granting, that <hi>Philip</hi> was depriued of his Crowne by <hi>Ʋrbanus,</hi> yet it doth not therefore necessarily follow, that this sentence of depriuation was denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Councel of <hi>Claramont,</hi> seeing that in the decrees of that Councell there is made no mention of this sentence, and the Pope might by some particular decree either before or after the Councell denounce this sentence of deposition.</p>
   <p n="40">40 <hi>Besides,</hi> to omit that almost all the Bishops of France did oppose themselues against <hi>Iuo,</hi> those words of Iuo, <hi>[vnlesse you restore his Crowne]</hi> may be vnderstood in a commodious sense, to wit, <hi>that vnlesse you restore his Crowne,</hi> which some perchance of the people, especially of the ruder sort did imagine was either wholy taken away, or in great part diminished only by the sentence of Excommunication: for <hi>the people,</hi> saith Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine, held the King excommunicated for no King:</hi> and moreouer the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the King might giue no small occasion to the people who are prone to rebellions to stirre vp in some sort the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome against the King. And that the words of <hi>Iuo</hi> may haue this sense, <hi>Iuretus</hi> in his obseruations vpon <hi>Iuo</hi> his epistles doth suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently insinuate. <hi>It is also probable</hi> saith he<note n="g" place="margin">Expounding the aforesaid words of <hi>Iuo.</hi>
      </note>, <hi>that the Prince being excommunicated some of the Subiects did refuse to doe him honour and homage, others did honour him and obey him, and so the diuersitie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions may be composed.</hi> And therefore no meruaile that in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi>
      <note n="h" place="margin">For so be the words of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of S. <hi>Dennis</hi> apud <hi>Iuretum</hi> lo co iam citato.</note> writings it was not written, <hi>in the reigne of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi>

least that <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> persons should seeme that way to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate with the King being excommunicated, <hi>but in the reigne of Christ [both for the reason alledged and also]</hi> for that the people held not the King being excommunicated for King, to wit, altogether absolute, and with whom they might as before lawfully conuerse in all affaires.</p>
   <p n="41">41 But that <hi>Iuo</hi> himselfe, and the greater part of the people were of that opinion, that <hi>Philip</hi> by that excommunication was not depriued of his Regall authoritie, it is manifest, both for that the people did willingly obey the King<note n="i" place="margin">France vnder a King not welliked of did keepe his Maiestie so entire that she did not degenerate from the sanctitie of hir ancestors. <hi>So wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Paulus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius lib.</hi> 3. <hi>in Rege</hi> 38. <hi>speaking of King Philip af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by Vrba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
      </note> and also for that Bishop <hi>Iuo</hi> himselfe in his letters<note n="k" place="margin">Epist. 22.28.</note> which he wrote to the King being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, hee calleth him <hi>most pious and magnificent King of France</hi> and hee calleth himselfe, <hi>an humble Clearke of his Hignesse;</hi> and to an other letter writtten in the yeare 1095, as <hi>Baronius</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth <note n="l" place="margin">In that yeare.</note>, at that time when <hi>Philip</hi> was excommunicated, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this superscription<note n="m" place="margin">Epist. 56.</note>. <hi>To Philip by the grace of God the most Noble King of France Iuo his hūble Priest greeting, &amp; as to his Lord &amp; King faithfull seruice:</hi> from which kinde of titles <hi>Juo</hi> would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse haue altogether refrained, if he had thought that <hi>Philip</hi> had by <hi>Vrbanus</hi> beene depriued of his Regall honour and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
   <p n="42">42 And whereas it is obiected by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that the Bishops of France were forbidden by Pope <hi>Ʋrbanus,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his Legate onely that they should not set the Royall Crowne vpon the heads of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>new</hi> Queene, this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection doth not proue that the <hi>King</hi> was depriued of his Royall right <hi>or authoritie,</hi> but this <hi>crowning</hi> did appertaine to the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Kings marriage, and to a certaine Religious ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, which was vsed vpon that day when the <hi>Kings</hi> marriage was solemnized<note n="n" place="margin">For the King was long before crowned with great solemnitie and was in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able possession of his Kingdome; and so that ceremonie was rather in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Queen</hi> then of the <hi>King.</hi> See <hi>Paulus Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and others who write the French Histories.</note>, and which vsually was done at the time of Masse; which religious ceremonie, because it did seeme to confirme the marriage betwixt <hi>Philip</hi> and his new wife <hi>Bertrada,</hi> might iustly be prohibited by Pope <hi>Vrbanus</hi> or his <hi>Legate.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="43">43 Now it remaineth only to answere to the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane,</hi> which is the principall ground, which my Aduersaries doe now vrge to proue the <hi>Popes</hi> power to depose Princes. For Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
      <note n="o" place="margin">In tract. contra. Barclai. pag. 30.</note> out of this Councell frameth this argument. <hi>Jn the most famous Councell of</hi> Laterane <hi>vnder Pope</hi> Innocentius <hi>the third there is made a Canon which is the third in order containing these words:</hi> Wee doe excommunicate and anathematize all heresie which doth extoll it selfe against this holy Orthodoxal Catholike faith which we before haue declared &amp;c. <hi>and beneath:</hi> But if the temporall Lord hauing beene admonished by the Church shall neglect to purge his territorie of hereticall filth, let him bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by the Metropolitane and other Bishops of that
<pb n="412" facs="241"/>
prouince. And if he shall contemne to giue satisfaction within a yeare, let this be signified vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> that from thence forth he may declare all his Vassals to be absolued from their fidelitie to him, and expose his territorie to be possessed by Catholikes, who hauing thrust out the heretikes may possesse it without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and conserue it in puritie of faith, sauing the right of the <hi>principall Lord,</hi> so that he make no obstacle or oppose any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment vnto this; the same law notwithstanding being obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued concerning those who haue no <hi>principall Lords. What would</hi> Barclay <hi>say to this?</hi> If <hi>this bee not the voice of the Catholike Church, where I pray you shall wee finde it? and if it be, as most truly it is, who shall contemne to heare it, as</hi> Barclay <hi>hath done, shall be not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a Heathen and a Publicane, and in no sort a Christian and a pious man?</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="44">44. But this obiection is easily answered: <hi>First</hi> therefore I do think that by those words <hi>a Principal Lord, or who hath no Principall Lord,</hi> are not vnderstood Emperours, Kings, and Soueraigne Princes. And that I gather from this that the Emperour <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike,</hi> whose Ambassadors were present at that Councell of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> did, fiue yeares after the Councell was ended, make the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same constitution in the same expresse words, only changing spirituall punishments into temporall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> but it is not likely that the <hi>Emperour</hi> did intend to comprehend in that decree himselfe, <hi>who is not subiect to the Law</hi>
      <note n="p" place="margin">F. de Legibus leg. <hi>Princeps.</hi>
      </note>, and much lesse other Kings who are not subiect vnto him. <hi>Moreouer</hi> in penall lawes Secular Princes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of the Lawiers, are not comprehended vnder those generall names of temporall Lords, Magistrates, and Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as neither an Abbot vnder the name of a Monke, nor a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop vnder the name of a Priest, nor a Pope vnder the name of a Bishop: seeing that according to the rules of the Law <hi>in Sexto</hi> in <hi>penalties the more fauourable part is to be chosen, and it is meete that seuerities be made lesse and fauours be enlarged.</hi> And if the Councell had intended to comprehend Soueraigne Princes in that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, it might as easily haue named them by their proper names of <hi>Princes,</hi> as by those generall names of <hi>principall Lords,</hi> or <hi>who haue no Principall Lords,</hi> especially seeing that the same Councell in other Decrees doth vse the proper names of Princes.</p>
   <p n="45">45 But against this answere my Aduersaries do first obiect: <hi>If the Councell of Lateran did not in that decree comprehend Emperours, Kings, and Soueraigne Princes, then what persons are those who there all called chiefe or principall Lords, or who haue no chiefe or principall Lords?</hi> And I demand of them againe, what persons are those, who in the Emperour Frederikes decree may iustly be called <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Lords,</hi> or who haue no <hi>Principall Lords?</hi> For the answere, so it be solide, which they shall make to my question, will fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="413" facs="241"/>
their owne obiection. Neuerthelesse my opinion is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Councel nor the Emperor did by <hi>principall Lords,</hi> or <hi>who haue no principall Lords</hi> vnderstand Emperours, Kings, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Princes who haue no Soueraigne aboue them in temporals, but onely those Lords who do hold of Soueraigne Princes some territories, prouinces, or perchance also some kingdome in roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or as it were royall fee harme;<note n="q" place="margin">As with power to hang and draw and with other such like princely Royalties.</note> by reason of which tenure they are made vassals to such Soueraigne Princes, although them selues by vertue of the same tenure haue also Vassals vnder them, whose Lords they are, and by how the more or lesse these Lords are exempted from the iurisdiction of Soueraigne Princes, by so much the more or lesse they may be called <hi>principall Lords.</hi> But let this suffice to haue breefly touched this for the present.</p>
   <p n="46">46 <hi>Secondly</hi> they obiect; <hi>Be it so, that Kings and Soueraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not chiefly and principally included in that decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, yet that secondarily and by consequence they are, or at leastwise might haue beene therein comprehended it is very euident, for if the Pope hath power to depriue for the crime of heresie the subiects of other Princes of their temporall dominions without the consent of their Princes, there can no sufficient reason be assigned why he may not also for the same cause depriue Soueraigne Princes themselues of their dominions.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="47">47 To this obiection I did briefly in my <hi>Apologie</hi> giue many answers, which I thinke it not amisse to repeat heere again word by word. The first was,<note n="r" place="margin">Nu. 454.</note> that as well the Popes as Councells do oftentimes ordaine many things (the ordaining whereof doth belong rather to the ciuill then to the Ecclesiasticall power) by expresse or tacite consent of Soueraigne Princes, who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent either in person or by their Ambassadours; or vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption or hope at leastwise that Princes will ratifie the same. <hi>And this the expositours of the Canon law doe affirme,</hi> saith Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes Parisiensis,<note n="*" place="margin">De potest. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia et Papali cap. 10.</note>
      <hi>For in cap. ad abolendam extra de Haereticis, wherein the Popes Holinesse doth command the goods of heretikes to be confiscated, Cardinall</hi> Hostiensis <hi>maketh this question;</hi> what is this to the Pope concerning temporalls? <hi>And hee answereth with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Pope</hi> Innocentius: <hi>that in very truth it is nothing to him; but hee did this by the consent of the Emperour, who beeing then present at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua gaue his consent:</hi> Thus Ioannes Parisiensis.</p>
   <p n="48">48. The second answere I made in these words:<note n="s" place="margin">In the same place.</note> An other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position the Glosse doth giue vpon the canon, <hi>Adrianus</hi> dist. 63. where the Pope commandeth <hi>the goods of those persons who do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe his decree to be confiscated,</hi> and vpon the Canon <hi>Delatori</hi> 5. <hi>q.</hi> 6. where he decreeth <hi>the tongues of false promotours to be pulled out, and the heads of conuicted persons to bee stroken off:</hi> For the Glosse doth answer, <hi>that the Church in these places doth teach what a Secular Iudge ought to doe.</hi> Which answere of his may be applied to other
<pb n="414" facs="242"/>
such like decrees, wherein the holy Canons doe impose tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall punishments: And this answere those words of <hi>Syluester</hi>
      <note n="t" place="margin">In summa verbo paena nu. 9.</note> doe fauour, who writeth thus: <hi>Ioannes Andreas following Hostiensis is of opinion that a Bishop cannot impose a pecuniarie mulct vpon a lay man who is not subiect to him temporally, but he must cause it to be imposed by the Secular Iudge.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="49">49 To these answers may bee added, that whensoeuer the <hi>Pope</hi> doth by a generall Decree ordaine any temporall thing which doth preiudice an other mans right, who is not his Subiect in temporalls, that decree, as some doe probably affirme, doth onely extend, vnlesse the contrary be expressed, to the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Romane Church, or to the patrimonie of Saint <hi>Peter, wherein</hi> as Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> saith,<note n="u" place="margin">Cap. <hi>per venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem</hi> qui filij sint legitimi.</note>
      <hi>he doth exercise both the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the chiefe Bishop, and execute the power of a Soueraigne Prince;</hi> Whose opiniō the Glosse vpon that chapter <hi>pervenerabilem</hi> doth seeme to fauour, who saith, <hi>that the Popes Holinesse cannot legitimate any man who is not subiect to his temporall Iurisdiction in such sort as that he may as a lawfull heyre by right succeed in an inheritance, for this were to put his sith into another mans haruest, and to vsurpe an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans Iurisdiction, and to depriue a man of his right to succeed, which he ought not to doe,</hi> and therefore <hi>in the Secular court hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not legitimate vnlesse the Prince shall permit him.</hi> But if the <hi>Pope</hi> can not make one legitimate who is not legitimate, or giue one right or depriue one of right to succeed: I cannot perceiue by what authority he can make a lawfull heyre and a lawfull Prince to be vnlawfull, and to haue no right, or to depriue one of that inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance which he doth lawfully possesse.</p>
   <p n="50">50 My third answere was, that the aforesaid decree of the Councell of Laterane did not containe a matter of Faith but only of fact; wherein as well the <hi>Pope</hi> as those Fathers following their owne opinions might erre, and that the Councell did not determine that the aforesaid future sentence of depositiō which the <hi>Pope</hi> should denounce against principall Lords, &amp;c. did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed either from authority which without all doubt was in it selfe lawfull, or from the sole Ecclesiasticall power without the consent of Soueraigne Princes. And therefore the opinion of those Fathers doth make no more certainty for the <hi>Popes</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to depose Princes, then if they had declared their opinion out of the Councell: seeing that this only can be gathered from the vndoubted doctrine of the Catholike Church, that the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible assistance of the holy Ghost is onely promised by Christ our Sauiour to the definitions and not to the facts and probable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Popes or Councels.</p>
   <p n="51">51 I omit now that those words <hi>[that from thence forth hee may declare his subiects to be absolued from their Allegiance to him]</hi> doe
<pb n="415" facs="242"/>
containe some difficulty, for if wee will strictly relye vpon these words, they seeme onely to signifie, that it belongeth onely to the <hi>Pope</hi> to declare the subiects to be already absolued, and not truely and in very deede to absolue them from their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
   <p n="52">52 But against this third answere my aduersaries doe vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently obiect: <hi>That doctrine, say they, doth appertaine to faith, which the Popes, Councells and Doctors doe either propose or suppose as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vndoubted ground and foundation of their decrees and senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but this doctrine for the Popes power to depose Princes and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue subiects of their Allegiance, is either proposed or supposed by the Popes, Councells and Doctors as a foundation of many Canons and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall sentences, therefore this doctrine doth appertaine to faith.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="53">53 <hi>Moreouer, if a Generall Councell should expresly define that the Church hath this authority, no Catholike could make any doubt but that this matter did appertaine to faith, but seeing that the Councell doth suppose it as a sure and certaine foundation of her decrees and sentences, she is thought no lesse to affirme the same, therefore it ought to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted no lesse certaine.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="54">54 <hi>Lastly, it is a point of Faith, that the Church cannot erre in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and precepts of manners, by teaching generally any thing to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full which is vnlawfull, or to be vnlawfull which is lawfull, or also by commanding any thing which of it selfe is vnlawfull. For such an error is no lesse pernicious to the faithfull then is an errour in faith; but if the Pope should not haue that authority to depriue temporal Princes of their dominions the Church should erre in doctrine of manners, and that in matters of very great moment. For shee teacheth that after a Prince is deposed by the Popes authority all his subiects are absolued from their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and that his dominions may be possessed by an other, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the Councells. Also that after a Prince is publikely excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated all his subiects are absolued from their Oath of Allegiance: in so much that they are not bound to obey him vntill he be reconciled, yea and she doth forbid them to obey him if the censure bee denounced. All which things should be false, and not onely false, but also pernicious; for that thereby the Subiects should be incited to rebellions and periuries, yea and against their wills be compelled thereunto: therefore the Church doth erre in doctrine of manners, and doth command rebellions &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, and by her censures doth compell men thereunto; but to affirme this is hereticall, therefore that also from whence this followeth is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, to wit, that the Church hath not power to absolue subiects from the bond of their Oath, and from their obedience.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="55">55. These bee the principall obiections against this third an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, wherein our most learned aduersaries do greatly triumph, think<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ng that by them it is most euidently conuinced, that it is so certaine, that the Pope by Christ his institution hath authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="416" facs="243"/>
to depose Princes: that the contrary cannot bee defended without note of heresie, or at leastwise of manifest errour. But let these Doctors, who are otherwise doubtlesse most learned, take heed least that they presume to impose vpon the vnlearned peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their priuate and vncertaine collections for vniuersall and vndoubted conclusions of the Catholike faith; for truely that these arguments are not so forcible, as they imagine it may by the practise of the Church and the decrees of <hi>Popes</hi> very easily bee proued.</p>
   <p n="56">56 And first of all, is not the due administring of Sacraments a matter of great moment, and cheefly belonging to the <hi>Popes</hi> office, and is not an error concerning it to bee accounted most pernicious? But the Pope hath oftentimes giuen leaue to a priest who was no Bishop to minister the Sacrament of confirmation<note n="x" place="margin">As it appeareth bp S. <hi>Gregorie</hi> lib. 3. epist. 26. and it is related in cap. <hi>peruenit</hi> dist. 95. &amp; many Abbots at this day haue also this facultie.</note>, whereas it is a great controuersie among Diuines, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> can giue leaue to such a Priest to minister this Sacrament. Seeing therefore <hi>that to the Sacraments of the new Law,</hi> as the Councell of <hi>Florence</hi>
      <note n="y" place="margin">About the end in the decree of Pope <hi>Eugenius.</hi>
      </note> doth teach, <hi>are required three things, the matter, the forme, and the Minister, of which if any one be wanting, it is not a true and perfect Sacrament,</hi> and that it is a very great sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the due and lawfull matter and forme of a Sacrament should be seriously applied by an vnlawfull minister; if the <hi>Pope,</hi> in whom onely according to these Diuines the whole Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power &amp; authority to define infallibly matters of faith doth principally remaine, cannot grant authoritie to a Priest who is no Bishop to minister this Sacrament, as very learned Diuines <note n="z" place="margin">Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> in 4. in q. de conf. ar. 3. <hi>Durandus</hi> in 4. dist. 7. q. 3. et 4. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauentura</hi> ibidem. <hi>Alphonsus de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro</hi> in lib. de hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resibus <hi>verbo</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatio. <hi>Petrus Soto</hi> lect. 2. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. &amp; others.</note> without any note of errour or heresie doe hold, is it not a very great error to grant such licences whereby there is danger that most heinous sacriledges, to wit, the inualide administrations of Sacraments should be committed?</p>
   <p n="57">57 Moreouer, <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> the fourth did in honour of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate conception of the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> make a decreee <note n="a" place="margin">It is to be seene in the fourth tome of the Councels after the life of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth.</note> for celebrating the feast of her conception, <hi>to the end that all faithfull Christians should giue thanks and praise to almighty God for the wonderfull conception,</hi> which also he calleth <hi>immaculate,</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">In the second decree.</note>
      <hi>of the immaculate Ʋirgin,</hi> and notwithstanding it is vncertaine and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by Diuines on both sides, without any note of heresie, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror or deadly sinne, whether the Blessed Virgin was conceaued in riginall sinne, or by the speciall prouidence of God preserued from the same. Is it not therefore from hence manifest, that that doctrine which is either proposed or supposed by the <hi>Pope</hi> as a foundation of an Apostolicall constitution and decree, and which belongeth to the Religious seruice of God, is not of so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vndoubted a truth, but that without danger of deadly sinne it may be impugned?</p>
   <p n="58">
      <pb n="417" facs="243"/>58 <hi>Lastly,</hi> some Popes haue oftentimes dispensed with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to contract matrimony who haue made a solemne vow of Chastity in approoued Religions, as it is recorded by Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers of <hi>Constantia</hi> daughter to <hi>Roger</hi> King of Sicilie, of <hi>Casi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirus</hi> King of Poland, and of <hi>Ramirus</hi> King of Aragone, and of <hi>Nicholas Iustinian</hi> a noble Venetian<note n="c" place="margin">See <hi>Azorius</hi> tom 1. lib. 12. cap. 7. q. 1</note>: but if the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to dispence in the solemne vow of chastity, whereof there is a great controuersie among Catholike Doctors<note n="d" place="margin">For S. <hi>Thomas</hi> and almost all the Thomists and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others whom <hi>Zanchez</hi> the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite relateth lib. 8. de matrimonio dis. 8. doe denye that the Pope hath such a power and <hi>Zanchez</hi> also saith that this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniō is probable.</note>, doubtlesse such dispensations would cause very many heinous sinnes, and doe great wrong also to other princes, who by such dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should bee vniustly depriued of their rightfull inhericance, and iust title to their kingdomes.</p>
   <p n="59">59 May we not therfore according to our aduersaries grounds argue in this manner? <hi>That doctrine doth appertaine to faith, which the Pope,</hi> (in whom only according to these Doctors<note n="e" place="margin">For they grant that the <hi>Pope</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone without a Councell hath authority infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to define, and the Councell without the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no authority at all infallibly to define, so that all such authority is onely in the <hi>Pope</hi> and dependeth only on the <hi>Pope.</hi>
      </note> all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to define matters of faith doth reside) <hi>doth either propose or suppose as a sure ground of his decrees and sentences, but this doctrine that the blessed Ʋirgin was not conceaued in originall sinne, that the Pope can dispence in the solemne vow of chastity, and giue leaue to a Priest who is no Bishop to minister the Sacrament of confirmation, is proposed or supposed by Popes as a ground and foundation of many their decrees, dispensations and iudiciall sentences, therfore this doctrine doth appertaine to faith.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="60">60 <hi>Moreouer, if the Pope should expresly define, that the Church hath such a power</hi>
      <note n="f" place="margin">To wit, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn vow of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity, and to giue leaue to a Priest who is no Bishop to minister the Sacrament of confirmation.</note>, <hi>no Catholike (those especially who doe hold that the Pope defining without a Generall Councell cannot erre) could make any doubt but that this matter doth appertaine to faith, but seeing that the Popes doe suppose it as a sure ground and foundation of their decrees and sentences they are thought no lesse to affirme the same, therefore it ought to be accounted no lesse certaine.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="61">61 Lastly, <hi>it is a point of faith, as our aduersaries doe suppose, that the Pope cannot erre in doctrine and precepts of manners, by teaching generally any thing to be lawfull which is vnlawfull, or to be vnlawfull which is lawfull, or also by commanding any thing which of it selfe is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. For such an errour is no lesse pernitious to the faithfull then an error in faith, but if the Pope should not haue authority to dispence in the solemne vow of Chastity, or to giue leaue to Priests who are no Bishops to minister the Sacrament of confirmation, the Pope should erre in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and precepts of manners, and that in matters of very great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For he doth teach that the Sacrament of confirmation ministred by a Priest who is no Bishop is a true Sacrament: Also, that if a Prince by the Popes dispensation doe marry a professed Nunne,</hi> that such a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is lawfull and valide, and that <hi>their children are lawfully begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ought to succed in the Kingdome. And notwithstanding that the next of the blood Royall should for want of the lawfull issue of this
<pb n="418" facs="244"/>
Prince pretend right to the Crowne, yet the Pope may without doubt, according to our aduersaries doctrine, command the Subiects, and by cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures compell them to acknowledge the issue begotten by that marriage wherein hee did dispence to bee their true, vndoubted, and lawfull Prince; all which things would be false, and not onely false but also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, for that thereby the Subiects should bee incited to doe iniuries and against their wills should bee compelled thereunto, and Princes should obtaine free liberty to commit incests, and sacriledges. The Church therefore doth erre in doctrine of manners, and doth councell sacriledge, and command iniustice, and doth compell by censures thereunto; but to affirme this it is hereticall, therefore that also from which it followeth is hereticall, to wit, that the Pope hath not power to dispence in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vow of chastity, and to giue leaue to a priest who is no Bishop to minister the Sacrament of confirmation;</hi> And neuerthelesse neither of these are hereticall or erroneous according to the doctrine of those Diuines but a little before cited. Let our aduersaries ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore solue these difficulties, and I will forthwith by their owne solutions vntie those former knots which they imagine cannot in any wise be solued.</p>
   <p n="62">62 To conclude, are not the reasons, for which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells are induced to define any thing of faith, as it were certaine grounds, which are by them proposed or supposed as foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their definitions and decrees, and neuerthelesse no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, as I suppose, will affirme, that those reasons are to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued by Catholikes with the same certainty wherewith the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions themselues are to beleeued. <hi>In the Councells,</hi> saith Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
      <note n="g" place="margin">Lib. 2. de Concl. cap. 12.</note>
      <hi>the greatest part of the Acts doe not appertaine to faith. For neither the Disputations which goe before, nor the reasons which are added, nor those things which are brought to explicate and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate, are of faith, but onely the bare decrees, and those not all, but onely those which are proposed as of Faith.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="63">63 Wherefore betwixt the voice, doctrine, and consent of the Church firmely beleeuing, or defining any thing to bee of faith, and of the same Church probably, onely thinking there is doubtlesse to be made a great distinction. For no Catholike ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any doubt but that whosoeuer contemneth to heare the voice of the Church firmely beleeuing, doth fall into heresie or errour, but Catholike Doctors, whose authority our most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aduersaries will not easilie reiect, doe in expresse words af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that he who being mooued with sufficient reason doth not embrace the doctrine of the Church onely probably thinking, doth not expose himselfe to any danger of heresie, errour, or temeritie. For <hi>Alphonsus Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>Franciscus Suarez</hi> who are doubtlesse most learned <hi>Iesuites</hi> doe alleage the practise and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent almost of the whole Catholike Church to prooue the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
<pb n="419" facs="244"/>
conception of the <hi>Blessed Virgin Mary,</hi> and neuerthelesse they doe expresly grant, and without a greeuous sinne they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but that the contrary opinion may be defended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger of mortall sinne. <hi>We,</hi> saith <hi>Salmeron</hi>
      <note n="h" place="margin">Ad Rom. 5. dis. 51. 6. Deinde.</note>, <hi>doe bring</hi> (for the aforesaid immaculate Conception) <hi>the consent almost of the Vniuersall Church, and the vniforme opinion of all Ʋniuersities.</hi> And <hi>Suarez</hi>
      <note n="i" place="margin">Tom. 2. dis. 3. sec. 5.</note>, <hi>The second ground</hi> saith he; <hi>is to be taken from the authoritie of the Church, and first the</hi> vniuersall consent almost of the whole <hi>Church. And especially for these two hundred yeares almost all Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall writers, Bishops, all almost Religions, and vniuersities haue sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</hi>
   </p>
   <p n="64">64 But concerning these matters let this suffice. For by that which we haue already said, what little force the aforesaid obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Aduersaries haue the learned Reader will very easily perceiue. And these are the principall things, which my Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries doe obiect against my <hi>Apologie</hi> out of those Councels cited by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whose booke against Doctor <hi>Barclay</hi> I haue diligently read and read againe, which neuerthelesse, to speake truly, doth so little satisfie my vnderstanding, that it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmeth me in my old opinion, then any whit auerteth me from the same, to which also I was long since determined to haue made an answere<note n="k" place="margin">Master <hi>Iohn Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi> who hath now very learnedly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that book.</note> if that, as I am credibly informed, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man whom it did more concerne had not taken vpon him to answere the same and therefore I am resolued to deferre my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, vntil his Reply to my Apologie, which our Countrimen do daily expect be printed and published<note n="l" place="margin">For I haue seene the copie of a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

   <p n="65">65 <hi>Last of all</hi> our Aduersaries doe obiect a certaine booke which is entituled, <hi>An Apologeticall Disputation for the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> composed, as they say, by <hi>Leonard Lessius</hi> doubtlesse a very learned man, wherein as they report, he hath cleerely, perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and euidently demonstrated out of holy Scriptures, anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, Councels and 13. inuincible reasons, that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power to depose Princes, and that this true Doctrine is not only a Theologicall conclusion, which is contrarie to error, but also expresly defined to be of faith, in so much that the contrarie opinion cannot be defended without manifest heresie.</p>
   <p n="66">66 Truly I haue often heard this booke to be meruailously commended by some men, and I cannot deny if it be true as they doe say but that it is written by a very learned man. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse if this booke doth so cleerely demonstrate, as these men do brag, why doth it not come to light, but, <hi>as a businesse walking in darknesse</hi>
      <note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 90.</note>, is suffered to be seene by few, and those only who are thought will applaude it?

   <p n="67">67 Are you perchance afraid to publish among Catholikes, and those especially whom you certainly beleeue to erre in their beleefe, such a booke, which doth most cleerely <hi>demonstrate</hi> a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is to be beleeued of faith, and which therefore is necessarie to eternall saluation?
