                 <title>A quiet and sober reckoning vvith M. Thomas Morton : somewhat set in choler by his aduersary P.R. concerning certaine imputations of wilfull falsities obiected to the said T.M. in a treatise of P.R. intituled Of mitigation, some part wherof he hath lately attempted to answere in a large preamble to a more ample reioynder promised by him. But heere in the meane space the said imputations are iustified, and confirmed, &amp; with much increase of new vntruthes on his part returned vpon him againe: so as finally the reckoning being made, the verdict of the Angell, interpreted by Daniel, is verified of him. There is also adioyned a peece of a reckoning with Syr Edward Cooke, now L. Chief Iustice of the Co [m] mon Pleas, about a nihil dicit, &amp; some other points vttered by him in two late preambles, to his sixt and seauenth partes of Reports</title>

   <p>I would wish also the said Reader to cōsider the last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>art of this your Epistle, where you say that you do
<pb facs="11"/>
conuince me out of <hi>my owne Confession, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that there is an Equiuocation, which no clause of mentall reseruation can saue from a lye</hi>:<note place="margin">Preamb. p. <hi>43.</hi> &amp; <hi>48.</hi>
      </note> and you set yt downe in a different letter, as though they were my wordes. But if the said Reader go to the place, where I do handle this matter, both in the second and seuenth Chapters of this my Answere, he will fynd, that I say no such thing, either in word or sense, but rather the quite contrarie: to wyt, that there is an externall speach (as that of <hi>Saphyra</hi> in the Actes of the Apostles, for therof was the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion) which no mentall reseruation can iustify from a lye, and consequently nor make properlie an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, for that it is false in the mynd of the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and so cannot stand with the nature of Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (that allvvayes must be true) as hath byn largely demonstrated in our Treatise of that matter.</p>
   <p>Which point being once well noted &amp; pōdered by your Reader, he will wonder at your strange vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting illation made hereupon, that is to say, vpō your owne fiction, when you wryte:<note place="margin">

<pb facs="11"/>
studie of breuitie to be preferred: &amp; what remayneth to be aduertised to your self, wilbe common also to your Reader, vntill I returne vnto him againe, as a little after in this Epistle I meane to doe, to the end not to weary you ouer much with so manie admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to your self.

Peter</hi> (<hi>I haue sould it for no more</hi>) was no lesse an Equiuocation, then to say, <hi>I am no Priest.</hi> But I deny it, and do say it was a lye, and no Equiuocation. For that she had obligation to vtter the truth to <hi>S. Peter</hi> that was her lawfull Iudge, and so hath not the Priest, that is demanded by him, who is not his lawfull Iudge.</p>
   <p>You say that,<note place="margin">Preamble. p. <hi>48.</hi>

   <p>And yet by the way I must further put you in mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> that you do deliuer me heere from a contradiction, and inuolue your selfe in a falshood

vnanswerable in reciting of these words of mine. For that before in your Epistle to my selfe you recite my Confession thus:<note place="margin">

      <hi>That there is a mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Equiuocation which no clause of reserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can saue from a lye.</hi> And here you say: <hi>I am forced to confesse an outward speach, which no clause of reseruation can saue from a lye.</hi> Betweene which two recitalls there is great difference, as before we haue shewed, &amp; no lesse then betweene truth and falshood. So as if you write truly heere, you spake falsely before: and if truly before, then falsely now. And thus much haue I byn inforced to admonish you of at this time, by the peruersity of your owne words and manner of writing.</p>

   <p>Let vs see his second defence, for this first standeth only vpon his owne confidence. <hi>Secōd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
      <pb facs="17"/>
(saith he) <hi>from my aduersary, tooke I matter of comfort, presuming that he that would write in defence of mentall Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would be found to equiuocate in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting also.</hi> This you see is but a presumption, and that a very poore one. For as a man may write of warre and yet not fight; and of Agriculture or husbandry, and yet neither plow nor sow:<note place="margin">
         <hi>His strong presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
      </note> So may he write of Equiuocation, and yet not Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate, and Equiuocate also and yet not lye. So as this could be but a silly comfort for <hi>M. Morton</hi> to presuppose and hope that I would Equiuocate in writing of Equiuocation, which was not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And if I had; yet might I do it without lying: and so nothing therby haue relieued his case, that was so deeply charged with that fault. And finally, if I had bene able to be conuinced of any point in that kind (as afterward you will see that I was not:) yet <hi>S. Augustines</hi> rule is, <hi>Quod societas peccantium auget potiùs quàm excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat peccatum:</hi> Fellowship in sinne increaseth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then excuseth the fault. Though truly it may se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>me that <hi>M. Morton</hi> would highly esteeme this fellowship with me, if he could bring it about, and thinke himselfe well defended, if he could attaine it. Which I am lead to belieue, not only by his labour, diligence &amp; solicitude therin, but by the last Conclusion of his for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>named Epistle to my self, which he endeth thus for an vpshoot.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>I may thinke</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Scripture ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified vpon you, where it is thus written:
<pb facs="17"/>
Therfore art thou inexcusable (O man) who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer thou be, that iudgest:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>2.</hi> vers. <hi>1.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>for doing the same thinges, by iudging an other, thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnest thy selfe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Out of which text of the Apostle <hi>M. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> would proue,<note place="margin">
         <hi>M. Mort. seeketh some asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation.</hi>
      </note> that I doing the same things with him (in this point of fraud and false dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) I cannot condemne him, without condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning also my selfe: which consequence I grant, but deny the antecedent. Which I assure my self <hi>M. Morton</hi> will neuer be able to proue in any one point of moment, throughout this whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certation of ours; himselfe being taken faultie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most at euery turne, as you will see.</p>
   <p>And yet doth he vaunt, as though his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were extraordinary in this behalfe, telling vs, <hi>that as the Greeke Cōmaunder being in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>f my penne, hauing generally inquired, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>prightly answered himself, that his cause was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>afe and his conscience sound, began more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely to confront me.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thus you see, that he hath cleared himselfe, &amp; is become victorious vpon a suddayne by force of a similitude only. And in truth the tale is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily told by him in wordes, but let vs come to the substance of the things. If <hi>M. Mortons</hi> cause be so safe, and his conscience so sound, how
<pb facs="18"/>
do there stand togeather afterward in the sixt Chapter of this my Answere, aboue thirty vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths,<note place="margin">

If these can be really defended by him, he doth somewhat. And for diuers of them, he ought to haue done it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But if they cannot (as I assure my selfe without making of more new, they cannot) then is neither <hi>M. Mortons</hi> cause safe, nor his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sound in this behalfe. Nay his <hi>sheild</hi> and <hi>buckler</hi> is vtterly broken, and his Cittie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge quite ouerthrowne.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">

   <p>And by this you see, that <hi>M. Morton</hi> is still doing, whether well or euill, God knoweth. I maruaile he feareth not the scratch due to his ytch, wherof he speaketh in his Preamble. For if out of <hi>Germanie</hi> there come that multitude of scratches, that is threatned by him whose letter I haue mentioned in the latter end of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, &amp; do ioyne themselues with these scrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of myne, both old and new, that do march togeather in this my answere against him, they

For if he had reallie meant it, and had seene himselfe able to performe it, he would haue answered substantially, in this Preamble, some of the chiefest difficulties that were laid against him, to the end to make his Reader belieue, that he would be able to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the rest in the said promised Encoūter.
