      <hi>The vnlearned arise and take heauen by violence, whereas great Doctors are thrust into Hell:</hi> and when I see that many thriue in grace, who haue no learning but Scripture, and no eloquence but what conscience doth dictate, I cannot but humbly pray to God, that you may alwaies be of that minde which you d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e d scouer in that gratious speech. I know right well that they are to be found in the world, who will lay other draughts of holinesse before you than you shall here finde. They will tell you of Masses, of haire-cloth, of whippings, of
<pb facs="65"/> pilgrimages, and other penances; and were it not that God hath taught you already to discouer the hypocrisies of these, and to see that, to stop the mouth of conscience for a time, they may be practised by the wickedest wretches, they might haply pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with you, being gilded ouer by the subtleties of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ. But, blessed be God, your soules are from amongst Lions, and I hope you haue beene longer trained vp in Christs schoole, than to be so gulled with such impostures. My care and prayer to God for you shall rather be that yee may adorne the profession of the Gospell which yee haue vndertaken. There are too many in the world, who with <hi>Caius Curio</hi> are singularly eloquent,<note place="margin">Lin. vitae ex vell. Pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

They lay a kinde of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace vpon God, as well as vpon the Gospell, that would be accounted Christians, and yet are not good. If a King should send, with instructions for the presenting of his person and will to another Prince, such a messenger as could not execute it, did it not lay this disgrace vpon him, that he is not able to chuse a fit person to doe his businesse? So is it disgracefull to God to send such an one into the world in his name, and with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable title of his seruant, yea Sonne, who doth the errand of the world, the flesh, and the deuill, rather than of him whose name he beareth. That therefore the censure of the <hi>Cynick</hi> vpon the common people, who did highly extoll those that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned money, and yet were very money-mongers themselues,
<pb facs="66"/> may not fall vpon you, let it be your glory and your reioycing not onely to praise and countenance the vertuous, but also as you haue begun, to be of the same knot and blessed societie. I know that this must be effected by a spirituall death vnto the world and sinne: but if it were a comfort to be put to death with <hi>Phocion,</hi>

      </note> because <hi>Phocion</hi> was innocent and well-deseruing of the Common-wealth; then how much comfort may it be vnto vs to haue fellowship in the death of Christ to our death vnto sinne, and in his resurrection to our rising vnto new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life. This Sermon shall (through Gods blessing) a little helpe you forward in this gracious worke: in which respect my humble suit vnto you is, that you would be pleased to vse it as your owne.
