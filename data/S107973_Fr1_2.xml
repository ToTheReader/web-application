   <p>THis letter of the byshop of Verona gētle Reader, though it be short in wordes, yet if thou cōsider it wel, it is long &amp; pitthy in matter. For it plainly displayeth the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises not onely of the Popisshe Prelates, wherby they haue procured and propped vp their kyngdome so longe to continue, and what deuises they haue to make it (if it possibly might be) euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng: but also of all other wicked that seke em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and glory in this world, not caring nor passing how vniustly they come by it. But God (against whose glory, this kingdome of Antichrist is no lesse contrary than the kingdome of the deuill him self, and who wil not the euyll to come by, or at the leaste long enioy hys desyre) myndeth, as thou maist per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, thend of this wicked kingdom of Antichrist and wald that al other wicked mēs purposes shuld be letted. For he maketh (as thou seest, the subtile, maugre their teeth) to open their owne subtiltie, &amp; the wicked to vttre his own wickednes, so that kno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wing the one, thou mayst easily iudge al. Wherfore if thou wilt not shew thy selfe ouermuche ingrate, thou arte prouoked to confesse his greate mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his poore shepe, and to praise him for his loue and fauour toward thee. And onlesse the nobilitie and people in euery countrey will shewe them selfe vtterly voyd of reason, they wyl (now God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon) put to their handes &amp; wittes to pul their nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes from vnder the tyranny of the bishop of Rome, God and mans enemy) and such wicked practisers &amp; not willingly put their owne neckes into halters, but rather defend thē selues, According to Goddes law, &amp; the law of nature, thā to suffre thē selues to be wilfully murthered. Thāke God for his giftes, shut not thine eies against his light, serue him, and
<pb facs="2"/> he will not faile the in thy nede, but prosper what so euer thou shalt take in hāde, hauing his feare &amp; glorye before thyne eies.</p>
