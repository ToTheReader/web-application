   <head>To the Feminine
READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are here presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by an extreme
Honourer of your
sexe, with a Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of Femall perfection. It is
not a Glasse wherein a Babe, a
Foole, or a Monster may see it
selfe, as well as you. By this you
cannot curle your haires, fill up
your wrinckles, and so alter your
<pb facs="11"/>
looks, that Nature who made
you, knowes you no more, but
utterly forgets her owne Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
By this you cannot lay
spots on your faces, but take them
out of your soules, you may. By
this you cannot compose your
Countenances, but your Mindes
you shall, and give them a never
fading Beauty. In this you may
discerne all Vertues, and all Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at their full growth. Here
you may discover Charity distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting,
Temperancy abstaining,
Patience suffering, Humanity
yeelding, Chastity resisting, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
combating, and Prudency
<pb facs="11"/>
assisting all these. Here any orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
you already have, you may
better, and any you have not, you
may purchase at the easie rate of
reading and imitating. Here you
may learne to transforme your
ugly Vices into as amiable Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
This Glasse will not flatter
you, nor if you be angry with it
for shewing your Deformities,
can you breake it. Both the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the reflections here are
all internall, and therefore not
tangible. This is shee, whose Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme
ingenious Antiquity made
an Vnicorne, laying his head in
the lappe of a Virgin. This is
<pb facs="12"/>
the faire tree, whose lovely fruit
once tasted, expels not for a time
onely, but for ever the venome
of the most deadly sinnes. This is
she, who was on Earth a Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of the good, and a reformer
of the reprobate. All her Visitants
were but so many Converts,
whose bad affections, and erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
opinions, the sweetnesse of
her discourse had rectified. The
Leprosie of sinne was her daily
cure, and they (whom vice had
blinded) were by her restored to
their inward sight, and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
soules adored divine, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesticall
vertue, residing in this
<pb facs="12"/>
sacred Temple. The conference
with her rais'd them above them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and enfranchis'd their
soules till then, chained to their
bodies. The knowledge of her,
humbled the most proud natures,
for the lustre of her Merits, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
their owne obscure. O make
the emulation of this chaste Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
your onely study! and not in
words onely, but in deeds also
shew your selves Proficients; for
Vertues meditated, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
do but puffe us up the more,
wee easily beleeving, that wee are
what we resolve to be. On this,
ground your beliefe, that shee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb facs="13"/>
you who shall constantly
tread in her paths, shall at length
arrive at the Celestiall Paradice
which now she inhabits, and shall
receive this salutation, not from
an Angell, but from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
<hi>Welcome thou faire
soule, full of Grace, enter into
the Glory, I have prepared for
thee.</hi>
