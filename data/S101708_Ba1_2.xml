   <p>These things are the substance of all this booke <note place="margin">An answer to such as censure this booke.</note> couched within the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall narration: which is no dreaming dotage, no fantasticke toy, no ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conception, no old wiues tale told; some haue an humour to delight in
<pb facs="162"/>
finding of faults; some are so enuious that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke vpon any thing which is anothers, but they must needs disgrace it: Perhaps some kicking lade in reading is galled, and therefore doth winsh. Some are so ridgedly graue that, forsooth, it is a misse to reade that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they may haue occasion offered any way to laugh or smile: when they may remember that euen <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> the gray headed, old aged, and graue father once laughed; as they themselues will also, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they be, when the humour takes them.</p>
   <p>If any dislike this little booke for want of matter,
<pb facs="163"/>
let him be pleased to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <note place="margin">No want of matter for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious vses.</note> these one and fortie particular instructions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore set downe, with the naturall and moral Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie cōprehended ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, how also families may be well gouerned and also religiously; how loue may bee preserued among Neighbours, what euils are the disturbance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and what bee the base conditions of the Nigards and pinching worldlings, contrary to such as be of a bountifull and liberall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
   <p>Besides all these things let them bee pleased to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the scope of the Booke, wherin two things are principally aimed at. <note place="margin">The scope of the booke.</note>
   </p>
   <p n="1">
      <pb facs="163"/>
1 To discouer to vs our miserable and wretched <note place="margin">1 <hi>To know our selues by nature.</hi>
      </note> estate through corruption of nature. For the laying open hereof, there is a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly description of sin, with the power, nature, fruites, and effects thereof; how it first came, how intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, bred, and brought vp, by whom, and where, with the seuerall kinds of sinne, and the differing conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of sinfull men, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vertuous courses, and vnder what colour they so do, to their owne ruine at the length.</p>
   <p n="2">2 To shew how a man <note place="margin">2 <hi>How to bore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi>
      </note> may come to a holy refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and so happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer himselfe out of his naturall wretched estate.
<pb facs="164"/>
To worke this, here is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered how a man is to search out sinne, what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie graces are required thereto, with the helpes how to discouer sinne, and to know sinnes to bee sins; what commonly bee the lets and hinderances in the discouery and search of our sinnes; what to do, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing sound out our sinnes, and how to become hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thereby, and how to sit downe to iudge of our selues without all partialli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Moreouer here is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, what gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are requisite to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life. Lastly, how we may know sinne to be subdued, and in whom it is truly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="164"/>
These things being the true scope and right vse of this Book, and the matters therein contained so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofefull and necessary to euery true Christian, I hope no sober minded man can, much lesse will find fault with it.</p>
   <p>If the manner laying <note place="margin">The manner is allegoricall.</note> those things downe in a continued allegorie, bee the offence to some, I doe suppose they know, that <hi>Nathan</hi> did teach a <hi>Dauid</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12. Ca. 5.</note> by an allegorie: <hi>Esay</hi> and <note place="margin">Ezech. 17. 2. &amp; 19.</note>
      <hi>Ezechiel</hi> taught the Iewes so too, and that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our spake many parables to his hearers.</p>
   <p>If any thinke it had bin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fit <note place="margin">Obiection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> for a yonger wit, then for one growne old and
<pb facs="165"/>
gray headed; surely <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, Esat,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ezechiel</hi> were not yong; neither did those formes of speaking dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate any thing from their holy aged grauities. And it may be thus to allegorize vpon such a subiect matter from all these passages, in politicke gouernment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired some more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then some perhaps, conceit, though the thing done to their hand may seeme now most easie.</p>
   <p>But the fault, if a fault, peraduenture, is nor sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply imputed for making an allegorie: but in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it so largely, and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting (as it were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude wise) some things, for the weightinesse of the
<pb facs="165"/>
matter therein conteined, not seeming graue inough as the parables of Christ, &amp; his Prophets were. For sinne and sinfull courses of men should be so deciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as the Readers might rather be moued to lantēt, then occasioned to laugh.</p>
   <p>First for the largenesse, it is no more then the ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cessitie of the intended dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course required, as the scope before mentioned may sufficiently witnesse. The parables of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ca 15. &amp; 16. Ca. 17. &amp; 19.</note> were large, and they were prosecuted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of those things from whence they were taken, to lay open fully thereby what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb facs="166"/>
and this is but so, and no more.</p>
   <p>I confesse the matter of this allegoricall discourse to be such (as may appeare by the manifold lessons before layed down, being the summarie Contents of the booke) as ought to worke in euery Christian Reader sorrow of heart in the deep consideration of his miseries, till he be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of his wretched estate: and withall to cause a diligent endeuour in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber sadnes to better his cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of liuing Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like before God; neither of which is preuented by the manner of handling, if all would doe, as some haue done, first to reade it after
<pb facs="166"/>
the letter, and then attend piously to the spirituall sence, they would attaine to that, which in so pen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning it, I aymed at. I knew the natures of men in the world; I persuaded my self that the allegorie would draw many to read, which might be as a bate to catch them, perhaps, at vnawares and to mooue them to fall into a meditation at the length of the spirituall vse thereof: which I well ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that others more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously bent, would at the first discerne and make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of.</p>
   <p>If two or three passages carrie not that grauitie in shew, as some, perhaps, could wish they did; Let
<pb facs="167"/>
these consider therin those places the enforced nature of the allegory. Then how that else wherin all the rest of the book the cariage of the matter is very far from the nature of so odious &amp; so base a cōparison, if it be in the hand of a piously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected &amp; wel minded Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Lastly, that euen those few passages are sharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes; &amp; are no more an occasion to guilty parties, with the conceits thereof to make themselues mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then that great Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> his mocking (in a matter none more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) was to the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> when yet, perhaps, some stands by of the wiser sort, abhorring <hi>Baal,</hi> might
<pb facs="167"/>
smile secretly thereat.</p>
   <p>There is a kinde of smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ioyfull laughter, for any thing I know, which may stand with so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber grauitie, and with the best mans pietie, iustly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned from the right apprehension of things, else had not <hi>Abraham</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into it, nor holy <hi>Iob,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 17. Ca. 29. 24. Psal. 52. 6.</note> nor the righteous in seeing (which is strange) matter of feare. Well, I haue clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed this booke as it is: It may be some humor took me, as once it did old <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> who apparelled <hi>Ioseph</hi> differently from all the rest of his brethren in a partie coloured coat. It may also bee that I tooke (as <hi>Iacob</hi> did in his <hi>Ioseph)</hi> more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb facs="168"/>
in this Lad, then in twentie other of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren borne before him, or in a younger <hi>Beniamin</hi> brought forth soone after him.</p>
   <p>When I thus did appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell him, I intended to send him forth to his brethren, hoping hereby to procure him the more acceptance, where hee happily should come: and my expectation hath not failed; deceiued altogether I am not, as was <hi>Iacob</hi> in sending his <hi>Ioseph</hi> among his enuious bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. For not onely hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, but some thousands haue welcomed him to their houses. They say they like his countenance, his habit and manner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="168"/>
well enough, though other too nice bee not so well pleased therewith.</p>
   <p>But who can please all? or how can any one so write or speake, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent euery man? If any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me, and abuse him in their too carnal apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, without the truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended spirituall vse, let them blame themselues, &amp; neither me nor him: for the fault is their owne, which I wish them to amend?</p>
   <p>You that like him, I pray you stil accept of him for whose sake, to further your spiritual meditation, I haue sent him out with these <hi>Contents,</hi> and more marginall notes.</p>
   <p>His habite is no whit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb facs="169"/>
which he is constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by mee to weare, not onely on working dayes, but euen vpon holy daies and Sondayes too, if he go abroad. A fitter garment I haue not now for him: and if I should send out the poore Lad naked; I know it would not please you.</p>
   <p>This his coate, though not altered in the fashion, yet is it made somewhat longer. For though from his first birth into the world it bee scarce halfe a yeare, yet he is growne a little bigger; but I thinke him to become to his full stature: so he wil be, but as a litle pigmie to be carried abroad in any mans poket.</p>
   <p>I pray you now this
<pb facs="169"/>
fourth time accept him, &amp; vse him, as I haue intended him for you, and you shal reape the fruite, though I forbid you not to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly merry with him. So fare you well in all friend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly wellwishes.</p>
