   <head>A Declaration for the better vnderstanding <hi>of this</hi> BOOKE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing written this Poetical History, with purpose to haue it printed in one only Volume, in the discourse whereof those doubts might be cleared, which now (being diuided) might offer themselues; it appeared (to my seeming) a very iust thing, to remoue this inconuenience, beeing it might easily be done, and that in very few words. For which purpose, it is to bee pre-supposed, That <hi>Guzman de Alfarache,</hi> our <hi>Picaro,</hi> hauing (by his study) come to be a good Latinist, Rhetorician, and Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian (as we shall deliuer vnto you in this first Part) after that hee had returned out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> he went forward in his Studies, with purpose to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the state of Religion, and to make himselfe a Church-man. But by reason of his often relapsings to his Vices, he left that course, after he had spent some yeeres therein. Now himselfe writeth his owne life from a-boord the Gallies, where hee remained, and was put to the Oare, for the faults which hee had committed, hauing beene a most famous Thiefe, and notorious Offender, as you shall see more at large in the second Part. Nor is it any improprietie, or beyond our present purpose, if in this first Part I shall set before you some Tracts of Doctrine: But rather seemeth agreeable vnto reason to present vnto you a man of a cleere vnderstanding, holpen by Learning, and punished by Time, making benefit of that idle time, which hee had in the Gallies; Being that we likewise see many ignorant poore soules sentenced to death, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to spend the remainder of their time in thinking on their soules health, diuert their thoughts from all other worldly things, for to make a short stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died speech when they come to the Ladder.</p>
   <p>This Booke diuides it selfe into three parts: In the first, it is treated of <hi>Guz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man de Alfaraches</hi> going forth of his mothers house, and the slender consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of yong men in those indeuours which they attempt: And how, though their eye-sight be cleere, they will not see, precipitated and blinded with their false pleasures. In the second, the life of a <hi>Picaro</hi> or <hi>Rogue,</hi> which hee vnder-went, and the lewd tricks which he was led into by ill company, and the time which he idly mis-spent. In the third, the calamities, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pouertie, whereunto he grew, and the inconsiderate courses which he ran into, because he would not take vp himselfe in time; and his obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in not suffering himselfe to be ruled by those, who were both able and desirous to doehim good. In that which I shall write hereafter, I shall (God willing) giue an end to this Story.</p>
