   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloued in the Lord Iesus, it is a most <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,</hi> and yet very <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>plausible delusion,</hi> to <hi>conceit</hi> vnto our selues an <hi>estate in grace,</hi> when as yet wee remaine the bond-slaues of Satan. And it is a very <hi>difficult,</hi> and yet most <hi>necessarie</hi> triall, to discerne our constant abiding and proceeding in this estate of grace. For (to passe by those who make a mocke of conuersion, as being a touch of noueltie, a brand of inconstancie, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of hypocrisie) who is there almost that flatters not himselfe to be in the fauour of God, and so interessed in his grace? And hath he not many such pretences and colours heereunto, which may so abuse his iudgement, that hee may <hi>thinke himselfe to be somewhat, when he is nothing;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Galat. 6. 3.</note> and so refusing to be found in Christ, by being lost and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied in himselfe, thereby become worse then nothing? Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neuer to haue beene borne, then so to bee deceiued. Oh how thè wisdome of the flesh prooues here enmitie against God! Is not this the iudgement vpon the world, that <hi>they</hi>

      </note>
      <hi>which see not, might see; and that they which see might be made blinde?</hi> Consider first, I pray you, how <hi>nature</hi> occasions this deceit. Is any disposed lesse euilly by the benefit of his <hi>complexion?</hi> Is any constrained from
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>some act</hi> of euill by <hi>natures impotencie</hi> and <hi>deformity?</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. Natures im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie.</note> Behold, euen these to the naturall man prooue very <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous stumbling blockes,</hi> to rest in nature, as affoording some shew of good, more then is in others of an harder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, as breaking out lesse into grosse euils, then such, who by natures abilitie are more prone and prouoked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And is it not esteemed a sufficient measure of goodnes, to bee lesse euill then others, howsoeuer the desire and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of corruption be the same in all? Is not the seeming good which by natures benefit shewes forth in the world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted currant holinesse, and thereby excludeth the true power of well-doing?</p>
   <p>Especially if to this shew of natures righteousnesse <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
      <note place="margin">3. Education.</note> be adioined, whereby the minde being informed in <hi>knowledge,</hi> and restrained by <hi>ciuilitie,</hi> natures euill is heereby more kept vnder, and it seeming good set out more saleable and beautious to the sinister iudgement: howsoeuer now nature hath gained no other then a weapon of vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, to commit sinne more dangerously, by how much it is inabled to couch it more closely, and smooth it more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly; yet this with the world passeth for a currant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, especially if some such change now appeare in the outward man, whereby wee may either differ from the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticitie and grosse abuses of our parents, or differ from the barbarous and desperate sprouts of our childhood, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed youth.</p>
   <p>And if now the Lord shall giue the wicked their desire, in <note place="margin">4. Restraining spirit.</note> affoording them so farre the vse of his spirit, as to <hi>restraine</hi> yet more inward corruption by it power and terrour, that so they may be fitter for such outward prosperitie as they haue especially made choice of in this life, and so renounced their interest in heauen, and withall may frame better to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, both of the <hi>good,</hi> to whom now they shall doe lesse

hurt, as also of the <hi>euill,</hi> whom by this meanes they may prouoke to good; that so Gods gouernment of the world may be more beautifull and glorious, and his will more iustifiably accomplished in the elect and reprobate. Is not this <hi>restraint</hi> apprehended, as a great conquest ouer corruption; and so a conuersion hence vainly concluded; seeing the inward hart is no whit renued, but only the corruption restrained from the outward act? nay, is not corruption <hi>more inraged inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the more it is outwardly bridled &amp; smothered? and so sin made out of measure sinfull: as being more <hi>inexcusable,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> the more it is curbed: as <hi>breaking out more desperately,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Note.</hi>
      </note> when the bridle is reiected: as <hi>ripening</hi> more dangerously, the more it boileth within: and so <hi>sealing vp</hi> vengeance more certainly, yea more <hi>fearfully hastning</hi> it, as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>despight the spirit of grace.</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 27. 28.</note>
   </p>
   <p>And what though the Lord bestow on the wicked many <note place="margin">5. Spirit of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.<hi>Matth.</hi> 7.</note> excellent graces of his spirit, inabling them to <hi>teach others,</hi> to doe <hi>wondrous things,</hi> furthering them so farre in the shew of holinesse, as that they shall seeme for a time to <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip the sincere professor?</hi> May they not teach other, and yet themselues be <hi>reiected?</hi> May they not doe miracles, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. Iob 10. Gal. 6. 10. 2. Tim. 3.</note> and yet heare, <hi>I know you not?</hi> Shall not <hi>the candle of the hypocrite be put out?</hi> Doth not this <hi>faire shew in the flesh deceiue,</hi> and <hi>prooue deceiued?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>What should I tell you of that change that is wrought by <note place="margin">6. Afflictions.</note> afflictions? Will not the wicked in their troubles seeke the Lord diligently? Must not the vilest forbeare when they cannot otherwise chuse? And is it any masterie, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, when power is not in our hands? Will not the swine that is now cleansed, returne to the mire againe? Is it cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, then to forgiue the world, when we see no <hi>time</hi> left for <note place="margin">Psal. 78. 2. Pet. 2.</note> execution of malice? Is it patience, to forbeare when wee can neither will nor chuse? Is it obedience, to tremble vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="6"/>
the whip? to feare God only for his iustice, and not to loue him for his mercie?</p>
   <p>Oh but wee are deliuered out of trouble, and restored to <note place="margin">7. Prosperitie.</note>
      <hi>great happinesse.</hi> Behold, wee are blessed on the earth: and are not we then truly blessed? Is not this a marke of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, to be prosperous in the world? Would God blesse our labours, if we did not serue him? May not this change from affliction to prosperitie be a certaine euidence of an inward change, from worse to better, and so prooue vnto the flesh a conceit of conuersion?</p>
   <p>Surely, if the world bee Iudge, the case is quickly ruled. Who is the good man, but the rich man? Either his riches shall be the cloke to hide his faults by greatnesse, briberie, cunning packing, friendship, &amp;c. or his euill <hi>by the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> of the world shall be accounted good: hee will not doe so for his credit: he needs not steale, oppresse: he hath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall: his couetousnesse is thrift; his pride, cleanlinesse; his prodigalitie, bountie; his loosenesse, libertie and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue. Hath hee not power of all in his hands? And may he not doe what he list? Is not his lust a law, his example a rule and warrant? He feares no trouble; therefore hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues none. Who can say, <hi>Blacke is his eie?</hi> because, who dares say so? Nay, who will not say, blacke is white, if it may please him? Thus prosperitie makes a conuert, if the world may giue in euidence.</p>
   <p>Especially if our fulnesse in the world be graced with some <note place="margin">3. Ciuill calling.</note> ciuill calling, whereby wee are honoured of the people, and taken vp with imploiments; is not idlenesse now much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, and so such sinnes as doe accompanie the same? Doth not credit now restraine, where conscience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not? Is there not now a cloake for sinne, and countenance for iniquitie? What defense is fathered hence for neglect of spirituall duties? What opportunity offered, to colour oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb facs="6"/>
and deceit? What pretence for licentiousnesse, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in the abuse of the creatures? What wrapping vp of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses, where there is fellowship in euill? Is not here a glorious maske for sinceritie and religion, where outward honestie in a ciuill calling becomes a warrant of vprightnesse, seeing our faith is shewed by workes? And what more obuious and commendable then our ciuill imploiments, so beneficiall to the Common-weale, so necessarie for our priuate, so suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfull in the issue, as who (in opinion) more blessed? What is it, if not godlinesse, that is so plentifully recompenced in this life? If now the wicked eat the labours of their hands, and drinke their wine in bowles, may they not sacrifice to their nets? May they not cry ayme vnto their soules, Oh well is thee, and happie shalt thou bee? Thus ciuill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment with worldlings is accounted religion: and to bee morally iust and true in contracts and bargaines, goes cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant with men for stanch and sound holinesse.</p>
   <p>But if we enter into Gods sanctuarie, and by the rule of the word determine heereof; is not the prosperity of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">Prou. 1. Psal. 55. Ier. 48. 11.</note> their destruction, and not their conuersion? Doth not the old sent remaine in <hi>Moab,</hi> because he was not changed from vessell to vessell, but enioied constant prosperity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, was setled on his l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>es, and rooted more obstinately in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures dregges, thereby exercised more greedily and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly the lusts thereof? Can the change of the outward estate <note place="margin">Os. 4. 7. Psal. 78. Os. 5.</note> change the inward man from worse to better? As they were increased, so, did not Gods people rebell against him, who in their afflictions sought vnto him deceitfully? Is not heere a change from better to worse? An hypocrite in affliction, as being bridled and restrained, prooues a desperate enemie, when by prosperitie he hath power in his hands.</p>
   <p>As for walking in a ciuill calling, howsoeuer this (being sanctified by the <hi>spirituall)</hi> may bee a meanes to lay vp a <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 5.</note>
      <pb facs="7"/>
good foundation against the day of Christ, <hi>1. Tim. 6. 19. 20.</hi> yet to the naturall man there is not a more dangerous out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes to exclude grace, then the greatest measure of honestie that is seene therein. For is it not the grace of this calling to rest in it selfe for good successe, without inuocation of Gods assistance, or reference to his blessing? Is not our pursuit heereof a priuilege to exempt from holy duties? We must liue, and therefore we cannot be bookish. We haue no leasure to the Church, &amp;c. Nay, is it not a price, proposed to incourage diligence in these worldly businesses, euen li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to prophane the Sabbaths, to despise the word? &amp;c. And what if men keepe touch and day in paiments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts? What if a little eie-seruice be vsed in the outside of their wares? Is it for conscience to God, to whom they desire to approoue the truth of their hearts; or only a care for the maintenance of trading, and mutuall commerce, which without this outward equitie must needs be abolished? Who will trust, or shall be trusted, if word be not kept? But is it kept any further, then may cleere from touch of mans law? Is promise kept heere to our hindrance, so we may winde out by the arme of flesh? Is the substance of our wares any thing lesse then answerable to the shew? Is not God robbed of his glorie, while we sacrifice to our labour and wit? and <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babel, <hi>which I haue built for the honour of my name?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
   <p>Surely as these outward things are common to all, so no man knoweth loue or hatred, either by prosperity or aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <note place="margin">Eccl. 9. 1.</note> Well may a good man (by right vsage) make these good vnto him; but these of themselues may wel make him worse: otherwise they haue no power inwardly to better him: Only it belongeth vnto God (through the ministerie of his word) to conuert the soule, as tendring (to this end) vnto vs, not <note place="margin">Psal. 19.</note> corruptible things, as siluer and gold, which make outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="7"/>
happie in this life; but the pretious blood of Christ, as a <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 18.</note> Lambe vndefiled and without spot, whereby wee are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from all our sinnes, and redeemed from our vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1. 8.</note> receiued by the tradition of the fathers.</p>
   <p>But hearken, I pray you, vnto a further plea of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite: <note place="margin">8. Profession. Practise. Matth. 7.</note>
      <hi>Haue we not heard thee teaching in our streets?</hi> Nay, <hi>Haue we not taught in thy name? Haue we not</hi>
      <note place="margin">Luk. 8. Mark. 6. 25.</note>
      <hi>receiued the word with ioy, and done many things</hi> accordingly? Can the best doe more? Doe not wee in many things offend all? Is not this a sufficient euidence of an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall conuersion?</p>
   <p>Surely where the grace of God, which bringeth saluation <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11.</note> to all men, hath appeared effectually, there it teacheth vs, not only to eschew all euill, in thought, word, and deed; but <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> on the contrary, to prosecute all good, both 1. inwardly in the <note place="margin">Act. 15. 19.</note> heart and minde, as being purified by faith, whereby with constant purpose we cleaue vnto God, and also 2. outwardly <note place="margin">Act. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. 23.</note> in the word and conuersation: <hi>Iam. 3. 1. Ephes. 1. Rom. 12. 1. 1. Cor. 6.</hi> yea generally and vniuersally, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to all Gods Commandements: <hi>Psal. 119. 7. 8.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly also continuing and abounding, yea increasing in grace, and finishing our course, that no man take away our Crowne: <hi>Reu. 3. 1. Cor. 15. 58. Ephes. 3. Col. 1. 2. Pet. 1. 8. 9. 2. Tim. 4. 3. Phil. 13.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And therefore seeing the word of God must bee a sauour of death vnto death vnto some who are to be renounced, and <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 14. Iohn 15. Psal. 119. Ezech. 33. 30. 31. Heb. 4. 2.</note> made inexcusable thereby; hence is it, that though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it 1. with <hi>ioy,</hi> as being rauished with the sweetnesse thereof; yet being not <hi>mixed with faith,</hi> it becomes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and so the ioy of the hypocrite lasteth but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And so it commeth also to passe, that for carnall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, as vain-glory, credit, satisfaction of others, whom they desire to be like, the hypocrite also may <hi>do many things</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
according to the <hi>letter of the word,</hi> though not answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the power thereof; not from the purpose of his heart, renued by the holy Ghost; but executing therein the lust of his heart, as spirituall pride, hypocrisie, &amp;c. Neither shall he be able to continue in any substance of well-doing, seeing howsoeuer for his credit and profit hee must sometimes shew religious, yet by reason of difference of companie, change of times and occasions, he must euen for the same ends of credit and profit, cast off his visour of holinesse, and so appeare in his true likenesse, to the satisfying of such to whom nothing but grosse and desperate wickednesse will giue any content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nay doth not this necessity lie vpon the hypocrite, that howsoeuer for a time he must glose and fawn vpon the truth, while it is his pack-horse to further him to promotion, riches, &amp;c. yet when by plunging himselfe into worldly courses, hee must necessarily crosse in his outward actions the power of that truth, must he not now for his credit abase and vilifie that truth which before hee so magnified? as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either too seuere and precise, because hee cannot reach it: or being <hi>foolishnesse</hi> and madnesse; and therefore he is <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 21.</note> now more wise, more sober, then to be guided by it: you must pardon his former folly and giddinesse: he will doe no more so; he will be more wise, moderate, &amp;c. This is the issue of an hypocrites supposed conuersion, answerable euen vnto the measure thereof; which being not rooted in the heart, nor aiming at Gods glory, no maruell if the glory of an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite prooue his confusion. And is hee not iustly deceiued in this fancie of regeneration? Is he not heereby excluded from the power of conuersion, because he resteth in the shadow thereof?</p>
   <p>But to admit a true conuersion: Is the combate now at an end? or not rather now begun? Is there any place heere for idlenesse, securitie, remisnesse in our calling? Surely though
<pb facs="8"/>
the foundation standeth sure in respect of God, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2 19.</note> who are his; yet it lieth much in vs, either to make sure <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 10.</note> and beautifie the building, by being watchfull and diligent in well-doing; or else by our negligence and security to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face <note place="margin">2. Phil. 12. Psal. 51. Psal. 73. Malach. 3.</note> and interrupt the same, yea many times, to our <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>feeling,</hi> euen vtterly to ouerthrow the same. For proofe heereof, peruse this <hi>treatise ensuing:</hi> let it be, in Gods feare, a <hi>touch-stone</hi> vnto thee, to make triall of a <hi>sound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion:</hi> and take it as a preseruatiue, to keepe thee in the power of godlines, that so thou maist not leaue thy first loue. If by pride or security thou hast beene left to thy selfe, and <note place="margin">Reuel. 2.</note> so hast left thy former measure, view thy selfe diligently in this present glasse, and vse it as a meanes for thy recouerie and perseuerance. Expect not what may be said, seeing my health and study affoords only breuity: neither misconstrue what may be well digested, lest thou be peruerted by a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke. Though many are called, yet but few are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen: and therefore if few digest this pill: let them not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <note place="margin">Matth. 22. 14.</note> the physicke, but their owne ill-disposed hearts. Those that can get meat out of the eater, and sweetnesse out of the strong, let them praise the glorious Lord, who bringeth light <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 6. 7.</note> out of darknesse; and not cease praying vnto our gracious Father, that he would turne our darknesse into light, and <note place="margin">Ioh. 12.</note> enable vs to worke while yet we haue the light: that so wee may approoue our selues the children of the light, and bee prepared to that light which shall neuer be changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to darknesse. Euen so be it. <hi>Come Lord Iesus: Come quickly. (∵)</hi>
