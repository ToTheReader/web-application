      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auyng of late (gentle reader) recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the expert Artificer Ro. Norman, his booke intituled The newe Attractiue (who of the great good will, and affection he beareth, hath attributed in his dedication, that, whiche I acknowledge not to bee dewe) in the whiche amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest other diuers vertues and properties of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes or Lodestone, he intreateth of the declinyng of the Needle touched there with from the plaine of the Horizon, (a matter neuer before found, or written of by any). For the further behoofe and benefite of all traueilers and Seamen, I tooke occasion to inlarge the same with this discourse of the variation of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, wherein I haue handled the whole varietie of that subiect, bothe Practically, and Mathimatically, to the ende I might partly satisfie bothe the vulgar, and also the learned sort. For, knowyng the variatiō of the Cumpasse to bee the cause of many errours and imperfections in Nauigation, and perceiuyng that all those that haue as yet gone about to giue rules in that
<pb facs="3"/>
arte, haue left this (beyng a principall poinct, and euē the grounde of all the reste) vntouched, or at least so sleightly handled the same, that little or no benefit could be gathred therby: I haue here set doune the sū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie waies to obserue the same at all tymes &amp; places, that the inconuenience beyng knowne, might be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of, and auoided. VVherein, although my cheefest intent hath been to pleasure those that shall haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to put the thyng in practice by their owne tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and experience, yet because some of the rules are deducted from the fountaines of the Mathematicall Sciences, and wrought by the doctrine of Sines and Triangles, whiche maie seeme strange in our Englishe tonge, &amp; wherwith fewe Seamen are yet acquainted, I maie seem to haue missed of my first good meanyng, but I would wishe them to chuse that whiche is plain, and conformable to their capacities, and make their profite thereof, and for the reste vnderstande, that of suche obseruations as thei them selues can not presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly applie to the purpose, by others that are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instructed in these Mathematicall supputations, or by them selues when thei shall attaine to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therof, maie be inferred suche effectuall matter as is by these rules and preceptes promised. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would haue all Seamen to vse suche diligence in
<pb facs="3"/>
their trauailes, that no oportunitie be omitted, when, or where any obseruation maie be made, either for the variation, or latitude of places, or of any other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie poincte incident to Nauigation, and thereof to keepe continuall notes &amp; memoriall. For these obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, there needeth not many troublesome Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, onely for the variation, the newe Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ende of this treatise I preferre before all other. And for eleuations, a plaine Astrolabe exactly made, and a crosse staffe, are sufficient. (The Globe were also a verie good and necessarie Instrument▪ for besides many pleasaunt conclusions that maie be tried by it, it doeth lighten verie muche the conceiptes, for vnderstandyng diuers important poinctes, but it is too troublesome [or otherwise not fit for euery Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner] to be caried to the Sea). Vnto the whiche maie bee added the Topographicall Instrument, for taking of distances, and making descriptions vpon the land. VVith these Instrumentes, and the sailyng Cumpasse and Marine plat, (whiche are alwaies to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode the principall, and moste necessarie Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes for Nauigation, for by them onely any voiage maie bee made, but without them no Nauigation can bee performed.) the whole worlde maie bee traueled, discouered, &amp; described. These are sufficient for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte
<pb facs="4"/>
Mariner, and more then these were superfluous, onely the runnyng glasses, leades, lines, and suche like appendances of the other excepted.</p>
   <p>But to haue all these Instruments, and not to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande the groundes how to vse them, were a great vanitie. Therefore I wishe all Seamen &amp; Traueiler's, that desire to bee cunnyng in their profession, firste to seeke knowledge in Arithmetik &amp; Geometrie, whiche are the groundes of all Science and certaine artes, of the whiche there is written in our Englishe to gue, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for an industrious and willyng minde to attain to greate perfection, whereby he maie not onely iudge of Instrumentes, Rules, and preceptes giuen by other, but also bee able to correcte them, and to deuise newe of hym self And this not onely in Nauigation, but in all Mechanicall Sciences. As by the studious practise and exercise in these artes, haue attained to rare and singuler knowledge: In Architecture, Ʋitriuuius the Romaine: In paintyng that famous Germaine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Durerus: And in buildyng of Shippes, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe Baker our countrieman: And others in other faculties as thei haue been moste skilfull herein, so haue thei excelled. Hauyng these helpes and groundes with the Instrumentes before specified, a Mariner maie bee able to make description in platt of the coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
<pb facs="4"/>
and Countries, and of the Banckes, Rockes, and Sholdes in the Sea, with the deapthes and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie notes obserued in his owne trauailes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, &amp; effectually accordyng to the truthe, (whiche is the cheefest parte required in a perfect Mariner.) And not be alwaies tied to the reportes of other, or to the Portugale, or Spanishe Marine platts, whiche are made by the Cardmakers of those Countries, men that are no trauelers them selues, but doe all thinges ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by information, and vppon the credite of others, whiche onely committ to memorie the forme and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Sea coastes, with making some fewe notes of the liyng of one place from an other, whiche can neuer bee so perfecte as the deferiptions that are made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the present sight and vewe of places, albeeit he be neuer so skilfull and cunnyng, that shall so cary the same by memorie, how muche lesse then by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull. By this meanes the Cardmakers set doune thei knowe not what: as maie appeare by the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their owne coastes, whiche are verie grossely and vnperfectly dooen, whereas the Marine plattes ought to bee described by suche as can giue reason, and shewe obseruation of euery particularitie contained in the same, aswell for the latitude of places, as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng by the Compasse of the Capes, Headlandes, Poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes,
<pb facs="5"/>
I landes, Baies, Rockes, Sholdes &amp;c. one from an other, and the distances betweene them. The errors of those descriptions, I maie not attribute to the Card<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, but to the vnskilfull Seamen of those coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, for if thei were otherwise, as thei haue been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted the moste skilfull of the worlde, those errors could not haue cōtinued as thei doe: true it is that for their great trauailes, thei haue been worthely famous aboue all other nations, till now at length our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieman Sir Frācis Drake for valorous attempt, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proceadyng, &amp; fortunate performyng his voiage about the worlde, is not onely become equall to any of them, but in fame farre surmounteth them all. But those Cardmakers, and all other that collecte and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hydrographical, and Geographicall descriptions of other mennes trauatles or reportes: as their paines maie bee greate, and deserue due commendation, so their doynges maie bryng commoditie diuersely. And in this behalf Abrahamus Ortelius in his Theatrum, hath deserued immortall praise, for collectyng to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and reducing into one cōmodious volume, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers plattes and descriptiōs, made by diuers and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie men. But amongst all those that haue made Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphicall descriptions, I can not a little maruaile at Guilielmus Postellus, who beeyng a famous lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="5"/>
man, a greate traueiler and Cosmographer, and Deane of the Kynges Professors in the Ʋniuersitie of Paris, in his vniuersall Mappe. Anno 1580. besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that it is generally handeled after suche a grosse and confused maner, that it might seeme rather to haue come from some rude vnskilfull, then from hym so famous a Doctor; hath also in the imagined Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries aboute the North Pole, so corrupted it with his fonde dreames, and fantasticall inscriptions, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng to those supposed landes, diuers people, as the Georgians and Hyperborians, and assignyng there to be the highest hilles of the worlde, and the people dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng on thē, to haue the continuall light of the Sunne; Sueta Zemlia founde by the Englishemen, An. 1550. the holie Lande, the place of the cheefest felicitie, the Hyperborean feeldes, and therefore the felicitie of the Moluccas, with many other ridiculous absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: That by the grosse errors of this learned man in these matters, I am taught, that what so euer fame goeth, or opinion is conceiued of any man for profound learnyng, and smothe deliueryng of their conceiptes, or what so euer greate promises are by them selues made in these artes, to iudge of them accordyng to the woorkes that come from them, and not otherwise to bee deceiued.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="6"/>For auoidyng prolixitie in this my Preface to so smala volume, I referre the gētle reader, to the worke it self. Yet by the waie it shall not bee a misse, that I commende vnto you, the table of the Sunnes declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (or Regiment) made by R. N. which is calculated for the present tyme, and differeth not from the truth in any place aboue one minute, wheras in all other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto made and extant, there are great errors. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, suche as otherwise can not from tyme to tyme calculate their declinations, accordyng to the place of the Sunne to bee giuen by the Ephemerides, and table of declination of Reinholdus maie boldly vse this Regiment for 20. yeres without any sensible errour. And so wishyng my trauailes in this trease maie doe suche good as I ment, I commit the same to your gentle constructions, and your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to the Almightie. At Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house the 26. of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Anno 1581.</p>
