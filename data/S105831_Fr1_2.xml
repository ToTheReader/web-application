   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FVLL, AND HIS ESPECIALL friends, Robert Lee and Roger Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington Esquires, Robert Greene wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth health, wealth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Philosopher Hermes (right worshipfull) being demanded why continually he carried the stone Celonites about with him, answered, least happily he might become vnthankefull. Meaning hereby that ingratitude is such a loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some vice in a liberall minde, and such a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous offence so repugnant to nature, that the forfeit of such a fault can be no lesse than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of death can afoord. For the nature of the stone is presentlie to depriue him of lyfe which is infected with ingratitude. Which say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Hermes throughly considered, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to minde the innumerable benefits and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good turns which I haue receiued at your worships hands, finding my abilitie far vnfit to
<pb facs="3"/> requite such curtesie, I was driuen into a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Dilemma, whether excusing my self by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilitie I should incurre the suspition of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, or in offering such simple stuffe my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiencie could affoord, I should be counted impudent. Staying thus in suspence, I shaked off the shakles with calling to remembraunce the saying of a poore Painter in Sienna, who offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a simple picture to Charles the second, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a present farre vnfit for such a Potentate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded how he durst offer such a base gift to so princely a personage. I feared not (quoth he) in that I knew he was our Emperour, knowing that it was kingly to accept of a gift though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so simple, and the signe of a worthie minde to thinke as well of the poore mans myte as of the riche mans treasure. Artaxerxes receiued thankfully the handful of water offered to him by a poore pesant, Cyrus was presented with a Pomgranat, and Iupiter himselfe vouchsafed of the graine of wheate which the poore Pismier offred to him for a new yeeres gift. Pricked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (right worshipfull) with these examples, I was the more bold to present this vnworthie worke as a witnesse of my vnfained good will and affection, assuming so vpon your worships
<pb facs="3"/> wonted curtesies, as I assure my selfe you wil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of this my toy be it neuer such a trifle, and vouchsafe of my good will though the gift bee neuer so simple: Promising that if hereafter ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my witte or skill shall be able to yeeld anie better fruite, I will offer it at your worshippes shrine, that al the world may know you are the two Saints to whome in heart I owe most duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deuotion. Hoping in the mean time that you will accept more of my wil than of the worke, and of my meaning more than of the matter, I commit your worshippes to the Almightie. From my Studie in Clarehall the vij. of Iulie.</p>
