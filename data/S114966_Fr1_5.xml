   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all the instructions and disciplines which are found to be profitable for mans vse, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by the iudgement of prudent men, is iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not to be the last, or lest. <hi>Tullie</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Roman</hi> Eloquence calls it: <hi>The witnes of the times, the Light of truth, the Life of memorie, the Mistresse of life, the Reporter of antiquitie.</hi> Which being generally spoken as it doeth agree allso with Histories Profane, soe by farre greater reason it may be applied to the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, which by soe much more exceedeth in worth the other, as things diuine doe excell the human. But no part of Ecclesiasticall Historie is more profitable to faythfull Christians, or more healthfull for their soules, then that which treates of the holy liues and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions of the SAINCTS, and proposeth them as paternes of perfectiō to be imitated in Gods Church. Whence it is, that both in the old and new Testament, are mentioned the examples of holy men, that well and truly serued &amp; pleased God in this lise. What else doeth <hi>Jesus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> in his booke intituled <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticus,</hi> from the fortith chapter to the one and fiftith; but rehearse the prayses of his worthie fore fathers, and

         </gap>.</note> For, these and manie other holy Doctours, Authours of SAINCTS Liues, vnderstood well that this manner of writing was both profitable to all good Christians, and the whole Church of God.</p>
   <p>But one and not the lest of the causes which should moue vs to write and read the Liues of SAINCTS, is, the encrease of His honour and glory, that made them SAINCTS, by adorning and enriching them with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular guifts and graces. For it is a thing most reasonable that we honour and serue them, who knew soe well how to honour and serue our Lord, and that we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to augment their <hi>accidentall</hi> glory (for the <hi>essentiall</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
we cannot) who aspired to nothing more then to amplifie and dilate the glorie of God. And since that <note place="margin">
         <hi>Io.</hi> 12.</note> God him self (as our Sauiour saith) honoureth those that honour him, by good reason men ought to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them that God honours. The royall Prophett <hi>Dauid</hi> considering the lawfulnes of this debt, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs, to <hi>praise God in his Saincts.</hi> Allso it is a thing iust <note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note> and profitable to implore the fauour and ayde of our brethren who are allreadie in possession of an assured victorie, to the end that by their prayers &amp; intercessiōs we may arriue at the quiet hauen where they haue lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and be made partakers of their heauenly crownes and triumphes. Moreouer, it is a great glorie for our Mother the Catholique Church, to know the braue deeds of the illustrious children which she hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. It is allso a strong bucklar and bullwarke against <note place="margin">Saincts li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues a buck lar against Heretiques</note> the infidels that impugne Her, and a scourge to the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, fallen from her, whose erroneous follies can not be better conuinced, then by the pious examples of the SAINCTS; for it is a farre more excellent way to teach by workes then by words, and all the workes of the SAINCTS are holy, and all in all contrary to the fantasticall imagination of Heretiques. For what can more confound their <hi>Faith, which alone they would haut sufficient for, saluation,</hi> then the good workes of the SAINCTS, their peanance, their fasting, their absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, their pilgrimages, their rigid and seuere morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of their bodies to bring them subiect to the mind, all which the blasphemous mouthes of Hereticks doe reiect as vaine, superstitious, and impious actions? But farre otherwise did CHRIST, his Apostles, and SAINCTS teach, both by words and deeds. And what they thought and did, can by noe other meanes be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manifested,
<pb facs="6"/>
but by the hystories of their liues. Soe that both to conuince Heretiques, and interpret the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">Saincts li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture.</note> and hard passages of holy scripture, the Liues and examples of the SAINCTS doe greatly helpe. Which made S. HIEROME call, the Liues of SAINCTS, the interpretation of holy scripture; and S. AVGVSTINE say, that the holy scripture treateth not only of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God, but alsoe of the liues and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the SAINCTS, to the end that yf we chance at anie time to doubt of the true sense and vnderstanding thereof, we way receaue light and instruction from that which they haue done. For composing our liues and manners according to the imitation of the SAINCTS, we need not feare falling into errour: when we see how the supreme gouernour of all hath adorned them with manifest miracles, and with euident signes declared that their Liues were gratefull vnto him.</p>
   <p>Their liues therefore must allwaies serue vs as a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour besore our eyes therein to behould our owne vices <note place="margin">Saincts li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for our act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">

         </gap>s.</note> to learne to correct them, and to looke vppon their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall vertues to endeauour to imitate them. There the proud shall find how to become humble, the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted how they may be mollified, the cold how they may be warmed, the tepid how they may be heated, the pious and feruent of spirit how they may be more and more inflamed with the loue of heauen: and in a word, all of whatsoeuer age, sex, condition, profession or calling, may thēce reape sweet flowers of all kind of vertues, documents of wholsom peanance, and liuely examples of true pietie, farre more efficacious to moue their minds to the practise of goodnes then the force of weake words only. This S. AVSTEN affirmeth of him self. This in times past manie noble Lords and Matro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="6"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> did testifie, who being all ether staggering in their faith, or growing cold in charitie, by only <note place="margin">Hier. ad Marcell.</note> hearing of the most holy life of great S. ANTHONIE the Hermite, were enflamed with soe great feruour of spirit, and fier of deuotion, that abhorring their former life,, and desiring euer after to slie all sinne and occa: sions of sinne, they bad adiew to the vaine world, and the pompes &amp; pleasures thereof, separated them selues from the conuersation and companie of men, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying their minds wholly to the diuine seruice, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the banner of CHRIST and his SAINCTS, &amp; crucified their owne bodies togeather with all the vices &amp; cōcupiscences thereof. But not to these only, but to manie others allsoe, the same is read to haue happened in the like case.</p>
   <p>Considering therefore and pondering oftentimes these things with my self, I was much grieued, that in <note place="margin">Causes mouing the: Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour to write the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se lines.</note> these lamentable times (wherein our miserable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is afflicted, spoyled, and oppressed by heresie) the Catholicks amidst these tribulations were depriued of the great profitt and consolation which they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue by the reading of the Liues of their SAINCTS; because that eyther their workes were not written, or yf they were written, it was in such Authours that now are scarse to be found, &amp; that in Latine, which is not for the capacitie of the vnlearned. I was noe lesse grieued allso that the SAINCTS them selues, that heretofore were the ornaments and Lights of our countrey, were now being vnknowne, depriued of their part of that due honour, which otherwise should haue beene done vnto them, being made knowne. For these reasons then, and partly for myne owne priuate exercise, but principally (gentle Reader) for thy consolation, I haue here aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
<pb facs="7"/>
(seeing noe better writer would take soe worthie a work in hand) to trie my penne in behalf of our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious SAINCTS, and to sett forth, though not as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily as I should, yet as truely and sincerely as I could, the Liues of all the most renowned. SAINCTS of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>land of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> and of the Iles thereunto belonging<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> and thereby I haue restored againe to all good Catholicks my Countreymen, that, which the cruell iniurie of the times had violently robbed them off, and sought to haue buried in the darknes of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall obliuion.</p>
   <p>But because all workes that are exposed to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick view of the world, are exposed allso to the censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of diuers sortes of poeple diuersly affected, I thought conuenient to set downe here some few aduertisemēts, aswell to preuent all occasions of misconstructions or cauills, that might be taken in the reading of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, as allso to informe the well-inclined Reader, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some doubtes or difficulties, that may occurre in the perusing of the same.</p>
   <p>First then, because the most illustrious Cardinall <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> (a man that hath otherwise well deserued of the <note place="margin">Baronius his mystake</note> Church of God for his Ecclesiasticall historie) doeth, contrarie to the auncient and common opinion of the world, robbe the <hi>Benedictine</hi> order of one of its greatest ornaments S. GREGORY the great, and denie that euer he liued a Monke vnder the holy RVLE of the Great Patriarch of Monkes sainct BENEDICT, and consequently affirmes that sainct AVGVSTINE and his fellow-Monkes whom he sent to conuert our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey (who were professed of the same Monasterie in <hi>Rome</hi> vnder sainct GREGORY) were not of the same Order; lest my Reader should chaunce to stumble vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb facs="7"/>
this new opinion, which since hath been by manie famous and learned writers hissed out of the schoole of true Historie, I will here for his better instruction briefly sett downe some few authorities of manie aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter and later Authours then <hi>Baronius,</hi> who doe all constantly asseuer the contrarie; that is, that both S. GREGORY him self, and the Monkes he sent, and made Apostles of <hi>England</hi> were indeed of the holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of sainct BENEDICT, and not of I know not what <hi>Equitiam</hi> familie, as <hi>Baronius</hi> pretends. And omitting here to draw arguments from the auncient charters &amp; writings graunted to Monasteries, euen in the time of sainct AVGVSTINE him self, which all euidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the same for a truth (as of some you may reade in his life <hi>May</hi> the 26.) I will first draw into the lists of this Combat, that ornament of our Countrey, sainct ALDELME Bishop of <hi>Sherburne,</hi> who died aboue nine <note place="margin">S. Aldelme against Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius.</note> hūdred yeares before <hi>Baronius</hi> was borne. In his worke then which he writt in verse of the prayse of Virgins &amp; Virginitie, hauing spoken much in commendation of out holy Father sainct BENEDICT, whom he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue been the first that ordered the exercises of Monasteries and a monasticall life, he maketh this epilogue to the paragraphe of sainct BENEDICTS prayses.

Whereby he euidently concludeth that not only the Apostles them selues, who brought the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi> into our countrey, were children of sainct BENE DICT, but euen that all the faythfull people of great <hi>Britaine</hi> were Foster-children vnto the same sainct BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEDICT whose disciples had nourished &amp; fed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie of their faith with the milke of CHRISTS holy Ghospell, and first brought them into the bosome of his true Church. And this same passage of sainct AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DELME was quoted seauen hundred yeares agoe by <hi>Amoinus</hi> a monke of the samous <hi>Benedictine</hi> Abbey of <note place="margin">Amoinus.</note>
      <hi>Fleury</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in a sermon of the prayses of sainct BENEDICT, which hath bin lately sett forth by <hi>Ioan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes a Bosco</hi> in his worke intituled, <hi>The Library of Fleury.</hi> This <hi>Amoinus,</hi> who is a very graue and auncient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, following the aforesayd truth embraced by our sainct ALDELNE, bouldly and without anie difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie affirmeth sainct GREGORY the great to be a child of sainct BENEDICTS, in the prologue of his second booke which treateth of the Miracles of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father. Nether is he content to say it only as the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his owne head, but constantly asseuers it a thing receaued by the whole <hi>English</hi> nation. For thus he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the life of sainct ABBO (extant in the Librarie of <hi>Fleury,</hi> chapter the 4.) <hi>In the meane time came an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage from the</hi> English <hi>natiō to</hi> Fleury, <hi>desiring to haue the helpe of some prudent and wise men.

      <hi>foresayd place, for two causes. One was, because Blessed Pope GREGORY hauing sent thither preachers of Christs faith, more peculiarly beat into their memories the obseruance of the Rule of the same beloued seruant of our Lord BENEDICT. And the other, because one called OSWALD, a man of great

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>leury.</hi> Therefore by the authoritie of this graue Authour a witnes of soe great antiquitie, it plainly appeares, that sainct GREGORY professed the holy Rule of S. BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEDICT, and that the Preachers he sent into <hi>England</hi> did the like.</p>
   <p>But lest some impertinent cauiller (for such an one he must needs be that calls in question the authoritie of our <hi>Aldelme</hi> whom the Church approueth for a Sainct) should say that these and such like writers professing the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order them selues, are parties in the controuersie, and that consequently their authoritie cannot decide this question; I will here briefly bring Authours of allmost all other Orders and Professions who doe expressely auouch that sainct GREGORY and his disciples our Apostles were <hi>Benedictines.</hi> And bicause <hi>Baronius,</hi> the Father of the contrarie opinion, <note place="margin">Thomas Bozius.</note> which we impugne, was a Priest of the Oratorian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatiō, let the Venerable Father <hi>Thomas Bozius</hi> Priest of the same Oratorie proceed first against him. This <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius,</hi> who was a learned, graue, and prudent writer, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of sett purpose to condemne the iudgemēt of his fellow-Priest in this point, soe plainly he speaketh for vs in manie places: especially in his fift booke of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent worke intituled, <hi>Of the signes of the Church,</hi> chap. 3. GREGORY <hi>the great</hi> (saith he) <hi>borne of a most noble race, and hauing througly performed his office in the chiefest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of</hi> Rome, <hi>at length despising all things, and bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing him self to the Order of</hi> sainct BENEDICT, <hi>he made profession of a monke, and (besides others founded in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) he built a Monasterie at</hi> Rome <hi>on the side of the hill</hi> Scaurus: <hi>in that place verie manie did learne both solid p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

   <p>Let vs bring in the last place some witnesses of our owne nation, not all that haue written of this matter, for they would require a whole volume, but some whose authoritie is beyond all exception. How great a man in all manner of learning, and chiefly in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall history as well of the vniuersall Church, as of our <hi>English</hi> nation was Doctour <hi>Nicholas Sanders,</hi> it is well inough knowne to the world. He in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Nicholas Sanders.</note> of his historie intituled, <hi>Of the English Schisme,</hi> hath these words? <hi>Gregory the great sent Augustine, Mellitus, &amp; other Monkes of S.</hi> BENEDICT, <hi>to the</hi> English Saxōs, <hi>who brought that nation from Idolatrie to Christianitie, and indued</hi> Ethelbert <hi>King of</hi> Kent <hi>with the baptisme of Christ.</hi> And NICHOLAS <hi>Harpsfield▪</hi> a man no lesse skillfull
<pb facs="11"/>
in the antiquities of <hi>England</hi> then SANDERS, in his Dialogue written against the <hi>Magdeburgenses,</hi> and in other places of his workes confirmes the same veritie. But let the most illustrious Cardinall WILLIAM AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEN conclude this Controuersie, who in an Epistle to <hi>Athanasius</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Monke of <hi>Cassine</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi> writeth these words: <hi>I could rehearse vnto thy pietie</hi> (sayth he speaking of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order) <hi>manie things out of the histories of our nation of the great reuowne and Sanctitie of this Order, for both</hi> Sainct AVGVSTINE <hi>him self, and the other disciples of</hi> Sainct GREGORY, <hi>that conucrted the countrey to the Fayth, were all of this Order: and all the Monasteries first instituted (which Venerable</hi> BEDE <hi>mentioneth) and BEDE him self, were of the same institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and all the Cathedrall Chapters, which in after times came to be of Secular Canons, were from their beginning of the Order of</hi> S. BENEDICT.</p>
   <p>Truely the authority of these three men, who in these later times were three fayre lights of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and second to none in the knowledge of the Ecclesiasticall history, as their workes now extant doe declare, who had searched into all the anncient monuments and charters of <hi>England,</hi> deserueth soe much creditt, that in respect of them, the opinion of anie other man whatsoeuer, may be neglected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned in this point. It remaynes therefore confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the authoritie of all the forenamed Authours that both S. GREGORY the great, and the Monkes he sent to preach the fayth of Christ in <hi>England,</hi> were all of the holie Order and institution of Sainct <hi>BENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICT.</hi> For no man I thinke can be soe peruerse (vnlesse he be a professed enemie to the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order) as to forsake the assertion of soe manie, Holy, learned,
<pb facs="11"/>
graue, wise, and prudent Writers both▪ auncient and moderne, and follow the innouation and noueltie of one <hi>Baronius,</hi> whose arguments against vs are soe weake and whose coniectures soe vnlikely, that the whole streame of his opinion seemeth rather to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from some other spring, then from the mind and learning of soe great a man. It would be too long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them here. It shall suffise that ouer and aboue the foresayd Authours and thousands more, we haue the auncient and common tradition of the whole world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Him. It is a sufficient, and more then a sufficient answer for him, that our assertion hath been allwaies receaued in the Church for a truth euen since the time of sainct GREGORIE him self, yea and that all the whole streame of antiquitie doeth conuince him of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation in this poynt. Of which his mistake I could easily pardon him, for allthough by seeking to robbe the <hi>Benedictine</hi> familie of sainct GREGORY, he thought to haue done a disparagement to the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet it fell out farre otherwise; for his deniall of a thing that had been alwaies before embraced for a truth in auncient times, moued manie learned men that zealed the Truth and good of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to make a most exquisite and strict search into the monuments and bowells of antiquitie, and finding that the opinion of <hi>Baronius</hi> was but a child that could by no meanes pretend anie title or right of descent from Authours of former ages, they soe learnedly, solidly, and manifestly made the contrarie assertion appeare to the world (to witt that sainct GREGORY was indeed a monk of sainct BENEDICT) that that which before lay, as it were, buried in antiquitie and not thought on receaued for a truth, but not talked on, knowne of all,
<pb facs="12"/>
but commended but off a few, became more conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to the world, more glorious to the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order, and more famously treated off throughout the whole Church: soe that the new opinion of <hi>Baronius</hi> serued but as a foyle more cleerly to sett forth the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of sainct GREGORIES being a <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monke, and to make the world take better and more particular notice, that soe great an <hi>Ornament</hi> of the vniuersall Church had been brought vp in the schoole of sainct BENEDICT.</p>
   <p>But that we may take away all further difficultie in this matter, let great sainct GREGORIE him self tell vs what Order he professed, for surely no man can say but he is a iudge without exception, and one whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is able to weigh downe more then I will name of such as write against vs. In his commentarie on the bocke of Kings, writing to his Monkes and Nouices, he vseth in manie places the expresse words of sainct BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEDICTS <hi>Rule</hi> and applies them to expound the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly text, or rather makes vse of the text it self to cōfirme the precepts of the <hi>Benedictine Rule:</hi> and there, in citing the words of the same Rule, he stileth our holy Father <note place="margin">

<pb facs="12"/>
doeth he not rather propose vnto them their Rules, and call S. BASILL and <hi>Equitius</hi> their <hi>Best Master?</hi> Were it not a thing strainge and against all rule for a Superiour of <hi>Franciscans</hi> or <hi>Dominicans</hi> to propose in a speech to his subiects the obseruance of the Rule of saint IGNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVS, and call him the <hi>Best Master</hi> of their Religion and profession, omitting to make anie mention of his owne Patrones sainct FRANCIS or sainct DOMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NICK? Surely yf sainct GREGORY had been a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple vnto <hi>Equitius</hi> (as <hi>Baronius</hi> faynes) he could not haue beene soe vnmindfull of the Father of his mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall religion as to preferre sainct BENEDICT be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, with the title of, the <hi>Best Master of regular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;</hi> and to propose his <hi>Rule</hi> to be obserued by his Monkes, and not once in all his workes to make the lest mention of the Rule of <hi>sainct Equitius.</hi> But how could he, when neuer anie such rule hath euer yet appeared vnto the world? But of his <hi>Best Master</hi> sainct BENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DICT, he maketh such honourable and large mention, that hauing dispatched the life of <hi>saint Equitius</hi> in one short chapter of his Dialogues, he filleth a whole booke with the life vertues and miracles of our glorious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sainct BENEDICT, whose <hi>Rule</hi> he confirmed &amp; preferred before all others, to shew the abundance of loue which he bore vnto him, whom he stileth the <hi>Best Master</hi> of his monasticall life. It would be too long to sett downe here all the places of our holy Father's saint BENEDICTS <hi>Rule,</hi> which this great Doctour of the Church S. GREGORIE expoundeth to his Monkes in the aboue cited Cōmentarie on the booke of Kings, It sufficeth for our purpose that he acknowledgeth S. BENEDICT for his <hi>Best Master,</hi> and proposeth his <hi>Rule</hi> to be obserued by the Monkes of his Monasterie,
<pb facs="13"/>
For what more manifest proofe can there be to shew that both he and the Monkes his subiects were all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Order, and that sainct AVGV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE our Apostle and his fellow-monkes &amp; preachers were professou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s of the same <hi>Rule,</hi> and Religion.</p>
   <p>Thus much (good Reader) I haue thought good to insorme thee in this poynt, not because the truth of the cause I defend did want anie such proofes, but because there are some soe willfully blind in the opinion of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi> that they doe yet striue against the whole streame of antiquitie and ancient Authours, and seeke to maintaine his noueltie. Against whom (If thou chāce to encounter anie such) thou art here sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed to be able to speake some thing for the truth in this matter. And doe not thinke that in disputing this poynt against a man soe worthyly deseruing of the Church as the most illustrious Cardinall <hi>Baronius,</hi> we doe it with intent to lay an aspersion of disgrace on his glorie, God forbid; for the defence of the truth can disgrace noe man; and especially him, who in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling through soe huge an Ocean as his Annalls are, could not chose but erre in some things, lest the world should haue taken him for some thing aboue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of mortall men. To conclude, we see that the greatest part of our <hi>English</hi> SAINCTS are knowne all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soe to haue been of the holy Order of S. BENEDICT, as it appeares in the ensuing treatise of their liues. For the Catholick religion being first planted in <hi>England</hi> by the labours of S. AVGVSTINE &amp; his fellow-Monkes, who were all <hi>Benedictines,</hi> that holy Order was allsoe soe happyly rooted in the whole countrey, and soe manie learned and holy men were bred and brought vp in the same, that the whole <hi>English</hi> Church was
<pb facs="13"/>
gouerned by the Professours thereof, and replenished with great store of SAINCTS of both sexes of the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictine</hi> familie, there being noe other <hi>Rule</hi> of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar life but S. BENEDICTS on foote in <hi>England</hi> for the space of aboue seauen hundred yeares after the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of it to the Christian fayth. Noe wonder then that the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Religion in <hi>England</hi> was the mother of soe manie and soe great SAINCTS. Their liues and of all others I haue endeauoured to sett forth briefly with as great care as I could, desiring thee for whose comfort I haue taken this paynes, to weigh the faults (yf anie thou chaunce to find) in the ballance of good will, and soe thou shalt not only encourage me to goe forward in this, and a greater worke then this, but allsoe oblige me to remayne thy friend, desiring no other reward for my labours but thy prayers vnto the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se glorious SAINCTS, that I may in the end be made participant of their heauenly companie.
