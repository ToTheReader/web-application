   <head>TO THE WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIPFVLL AND his worthy friend M. TI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOTHY CHALONER, <hi>a great louer of learning.</hi>

   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Hilostratus,</hi> a famous Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting somtimes to a Noble young man, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth these words: <hi>Cauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum esse ne temporis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciū sine fructu praetereat:</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
and <hi>Nazianzenus</hi> sayth, that our time beeing but short, and yet precious, is not carelesly, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be let slip; but that euerie man in his Place, and Calling, is to doe some good to the Countrie &amp; Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth wherein hee was borne. For which cause, I haue taken some paines in the publicatiō of these Aphorisms; a worke ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needfull to be known, and vnderstood, by all sorts of people: and as <hi>Leonardus Fucchius</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, the best worke that euer <hi>Hip.</hi> compiled;
<pb facs="4"/>
wishing that all Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Chirurgions, should carrie them in their bosoms: as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Tully,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Comedies of <hi>Terence, tanquam in sinu portare,</hi> &amp; to haue them at their fingers ends.</p>
   <p>These Aphorismes were first of all written in the Greek, and since translated into Latine by many excellent and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Physicians, and are dailie set forth with large Comments: which doth shew vnto vs their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and worthinesse. For a man may by them
<pb facs="5"/>
preserue himselfe from sicknesse being in health, and being sick cure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of sicknesse.</p>
   <p>Accept therfore I pray you of these Labours, which I for the benefit of my Country haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: which if you shall so do, I shall little esteem of the venemous teeth of anie carper. For, to you onely I present them as a token of my loue, &amp; affection, which I beare vnto you: not for many fauours which I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from you, but for your many vertues and
<pb facs="5"/>
loue of learning which is known to be in you. For (truly) I doe not knowe to whome bookes may better be presented, then to those that loue books, whereof I knowe you to haue manie; a great ritches to you, but little regarded with thousands of your rank. But I leaue to trouble you: and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing you as many hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py yeeres, as you haue vertues, I commit you to the Almightie his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
