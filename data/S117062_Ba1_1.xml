      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have bene often requested to translate Mr. Brightman vpon Daniel &amp; the Canticles into english, as he is already vpon the revelation. I have at length yeelded to doe one, being both short and pithie, leaving the other to such as have more store of gifts and leisure, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons best knowne to my selfe, which I must crave also to keep unto my selfe: although I confesse I would be gladde that all our english Churches should inioy the benefit of the godlie &amp; learned labours of such a worthie English mā (nay what if I should saie, an english prophet, as some learned beyond the seas have stiled him) for as or blessed Saviour saith, (and it was his owne lot and portion) a prophet is not without honour but in his owne country, and among his owne kindred. Marc. 6.4.</p>
   <p>I have seen indeed both Iesuits and Lutherans abroad, and also protestants at home, both in pulpits and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, barking and carping against this excellent and worthie man, but I spare and pitty them, not anie of them able to doe or speake as he hath done and spoken, and manie of them not worthie to cary his bookes after him.
<pb n="110" facs="56"/> It is farre more easie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>p at a worthie writer then to compile a booke like his, let them eyther mend his, which wilbe a hard talke for them, speak better, or hould their peace.</p>
   <p>He was indeed one of a thousand, great &amp; gracious manie wais both in life and in learninge, <hi>dum ea docuit quae fecit? &amp; ea fecit quae docuit, &amp; verba vertebat in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera.</hi> He taught that he did practise, and did practise that he taught, and so turned wordes into workes. He was a great Artist and a great linguist. He had good skill in all arts and tongues needfull for a compleat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, even in song also, (vocall musick being the best) till his more weightie studies cald him from the maydēs, to divinitie their mistresse, wherin he excelled and shined above manie of his fellowes, all that then lived with him in Queens Colledge in Cambridge, wherof he was a fellowe, doe very well knowe. He shined every waie, and was a Brightman indeed answerable to his name, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, <hi>vir splendidus,</hi> a bright man, in his life shining to all that conversed with him, and in his deep learning &amp; knowledge shining to all that heard his learned catechizinge, common places, and lectures in the colledge, or his sermons in the countrie in Bedford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Aquila non capit muscas.</hi> Eagle like he soareth aloft catching no flies but great and high matters; he doth not with the lambe wade in the shallow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s, obvious and playn places, but with the Elephant he swimmeth and helps other to swimme safely over the deepest and darkest places of the whole canonicall scriptures, as Iohns reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Salomons songe, and Daniels obscurest vision in 11.12.</p>
   <p>Some may think he did <hi>altum sapere</hi> and beare to high aboue his reach and capacitie, and therfore hee the
<pb n="111" facs="56"/> Austr. Lutheran applyeth the speach of Festus to Paul Act. 24. to him untruely, but those that did well know him, and the great measure of meeknes and humilitie that God had graced him withall, would not think that he did <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, as the Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e saith very elegantlie in that eloquent exhortation Rom. 12.3. <hi>Jmum humilitatis, sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum divinitatis,</hi> The depth of humilitie is the height of divinitie: the lower in or selves, the higher with God, as himselfe speaketh Esai, 57.15. though he be high and loftie and dwelleth in the highe and holie place, yet he wil dwell also with the contrite and humble spirit, &amp; vnto such wil he be a guide and teach them his wayes and counsels. Ps. 25.9.14.</p>
   <p>And therfore I doe not doubt, but God revealed much vnto him &amp; let him see a great deale more into these my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall &amp; darke passages, then manie other of his deere servants, that so he might reveal &amp; open them to others: for as he freely received so he freely gave.</p>
   <p>But whither will my love carry me? I refraine: his owne works shal praise him abundauntly; which because being in latin, the greatest part of our countrimen doe not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. I have made his short exposition of Daniel to speak english unto them, that none maie be deprived of the benefit of his godlie labours.</p>
   <p>It is pitie such a bright shining candle should be put under the bed or bushel, but to be set so as all may see &amp; enioy the light therof. Math. 5.15. He hath so cleered that pointe of the Iewes vocation, which the Apostle casteth a <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> Rom. 11.33. in these latter times after the overthrowe of their last &amp; greatest enemie the Turks, as I have not seene in anie writer the like. He goeth beyond the streine and against the streame of the most interpreters, who goe about for the most part to restreine
<pb n="112" facs="57"/> all in Daniel to the first comming of Christ and doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre all to Antiochus, or to the Romanes: which cannot be, for neither of them come to their endes in Iudea, or the glorious holie mountaine, as the Turk shal doe. Dan. 11.45.</p>
   <p>Daniel having in the former part of this chapter 11. laied downe their other enemies the Persians vers. 2. the Grecians, cheifly Alexander. vers. 3. and his 4 captaines succeeding verse 4. which came especially to two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall heades: the Lagidans in Egypt, whom he calleth the Kinges of the South, as standing South from Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea vers. 5. and the Seleucidans in Syria, whom he calleth the Kinges of the North, vers. 6. &amp;c. to the 36.</p>
   <p>Then and there he commeth to the three last enemies of the Iewes, the Romanes, which had clipped the winges of Antiochus in the 30. verse, till at the end their owne eagles winges were also clipped by the Saracens &amp; Turkes in vers. 40. the one like a dossing beast doe push sore at him, the other comming against him like a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde that cannot be resisted, overfloweth, beares and beates downe all before it, entreth into Iudaea, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious land, which had bene then a longe time the cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit of the world in the midst of their enemies, Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Persians, Grecians, Lagidans, Seleucidans, Romans, Saracens and now at this daie the Turkes, the last, though not the least of their adversaries, which shalbee troubled with the tydinges of the easterne and northerne Iewes conversion, which shal make him to march out furiously against them like another Iehu 2 king. 9.20. though not with like successe, but he shal com to his end there, in the holie land and glorious mountaine, and note shal help him, for who can help and hold him vp whom God wil hinder and cast downe?</p>
   <pb n="113" facs="57"/>
   <p>Then followethe joyfull returne and resurrection of the Iewes: who lay as dead for almost seventeen hundred yeares in chap. 12. which if it be not meant of them, there is litle comfort for them in the whole prophecy, which was the Prophets maine intention and principall drift and scope, <hi>Oculus adscopum,</hi> our eye must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at the mark and scope, if we mean to hit the white and right meaning, and so the Apostle Paul doth call their calling and receaving unto grace, life from the dead, Rom. 11.15. whereunto most sweetly agreeth the prophet Ezekiel from the 37. chapter. to the end of his prophecye in the last 12. chapters, first setting downe their conversion in the first 14. verses of the 37. where the dead and dry bones scattered come together agayne and live.</p>
   <p n="2">2ly the vnyting and joyning together againe the ten tribes with the two, from the 15. vers. to the end.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, the destruction of Gog, and all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the 38. and 39. chapters.</p>
   <p>Fourthly, and lastly, we have a heavenly new prophecie concerning the glorious and Christian Church of the Iewes, whereof Christ himself was the builder, in the 9 last chapters, beginning with a very solemne charge, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend attention, and a sweete carriage, and demeanour of all parts, inward and outward, as of hart, eyes, and eares. 40.4. And also concluding with the new and lasting name thereof, not Ierusalem, as of olde now antiquated, but <hi>Iehovah Shammah,</hi> the Lord is and will be there for ever, as being the truth of the former type, represented by the temple, Psalm 132.14. This is my rest for ever, here will I dwell, for I have desired it.</p>
   <p>Thus have I briefly in a word epitomised and abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this learned exposition for thee: He shall now speak unto thee in thine owne mothers tongue and native lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. He will bring that to thine eares, which happily
<pb n="114" facs="58"/> thou didst never heare of before: Make much of such faithfull expositours, and praie to God to increase the number of such learned interpreters, as may help thee to see and vnderstand such mysticall visions and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, and that he would in his due time bring downe those two mayne enemies of his gospell and his people, the Romane Antichrist in his old Rome, and the easterne Gog and Magog in his new Rome or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, who would soon fall of his owne Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane ponderous weight, if he were not supported by Romishe idolatrie: And let not vs protestants by our scandalous lives and conversations be anie hinderaunce to the calling and comming on of our farre distant brethren the Iewes, but help forward, what we maie their effectuall vocation, by frequent and fervent prayer for them, and dayly crucifying of sin, which crucified the Lord of glorie both theirs and ours, and so together with joynt consent set forth the purity of Gods worship: and celebrate his prayses unto the full and finall end and consummation of all thinges.</p>
