   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, seeing in the few yeeres that I haue exercised Physicke at the Baths, the yeerely concourse in the Spring, and Fall, of people of all sorts, and from all parts of this Kingdome, to those famous Waters, and the little benefit that many after great expence and trouble receiue thereby: I was induced to publish this ensuing Treatise, wherein I haue very briefely shewed the nature and efficacie of those Waters, touched the causes that many finde not comfort, but oftentimes rather hurt, that resort to them; with such aduertisements concerning the vse of the said Waters: which if they be rightly obserued, I am perswaded, few will hereafter complaine that they haue beene at the Baths in vaine, and so the Waters regaine that esteeme which in respect of their singular Vertues they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of. But here you must take from me this one aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement, which is, <hi>That Sickenesse is a Symptome of Sinne:</hi> And therefore first, <hi>Poenitentiam agendo,</hi> before your departure from home, make peace betwixt God and your conscience, and then repaire to the Baths, <hi>quò te faustum ducat, atque sanum reducat, qui solus id potest.</hi> Vale.</p>
