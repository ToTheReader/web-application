      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bin reported (Right Honourable and my verie good Lorde) and is founde true of al men, that the Bee, when she hath gathered her hony, flieth immediatly to the hiue, wher she leueth the same, as in the place of saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde for her fruite, and as a gaine of her labour: whose paine as it is commended of al, so also is it diligently folowed but of a few, who whilest they come to the sweete flowers and wise sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the worde of God, doe but basely reade and negligently consider the same, whereas they shoulde drawe and sucke out, yea, and laye vp euen with the Bee, to their best vse, most pleasant hony. And this they should doe, not onely for themselues, but also for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For huing to the profite of the Church of God, they imparie their labours to the benefite there of, yea besides the foode to their own soules, other are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by them: as amongst other (Right honorable) Maister Michael Cope, Preacher of the word of God
<pb facs="348"/>
in Geneua, deserued not the least praise, who painfully trauelling in the Prouerbes of Solomon, did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read them for his owne delight, but also sucked out of euerie flower of the same Garden, most sweete ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: which beeing faithfully gathered and disposed in the Hiue, he left as a fruite of his labour to al posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for al the godly to be partakers of. Now for that it is not the gift of euery man to driue the Hiue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bee gathereth her honie (although I knowe that many can, amongest whome your honour may bee equal with the best) yet because it was preached, and then written in the Frenche tongue, which most vnderstande not, I thought it vnmeete, that so sweete a nourishment should be with holden from my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie men: &amp; therfore haue bin bold vnder your honors protection to communicate it as wel as I coulde for their profite and commoditie, which I am bolde the rather to dedicate to your honour; because you loue those that liue to other; because you are a Patron, &amp; so haue shewed yourselfe of al honest labors, who albeit you vnderstande the tongue, yet are you glad to haue it made known vnto others. These things cōsidered, &amp; for that also I haue receiued benefit heretofore at your honours hands, I thought it my bounden duetie, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the translation of this Comentarie vpon the Prouerbes of the wise King Solomō to your honor: assuring my selfe, that your care wil be no lesse in the protecting of so good a woorke, then there shal happen profite to the wise reader thereof: for what woulde any man desire for the full accomplishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of knowledge, belonging to all estates, that
<pb facs="348"/>
is not handled in the Prouerbes? Or what woulde he desire for his profit, that is not cōteined in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbes? for therin shal euerie man finde, from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to the lowest, his duetie prescribed most notably, as for Kinges, godlinesse, iustice and mercy: for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates and Iudges, wisedome and true dealing: for rich men, liberalitie to the poore: againe, that the poore be contented with his estate, without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring: to be short, he teacheth the husbande fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: the wife, obedience: children, reuerence: seruants, diligence: finally, he setteth downe a punishment for the proude, a reward for the lowlie, a dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state for scorners and disdainers of the word of God: the life of a lier altogether vnlawful: the vsurer, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, and vnchast, cleane condemned. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, he exhorteth that the merciful, liberal, and wel doers, be imitated and folowed: al which and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande more then I am able to repeate, as they are most notably set downe by the wise King Solomon, so are they verie learnedly, and most plainely declared by Maister Cope. Wherefore (Right honourable) since that the maiestie of the matter is so great, and the wisdom of the wise man so vnsearchable: I trust your Lordship wil beare with my rudenesse, and supporte mine endeuour in publishing and making manifest this simple translation to al men. And although I am not a translator of suche rypenesse in iudgement, and perfection in style, as the matter requireth, and as I my selfe coulde haue wished: notwithstanding, I hope I haue rendered it at the leaste, sense for sense: and where the Frenche and our tongue doe
<pb facs="349"/>
agree, verbatim; that out of the wordes, one may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the sense; and out of the sense the reason, and so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the trueth: most humblie beseeching your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to take in good part this my rude labour &amp; bold enterprise, the which if it shal please your honour of your accustomed clemencie to doe, you shal not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incourage me to greater thinges, but also shew yourselfe a comfort to al the godly. And thus beeing loth to offend your honour by tediousnes, or to withhold you from your graue &amp; most waightie affayres, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech the Almightie God by Iesus Christ our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, long to preserue your honour in health, wealth, and godlinesse, to the glorie of his name, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Church, &amp; good of this our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale &amp; countrie, &amp; to your own euerlasting comforte in him. Amen.</p>
