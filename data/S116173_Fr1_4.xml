   <sp>
      <speaker>Author.</speaker>
      <l>AS I did musing lie, with sundrie thoughtes opprest,</l>
      <l>Séeking to salue my carefull minde, of paine to be redrest:</l>
      <l>And pondring how my youth full ydlely I had spent,</l>
      <l>In scilence only wrapped vp, my minde it did torment.</l>
      <l>From darknesse vnto lyght I thought it best to call,</l>
      <l>By setting forth some little booke which profite might vs all.</l>
      <l>And that I did intende is brought now to effect.</l>
      <l>At ydle houres I did it penne as time would me direct.</l>
      <l>The worke you plainely sée, friende Printer what it is,</l>
      <l>Declare if printing it deserue, and what there is amis.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Printer.</speaker>
      <l>Your meaning I perceyue, your purpose I allowe,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="5"/>In that you are so diligent to prosecute your vowe.</l>
      <l>And as in ages all, those haue their prayses due,</l>
      <l>Which painfully do runne their race, and idlenesse eschue:</l>
      <l>So can I not mislyke your noble enterprise:</l>
      <l>Which seeke to helpe your countreymen, with this your fyne deuise.</l>
      <l>But shall I tell you playne, herein what is my mynde?</l>
      <l>Me thinke this worke was done before, and it in print I fynde:</l>
      <l>For <hi>Esope</hi> (as you knowe,) already englisht is:</l>
      <l>And what doth yours, but taste of him? naught do I sée but his.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Author.</speaker>
      <l>This briefly vnderstande, that <hi>Esope</hi> is not last</l>
      <l>In this my booke, nor only he alone doth stande agast:</l>
      <l>But sundry writers else aboute him here do stande,</l>
      <l>Both wittie, learned, eloquent.
<pb facs="5"/>
as hath ben tane in hande.</l>
      <l>Besides, if well you marke, comparyng that with myne,</l>
      <l>It is as neare as East to Weast, and drosse to Syluer fine.</l>
      <l>Vncomely tales in that are founde, and most absurde to reade,</l>
      <l>Of reason voyde, of mirth bereft, to no good ende they leade,</l>
      <l>No head nor foote in them is had, but set confusedly,</l>
      <l>On <hi>Esope</hi> falsly forged tales, what man can it denye?</l>
      <l>As in the lyfe of <hi>Xanthus</hi> wyfe, and others he doth write</l>
      <l>So rudely, falsly, foolishly, how then should this delite?</l>
      <l>Of <hi>Esope</hi> that which I do write, the <hi>Greeke</hi> text doth allowe,</l>
      <l>Dissenting cleane from that you thinke, let this content you nowe.</l>
      <l>In common place it is reduced, applying as I might,</l>
      <l>So truely, vnto euery thing his proper place and right.</l>
      <l>From nintéene authors else, I haue selected out,</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="6"/>Their fine deuise, their sayings wise, their pleasant déedes and stout.</l>
      <l>The truth hereof you heare, first trie, then iudgement geue:</l>
      <l>If contrary you finde to this then do not me beleue.</l>
   </sp>
   <sp>
      <speaker>Printer.</speaker>
      <l>I haue compared since your doings vnto his,</l>
      <l>And contrarie to that I thought, I finde that now it is:</l>
      <l>Besides vncomely tales, and falsly forged fables,</l>
      <l>Wherewith his booke replenisht is, perceyue I many bables.</l>
      <l>For yours and his do farre in euery case dissent,</l>
      <l>I sée from whome you do deriue, your doings and intents.</l>
      <l>To aunswere your demaund full readie am I prest,</l>
      <l>And will hereafter when you list, accomplish your request.</l>
