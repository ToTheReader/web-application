If that hurtfull curiosity were mortified learned men now fearinge that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor would be boulder to wright and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish their Godly iudgments, touching points in cōtrouersy among other I heare of a more larg &amp; learned treatise of this point which no doubt the authour will publish in time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for him if cursous heads itching eares, and wanton tongues do not hinder.
