   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>WIse was the painter in his amorous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, who in pourtraying out the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Venus,</hi> drew her picture with so great arte, sleight, and significant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of her naturall blazon, as the pourtraict of her foreparts all ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowed with the porch where she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in, <hi>posteriora eius</hi> on the back, being only seene go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Temple, presented an abstract to the beholders of so rare excellencie, as the type of the prototypon by signes and symptons seemed to say: Giue back enamorades of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies bewties: seeke not to see the face of the peerelesse: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your curious eyes with this, which though the meanest part of the delightfull obiect, yet of that perfection, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you may behold the works of Dame Nature to be so farre aboue reasons reach, as wit and arte should skip beyond their skill, if they should attempt to set forth the worthiest parts of this goddesse paragon sance pere. And yet was <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> but a very strumpet: a common queane, fitter for <hi>Vulcane</hi> the black Smith, then for <hi>Mars</hi> the Captayne, and more admired at, talked of and followed for her want on tricks, insatiable lust, and shape to frame an eye to vice, then for any complement all perfection to be found in the purest parts of her filthie carcasse, or lineaments of her vading, though seeming faire sweete blesfull cheekes, shrowded in the auriflame of carnation dye, dropt in euery line mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall with argent and Gules, milke white and scarlet red.</p>
   <p>This I haue sayd, to bring into discourse the matter whereupon I meane to treate: and whereunto the treatise
<pb n="*" facs="3"/>
following doth wholy tend in chiefe, as intituled: <hi>A sparing discouery of our English Iesuites, and of Father</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>proceedings, vnder pretence of promoting the Catholick faith in England,</hi> &amp;c. For if wise were <hi>Apel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> or whosoeuer the Paynter was, in conueighing of his pensill, by such cunning to shew <hi>Venus</hi> on the back, as all men did deeme her face, and foreparts to be of such exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site perfection, as impossible by arte to counterfeit her beauty, and therefore in policie thought it meetest to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile her in a Temple: this glimpse of her seeming glory, being the only way to procure alonging desire of a full view to be had of her; a loue in such fondlings, kernes, lobcocks, and lewde priuadoes as had neuer seene her, and a conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what soeuer was amisse in her, or might breede lothsomnes in her followers: Then sure no fooles were the first Panegyricks of the Iesuites prayses in the vse of their wits, heads, hands, and pennes; by setting forth to the worlds theater in many strange proiects, antique stewes and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes, the hinder parts of the Iesuiticall perfection, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out the fore-parts <hi>(scil.</hi> their drifts, practises, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises which are first in intention and framing of plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes) ouershadowed with hypocriticall zeale pharisaicall pretence, and catholick shew of so true religion, as impossible for any one to equall them in any degree of perfection: whereas in very deede they are men of the most corrupt manners, imperfect life, and stayne of religion, that liue in the Cathol. Rom. Church this day, as this ensuing discourse will in part declare.</p>
   <p>And yet they stand so much vpon their pumptoes in the euerweyn'd conceit of their puritanian perfection, partly by meanes of fame, which following false reports hath made them famous: partly by folly, which hath made their follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers dote Pigmaleon-like vpon their shrines, and shadowes of vertue and deuotion; and partly, (and most of all) by cousening policy in the paynter, or her aults of their blazon, in setting forth a counterfeit of morall perfection, concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="*" facs="3"/>
the essentials of christian Cathol. religious pietie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these are not in them to be found. Insomuch as one (and he their chiefe Polypragmon) Father <hi>Parsons</hi> by name, scorneth to haue any secular Priests witnesse of the Iesuiticall worthinesse, and of his owne worthie deserts: but thinketh it inough to merit the honor, point of all excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, worth, praise, and perfection, by possessing the minds of the <hi>mobile vulgus</hi> with an opinion of their hinder parts, to be such as themselues are (forsooth) peerelesse, matchlesse, and none to be compared with the meanest puny father of their societie. And hereupon in one of his letters like a prowde <hi>Nemrod,</hi> taking vpon him to be the holy Apostles peere (if not aboue him) he writes, and in this manner: What (sayth he) <hi>an indigemus iam cōmendatitijs lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris: an non vos estis literae nostrae?</hi> who are priests and laborers in Gods Vineyard by our hands, and without our helps, and labors, and loue towards you, you neuer had bin such; no, nor these that are our most contradicters or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligners there &amp;c. Least therefore we should but incurre a scoffing contempt, and receiue but a flap with a foxtaile for commending of these peerelesse perfectiues: for my part I will promise good Father <hi>Parsons</hi> faithfully, that hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he shall neuer haue my worthlesse commends, nor any of his remayning Iesuites. And further, in the same letter he accounts the secular priests ingratefull, for not applauding to their owne destruction, contempt of priesthood, abuse of Pope, and Prince, and ruyne of all Catholicks, and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick religion, in prowdly arrogating to his societie that all we haue, comes from them. Which is as false, as contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can make it: for all their credit, and what else they haue worth the naming, commeth from the secular cleargie and priestly prerogatiue. So then, this admonition of his giuen (though with many absurdities) is to be taken for a gentle caueat for all reuerend priests, and other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, to beware how euer they admit, accept, or receiue from henceforth any fauour at a Iesuites hand; or yeeld
<pb n="*" facs="4"/>
them any countenance, or affoord them any furtherance in attayning to any place, office, or calling of credit, gayne, or other aduauncement: being sure by the former to be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayded euer after with disgracefull speeches, making a mountayne of a molehill (if any good be gotten by their meanes:) and by the latter, as certayne to make a rod for their owne tailes (as the tearme goeth) lesse or more sharp, agreeing to the qualitie of the profit, or preferment that any one shall enfeoffe, enrich, or possesse a Iesuite with there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And by both manifest it is, that whether you giue any thing to, or receiue any thing from them: the very gift, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, contract, bargaine, condition, familiaritie, or act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling with them; is a plague infectiue, a poyson reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilesse, and a pitch that floods of watery teares (nay what if I sayd bloudy) will not wash away: so dangerous are their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntments and charme. For giue them but an inch, and they will take an ell. Admit them to parlee, and straight they fall to practise. Affoord them but a fauor in ciuill cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, and they incroch vpon a freedome by absolute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And once comply, comport, combine your selfe with them; and they pray vpon you. Aliene, sequester, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynt your selfe once from them, after acquaintance made with them, and you are sure to be deuoured by them: their baytes of calling to their lure are so sweete: their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings in giuing of gorges for off castings, so cruell, <hi>(gladij enim ancipites linguae eorum:)</hi> and their familiaritie so fatall, as like <hi>Seians</hi> iade they are infortunate, mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, and worke the heauie downe-fall of those that deale with them. So as some haue wished that those priests who first (of meere charity I dare say) procured and were meanes of the Iesuites comming into <hi>England,</hi> as also of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment to secular priests offices in the same: had bought their absence with their dearest bloud out of the one, and the other, the English Colledges, and the English Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But seeing the dismall dayes of our heauie calamities haue calculated to our hard fortunes, to bring those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="*" facs="4"/>
vs that should augment our miseries: Let Father <hi>Parsons</hi> and his associates from henceforth spare their pennes, and (if they please) their liplabor besides, from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting our witnes of their good names; and receiue with gratefull minds this testimony ensuing, by a discourse of their owne words, acts, and proceedings, as letters <hi>commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datitiats</hi> of the vnsauory fruits of their lucklesse labors. And because their face and foreparts (vnderstood by their intention, which should make their acts perfect indeed: for <hi>intentio non actus perficit actum)</hi> are masqued with a vaile of policie in externall shew of pietie, so as the ignorant sort of their foolish Enamorades haue nothing but their backs, or <hi>posteriora,</hi> that is, the fruits of their labors to iudge them by: therefore say I, by a demonstration <hi>à po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriori,</hi> or of the effects, the testimony of their owne hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writings and deedes done, will we, or nill we, will be such let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of commendations for them, and on their behalfe, as we are vnwilling to open, were we not forced thereunto; their friends will be sory (for their aduersaries will put them thereby to their trials:) Angels will blush at them: feendes will laugh them to scorne: and they themselues (if any grace, remorse, or shame be in them) will hide both their backs and faces for euer hereafter: neuer vaunt of their vertue, of their learning, of their wisedome, of their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of their graces: neuer pluck vp their plumes againe, neuer seeke to ouerpearke, ouercrow, ouertop their betters, their ancients, their independents, of whom they do &amp; must depend in their priestly function, their highest dignities, their whole authoritie, and the chiefe flower of their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: spite of their pride, maugre their malice, though Don Lucifer be their Captaine.</p>
   <p>I might (gentle Reader, deare Cathol. Engl. Recusants, of all degrees and both sexes) heere enlarge my selfe with a long discourse of the Iesuites to too great impietie by appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the example brought out of the picture of <hi>Venus:</hi> what foule, loathsome, and fearefull vices are amongst
<pb n="*" facs="5"/>
them, pharisaically ouershadowed with a pretence of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious zeale. I could here touch 20. sundry persons in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner, if confession-reuealers, if murders, if extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if cousenage, if what not more dreadfull offences worse then these (if worse may be) can touch them; and with wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of speciall credit, with more odious crimes then euer they can iustly lay (as most falsely, iniuriously, and vniustly they haue already layd them) to any of these secular priests charge: who now do stand in opposition against them. I could here set downe in a positiue discourse an historie of a great part of their whole life, euen from the beginning of <hi>Ignatius Layola</hi> a Span. Captain their first founder, to this present hower; all within one age of a man: how they are gone from their first institution, and haue corrupted and broken the rules of their order or societie: for they are so farre out of all order, as they must needes haue a new name, <hi>scz.</hi> to be called the Fathers of the societie (euen as the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes haue such a like name) scorning to be called or sayd to be of the order of this, or that man, as the <hi>Benedictines</hi> are of the order of <hi>S. Bennet:</hi> the <hi>Dominicans</hi> of <hi>S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicks</hi> order: the <hi>Franciscanes</hi> of <hi>S. Francis,</hi> because the Iesuites are of the societie (forsooth) or fellowship, and that of no meaner person then Christ Iesus: how of all other religious orders (for religious they would be counted, though not of or in any order) they haue the soonest failed and fallen from all religious pietie in generall (for some of them no doubt are good men in speciall, but I doubt those are not Engl.) of any one order of religion that euer was confirmed (as theirs was) to this day. How many signes, demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and morall certainties there are, that their best dayes are past: their rare, memorable, and worthie fame, at the highest pitch: their haughtie-aspiring-towring-wits at a shamefull <hi>non plus:</hi> their prowde-ambitious-mounting-thoughts in the next turne to a Luciferian fall. I might take occasion heere to descry in the anatomy lecture of the Iesuiticall ghosts, the diuersitie of such wicked spirits, as
<pb n="*" facs="5"/>
transforming themselues into angels of light, leade more soules to hell with them, then the feends of most vglie shape appearing in their owne proper colours. I might from hence deduct a triple alphabet intire of Machiuilian practises v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Iesuites, setting downe their rules atheall in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their platforme layd for a perpetuity of their intended gouernment despoticon, and mock-weale publick oligar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall: how, when, amongst whom, and by whom, this &amp; that stratageme is to be practised: what maximes, axiomaes, or rules are generall or common to all: and which are speciall, and but proper to some in particular: how that <hi>vtiscientia, omnia ordine ad Deum, omnia propter bonum publ. societ. omnia pro tempore nihil pro veritate,</hi> with many the like, makes (by their interpretation) all lying, periury, swearing, for swearing, murther, incest, sacriledge, simony, idolatry, and whatsoeuer else, lawfull, profitable, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable &amp; necessary. How this polititian or state-father is to be imployed in Princes Courts as a lieger for aduice: how to canton a Kingdome: how to refine a Monarchie into the forme of a Prouince: how to insinuate himselfe in proper person or by his agents into his Soueraignes fauour, or some neerest about the seate of Maiesty, to know all the secrets of the land: how to alien the mindes of most loyall subiects, and draw them to consent to what vnnaturall inuasion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, conspiracie, riot, or what else, and when, and as he pleaseth: how to know the occurrents of chance and change in state affaires: and when and how to colour treacheries, treasons, and popular tumults, vnder glorious stiles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths, and zealous actions. I might here dilate vpon the manifold iniuries, calumnies, and slaunders, breathed out by them against Popes and Princes, against the Cathol. Rom Church and common wealth of <hi>England:</hi> nay of euery Christian Kingdome: against the Mother Citie, where stands inuiolate the fortresse of our faith and religion: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all monasticall and religious orders: against the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Clergie, and especially Seminary Priests: against all
<pb n="*" facs="6"/>
noble and generous blouds, titles, honors, and princely prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues from the regall Throne of Maiestie to the seate of worship against the right of inheritance to armes, lands, and honors, euen from the Soueraigne to the Freeholder or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in fee simple of all degrees: against all and euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, part, and member of the publick weale, molested, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungered, infested by them. I might here set downe the finall conclusions of their intention, for, and to what end, they do these things: <hi>scil.</hi> to aduance themselues, and pull downe all that are not they. For this cause it is that all their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant crowes, are milke white doues: their black birds, swannes: their haggardhawkes, gentle fawcons of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. For this cause it is that their sots are Salomons: their preuadoes, saincts: their silents, politicks: and all amongst them rare, matchlesse, peerelesse. For this cause it is, that they haue a more neere familiaritie with God, greater skill, and more aboundance of grace giuen them, for edifying, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting, and instructing of soules, then any other Priest. For this cause it is that they dare presume to call the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe an heretick: the Kings of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates: and to giue her Maiestie and the State heere names so odious, as too oft it is once to repeate them after them. No maruaile then if the secular afflicted Priests be subiect to their torturing toongs in all extreamenes that may be thought vpon. For this cause it is that they (the Spanish faction I meane) haue labored these 30. yeers space and vpward (for so long it is since the Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> came out by the Iesuiticall humorists procurement) for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing her Maiestie of her life, Kingdome, Crowne, and all at once: for setting this flourishing common wealth on fier and flame: for establishing their owne Allobrogiall conceited soueraignty, vnder pretence of restoring this whole Ile to the auncient Cathol. Rom. faith and Religion. For this cause it is, that no Religion, deuotion, pietie, charitie, no nor any face of a true reformed Cathol. Church (as they tearme it) must be spoken of, or thought to be any where, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="*" facs="6"/>
the Donatistiall-Africanian-Spanish-Iesuites: No not in <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe, without the Iesuites residence were any true religion to be found. For this cause it is, that all secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Priests or other Catholicks must be censured, iudged, and condemned by these arrogant Iesuites for irreligious malecontents, atheall polititians, apostataes: and what not vile tearmes are giuen vnto them, that fauour not, nay, that will not applaude, further, and sweare to the Ladies <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes</hi> title to the English Crowne: or that will seeme any way to defend, wish, or shew any fauour in their poore and worthles conceits, (as what other opinion can afflicted sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects haue) to the line of King <hi>Henry</hi> the seauenth, or any one of the bloud royall of our owne Nation, borne and liuing within the Ile of <hi>Albion.</hi> For this cause it is, that the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Priests must be holden for men infamous, detected of most notorious vices, scandales, passionate, ignorant, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, and vnfit for gouernment. For this cause it is that an innouate or new authoritie must be gotten and giuen to one Maister <hi>George Blackwell,</hi> (a man by so much the more fit for to serue their turne, by how much as he is the most vnfit of an 100. secular Priests within the Realme, for the purpose in shew pretended by them) for to extend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> with a premuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall stile and title of regall dignity, derogating as well to the see Apostolick, as to the seate of Maiesty. And yet he thus authorized standeth at the deuotion of the Iesuites to runne and turne like a lackey boy in a french Ioupe, and is to attend on his good Lord and Maister Fa. <hi>Garnets</hi> will and pleasure, being but aduaunced to the dignitie, honor, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a viceroy, nay but of a viceregent, nay but of a vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>president, nay but of a viceprotonotary, nay but of a viceui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridary: nay but of a meere spirituall rackmaster at the most. For he hath nothing to do with any Iesuite, among whom there is a subordinate authoritie by degrees ascendent euen to Emperour <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> or their Generall; but is at the commaund of the meanest puny father amongst them,
<pb n="*" facs="7"/>
to strike with ecclesiasticall censure, whomsoeuer any of them willhaue smitten downe: and therefore he must needs be said to be in some inferior calling vnder them, as the word Archpriest importeth. For the meanest Iesuit (though a lay brother) being accounted far better, and to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any ordinary Seminary, or secular priest; it followeth then, that any Iesuite priest is to be preferred before an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary secul. priest, that is to say, before an Archpriest or chief maister &amp; head-priest ouer the rest of the seculars. For this cause it is, that the seeming to take notice of the Iesuits falshood, treacheries, &amp; treasons against the Cathol. Church, and commonwelth, intended by institution of this new puritanianlike superintendency, or authority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon resisting it (as the secular priests did, first by non-accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of him, and then by appealing from him) is tearmed schisme, disobedience, disloyaltie, rebellion, and what not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, committed against Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> or <hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> (for the words schisme, rebellion, &amp;c. must needs haue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to some supreme Maiestie) and seeing the secular priests haue only (if against any) schismatiz'd &amp; rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>M. Geor. Blackwell</hi> and his Iesus masters: <hi>ergo</hi> by necessary sequel it must ensue; that he is the Pope in respect of the schism, &amp; the Prince in respect of the rebellion incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and committed against him. But then withal I do infer, that he is an absurd vsurper and traitor to them both alike, by his dotage in suffering such vaine Iesuiticall applauses to his owne destruction. For this cause it is, that he the said <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> must by the Prouinciall, or other superior or inferior Iesuits, commaund, excommunicate, suspend, and take away faculties from what priest they please; yea, and their goodnames besides. Nay which is not more cruell, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall, barbarous, &amp; monstrous, then childish, ridiculous, peeuish, &amp; indiscrete, void of all wit, sense, learning, religion, conscience, ciuility, humanity, or honesty; he must and doth forbid men to defend their good names, to say, or thinke they are wronged by him, or the Iesuits: to seeke for any iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:

George Blackwell</hi> suspend, inhibite, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate, at a Iesuites pleasure. For this cause it is: that all manner of bookes, writings, or other passages of speech are contemned and condemned that fauor not <hi>Fa. Parsons</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularitie in his bookes of titles, or his treasons and slanders against our soueraigne and state in the late Bull of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication 1588 set out against her Maiestie &amp;c. or other rayling bookes of <hi>Philopater,</hi> the scribe, the wardword (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating to secular priests in sundry places) especially his high counsell of Reformation &amp;c. For this cause none but Span. and Iesuites are secretly nominated to rule the roast in <hi>England,</hi> vpon the pretended Span. inuasion for resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of religion: all the english that are not Iesuits being but fooles or atheists, and libertines, vnfit for gouernment.

For this cause it is, that <hi>Fa.
