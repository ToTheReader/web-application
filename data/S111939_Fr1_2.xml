   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>AGainst this Popish and trayterous defense of the proude <hi>Censures,</hi> giuen vpon <hi>Master Charkes</hi> and <hi>M. Hanmers</hi> bookes, there hath bene alreadie set forth an answere, conteining a maintenaunce of the creditte of those excellent Ministers, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Gods Church, which this malitious slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hath sought to deface (for staie of the simple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) till <hi>Master Charkes</hi> booke come forth. There hath also bene printed and set forth by <hi>Doctor Fulke</hi> a briefe confutation of sundrie cauills and quarrel vttered by diuerse Papists against his writinges, and special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by this <hi>Censurer</hi> in this his booke of defense, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by some parte of his vnhonest dealing is displayed, to the discredite of this defender, and to the shame of all Papists. Neuerthelesse, vnderstanding that <hi>Master Charke</hi> is not minded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> set forth his answere, (although he haue it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> written) before this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> his wholl booke, as he promiseth; I haue thought it not amisse, to write a shorte treatis for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> the matters of doctrine espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which are in controuersie betweene <hi>M. Charke</hi> and the <hi>Censurer,</hi> either omitting, or but breiflie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the points handled more at large in the two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> books. Neither do I thinke <hi>M. Charkes</hi> stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be misliked, for diuerse causes: First, to auoyd confusion, which might ensue, if the defender should replic vpon his answere to the first parte, before the confutation of the second parte were finished, &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished:
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
Secondlie to auoyd misunderstanding: for that diuerse pointes touched in the first parte, may be more at large, and otherwise handled in the latter parte, vpon vew whereof <hi>Master Charke</hi> would change his answere. And last of all, lest replying, and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon the first parte, might be occasion that the latter parte should neuer be handled. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and some other, perhaps better knowne vnto him-selfe, indifferent readers may gather, that it is expedient for him to staie, vntill he see the wholl charge of the aduersarie, and then more orderly and seasonablie he may publish his answere altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
   <p>But now to the purpose taken inhande. Three tall fellowes step forth vpon this bulwarke of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense: the <hi>Corrector</hi> of the printe: the <hi>setter forth</hi> of the booke: and the graunde Captaine <hi>defender</hi> himselfe.</p>
   <p>The <hi>Corrector</hi> commeth forth with his parte, <hi>to stoppe a gappe, or emptie place of a page, with the reall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap> of a nowne Heretike: and that presuming</hi> (as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>) <hi>without the authors knowledge:</hi> to wise a man belike to be made priuie of such gramaticall trifles. But whereas he weeneth that <hi>by reading his authors trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, a man shall see the moste points verified in Master Charke and his companions,</hi> he is fouly beguiled. For there is no wise man, but seeth all the pointes of his newlie deuised declension throughly verified in his author and his Complices: who hath shewed himselfe to be, not in one, but in all cases, a proude maleperte Lyar, and an obstinate seditious Atheist: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> hereunto an impudent heretike, and a malitious traytor. And if any man be so simple, that he cannot yet perfectlie be holde all these pointes in his owne treatise, yet in the answeres, and confutations thereof, he that will not acknowledge them to be verified in him, is like to proue a nowne of the same declension with him. Thus the Owlie <hi>Corrector</hi> hauing shotte his bolte out of the
<pb n="3" facs="3"/>
bulwarke, which by euil happe of a contrarie winde is caried backe against him selfe, and his owne freinds, retireth into a corner, and doth no more appeare, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that some notes of his negligence, here and there bewraying him, do declare that this was not the first time that he was ouerseene in his life, &amp; that he should haue done his Master better seruise, if he had imploied the time he spent in deuising this grammatication, in being occupied more diligentlie about his office of <hi>Correction.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The <hi>setter forth of this booke</hi> hath the next place, who writing an epistle to <hi>Master Charke, minister,</hi> as he termeth him, and as he is indeede, of the Church of god in England, vnder colour of expostulation of some particuler matters, concerning the person of <hi>M. Charke</hi> taketh occasion to be a setter forth, not onelie of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious &amp; slaunderous booke against the Church, but also of moste spitefull accusations against the prince, and Magistrates of the realme: a sin the particuler vew of this epistle shall moste manifestlie appeare.</p>
   <p>First therefore he excuseth the long delaie of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth this defense of the <hi>Censure,</hi> which hath beene deferred more moneths, then the <hi>Censure</hi> was daies in writing, <hi>vpon such cause as is easie to iudge, and speciallie to Master Charke, which for the moste parte is priuie to the same.</hi> The meaning is, that the author is so quicke a dispatcher of his matters, partely by meanes of the weakenes of our cause, partelie by singuler dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie of his owne wit and learning, that <hi>hauing fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed his Censure in eight or nine daies space at the moste,</hi> he coulde also in like proportionable time haue accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished his defense, if he had not by the cause preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, beene stayed or interrupted. And here the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is much beholding to the <hi>setter forth,</hi> that doth so cunninglie commende his facultie in expedition of such writings: which in a Papist must needes be an argument of great and wonderfull promptnes, both
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
of wit &amp; learning, though in a protestant it be gyrded at by the author him-selfe, with a scorneful reproche of rashnes and ignorance. But what is the cause, trowe ye, that hath stopped the force of these flowing streames of the authors eloquent style, that in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny monethes he hath not fullfilled that course, which without impediment he had beene able to haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched almost in as fewe daies. <hi>Euerie one</hi> (sayth he) <hi>may imagine how difficult a thing it is in England, for a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike man, to write any booke: where neyther libertie, nor rest, nor librarie, nor conference, nor being is permitted.</hi> But I praie you sir (if I may be so bolde to aske you) what greater libertie, rest, lybrarie, conference, or being, had your Catholike author in contriuing his <hi>Censure,</hi> which he wanted in writing his defense? Or rather what cause had he to complaine of the difficultie of the tymes, which with such facultie, in so shorte a tyme, could performe so greate and waightie a peece of worke, as by his owne iudgement (who you know is nothing partial in his owne cause) deserued to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the honorable name of a <hi>Censure?</hi> vnles perhaps you thinke, that either the Prince, her Councell, or the Cleargie of the realme, should haue inuited him to write against the religion of God, and the state of the realme, with promis of libertie, rest, librarie, and all other thinges, the lacke whereof you pretend to haue hindred him.</p>
   <p>And yet whatsoeuer you say in generall, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse in particuler, that all difficulties notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the author had, soone after <hi>M. Charkes</hi> replie to his <hi>Censure,</hi> in greate parte dispatched his defense readie for the printe, but that by misaduenture your seditious printe was discouered, and taken <hi>with many things printed, or in printing, concerning your defense of trueth and equitie, against his falshoode, and violent oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi> That you speake against <hi>M. Charkes</hi> falshoode, it is lawful for you to renew, if you can discouer any
<pb n="5" facs="4"/>
committed by him. As for his <hi>violent oppressions,</hi> being a man of noe power or authority out of the Church, al may know how vainly you charge him, or rather how lewdlie in speaking to him, you speake of the lawful proceedings of the Prince, and all her magistrates, against Popish traytors, terming them no bettet then <hi>violent oppressions,</hi> when God knoweth, you haue but in a few yet tasted of most iust condemnations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions. Oflike stomach and style it is, that you say, <hi>the same print was so long sought, and much feared by him.</hi> By like he thought that your printe being taken, you had noe meane to publish your authors defense a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: as though you haue not printers enow in places beyonde the sea. How daungerous an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne printe within the lande may be to the state, if it be abused by seditious persons, no man of meane vnderstanding can be ignorant: and therefore mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell not if the magistrates haue beene carefull, to search for it, and diligentlie to suppresse it being founde.</p>
   <p>But of this disturbance (as you tell vs) had like to haue come a greate losse: for the author had almost giuen ouer his enterprise of defense, not onely vpon these difficulties alleadged, but also <hi>because Master Charkes replie did seeme sufficientlie to answere it selfe.</hi> A pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull case, but how did the replie answere it selfe so sufficientlie? He telleth vs, <hi>it was so obscure in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as moste men without the Censure might not vnderstande it.</hi> Admit it were so: is the obscuritie of a replie, a sufficient answere to it selfe? but why might not he that could not vnderstande it, haue recourse to the <hi>Censure,</hi> whereunto his replie had relation? Then he answereth for a second reason: <hi>It was so weake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as it needed litle confutation of others.</hi> This will best appeare by the authors doughtie defense, when both are compared, and examined together. A third reason. <hi>Campian the subiect of the Censure, being fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="6" facs="5"/>
Master Charkes handes, it was looked for, that according to reason, and all his promisses, he should be disputed withall openlie, publikelie, and freelie: and so the matter without writing dispatched.</hi> No man is so simple, but he may well perceiue, that while the wordes are directed to <hi>Master Charke,</hi> they are ment against the Prince and state. For who can trulie say, that <hi>Master Charke</hi> had <hi>Campian</hi> in his handes? or that he had made promis, of open, publike, and free disputation, whoe knew full well that he was not able to performe such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis if <hi>Campian</hi> had beene taken? or that any man of our profession, made any one such promis? what meaneth then our <hi>setter forth,</hi> by these his wordes, <hi>and all your owne promises,</hi> but thorough fayning of many promises, to slaunder vs of many breaches of faith and much falshoode. This is, in Poperie and Knauerie, a common practize, to charge men with a promisse where none was, that they maie ouercome modestie with impudencie; or at left to make her blush, beeing vniustlie accused of vnfaithfulnes.</p>
   <p>But you will saie, it was according to reason, that <hi>Campian</hi> should haue beene so disputed withall, if there had beene no promise at all. Great reason forsooth, that a well knowne, vaine, light, runnagate person, challengeing all the graue, wise, and learned of the land to disputation, should so greatlie be regarded, that his chalenge should be taken. Nay that an arrant traytor, furnished with faculties from the Pope, the Queenes open enemie, whose banner of defiance at the same time was spread within her Maiesties domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, should be admitted vnder colour of an open di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputation, to stir vp the vnconstant people to tumult and sedition: as though the religion so long by lawe established, were now brought into doubte, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation. Finallie, it was small reason in wise mens iudgement, that such a lustie Champion as did first cast his gloue of defiance out of a secret corner, after
<pb n="7" facs="5"/>
he hath beene long sought for, &amp; is at length drawne out of the bench holl, shoulde be set on the open stage to answere his challenge against al commers, with no smal glory of his foole hardy attempt, though he loose the daie, and be vanquished in the cause. Neuer the lesse it pleased them that had authoritie, partelie to represse the insolencie of the proud peeuish challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and his foolish fautors, that made no small ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counte of such a glorious <hi>Thraso,</hi> pattelie to satisfie the weake mindes of such, as might surmize of his bragges, otherwise then they deserued, there was a conference or disputation graunted, wherin although <hi>Campians</hi> learning was well knowne before, to all them that knew his bringing vp and studies, yet was it then throughlie discouered to many others, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued better of him before, then at that time shewed manefestlie to be in him. For besides his shamefull ignoraunce in the learned tongues, which he sought most rediculoussie to couer and hide, there appeared in him to all indifferent mens iudgements, no more then is writen of <hi>Catiline</hi> the Romane, whome he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as well in practize, as he resembled him in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, <hi>Loquentiae multum, sapientiae parum,</hi> many words, little wisdome, impudent loquacity, smale learning, &amp; lesse iudgement.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>But when it came to the hearing of the worlde</hi> (sayth the setter forth) <hi>how courteouslie you had vsed this learned man with torments.</hi> The world here signifieth, the secretra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of trayterous papists, which giue themselues to no thing more then either to heare or inuent, most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent lies against religion, &amp; al mainteyners &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the same. For to omitte the common phrase of this epistle, wherewith all thinges that are done against the papists, are imputed to <hi>M. Charke,</hi> whom al reasonable men knowe to be one of the moste, that may doe lest in these cases: who is so farre from all sense or vnderstanding (if he know what racking
<pb n="8" facs="6"/>
meaneth) to beleeue that <hi>Campian</hi> endured such tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of racking: whereof no signe could appeare in any part of his body, either before the conference, or after, whereby he should be lesse hable to dispute, as may be prooued by many hundred witnesses: yet the glorious foole, partly to boast of his sufferings, partly to excuse his impatience, and pusillanimity, which for feare rather then feeling of the racke, had discouered many of his friendes &amp; complices, with his owne hand writting, immediately after his racking, was not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on the day of the first conference, to complayne of his grieuous torments, vntil by testimony of Master Lieuetenant of the Tower, and others that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, his impudencie was so restrained for that time, that he thought it not best to bragge any more of his intollerable racking. <hi>But in the conference</hi> (say you) <hi>he was handled without all indifferencie or law of reasoning.</hi> How so, I praie you? The questiones were taken out of his owne booke, in which he could not bevnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: he had as great warning of them, as any of his aduersaries: he required no booke to furnish his memorie, but it was prouided for him: the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents for the moste part, dealt with him in lawfull syllogismes, except when his owne lauish tongue, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing against the lawe of reasoning, enforced other manner of communication: he was neither threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor reuiled, though he gaue great occasion by his insolent speach &amp; gesture. He was pressed with no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but the booke was shewed him: &amp; what other indifferencie or lawe of reasoning would you require?</p>
   <p>But it is no maruell though you dare be bolde to quarrell at his handling in the conference, when you are not ashamed to speake so impudently of his open trial and condemnation, saying: <hi>Finally you made him away by cruel death, without any shew or shadow of particu lar crime committed by him, against Prince or countrey.</hi> This were more then barbarous immanitie, if it were true:
<pb n="9" facs="6"/>
but being false, what is it, but a most heynous, and sedi tious slaunder, whether you consider the matter, or the persons against whome it is vttered? Let vs begin with the persons. Who made <hi>Campian</hi> away? not <hi>M. Charke,</hi> I am sure: for all men would laugh at you, if you so should say: for immediatlie after, you distinguish him from that action, saying, <hi>and that your selfe Master Charke followed him in person:</hi> Then whoe can be vnderstoode to haue made him away by cruell death, but they by whose authoritie, in whose highe Courte, by whose order, he was brought to triall: by whome euidence, verdite and sentence was giuen, and execution com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded? Now let vs waigh the matter: was he not in dighted, &amp; arraigned, found guiltie, atteinted, &amp; iudg ed, according to the ordinarie &amp; accustomable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alwaies vsed in the case of hie rreason, according to the lawes of the realme? had he not leaue to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere for him selfe, to challenge the Iurie, or to vse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other plea, that is permitted and allowed in such cases? was there noe shewe or shadowe of particuler crime conteined in the inditement, or in the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? The worlde knoweth it must needes be, &amp; the recordes are yet to be seene. But there was nothing prooued, perhaps you will say, though much was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged against him: he was slaundered by them that gaue euidence against him, he neuer did beare a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous or vndutifull minde against the Prince, or the state. Well, admit for <hi>Campians</hi> sake, that the credit of sworne witnesses, and the wholl processe of so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable a state, as is of this lande, must stand in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense, and not prooue so much as any shew or shadow of treason committed by him: yet what shall his owne confession subscribed with his hande testifie, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his treasonable affection against her Maiestie? shall it not confirme the testimonie of such as gaue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence against him, &amp; prooue him moste manifestly to be guiltie of high treason? his owne confession ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

   <p>These things knowne, &amp; considered, it is euident that none, but as honest a man as <hi>Campian,</hi> could write that <hi>Campian was made away by cruell death, without any shew or shadow of particuler crime, committed by him against Prince, or countrey:</hi> or that <hi>Campian</hi> suffering for such horrible treason, <hi>is a Martyr of Christ:</hi> or that he and his fellowes <hi>died moste constant, pure, and innocent martyrs of their Lord and Master Iesus Christ.</hi> But for that <hi>Master Charke in person followed Campian to his execution, as a conqueror of his aduersarie, with bigge lookes, sterne countenance, proude wordes, and merciles behauiour,</hi> the author of the <hi>Censure</hi> was mooued to resume his answere, <hi>as well for the honour of Christs martyr, as for declaration of what value he is in reason, learning, and weight of argument by writing, which is so feirce and violent upon Gods saints in death, and torments, so pompous in gate and speach vnto the people, &amp;c.</hi> Here are many greeuous accusations, but no proofe at all, but the common reporte, and that of trayterous Papists: for no honest man will charge <hi>Master Charke</hi> with these crimes. If he followed <hi>Campian,</hi> it was not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulte vpon his miserie, but to exhort him to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. What <hi>bigge lookes or stearne countenance</hi> he could put on in that time and case, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. I hope all men that know his face, will testifie, that he looked then no otherwise, then he doth at all times, except commiseration of the damnable state of those obstinate traytors and heretikes, did cause some tokens of heauines to appeare in his countenance. What his <hi>proude wordes and mercilesse behauiour was,</hi> in what pointe he shewed him selfe <hi>so feirce and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> vpon those trayterous heretikes, in death and torments, when you can declare, but in three wordes,
<pb n="13" facs="8"/>
you shall receiue an answere. In the meane time you may not thinke that with any reasonable man it is sufficient for you to accuse him of pride in wordes, and crueltie in behauiour, when you bring no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple nor proofe thereof. And sure I am, what wordes of his soeuer then vsed, you may wrest to make a shewe of pride, you are hable to alledge no action, wherein you may declare his vnmercifulnes, feirce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or violence. As for his <hi>pompous gate and speach,</hi> which you note in the last place, I doubt not but all they which know him, do laugh to heare you obiect it to him, as also that you note him afterwarde, to <hi>weare gorgeous apparrell,</hi> and therein to haue excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Campian.</hi> His <hi>valew in reasoning, learning and weight of arguments in writing,</hi> what they are, and how to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, albeit his friendes know already, yet I hope his aduersaries also shall in their conscience acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, especiallie after the smoke of your authors ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils be driuen away, by the cleare light of trueth.</p>
   <p>As for <hi>the disturbance thorough searchers and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters,</hi> that you complaine of, which caused your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to breake of in the middest, is but a shift of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scant. For as your author, whatsoeuer he be, is still hidden, so in his hiding place, he may goe through, if it please him, or if he be weary of his enterprise, he may take his ease without controlement. For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of the time is not such, though you whine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so much, but if he can abstaine from vndermy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the state, he may enioy more rest, then an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike deserueth to haue, or then Papists in time and places of their gouernement wil afforde vnto true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes.</p>

Secondly, how hyporbolically he describeth our vehemency: <hi>no one iot of curtesie, humanitic, reasonable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie.</hi> Why sir? who are you with whome we deal so streightly, for whome we make search so diligently, and punish so extreamely? A wholl hundred of Papists and more be daylie in our sight, dwell in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and suffer not so much as the lest ordinarie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishent which is appointed by law for them, which come not to Church. They be temporall men, you will say. Read the booke entituled <hi>the execution for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, &amp;c.</hi> and you shall finde a number of your cleargy men vsed with all curtesie, and humanity, that maie be shewed to men of a contrary religion. It remaineth then, that you are some rebeilious Iesuits, or semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry priests, which are sent hither by the Pope, and his Antichristian adhaerents, to alienate the princes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects mindes, yea to steal away their hearts from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of their Lawfull Soueraigne: that you might by such meanes prepare a waie the soner for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like execution of that blasphemous bul of <hi>Pius Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> And would you, wandring about with such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and practises, haue curtesie and gentlenes shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you? And yet when you are apprehended, there is no duety of humanity denied you. You haue the due triall of law, and many times the deserued execution is forborne. Such lenitie so lightlie regarded, nay so tragically inueighed against, as most barbarus cruelty, deserueth at the hands of God and man more sharp, and yet but iuste entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>You exclude vs</hi> (say you) <hi>from speach, conference, writing, printing, disputing, or any other due trial of our cause.</hi> Stil you would haue your cause to be religion, when it is high treason. And as for triall due for treason, is neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied you, before you be condemned for it. As for
<pb n="15" facs="9"/>
speach, conference, writing, printing, disputing for trial of the cause of religion, when you will permit to be free, in places of popish regiment, you may expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate with vs, for not allowing you the same in this Christian state of gouernment.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>But what extremitie soeuer we vse, we are sure</hi> (say yow) <hi>allwaies to be answered by one meanes or an other.</hi> It may be as you saie: but you tell vs not when. For if you speake of answering our bookes, you scarse giue one for tenne. Neither do you so disquiet vs by your pretended claime, as you mainely boast, but we might sleepe on both sides, if we had none other busines then to confute your popish treatises. And if you had no greater hope in treasonable practises, as in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, both in England, and Ireland, and in your Popes bandes and banners, your <hi>Saunders,</hi> your <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> your <hi>Someruils,</hi> your <hi>Parries,</hi> and such other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable traitors and treasons, then you haue confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in writing or reasoning, you would not looke to see the rooting out of our faith &amp; religion, which you terme heresie, as you do vainly prognosticat and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>But our credit</hi> (you thinke) <hi>is greatly crushed in our owne conceiptes, seing we flie openly and without shame all kinde of quiet triall what soeuer, and with furie onely moue the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to violence against you.</hi> In deed you know your owne cause best, where you haue the magistrate obedient at your beck, how vnwilling you are to haue any other quiet conference for trial, but imprisonment, torment, fire, and fagot. And if the same measure were paied you home againe into your lapps, it were no more but good iustice, and such as you shall surely finde one day, according to the prophecy of the holy ghost. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde <note place="margin"> Apoc. 18.</note> her euen as she hath rewarded you, &amp;c.</hi> when God shall put into the hart of Kings, to hate the Romish whoore of Babylon, to eate her flesh, and to burne her with fire. But as yet, God calling you to repentance,
<pb n="16" facs="10"/>
you haue no cause to repine against our seuerity, much lesse to condemne vs of violence, if you seeke not your owne bane, by practising of treason and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But how do you openlie and without shame, saie, that <hi>we flie openly and without shame all kinde of quiet triall?</hi> What lawfull kinde of quiet triall hath not bene offered to you? Would you haue confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? was there not a moste solemne conference agreed vpon, in the beginning of her Maiesties reigne, where principall men of both parts haue beene chosen to confer, and all the states of the realme assembled in parliament readie to heare? And who did there openly and without all shame flie the triall? did not the pillers of popery, vpon a friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus cauill, misliked by their owne <hi>Fecknam,</hi> giue ouer the combate? As for <hi>priuate confirence,</hi> it hath bene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times offered, and often practised with such of your heresie, as be in holde, but of them for the moste part misliked or reiected. Triall by writing of bookes, hath alwaies bene, and yet is open &amp; free, in so much as many of your popish treatises being confuted by vs, are allowed to be inserted into our bookes, that the indifferent reader may iudge of both more freely and easily: a triall which you papists neuer yet durst enter into, and a manifest argument, that you flie the most indifferent kinde of triall. You haue bene open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenged by <hi>Doctor Fulke</hi> to conclude the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies <note place="margin">In his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before his reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue against Bristowes motiues.</note> of religion that are betweene vs in the strict forme of syllogismes, both for your owne ease and for the clearnes and certainty of iudgement: and this rea sonable request, if you refuse to yealde vnto, he hath protested before God and the world, that you shew your selues thereby to be enemies of trueth, that you flie the light, and dare not abide the triall. And yet these foure yeares day, none of you all hath aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that most easie, certaine and necessary trial, which you cannot refuse, if you wil haue trueth to be thought
<pb n="17" facs="10"/>
to stand on your side. Let wise men iudge therefore, <hi>whether we refuse all kinde of quiet triall,</hi> and whether it be not a seditious kinde of triall, that you would haue, as appeared by <hi>Campians</hi> challenge: who although he were a person too contemptible for yeares, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, learning, or honestie, to make so proude a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, to all the learned and wise of the Church and common welth of England: yet when he was brought to light, he was conferred withall, by diuerse graue, and learned men, and tried in the defense of his owne treatise, in which God wot, he was quickly found to be none other, then his familiars alwaies knew him to be, that is more bold to challenge, then able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him-selfe: more ready to cauill like a childish so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phister, then to answere like a sober deuine.</p>
   <p>And as <hi>for his constancie &amp; patience</hi> (which you magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie with so many wordes) in his iust execution for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which you falsly terme <hi>martyrdome,</hi> for your false religion, there is smale cause you should boast of it: but that it is necessarie, where you cannot be borne out with trueth, to breake through with open lyes. For manie hundrethes of eie witnesses can testifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, that of his patience (which yet had bene perforce) there was no sufficient trial by torment, or sense of bodelie paine, at his death, other then is vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to al that be strangled with an halter. But <hi>as for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie or cherefull passage vnto his death,</hi> it appeared lesse in him, then in any of his fellowes, but rather great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of deiection and consternation of his minde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraied in his colour, countenance, voice, and gesture, plainly noted by such as knew his stomach, courage, &amp; lusty behauiour when he was in prosperity. <hi>That he &amp; his complices, would acknowledge no guilt of treason,</hi> whereof they were so cleerely conuicted, it maketh their death more detestable, &amp; sheweth their hipocrisie more dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: who seeing it was necessary for them to die as traitors, desired of their fautors to be honored as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs:
<pb n="18" facs="11"/>
declaring thereby intollerable rancor, and malice against the prince and the state, and no lesse pride &amp; ambition in them-selues. Of such <hi>Martyrs</hi> boast as long as you will, you shall neither get credit by them, when their cause is knowne, nor terrifie vs with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge of their blood, when their punishment was iust. HEtherto belike you haue spoken to al that abhorre Popery in general: for now you <hi>will speake aword or two to Master Charke, as to his owne person in particuler.</hi> And two things you tell him of, that in this matter do prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concerne him. The first is his writing, <hi>which, as shall appeare by this authors defense, doth conuince him of grosse ignorance, and that in verie common matters, both of diuinitie, and of Philosophie, wherein it is well knowne that Campian was moste excellent.</hi> But seeing the proofe of this conuiction resteth onely in the authors defense, the discreete reader will suspend his iudgement, vntill he see <hi>Master Charkes</hi> answere also. In the meane time it will appeare, by that which other men write in his defence likewise, that all is not grosse ignorance, which cauilling and malitious Papists, seeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face him with a false accusation, are disposed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute vnto him. As for <hi>Campians</hi> learning in these two sciences, I may be as bold to saie, it is well knowne, that it was but vulgar, and inferior to manie of his yeares and tyme of studie, which you commend to be in the superlatiue degree of moste excellencye. Some peece of his diuinity he shewed in the conference with in the tower of London. <hi>His knowledge in Philosophie,</hi> as it is not to be waighed in the controuersie of Religion, which we haue in hand, so it is not to be thought, that he so far excelled therein, but Oxford and Cambridge can aforde an hundreth Masters of Arte his iuniors in time, at the lest way his equalls, if not his betters therein</p>
   <p>That <hi>Master Charke outfaced him in the towre of London, by reason of his high place, gaie apparell, great wordes, assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="19" facs="11"/>
of friendes, countenance of authoritie, and applause of Protestantes standing by,</hi> it is a poore excuse of <hi>Master Campians</hi> insufficiencie, which though it was manifest to the wise and learned, in euery of the former daies of conference, yet in that last daie of <hi>Master Charkes encounter with him,</hi> was apparant euen to the simple &amp; ignorant: so that <hi>Campians</hi> impudencie, wherein he chieflie excelied, was so repressed at that time, as euen in the opinion of euerie man (albeit he was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished before) yet now at last he seemed to be cleane ouerthrowne. And this shamefull foile, you would faine haue to be thought to haue happened vnto him, as <hi>one ouermatched with M. Charkes highe place, gaie appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, great wordes, &amp;c.</hi> It is pittie your <hi>Champion</hi> was noe better armed aganst so weake arguments, but did suffer him self to be outfaced with such friuolous reasons, of place, garmentes, wordes, countenance, &amp; multitude. verely they that knew his audacitie from a childe, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled to see him so greatlie daunted, but that it pleased God that day, to make him, and all the papists, in their foolish deuise of his impudent challenge, ridiculous to al the world. But if we maie examine these reasons, by which he seemed to be so much outfaced, what <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of place,</hi> I praie you, was there betweene the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, and the respondent? were not there stooles of equall height? you would haue fooles imagine belike that <hi>Charke</hi> sat a loft in a throne, seauen stepps higher then <hi>Campian,</hi> or what meane you to prate of <hi>high place.</hi> As for <hi>gay apparell,</hi> men maie see <hi>Master Charke</hi> daielie how gorgeouslie he is araied, so that he turneth the eies of all men vppon him, which waie so euer he goeth: or els <hi>Campian</hi> had smale cause to feare him, for his gaie apparell. In trueth his apparell was of colour blacke, of matter wollen, of making such as the common sorte of Ministers in London commonly do vse to weare. But if <hi>Campian</hi> had bene stripped out of his rugge gowne, whereunder his ruffianlike garments
<pb n="20" facs="12"/>
were hidde, he would haue appeared in much gayer apparell for matter, colour, and fashion, then <hi>Master Charke</hi> was euer seene to weare, since he came into the ministerie. Neuertheles his gowne could not hide his to spots hat, which, if not on that daie, yet at all other times of the conference, it is certaine was the same, that was seene with the rest of his <hi>Iesuiticali robes,</hi> when he ridde through Cheap-side towards the tower of London: And therefore mee thinkes you neede not to haue spoken of <hi>Master Charkes gaie apparell.</hi> But what <note place="margin">Sesquipeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia verba.</note> were those <hi>greate words</hi> of his, a foote and a halfe long at the lest, that <hi>Master Campian</hi> might be outfaced with them? They that were present could obserue no affectation os wordes, but weight of matter, that bare downe <hi>Campians</hi> courage, especially when he was pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to answere to syllogismes, which (as though no man but he could skill of) at the first he did scornefully call for. <hi>The assistance of friendes</hi> was a smale prerogatiue, when they were onelie hearers, and not helpers of his disputation. <hi>The countenance of authoritie</hi> litle auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in conference, where each partie, by leaue of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, may saie what he can for his cause. Last of all <hi>the applause of the Protestantes standing by,</hi> was no cause of <hi>Campians</hi> outfacing, but a consequent of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient answering. That vaine scoffe, of <hi>Campians comming within the reach of Charkes ministeriall power and authoritie,</hi> sauoreth of nothing, but of proude follie, and foolish malice. For all men maie easilie know, that when <hi>Campian</hi> was apprehended for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Queenes subiects to sedition, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the tower, for imagining and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of high treason, he was not within the reach of anie Ecclesiasticall persons power, or authoritie, much lesse of poore <hi>M. Charkes</hi> iurisdiction, which is none at all, further then by commission might be graunted to anie of the state ciuill or Ecclesiasticall to examine him, or to conferre with him.</p>
   <pb n="21" facs="12"/>
   <p>The second matter you haue to speake to <hi>Master Charks</hi> owne person, <hi>is of his false dealing, to deceaue: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you graunt him principalitie, not onely aboue Campian, who had no talent at all therein, but euen aboue the chiefe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of his owne syde, most expert in that facultie.</hi> The terme of <hi>talent,</hi> being taken out of the gospell, and signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some grace or gyfte of god, how vngraciouslie it is abused, not onely in this place, for a facultie of false dealing, but also by the auctor him-selfe asterward, for a custome of rayling, I wish the sober reader to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, and to consider what religious affection these men beare to the doctrine of Christ, that can finde no termes to play with all in their spitefull inuectiues, but such as are shamefullie detorted and abused from the holy vse, and phrases of the blessed scriptures. As for the crime of <hi>false dealing,</hi> let it appeare in Gods name, by the tryall and examination of both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties writings, and rest where it shalbe found to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctized. In the meane time, we must a litle consider of these examples here brought for a taste, to shew his false dealings by <hi>Master setter forth:</hi> First <hi>M. Charke</hi> inueigheth against the <hi>Censurer</hi> verie sharpely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he chargeth <hi>Luther</hi> with an opinion, which he confesseth that sometimes he held, and afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canteth, concerning the licensing of wiues to lie with their neighbour, when their husbands by naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, were not hable to do their partes. This say you, seemeth a very reasonable defense: where is then the false dealing? Mary (say you) <hi>the words that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow in Luther, declare that now he would doe worsse then before: for now he would compell the poore husbandes, to graunt their wiues that libertie, or els would he tugge them by the lockes of the heade. And can there be anie more shameles <note place="margin">See after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the answere to the defense more at large.</note> dealings, &amp;c.</hi> If <hi>Luther</hi> declare his opinion in the words following, to be as you say, I must needes confes that this was a great ouersight in <hi>Master Charke</hi> at lest, if it were not shameles dealing. But if <hi>Luthers</hi> meaning

by the whole scope of that place be plaine, not to giue the wife licence to lie with an other man (the band of wedlocke continuing) but to compell such an insufficient husband to be deuorced from his wife, because she cannot haue the lawfull remedie of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency by his companie, do you not plaie the papist in graine, thus to exclame against <hi>Master Charks</hi> false dealing? As for the phrase of <hi>tugging by the Locks,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Dutch prouerb, signifying no more but inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (to vse your owne words) hath that man anie conscience, trow you, that will vrge it to colour such vnhonest and false accusations? Verily you had bene better to haue held your peace: for now you are, and shalbe more hereafter discouered, while you slaunder him vntruely to vse deceit, and do vse false plaie your selfe, and that most impudentlie.</p>
   <p>Another example of his <hi>false dealing</hi> you bring, in the controuersie, <hi>Whether concupiscense in the regenerate without consent be sinne.</hi> Where <hi>Master Chark</hi> being sore oppressed by many places of <hi>Saint Augustines</hi> auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, brought by the <hi>Censurer, findeth no other reliefe of his credit with the reader, but to forge a place of Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine to the contrarie: in which to deceaue the reader, he foisteth in this word (sinne) reciting his words thus: Concupiscense is not so forgiuen in Baptisme, that it is not sinne. By which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the word (sinne) the matter seemeth to stand cleere on his side. And this cannot be excused by ignorance: but sheweth open and wilfull malice in the man.</hi> Hasty iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Peraduenture he may excuse the addition, by the Printers fault, and so it was neither ignorance, nor malice in him. But take it moste hardly, that <hi>Master Chark</hi> did purposely adde the word (<hi>sinne</hi>) vnto <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines</hi> text (which yet in a strict translation, where there is no neede, is not alowable) if it be manifest that it is <hi>Saint Augustines</hi> meaning, the addition of a word, for explication of the sense, is neither forging, nor foisting. But it is most impudentlying in you, sir
<pb n="23" facs="13"/>
      <hi>setter forth,</hi> to say, <hi>he findeth none other reliefe of his credit with the reader,</hi> but to adde this word (<hi>sinne</hi>) to <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines</hi> text, when immediatly after this pretended forgerie, he bringeth a most cleere place of <hi>Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> in which he doth expressly affirme, that concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piseense, euen in them that haue the spirit of God, is sinne: which argueth, that he needed not at al to forge and foist, hauing <hi>Saint Augustines</hi> words so euident on his side, and that he findeth not onely another, but a farr better reliefe of his credit with trueth, then he could looke to gaine, if he had bene disposed to vse false dealing. <hi>Master Charkes</hi> wordes are these: <hi>Saint Augustines place making it no sinne in the regenerate without consent, is expounded by him-selfe afterward saying: Concupis cense is not so forgiuen in Baptisme, that it is not sinne, but that it is not imputed as sinne. For a cleere proofe hereof, in another booke he saieth plainly, it is sinne.</hi> and so shewing the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of his saying, citeth the place at large <hi>Cont. Iul. lib. 5. cap. 3.</hi> in which are these wordes. <hi>Concupiscense of the flesh, against which the good spirit lusteth, is sinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is in it a disobedience against the regiment of the minde.</hi> Where he saith, for a cleerer proofe, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the word (<hi>sinne</hi>) in the formet text, was not added by him, at lest wise not to deceaue: for with the addition, you will confesse, it is as cleare, as can be for his parte. But if he added that word, as being of the plaine meaning of <hi>Saint Augustine,</hi> yet subiect to cauilling, because it is not in him expressed, to take awaie al colour of wrangling, about the terme, he ioyneth a moste cleere proofe, of <hi>Saint Augustines</hi> iudgement plaine, that concupiscense in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is sinne in his owne nature, although because it is forgiuen, it is not imputed to them as sinne. So that the sense is manifest, that concupiscense in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate is sinne, but sinne forgiuen, or sinne not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And therefore although in some sense, a man may truely say, that sinne forgiuen, as adulterie, is no
<pb n="24" facs="14"/>
sinne, or sinne not imputed, is no sinne, because the guiltines there of is remoued from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, couering, or not imputing, through Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or satisfaction of Christ; yet it followeth not there of, that sinne of his owne nature is not damnable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause mercy hath made it remissible: or that sin forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as adultety, or such like, cannot be properly called sinne, because it is pardoned; but the cleane contrary doth follow of necessity: euen so is cōcupiscens, which is forgiuen in the regenerate, yet remaineth in them, not as a vertue, or an indifferent thing, but as an euil thing, as <hi>Augustine</hi> els where confesseth: yet no sinne able to condemne them, because it is not imputed to them, or because it is pardoned in them. Therefore except you wil say, that sinne forgiuen or not imputed ceaseth to be sinne in his owne nature, concupiscense in the regenerate is sin, although forgiuen &amp; not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them. But of this matter inough at this time, seing it is to be handled more at large hereafter, and to be plainly shewed, that <hi>Saint Augustine,</hi> although in some sense, he say that concupiscense is no sinne, yet in another sense he doth as plainly affirme, that it is sinne, and such as would condemne vnto death, if it were not satisfied by Christ, and remitted vnto the regenerate.</p>
   <p>Your third example, of his purpose to deceaue, is, that <hi>not hauing at hand the Censure of Collen it selfe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth diuerse vntruthes against the Iesuites out of Gotuisus, concealing his name, quoting onely Censura Coloniensis, which he is sure cannot be seene, as not to be had in England, ando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Canisius, whom his author Gotuisus doth likewise cite, which may be had, and red of euery man.</hi> This is but a bare surmise, without any sufficient reason to vphold it: of two he citeth one, <hi>Ergo</hi> he seeketh to deceaue. And as for the <hi>Censure of Collen,</hi> it is now as common to be had in England, as <hi>Canisius</hi> his Catechisme, although when <hi>Master Chark</hi> did set forth his first booke, it was
<pb n="25" facs="14"/>
not to be sold in the shops, yet many had it in their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And it seemeth he did chuse to cite that which was like to be of greater authoritie among the Papists, as done by consent of a wholl Vniuersity. But it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him more neerely, that where <hi>Gotuisus did not bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the Iesuites sufficiently, Master Chark without blushing will falsifie his wordes, to make them more odious: as where Gotui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus his wordes are, that the Iesuites say, the scripture is, as it were a nose of wax, Master Chark saith their wordes are, the scripture is a nose of wax.</hi> This quarrell was obiected at the first by the <hi>Censurer,</hi> and answered by <hi>M. Charke</hi> in his reply, that protesting at the first, not to set downe the very words, but the meaning, he hath nothing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried therfro. For there can be no other sense of these words, <hi>the scripture is a nose of wax,</hi> and these, <hi>The scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is as a nose of wax,</hi> seing no man would dreame of a transsubstantiation, but al reasonable men vnderstand a semblans or likenes, although the note of similitude (<hi>as</hi>) be not expressed. Therefore there appeareth no purpose of deceauing by this citing out of <hi>Gotuisus,</hi> when <hi>Paiua Andradius</hi> also excusing the same crime against <hi>Kemnitius,</hi> confesseth that <hi>the fathers of Collen, in a most apte similitude, called it a nose of wax: &amp; Pighius the leaden rule of the Lesbian building,</hi> as <hi>Master Charke</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, whose purpose is no more, but to prooue that this is an vnapt, and an vnworthie similitude, and therfore hath offered no wrong to the <hi>Iesuits</hi> or <hi>Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Collen,</hi> nor vsed any fraude to deceiue the reader.</p>
   <p>Now concerning his other <hi>behauiour towards M. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian in the tower of London, &amp; els where,</hi> you <hi>mean not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to stand vpon,</hi> because you cannot imagine what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour you should set vpon your slaunder, and yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what you must say, or els burst for spight. First <hi>his inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uility in wordes vttered against Campian in his booke.</hi> These blasphemous heretiks, and arrant traitors, where they haue no authoritie, and most bloodie butchers of gods saints where they haue power, require to be reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<pb n="26" facs="15"/>
euen of them, whome by all possible meanes they persecute, and abuse, so that there may not an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentle word be spoken against them, though it be not halfe so much as they deserue to heare, but they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine forsooth, of greate inciuilitie vsed toward them. But what the <hi>Ceusure</hi> noted, the reply hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and therefore to a generall charge, I neede make none other, but a generall answere. <hi>But that was nothing to the contemptuous vsage of so learned a man in open audience.</hi> Surely learning goeth very low among the English Papists, when <hi>Campian</hi> is made so learned a man, and euen with lothsomnes so often commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for learning: in whome as we acknowledge there was more learning, then honesty, so they which either were priuy to his studies, or had trial of his knowledge, must needes confes, that there wasin him much more arrogancie, then learning. But what <hi>contemptuous vsage</hi> (I pray you) can you lay to <hi>Master Charks</hi> charge? <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous threatening of that further crueltie which then he had in minde, and now hath put in execution vppon him.</hi> Is any man so simple to belecue this slaunder? hath <hi>M. Chark</hi> put any crueltie or punishment of iustice, either vpon <hi>Campian</hi> in execution? or had he any more to do in <hi>Cam pians</hi> punishment, then you? or was any greater cause thereof then you? nay verily, I maie thinke probably, that you, or at lest wise I may saie boldly, that some of his greatest friendes the Papists, were a much greater cause of <hi>Campians</hi> death, then any minister in England. For they knowing his proude stomach, &amp; arrogant dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position (which no man could be ignorant of, that was acquainted with <hi>Campian</hi>) chose him for a meete instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be sent into England, as a trumpet of sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with his traiterous faculties, which is in deede the right and true cause meritorious of such paine, as he suffered, &amp; not <hi>Master Charks</hi> crueltie or malice: which if he had borne any against <hi>Campian,</hi> he is neither of authoritic, nor credit, to procure execution thereof,
<pb n="27" facs="15"/>
in such sorte as <hi>Campian</hi> was punished. Therefore this slaunder of <hi>Barbarous threatning, and contemptuous v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,</hi> is as the rest of your honest reportes, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue trueth, nor likely hoode of trueth in them.</p>
   <p>But of all other things it seemeth to you <hi>most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and fit for a stage, which yet Master Charke thought was excellent, and became him well: and that was his often tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the people, and requesting them to reioyce, and thanke the Lord that had giuen him such an argument: which when it came forth, prooued not worth three eggs in Maie, for that Master Campian dispatched it often times in lesse then halfe three wordes.</hi> Ofthis turning and requesting they that were present do saie, you lie in your throate, that anie such was vsed by <hi>Master Charke,</hi> as also where you saie, that <hi>when he was brought to a non plus, and thereuppon the people beginning to departe, he caused the dores to be shut, and no man to be let out, vntill they had ioyned with him in praier to thanke the Lord for his victorie, &amp;c.</hi> But if it had bene true, that he had requested such thankesgiuing of the people, or caused the dore to be shut, that the wholl multitude of hearers might ioyne with him in prayer, is praier &amp; thankesgiuing ridiculous, &amp; meete for a stage? &amp; doth the vse of them prooue a comicall exercise to get applause of the people? if the one or the other be so in the accompt of papists, surely they are otherwise iudged of among true christians. But it was the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the arguments (you wilsay) which were so light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissolued, in lesse then halfe three words, which made that preparation ridiculous. A maruelous dexteritie of the Champion, orels a ridiculous maruell of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasite, to saie, that he could dispatch arguments often times, and shew the infirmitie of them in one worde onelie, so that all men might laugh at the opponents follie. Of like credit it is, that <hi>Master Charke in the end was brought to a non plus, and thereupon the people began to depart:</hi> when as manie as were present can testifie, that the daie being farr spent, <hi>Master Liuetenant</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="28" facs="16"/>
that the time was past, whereupon <hi>Master Charke</hi> gaue ouer, and concluded with praier. In which if anie Papist, by reason the dore was shut by order of them which might commaunde it, were constrained like an hypocrite to vaile his bonet, or bow his knees against his minde, yet none was so hardie to protest that he would not ioyne in praier with him, but ouelie your grande Captaine <hi>Campian:</hi> which yet was so courtcous a gentleman, that he offered to ioyne hands with them in familiaritie, with whome he refused to ioyne his tongue in praier. A lack that treason and vaine glorie would not suffer him to liue: for otherwise manie thinke he would haue beene tractable enough in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>But it was to get applause of the people that Master Norton the rackmaster was at Master Charkes elbow, to repeate and vrge his arguments for him to the purpose,</hi> What els? ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we might be bold with your worship, and tell you that you gable. <hi>Master Norton</hi> was there as a diligent and faithfull writer, as well of the arguments, as of the answeres: and when he repeated anie argument that he had written, it was that the opponent might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he had taken it truely. As like wise he repeated <hi>Campians</hi> answere also, who often times when he misliked it him-selfe, either added, or detracted, or altered the same, so that he weried the writer not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, vntill it was set downe, as he would haue it stand, and as he would stand to it: otherwise it had bene smal matter of applause, that <hi>Master Charke</hi> should get, to haue an other man vrge his arguments for him to the purpose, as though he could not follow them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe sufficientlie: so greate likeliehoode of trueth your surmises haue, which yet you set downe as absolutelie, as they were oracles of Apollo. <hi>For which cause also you had Master Norton the rackemaster, &amp;c.</hi> But how well do you remember the rule of ciuilitie in wordes, whereof you are such a rigorous exactor in other men, that so
<pb n="29" facs="16"/>
reprochfully scoffe at <hi>M. Norton,</hi> who besyde his rare giftes of witte, learning, and wisedome, was of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall trust with other appointed by the Prince, and her moste honnorable councell, to examine such as were thought meete to be tried, or terrified with the racke, &amp; therefore in respect of the authoritie, by which he dealt in those cases, neither in ciuilitie, nor in christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie deserued the odious, and opprobious name of a <hi>rackemaster.</hi> Againe you pittie the case, <hi>that we durst not make those few disputations publike, where more men might haue laughed &amp; bene witnesses of our folly &amp;c. No no, if we had parted with Master Campian but at an euen hand, as we ioyned with him with all inequallitie, you shoulde haue had bookes of triumphset forth before now, &amp; this secret of ours al the people of England doth knowe.</hi> What secret of ours? be like that we durst not make these disputations publiker by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the report thereof. For otherwise there were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses enow, at the hearing of them. But now all the people of England know that you lie impudently. For the report of that conference hath bene imprinted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most this two yeares, and neuer a papist of you all, at home or abroad, hath aduentured to controll it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there haue bene printed brags, that you would shortly set'it out your selues to our shame. You will say it is set downe by our selues, or our owne friendes, and consequently partially in reporte of <hi>Campians</hi> answers. Admit it were so (as in deede it is otherwise) for <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> answers touching the substance of them, and in his owne wordes, are as trulie set doune, as the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents argumentes: yet because the matter is not the victorie against <hi>Campians</hi> person, but against his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, if you thinke <hi>Campian,</hi> or your cause haue iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by the report of his answers, whie do not you shew, either what his answers were. or what they should haue bene, to the auoiding of those argumentes that then were brought against him? Which arguments as they were then propounded to <hi>Camipans</hi> person. so
<pb n="30" facs="17"/>
now by publishing of them in print, they are offered as a smal taste to al his fautors &amp; abbertors, to answere them, if they can, better then <hi>Campian,</hi> but a young nouis in popish diuinity, was hable to doe. But I suppose it much more easie for you to laugh at them in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and smile in your sleeues in open presence, then keeping the lawes of disputation, to auoide the force of them. As for the vaine glory whereof you dreame, that we be so greedie, you see by differring the publication of that conference so long, that we could wel haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne it altogether, if vour insolent bragging, false surmising, impudent slaundering, and childish da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, had not in a manner extorted the setting forth thereof. The example you bring of our desire of praise, by <hi>Doctor Fulke,</hi> looking into Wisbige Castle, is by the same man sufficientlie answered, with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarrells, that you picke against his writings, in a seuerall treatise annexed to his defense of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish translations against <hi>Gregorie Martine,</hi> and therfore there needeth not anie other confutation of those slaunders and cauills, then is alreadie set forth.</p>
   <p>But with what inequalitie did we ioine with <hi>Campian,</hi> by meanes whereof, he might be lesse hable to make his partie good? <hi>We know</hi> (you saie) <hi>the inequalitie, whereby we dealt with that man, being but one, vnbooked, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouided, wearyed with imprisonment, and almost dismembred with the rack, threatened and terrified with death to come, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed onely to answere, and neuer to oppose: yea all this wee know, and the world both knoweth and marueileth at it abroad.</hi> The world maie maruell at his arrogancie, in making such a proude challenge, and at your impudencie, in defending his insufficiencie with such manifest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueths. First you saie, <hi>he was but one,</hi> and the world knoweth there were but six, of more then six hundreth whome he challenged, hable to haue incountred with a greater giant, then he was, that at seuerall times had conference with him. He being but one, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
<pb n="31" facs="17"/>
note of intollerable pride, prouoked al the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of England: and do you complaine, that being but one, he was assaied by so few of so greate a number as he challenged? There was but one that challenged all, and therefore it was thought meete, that this one should be a litle discouered, partelie to represse the insolencie of him-selfe and of his friendes, partlie to satisfie the weakenes of some ignorant persons, that might imagine, there was some greate matter in his bold challenge, who shewed therein the greatest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that could be, if it had notserued for an other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till practize. <hi>Hewas vnbooked</hi> (you saie) but in deede he was licensed to haue what bookes soeuer he would call for. <hi>Canisius</hi> great Catechisme he required, and had, which he saide should be vnto him <hi>instar omnium. Vnprouided</hi> he could not be, being opposed in his owne booke, or at lest wise could not complaine of it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as long time to consider of the questions, as his aduersaries had. <hi>His imprisonment</hi> had not bene so long before the conference, nor his keeping so straite, that his witts could be dulled, or his memorie quai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in so short a time of fiue or six weekes. That he was either almost, or anie thing at all <hi>dismembred, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted in bodie with the racke,</hi> is a most false lie, and shamelesse slaunder, although he bragged as of his suffering by the rack, which he rather saw, then felt, as Master Lieuetenant told him. It is as false that he was <hi>threatened or terrified with death,</hi> by anie of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters. If he were terrified in minde with conscience of his treasons, to feare that death, which he knew he had deserued, there was none to blame but him-selfe. Otherwise his behauiour was not like one that feared death, as it was afterward when death in deede was present before his eies.</p>
   <p>Finallie, that he was <hi>appointed onelie to answere, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to oppose,</hi> it was noe disaduantage to him, if he had maintained a true cause, and had beene that man of
<pb n="32" facs="18"/>
learning, which he would seeme to be. For all men which know what belongeth to disputation, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that it is easier for a learned man to answere with commendation in defense of trueth, then to oppugne a true cause, with hope to winne credit. Wherfore the inequalitie was in the cause, not in the disputers parte, which was appointed to <hi>Campian.</hi> For if his positions had not bene false, by answering he had the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage against the opponents. Againe, <hi>Campian</hi> did first take vpon him the opponents parte in publishing his booke of tenne arguments against vs, which by our side was answered, and therefore it was meete, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to order, he should be appointed to answere, and our side to oppose, and that by the verie law of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie and indifferencie, although (as it is euident by the reporte of the conference) he was permitted som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to oppose, and propounded such arguments as his weake cause could afforde him.</p>
   <p>But you <hi>are sure and dare auowe to our faces, that we will neuer deale with you at euen hand, or vpon equall conditions, while we liue.</hi> You maie be sure that to maintaine your purpose of sedition, for which your challenge was made, that we will not deale with you at anie hand, or vpon anie conditions. But to shew your falsehoode, ignorance, and arrogancie manifest to the world, we are readie to ioyne with you in anie conditions, that our prince and magistrates will allow vs, and shall thinke maie stand with the quiet of the state: who, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our religion after lawfull and solemne conference by vs offered, and shamefullie refused by your good masters, is by law established, will not rashlie admitt euerie vaine and ridiculous challenge of disputation, that is offered by such, as <hi>Campian</hi> &amp; you are, who dare auow to our faces, and yet dare not shew your owne faces, before you be drawen out of your creeping cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and hiding holes, as <hi>Campian</hi> and his complices were.</p>
   <pb n="33" facs="18"/>
   <p>
      <hi>Yet you are in the name of all your fellow Catholikes tore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new your bublike challenge of equall disputation.</hi> Who are you, and what Commission haue you from your fellow Papists, that we may credit you? If we knew either the one, or the other, we might the rather consider of your pretended publike challenge. <hi>Edmond Campian</hi> did more like a Champion, who when he cast downe his gloue of defiance, spared not his name, though he hid his head. But you, comming with so lowd a challenge, so large of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, so magnifical promises, not of your owne countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but of straungers also, of matters not in priuate mens power, but of the graunt of Princes, &amp; that in any kingdome and countrie, which you call Catholike; and moreouer, rather then you would faile of disputation, are ready to beare the expenses, not onely of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie-men, which are manie, but of all the learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants of Europe, whome you giue vs leaue to call for our defense, must needs haue great intelligence &amp; conference with all the popish states in Europe, and a wonderfull large commission from them all, which we would beglad you should shew, for our assurance, or els you shew your selfe the noblest foole in the world, to thinke that any man will credit you in so weightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, vpon your owne bare worde, not knowing so much as whome to enquire for, or where to finde you, if we were disposed to confer with you, about anie conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of equalitie to be vsed in the pretended disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or about the time, place, or persons to be emploied in the same.</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse to shew your confidence, and desire of triall in all the haste, you tell vs, that <hi>albeit we thinke your cause to be greatlie weakened by the taking awaie, and dispatching</hi> (so you cal the iust execution) <hi>of Campian, &amp; Sherwine, yet you are the same men you were before, yea much more disirous of this triall, then before.</hi> Indeede I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded you are no changelings, but euen as the deuill hardneth them whome he hath once in possession, so

your obstinacie daylie encreaseth, both in herisie and treason. For the weakening of your cause, we neuer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted any greate moment to be either in <hi>Campian,</hi> or <hi>Sherwine,</hi> more then to the strengthening thereof. They were of the ripest frie, that your seminarie could afforde, sparing the olde stores, and yet they were but frothe, for any sounde learning that was in either of them. You say, we <hi>were wante for more abasement of the other, to saie that M. Sherwine was farre better learned, then Campian him-selfe.</hi> It may be some haue saide soe, and they that haue had conference with both, doe affirme that is the learned tongues Greeke and Hebrewe, <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn</hi> had some litle sinacke, so that he could talke of them, whereas <hi>Campian</hi> was as blind as a betle in them both. Againe, <hi>Sherwyn</hi> in reasoning had for the most parte, the common shiftes and ordinarie answers of Papists, to the places that were cited out of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: <hi>Campian</hi> had nothing but friuolous distinctions, framed of his owne heade vpon the seddaine, seldome, or neuer vnderstanding the argument of the booke, or place of the Doctors, that he was pressed withall. So that it might casilie appeare, that <hi>Sherwin</hi> was better studied, &amp; <hi>Campian</hi> quicker witted. In impudencie they were almost equall, sauing that <hi>Campian</hi> was impudent with arrogancie, <hi>Sherwine</hi> with more shew of humilitie. I wil note one example of <hi>Sherwins</hi> impudencie, and an other of his small knowledge in the Hebrewe tongue, wherein yet the Papists would beare vs in hand, that he was excellent. When after some priuate confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence had with him in <hi>M. Liuetenants</hi> lodging, within the tower of London, My <hi>Ladie Hopton</hi> chaunsed to speake somewhat against the licentious and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable life of the Cardinals, and cleargie of Rome; <hi>Sherwin said, if any such thing were, they should answere for it themselues: but he tooke the eternall God to witnesse, that those eyes of his neuer saw in the citie of Rome, which he had often walkedouer, that could offend his harte, or conscience;</hi> which

   <p>But let vs see what be the wordes of your publike challenge. <hi>We request you, yea we coniure you, either for trueths sake, if you seeke it: or for your owne credits sake, if yee will retaine it, that you yeald vs after so much sute and supplication, some equall triall, either by writing, preaching, or disputing</hi> Although we should not yealde either to your requeste, or to your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

<pb n="36" facs="20"/>
tried to be on our parte, that <hi>our credit</hi> in mainteining thereof cannot be cracked, if we should altogeather refuse any new triall. For why should you be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after. 24. yeares to any new <hi>triall,</hi> which refused in the beginning so lawfull and solemne a triall, as the like in any memorie was neuer offered in this lande? what <hi>sute or supplication</hi> you haue made I knowe not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you meane the seditious challenge of <hi>Campian,</hi> which was caste about as a lible, to erect and stirre the wauering mindes, of your inconstant disciples, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to expectation of some great alteration, not lawfully, and orderlie deliuered to them, to whome it was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, as <hi>an humble sute or supplication.</hi> Againe, there is noe reason, that vpon any sute or supplication, there should any further triall be graunted vnto you, that haue beene alreadie so often conuicted, &amp; condemned in the cause, as though the matter were stil in question or doubt with vs; but onely in respect of some weake, and doubtfull persons, vnto whose infirmitie, in hope of their satisfaction and full resolution, something may be yealded. For what wise man would graunt to the <hi>Manichees, Arrians, Macedonians,</hi> and such other absurde heretikes (so long since condemned) at this time any new triall or iudgement by publike disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, preaching, or writing, although they did neuer soe importunatelie craue it, yea (as you doc) adiure and coniure them to it? And seeing you are so indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, as you pretend, <hi>to enter into any equal trial, either by writing, preaching, or disputation,</hi> what maketh you so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement in calling for <hi>triall,</hi> when one of these waies neither is, nor can be denied vnto you, namelie <hi>triall by writing?</hi> yea you haue beene prouoked, and challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the most equal way of triall by writing, which is by syllogisme, to trie how you can vphold any of your heresies by vs condemned: whereunto you are now the rather to be called, because you complaine that <hi>Campian</hi> was not suffered to oppose. Set downe your
<pb n="37" facs="20"/>
syllogismes in the defense of any article of controuersy that you holde against vs, or in oppugning any point, of doctrine that we hold against you, either in writing or in print, so as they may come to our handes, &amp; you shal receiue a speedie and a readie answere. This triall you may haue without daunger, sute, or charges, if it were triall, and not treason, that you sought to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctize vnder pretext of <hi>publike trial, by preaching, or dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> Els what neede you be so importune for anie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall triall, when this the moste equal, the moste ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, the moste profitable triall, or way of triall, for finding out, and iudgeing on which side trueth doth stand, neither is, nor can be taken from you.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>There is noe reason in the world</hi> (you say) <hi>but onelie feare that may mooue vs to denie you this your request.</hi> But they that be wise can easilie iudge, that there is great reason to denie you anie such request, where your purpose is knowne to be sedition, and not triall: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse your request of triall by writing is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied you, as I haue saide before: vse it then when you thinke good, and make no more babling of <hi>triall,</hi> if you seeke nothing but triall, and be indifferent to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of these three kindes of triall.</p>

      <hi>The reason of the state</hi> (you saie) <hi>which is alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your request, is mosts vaine.

I haue touched some reasons alreadie: they that gouerne the state can saie much more. As for peaceable disputations vppon controuersies in religion, are dailie practized in our scholes, for excercise sake, in which all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments you can bring, are vrged as vehementlie, as you your selues can doe, in peaceable manner; and are so clearlie auoided, either by the answerer, or at lest by the moderator, as all reasonable hearers may

You fare like a cowardlie russian, which knowing a man to be bounde to the peace, will make no end of bragging, and challenging him to fight: but if anie man that is at libertie offer to trie a blow or two with him, he is as colde to the combate, as he was before hotte to the challenge.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>You offer your selues to the labor, charges, and perill of life,</hi> and yet you aske <hi>for your safeties such a warrant from her Maiestie, as the late councell of Trent did offer to all prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of the world.</hi> If you offer your selues to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of your liues, what need you anie warrant for your safeties: except you thinke her maiesties warrant is no better then such as is giuen by popish Councels and princes, which notwithstanding anie safecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits, leagues, truces, or warranties of safetie, are at their libertie to make contrarie Canons, and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute most cruell burnings, massacres, and murthers of Gods saints and innocent lambes, which haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

their liues into such faithlesse tyrants hands. But God be praised, her highnes honour hath neuer bene blemished with the least spotte of vnfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that you should seare notwithstanding her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties warrant, anie daunger to your liues, or boast that you offer your selues to perill of life, when you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund a warrant for your safeties, without the which you dare not so much as vtter your name, that be the challengers. And therefore it were a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous sute for <hi>a warrant,</hi> that our ministers shoold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence in your behalfe, when they know not what you are, nor what warrant you haue, from any learned Papists to make such large offers, vponwarrant of your safteties: seeing it is knowne, that the best learned of your side in England, haue not only refused the same, but some also iudged al disputation to be vnprofitable.</p>
   <p>Your offers I confesse are verie large, as <hi>that we shal appointe in what kinde and number, at what time, to what place, you shal come, either our countrey men onely, or strangers to dispute in our vniuersities before the learned onelie, that you giue vs leaue to call all the learned protestantes of Europe for our defence, you taking onelie our owne countrimen: That you giue vs leaue to oppose or defend, begin or end or vse anie prerogatiue that maie not impugne the indifferencie of triall.</hi> But when you aske, <hi>what we can alleadge why we should not accept this,</hi> We answere, that beside manie causes, not here needefull to be rehearsed, though before in parte touched, we alleadge for this present, that we do not beleeue that you are able to performe anie of these liberall offers, except we see matter of greater credit, then an epistle of an vnknowne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, written to <hi>Master Charke</hi> a priuate man. If you had shewed vs such warrant or commission, as wee might probablie haue beene perswaded of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of these promises, you might more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie haue required, what we had to alleadge, whie we did not accept them: but now there is noe reason in
<pb n="40" facs="22"/>
the worlde, that we should intreate with our Prince &amp; Magistrates vppon these friuolous wordes of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure hedge-creeper, or boasting bench-whistler for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing we knowe: <hi>I am in the name of all my fellow Catholikes to renew, &amp;c: Once againe I saie to you ministers, &amp;c.

If <hi>Master Charke,</hi> a man well knowne by his name, should make the like offer to you, by such an other printed epistle, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your offer, should promise you as great warrant as you require, at home or abroad, and moreouer to beare your expenses, rather then you should saile to appeare at anie time or place by him assigned, is your simplicitie so great, that you would keepe the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted daie, and place of disputation, vppon his pure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, without further assurance? And yet you can not misse to heare of him, &amp; his dwelling place at London: whereas we know not to whome, nor whether to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnethe warrant, that it may come to you: except per haps youwould haue it proclamed with sound of trum pet, &amp; sent into all partes of the realme, that you maie heareof it. It maie be you will alleadge, that it is great
<pb n="41" facs="22"/>
daunger for you to appeare without warrant of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and noe perill for vs, to procure you assurance of safetie. But all wise men maie see, that we should deserue noe lesse punnishment by procuring such a warrant for you, vppon so light a grownde, if you did not accepte it, as you should incur, appearing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant, for anie difference in religion, if you be not guilty of fellonie or treason. If you ment nothing, but peaceable disputation for trial of truth, you would not make your challenge in printed libels, and sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pamphlets, but rather seeke it at the handes of them that haue authoritie to graunt it, by intercession of those forreigne princes, with whome you pretend your credit to be so great, that you can procure what securitie soeuer reasonablie we can demaund, in their dominions. But to vse anie such lawful meanes, I trowe you will make no haste, when you wil not accept that quiet forme of triall by syllogismes in writing, which by <hi>Doctor Fulke</hi> so manie yeares agoe was offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and yet is free for you to take, if it please you, and that without sute, without daunger, and to the best and surest triall of the trueth.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>But if we dare not venture with disputations, yet you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire vs to graunt you certaine sermons to encounter with vs vpon this matter.</hi> A verie reasonable request, I assure you. when you will graunt the like libertie of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in Spaine, or Italie, we will become suters for you to preach in England. Or if that also be to daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, we must procure you but a litle passage for your bookes, &amp; speciallie <hi>Master Charke</hi> must obteine licence &amp; free passage for this booke, vntil it be answered.

And yet it is more then you will doe for vs, to giue licence, that our bookes may be read of euerie man amonge you, with your confutations. And <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Windham</hi> then saide, that no wise state would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it. Neuerthe lesse our state, God be thanked, vpon conscience of trueth on our side, hath with no lesse wisedome, then good successe, alwaies permitted your bookes with our answers to them, to be read of all men to iudge indifferentlie, so they conteine nothing but question of religion, and not shamefull diffamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and inuectiues against the prince, and the state of gouernement: which matters deserue to be answered with an axe or an halter, rather then with penne and paper. But to permitte your bookes vnconfuted to haue free passage (althoughe they passe with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times lesse daunger, then ours maie doe among you) as you require, it were neither wisedome, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, equitie, nor reason.</p>
