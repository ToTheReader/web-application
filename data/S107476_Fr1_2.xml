   <p>BEcause the iudicials of Astrology <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> casting of figurs to tel fortunes seme rather childishe plaies then weighty matters for graue mē to be occupied with al. In so much as god himself threatneth that he will send out his plages &amp; powre forth his iudgements vpon the wicked, &amp; their so thsaiers and stargasers shall not know how nor when such things shal com vpon them. And our experience teacheth vs the same in the late famine among vs, in the losing of Calis, in the burning of Pouls and the destruction of other cities and contreis. Therfore am I bold thogh I be but a child to offer to the world soch things concerning the curiositie of that art, and the abuse of the same, as I bothe learned at the mouth of maister Caluine and red in his bokes: &amp; the rather because I do se that my former labor in the trans<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation of that epistle of <hi>Cicero</hi> vnto his brother <hi>Quintus</hi> hath not bene reiected.</p>
   <p>Now again if my labors may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any, I shal praise god, &amp; giue my self to further studies that I mai more ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mire gods glory, &amp; according to my smal talent profit his church, which thing that lord that is the only author of al wisdom and geuer of all goodnes grant me to do always to my lyues end. So be it.</p>
