   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>Courteous Reader.</p>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not so old as true, that Truth seekes (nay brooks) no Corners, though Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doth; for (in a word) to prove them both legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, it is as bold (with Discretion) as the other is modestly bashfull; it may (for a time) be blamed, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shamed; suspected, but not quite deiected; trodden on, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed; eclipsed, but not extinguisht; no, 'twill rise, and shine foorth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; comparable it is, and alike effectuall to the glorious Sunne, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his entrance (vpon least advantage) through the thickest Clouds into the darkest Dungeon; where a good sight receives his light at a little hole, and reioyceth in it.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>This short Treatise following (in part) expounds my meaning, being of a Voyage I made vnto the <hi>East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

Is no par cell of this discourse; yet notwithstanding, seeing that by one finger the whole hand may be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and by the foot the entyre bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy drawne out; I held it requisite (for good respects) this way to declare my selfe, and at this time especially; as high time (among many other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations more generall &amp; delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) in such briefe passages as seemd to me most considerable, and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

all offence or prolixity vnto any) to my purpose materiall; that the honourable Company themselues, or any else of iudgment (with content and pleasure in the sweete variety, and milde composure of matter) might from thence (accidently, or by the way onely) make a neere coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the true cause of my neglect there, &amp; vntimely departure thence, to their preiudize as my own, which here (in modesty) I silence.</p>
   <p>Hauing finished my Travayles, I made bold (in a plaine Epistle) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate them vnto the Honourable Companie, as most convenient me thought; but it pleased them not to accept thereof, for reasons to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues best knowne; which I suppose (for I hope the best) they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, (or it may so fall out) to my aduantage; for looke how many cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Readers, both of themselues and others (to whom in generall I

   <p>It was so full of loue, my lost De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication I mean (breifly preferd to all other graces, as holding the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent roome in euery grace and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, morall and diuine; compared likewise to fire, fine gold and siluer of the finest; and made illustrious by Pearles, Diamonds, and Pretious stones, (yet all vndervallued as tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles vnto him or her, in whom this divine Grace of Graces dwelleth, as being richer then all riches, supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all wants, healing all infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and sweeter also (in its blest ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects) then Hony and the Hony combe) with a reason (in a word or

   <p>My History it selfe (courteous Reader), here at hand attends thy leasure, and craues thy patience, at most but an hower or two, to suruey her partes; if perhaps (at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) they answer not thy expectation, as thinges too common, and alreadie past the presse; let not this diuert thee from that honest recreation which (in one respect or other) may
