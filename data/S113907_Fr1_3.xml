short day of mans life once goeth
downe, it neuer<note n="a" place="margin">Soles occide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re &amp; redire pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt: Nobis cum se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel occidit breuis lux, Nox est perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua vna dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enda.

deare, and too deare (being lost) for
all inestimable valewes to redeeme:
and health is the sweetnesse of life,
and the verie life of<note n="b" place="margin">Non est viue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re sed valere vita. Martial.</note> liuing, without which, men while
they liue are alreadie dead. Thou therefore that louest thy
life, and for thy life thy health, take counsell of a Physition
without a fee. So many and so infinitely do the numbers of
barbarous and vnlearned counsellours of health at this
time ouerspread all corners of this kingdome, that their
confused swarmes do not onely euery where couer and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse
the Sun-shine of all true learning &amp; vnderstanding
but generally darken and extinguish the very light of cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense and reason. It is euery mans office to do good for
goodnesse sake, and both my generall duty vnto a common
good, and my speciall bond vnto my friends, do earnestly
solicite me hereto, since no man (that as yet I heare) hath
hitherto vndertaken this taske. For their sakes therefore,
for whose harmes by vnskilfull hands I haue oft hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sorrowed, and for their loues, whose life and health
I wish heareafter preserued, and for their good who will
take paines to know it, I here commend (leauing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
mischiefe to the common care) vnto euerie particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
for himselfe this needfull detection of harmefull<note n="c" place="margin">Cui malus est nemo, quis bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus esse potest.</note> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours,
<pb facs="4"/>
and necessarie counsell for safe supplie (necessitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neuer more distractedly miserable in hard choyce of
good) in so common and confused multitudes of ill. For
the meanest readers sake (whom in this whole worke I
labour equally to obserue) I haue suited the plainnes and
simplicitie of a familiar style: and for facilitie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
reading haue also smoothed and cleared the streame
and current of this little volume, from the stops and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions
of vnusuall sounds and language (as farre as
the subiect will permit) refreshing onely the learned in
the margine. Neither haue I esteemed it any indecorum
for the meanest vnderstanding sake, together with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
cautions and rules to insert particular cases and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
which may be both an inducement to reade, and an
enticement to continue, example being neither least plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
nor least profitable vnto the vulgar. There shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in this following treatise described, first, such insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
workemen and practitioners, as this time doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
set forth, with their seuerall manners, defects and
dangers: and after shall succeed a plaine patterne of that
sufficient Artist, vnto whom with iudgement and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
satisfaction vnto thy owne vnderstanding, thou maist
commend thy health, and whom the Ancients, right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and experience haue euer allowed. I labour not in
this plaine discouerie with words to feast prodigalitie, nor
hope altogether for want of correspondence vnto satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to macerate frugall satietie. Few words do best hold
<note n="d" place="margin">Citò dicta Percipiunt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles animi, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentque fideles. Horat.</note> memorie, and a short taste doth breede more eager ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.
I will therefore onely briefly point the common
forgetfulnesse by bare aduertisement to better memorie,
which after may better thence guide it selfe to more
<pb facs="4"/>
large and accurate consideration. This plaine endeauour
begotten of succisiue houres by good desire, thy proposed
benefite (deseruing Reader) hath here brought forth into
this common light. Enioy therefore therein what seemeth
liking, or of vse: the rest thy wiser thoughts may either in
reading, abstract, or thy ingenuous mind compare with
that is better, or by it selfe censure as a cipher. Farewell.</p>
