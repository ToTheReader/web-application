      <hi>foolish pitty in me to spare that which will be spent: yet haue I euer dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my poore labours to the eare only, that therby (if God would) they might bee conuaied to the heart: not vnto the eye with a desire to haue them exposed to the censure of the world. Notwithstanding mine own priuate iudgement &amp; resolution, mistake me not, I can very well digest the publishing of other mens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>

      <hi>For as</hi> Simonides <hi>seeing a man silent at a feast, sayd vnto him; If thou beest a wise man, thou art a foole for concealing thy wisdome: if a foole, then thou art wise for not reuealing thy folly: So, I hold it wisdom in them which are enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with extraordinary gifts, to impart their graces vnto the world: But as for those to whom knowledge hath either not dawned, or not so plentifully shined as vpon their fellows, I aduise them as</hi>

I iustly ranke my selfe amongst the later sort, and would haue followed the counsell that I giue to others, but that I am weyed against my owne mind by such reasons as I hope wil passe for weighty in the iudgements of others as wel as of my selfe. When by the commandement of the right reuerend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of London (by whom I was and euer will gladly be commanded) I was called vnto this seruice, and deliuered this sermon in that honourable presence where it was bestowed, I found that it was swoln farre too bigge for the time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to that exercise: which might by me haue been more fitly proportioned to the time, if I had endeuoured (as heretofore I haue done) to drawe my speech into knots and borders, and set my words checkerwise for the delight of the eare only. But I thanke my good God, who hath set me in the country to be schooled by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience (which teacheth fooles and all) at whose hands I haue learned to intend not mine owne credit, but the glory of my great Master, and the soules health of the Lambes of his little flocke.

      <note n="d" place="margin">Math 10. 19</note> in illa hora, <hi>we (I say) cannot digest our matters by the clocke: and therfore (my case being such)</hi> I <hi>was forced to cut off much of that which</hi> I <hi>had prouided, and to mangle that which</hi> I <hi>spake, because</hi> I <hi>breathed with an eager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire toward the end of my text. Neither was it my length only that crossed my

      <hi>These are the reasons which induce me to present that vnto the eye, in his full shape and proportion, which came maimed vnto the eare, and much abbridged for want of time. Vnto mine own purpose, for publishing hereof, there hath not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the concurrence of the desires of men of good sort and ranke. Neither could</hi> I <hi>want one to patronize it beeing published; for God hath giuen mee some honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and worthy friends: among the rest, the right reuerend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of</hi> Hereford <hi>my Diocaesan, to whom (vnder God)</hi> I <hi>am indebted for much of my liuelihood in this world:</hi>
