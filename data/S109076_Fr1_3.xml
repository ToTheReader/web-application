   <head>THE PREFACE TO <hi>the Readers.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL men naturally desire happines All their plots, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and endevours aime at this
end on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Wherefore it is and alwayes hath been free and very commendable, for all men to learne
<pb facs="4"/> and seek happines in all good ways To tell what they have learn'd and to doe good to
themselves and others, according to their genius abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, opportunities, and occasions.
Having therefore had more leisure then sometimes I wisht to have, and therin also the
opportunity to peruse many good Authors, I thought not amisse (to avoid idlenesse and
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and to recreate and please my selfe) to search and study for true joy and
happinesse. And having col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected many notes concerning Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall, Morall, and divine
happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse on earth, I have since written the same together in a Booke and as well as my
weaknesse could, digest
<pb facs="4"/> the same into such a manner, method and stile, as I thought best, with such
alterations, additions, intermixtions, and inventions, as met with my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations; intending the
same at first onely for private use. I had thought to have written in this Epistle divers
reasons moving mee to publish this little Treatise before the rest which I have written of
this subject. But if I should, the same would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Epistle too long for the Booke:
Nor is it expedient to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize, and tell you private reasons in print, I shall now
therfore concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter onely tell you, that having lately publisht a little Booke being
one particular part of <hi>Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb facs="5"/> Happinesse</hi> (as this is a generall part therof.) The Epistle therein, to the
Reader, may with very little alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on serve to this Book also, to which (if you be not
satisfied,) I referre you.</p>
   <p>And since I have made use of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Authors; And found much happinesse in the
inquisition and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy therof, I cannot but hope there are some things herein worthy your
perusing. Nor is it a crime, as some would seeme to mayntaine, to make use of Authours; It
rather argues conceitednesse, vain-glory, and folly in such men, who think it Pedanticall and
weaknesse; to stoop to and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge other mens authority and opinions as being opposite
to their
<pb facs="5"/> affected humours and stile, when as themselves indeed gaine all their knowledge
from others. And now, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> is said; No new thing can be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten which hath not been before.</p>
   <p>Yet by composing a Book in a new manner, method, and stile, by alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, adding to,
abridging, and som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times converting to other purposes, the same may seem to be (and be as
usefull) as if it were all new, and which to doe is often as difficult, and requires wel-nigh as
much art, as wholly the invention of new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and is better to be esteemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause more
authenticall.</p>
   <p>I should have done well indeed, to have cited Authours, But being at
<pb facs="6"/> first written for private use I negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the same, and now cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem that
neglect, or if I could the Treatise, in respect of the stile inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixions, abstractions,
additions, and alterations in divers places would not well admit therof. But although it be truly
said that no new thing, can be said or written which hath not been (to the same effect)
before; yet may it be said of this Treatise in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall (aswell of the composition
thereof) that the same is new, in as much as never any man (that I can reade of) hath written any
Book of this subject, Namely, the enjoying of earthly happinesse freely and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
(though in the good use therof)
<pb facs="6"/> and with a heavenly minde: But of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e contempt thereof many Bookes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ave been written,
and yet the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>est contemners of earthly felicities, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> their Bookes will sometimes
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>esse this truth, That in the good use <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>hereof the same may be enjoyed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>reely and
cheerfully. And that such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ree enjoying, and the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ns thereof may excite us to Pietie,
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eavenly joy and happinesse.</p>
   <p>Concerning the stile and method, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> affect not too much nicenesse and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uriosity. Nor
on the otherside, too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uch loosenesse and indigestion. My <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ndevours have been to
compose the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ame in a serious, yet free and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ng way. But, I confesse, my ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb facs="7"/> are very weak and worth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lesse, whch I tell you; and truly te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> you, because I had
much rather yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> should be possest with a prejudicat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> under opinion, then great
expectati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on; It is easier to make the one fals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> then the other true, I could wish in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed,
that I were able to raise Medita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions as high as Heaven from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> Earth. But the consideration
of my weaknes, and unworthinesse deject<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> me.</p>
   <p>But the Abstracts, I confesse, I have beene but little used to study in tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> way. And
they were but a late exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of a short time for recreation and to try conclusions. In them
also I have not much cared for niceness o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <pb facs="7"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>uriosity, but takē a free liberty. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ooke were (perchance) in a wise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ans
judgmēt, better without them. But in my weak judgement the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ay be read (as they were
written) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o recreate the minde. Also to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>en the memory. They are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>ed (considering
the subject) in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ew and, I hope, pleasing manner, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nd free from unnecessary Poeticall
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>dditions, fained allegories, Parables, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nd consequently from obscurity, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>iousnesse,
and most befitting the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>bject.</p>
   <p>Concerning the Title, it is usuall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o prefixe titles to Books in these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>imes, perchance
better then they deserve, and as some thinke, a kinde
<pb facs="8"/> of policy. If therfore you thinke have herein done amisse I have pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dents for
it. Notwithstanding; think the Book in divers respects i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> correspondent to the Title, and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
very well befit the same. However would desire you to expect onely a very short discourse
upon each of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> severall heads or Sections; a view wherof you may see in the Analysis If you
look for more you are not like in this Book to finde it.</p>
   <p>How necessary this Treatise is, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe will shew. I conceive there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a
greater motive to stirre us up to vertue and pietie, then to shew (against the pernitious
opinion of the World conceiting the contrary)
<pb facs="8"/> that vertuous and pious men even in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>is life may enjoy much more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nesse than
vicious impious men. That this truth may more plainly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ppeare, I shall endevour hereafter to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ew
the same more particularly and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ainly, also to search further and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
