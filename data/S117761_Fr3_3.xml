   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Race and peace bee with thee Christē reader. I am sure there are many that will much meruell &amp; coūt it a great presumptiō that I beyng so young and of so small learnyng dare attempt to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute <note place="margin">Not who speaketh, but that whiche is spoken is to be weyed most.</note> this matter against these thre per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages of the which nūber two, that is to say, my Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> are auncient men both of great witte, and dignitie. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I will desire thē paciently, to heare myne aunswere, not aduertisyng who speaketh the wordes, but rather what is sayd. And as cōcernyng myne youth, let them remember what Paule monisheth. i. Timot. iiij. willyng that <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> Timotheus should instruct the cōgre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration <note place="margin">The holy ghost inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth where, when, and on whom he pleaseth.</note> and that no mā should despise his youth: for as the spirite of God is bound to no place, cuē so is he not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict to any age or person, but inspireth when hee will and where he will, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng the young to see visiōs and espye the truth, and the elders to dreame dreames, and to wander in phantasies Actes. 2. Ioel. 2. <note place="margin">Actes. 2.</note>
   </p>
   <p>And as touchyng my learnyng I must nedes acknowledge (as the truth is very small, neuerthelesse that litle <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> (as I am bound, haue I determined, by Gods grace) to bestow to the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The talent of our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng is to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difiyng of Christes congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of Christes congregation which I pray god to encrease in the knowledge of his word.</p>
   <p>I would not that any man should admit my wordes or learnyng, except they will stande with the Scripture, and be approued therby. Lay them to the touchstone, and trye them with Gods word. If they be found false and counterfaite, then damne them, and I shall also reuoke them with all myne hart. But if the Scripture allow them, that you can not deny but it so is, then resist not y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> doctrine of God, but know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge your ignoraunce and seduction, and returne gladly into the right way. <note place="margin">Wilfully to resist Gods worde, is sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the holy ghost.</note> For if you cā not improue it by Gods word, and yet, of an hate and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mynde that you beare to the truth labour to resist it &amp; condemne it that it should not spread: I ensure you your sinne is irremissible and euen agaynst the holy ghost, and the bloud of them <note place="margin">Ezech. 33.</note> that perish for fault of instruction shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be required on your handes. <note place="margin">Obiection.</note>
   </p>
   <p>Peraduenture some of you will say, your fathers &amp; old progenitours▪ with many holy men and Doctours haue so beleued &amp; that therfore you will abyde by the old. I aunswere: The wayes &amp; <note place="margin">Aunswere.</note> iudgementes of God are meruelous, who knoweth whether God haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred his elect to erre and be seduced for a season, to the entent that the vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full which would not beleue the truth, but had pleasure in iniquity might stō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at their errour into their vtter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion <note place="margin">1. Thess.</note> and ruine? Although a man be neuer so faythfull and holy, yet is there much imperfectiō in him as long as he <note place="margin">Our imper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuen tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough faith in Christes bloud.</note> is included in this mortall body, how be it, it is not imputed vnto him, but through y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fayth in Christes bloud who lye pacified and forgeuen. And therfore it is not sure, that we folow their exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our workes or other imaginatiōs, but let vs euer cōferre them vnto the pure word of God, and as the Scripture te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth so let vs receaue them.</p>
   <p>My Lord of Rochester doth testifie <note place="margin">The By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chesters owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyng the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of the scriptures in his time, and long a for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> that.</note> him selfe writyng vpon the xviij. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, that there are many pointes both of the Gospels and other Scriptures which are now discussed more diligēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more clearely vnderstand, then they haue bene in tymes past. And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth furthermore that there are diuerse places in Scripture yet some deale darke, which he doubteth not, but that they shalbe more open and light vnto our posteritie, for why shal we dispaire of that (saith he) sith that the Scripture is for that entent left with vs, that it may be vnderstād of vs exactly, and to the vttermost point? Of this may you euidently perceaue that the old fathers and holy Doctours haue not sene all the truth. But somewhat is also left, through the high prouision of God, to be discussed of their successours. And therfore is it not mete, that we straight wayes cleaue vnto their wordes, with out any further ensearchyng the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but we must examine all thyngs by the Scriptures although. S. Paule or Peter should preach it vnto vs, as we see experience Actes. xvij. that whē <note place="margin">Actes. 17.</note> Paule preached, the audience dayly searched the Scriptures, whether it were as he sayd.</p>
   <p>But you haue bene of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance <note place="margin">The cause of our blind<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, and grosse er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</note> secluded from the scriptures, whiche is cause of such grosse errours as ye are now fallen in, so that ye could neither search them, nor yet once looke on them. Alas what blindnes doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
<pb n="4" facs="259"/>
our eyes? Are ye so childish to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue that the same worde whiche hath made the vnfaythfull and heretickes, faythfull and Christen in tymes past, is nowe so farre altered that it should cause the faythfull and Christen to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come heretickes? I praye God open your eyes. Howbeit wee may nowe well tast at our fingers endes that we haue long bene in that miserable case that Paule prophesied vppon vs. ij. Thes. ij.<note place="margin">2. Thess 2.</note> that God hath sent vs strong delusions because we would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> knowledge of the truth: what greater delusion can we haue, then to thinke that the very woorde of God, whiche was written for our comforte, which is the very fode and sustenaunce of our soules, whiche is the sure met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde and perfect touchstone that iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and examineth all thynges:<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> to thinke (I saye) that this wholesome worde should be our poyson and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation?</p>
   <p>And all be it our forefathers haue lyued without it and receaued all for truth that our Prelates belyes haue i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined: yet is not theyr fault &amp; ours a like (although I can not excuse their ignoraunce but that it is sinne before the face of God) for they had not the light of Gods word opened vnto thē. <note place="margin">Voluntary ignoraūce, not to bee excused.</note>Nowe sith we haue the light declared vnto vs, and yet will procede in blynd ignorauncie and not conferre and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine these iugglyng mistes with the light of Gods word, our ignoraunce is wilfull and without excuse.</p>
   <p>Suffer therefore all thynges what soeuer they be, to be tryed and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Scripture. If they be true then shall the Scripture doe them no hurt, but stablish and strēgthen them, for the Scripture discloseth nothyng but falsehead, and cōdemneth nothyng but that is damnable.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">The cause of Iohn Frithes writyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gatory.</note>And now to descend vnto our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and disputation whiche is of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, I shall shew you what occasiō I had to take it in hand. I wrote a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto a certaine frende in England, desiryng hym instantly to send me cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bookes which I though necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for my vse, and were not to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in these parties, as the Chronicles, Syr <hi>Thomas Mores</hi> booke agaynst the Supplication of Beggers, and certein other. These bookes I receaued vpon S. Thomas day before Christmasse, the yeare of our Sauiour a. M. ccccc. &amp; xxx. with a letter written in this forme: Sir I haue sent you such bokes as you wrote for, and one moe of <hi>Rastels</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, wherin he goeth about to proue Purgatory, by naturall Philosophie: whiche thyng (quoth he) I thinke be more easie to do, thē to proue it by any good Scripture. &amp;c. This stuffe recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I was meruelously desirous and tickled to see what reasons he brought for his probations. And in the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and Prologe of the booke, he set seuen reasons which he sayd that fonde felowes alledged for thē to proue that there could be no Purgatory. And in deede they are very fonde that would deny Purgatory, if there were no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Argumentes to confute it then hee assigneth. But by Gods grace I will propounde vij. times seuen which shal haue such pith, that their paineful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory shall not bee able to abyde the worst of them, for these seuē that <hi>Rastell</hi> assigneth are not worth one Beane.</p>
   <p>When I had read and well ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red these reasons, I thought that hee should sharpely haue confuted thē, as he might full well haue done, specially sith they were but of his owne imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Neuerthesse when I came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his solutions I founde not one but it had certaine poyntes repugnaūt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Scripture (vnto which our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must euer be obediēt)<note place="margin">Mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must be obedient to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> yea and also they were extremely iniurious vnto Christ and his precious bloud.</p>
   <p>Then left I him, &amp; read: Syr <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Mores</hi> booke, to see what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might bee brought for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and after that made I diligēt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to come by my Lord of Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters booke which also writeth on the same matter, and when I had well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined their reasons and had sene the order and processe of the Scriptures whiche they alledged:<note place="margin">Aulus Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</note> I founde that clearely verified whiche <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> sayeth, that it were a great deale bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a man to bee sharpely rebuked yea and openly to haue his faultes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished of his enemy, then to bee cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and slenderly praysed of his frende.<note place="margin">The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of an open enemy better then the sclender prayse of a frend.</note> For a mans enemy ensearcheth nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly and gathereth together all that he can imagine, and so accuseth a man more of a fumous heate then of any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: and therfore the audience (if they be wise) consider his woordes theraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so geue very small credence or els none vnto them. But if a mans frende before audience doe prayse hym slenderly and coldly, it is an argument that the person is very faultie, for a frende beholdeth all qualities and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstaunces,
<pb n="5" facs="259"/>
his byrth, bringyng vp, &amp; what feates hee hath done all hys lyfe long: yea and applieth many thynges vnto his frendes prayse, whiche serue but sinally for it, for he will leane no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behynd that may be imagined to employ his frendes fame and honour. Now if in all these pointes he can not colour out a glorious apparant laud, but is compelled for lacke of matter to prayse his frēd slenderly, then (if the au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diēce be wise) they may soone cōiecture that he is no prayse worthy, &amp; also may well doubt whether that small prayse which he gaue him be true or not. Euē so, when I had read these bookes of Syr <hi>Thomas More</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> and saw the small probations &amp; slender reasons that those two witty and learned men had brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme Purgatory: considering also that they are the chiefest frendes, proctours and patrones therof, and that they had applied many reasons and Scriptures for their purpose (for lacke of matter) that rather made against them: yea and not that onely, but also that they dissen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted betwene them selues in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations: for <hi>M. More</hi> sayth that <hi>there is no water in Purgatory.</hi> And my Lord <note place="margin">M. More &amp; my Lord of Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster can not agree.</note> of <hi>Rochester</hi> sayth that <hi>there is water. Master More</hi> sayth that <hi>the ministers of the punishmēt are deuils.</hi> And my Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi> sayth that <hi>the ministers of the punishment are aungels. Master More</hi> sayth, <hi>that both the grace and charitie of them that lye in the paynes of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are increased.</hi> My Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi> saith, <hi>that the soules in Purgatory obtain there neither more fayth nor grace nor charitie then they brought in with them.</hi> These thynges cōsidered, it made mine hart yerne and fully to cōsent, that this their paynefull Purgatory was but a vayne imagination, and that it hath of long time but deceaued the people and milked them from their money.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding God hath left vs two Purgatories. One to purge the <note place="margin">The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatoryes, that God hath ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> hart and clense it from the filth whiche we haue partly receaued of Adam (for we are by nature the children of wrath. Ephe. ij.) and partly added thereto by consentyng vnto our natural infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. This Purgatory is the word of God as Christ sayth. Iohn. xv. Now <note place="margin">Iohn. 15.</note> are ye cleane for the worde whiche I haue spoken vnto you. This purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory of the hart.</note> obtayneth no man but thorough fayth, for the vnfaythfull are not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the word of God, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes and Phariseis were nothyng the the better for hearing his word but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the worsse for it was a testimony against them vnto their condemnatiō. And because we receaue this purgatiō <note place="margin">The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory of the hart, is fayth.</note> onely through beleuyng the word, ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore is the vertue of this purgyng ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied also vnto fayth, for Peter sayth. Act. xv. that the Gentiles hartes were purged thorough fayth, that is to say, through beleuing the word. And what word is that? verely the preaching that Christes death hath fully satisfied for our sinnes and pacified for euer the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath towardes vs. &amp;c. This fayth purifieth the hart and geueth vs a will and gladnes to do what soeuer our most mercyfull father commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs.</p>
   <p>Neuerthelesse because our infirmitie <note place="margin">The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> is so great, and our mēbers so weake and fraile that we cā not eschew sinne, as our hart would, and as our wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth: therfore hath God left vs an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Purgatorye whiche is Christes crosse. I meane not his materiall crosse that he him selfe dyed on, but a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all crosse which is aduersitie, tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, worldly depression. &amp;c. And this <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> is called the rodde or scourge of God wherewith he scourgeth euery sonne <note place="margin">The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory of the mēbers is the crosse of Christ.</note> that he receaueth, that we may remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber his law and mortifie the old Adam and fleshly lust which els would waxe so rebellious that it would subdue vs, raigne in vs, and hold vs thraull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sinne. When soeuer we haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a crime thē is God presēt with <note place="margin">Psal. 89.</note> this rod as he saith Psal. lxxxix. If they defile my ceremonies and not obserue my cōmaundementes, then with a rod shall I punish their sinnes and with beatyngs shall I reward their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but yet my mercy shall I not take from him neither will I deceaue hym of my promise.</p>
   <p>This crosse must we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>eceaue with a <note place="margin">God nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs to the crosse, to heale our infirmities.</note> glad hart and thanke our louing father for it, for it is but a medicine to heale our infirmitie and to subdue our rebel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lions members. But when our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are fully mortified, that is, when death hath subdued our corruptible bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy, and our flesh cōmitted to rest in the earth, then cease the Purgatories that God hath ordeined, &amp; then are we ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">So euill was the life of the Papistes that they imagined a Purgatory for them selues.</note> purged in his sight.</p>
   <p>If our Clergy could haue found in their hartes to haue taken these Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories vppon them, they had neuer neded to imagine any other, but sith their lyfe begā to waxe so dissolute, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially sith they should be the salt of the
<pb n="6" facs="260"/>
earth and lanternes of light: It was necessary for them to imagine Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory after this lyfe, for els they might be sure that the most part of them were neuer like to come in heauen.</p>
   <p>Iudge Christen reader whiche hast the spirite to discerne and knowest the voyce of Christe what reasons <hi>Rastell</hi> hath brought and how he hath soluted them: for in my mynde both his reasōs and solutions are so childish and vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, so vnlearned and baren, so full of faultes and phantasies, that I rather pitie the mans deepe ignoraunce and blindnesse (which hath so deceaued him selfe through Philosophie and naturall reason) thē I feare that he by his vaine probations should allure any man to consent vnto hym.</p>
   <p>Iudge and conferre the Scriptures which Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi> alledge for theyr opinion, and I doubt not but that God shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen thine eyes to espy that thing which hath blinded them.</p>
   <p>Iudge and compare the Scriptures together which I haue brought to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firme my purpose, ponder their reasōs and my solutiōs vnto them, and I am sure thou shalt perceaue that my small learnyng hath condemned theyr hyghe eloquence, that my foly hath brought to nought their wisedome, and that my youth hath disclosed their old and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred ignoraunce.</p>
   <p>And this is euen the old practise of <note place="margin">The wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</note> God: to chose the folish thynges of the world: to confound the wise: to chose the weake to confounde the mightye: And to chose the vyle thynges whiche are of no reputation: to confound them of high degree: that no flesh might bost it selfe in his sight to whom onely be prayse and thankes for euer.</p>
