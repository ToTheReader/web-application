      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the light of my life, (and candell of earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) was almost burnd out, good M. Doctor <hi>Seazar,</hi> it was Gods will I should addresse my selfe, and suite to our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Soueraigne the mighty <hi>Caesar</hi> of our world: who often times poured oyle into my wasting lamp, and finding in wants a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy maister of requests, that would not suffer my dimme candell blaze to be blowne out, so for my benifit you brake with her Maiestie, and brought from her gratious goodnesse the little I liue vpon, and am likely to die withall, which kind curtesie of yours (voyd of all taking of money) drew my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and hart in a manner out of my bowels, and my inward spirits to be so farre in your dept, that I searched the best of my inuentions to the bottom, the shallownes whereof was so great, that I found but little of contentment, fit to present you withal: Than I bethought me of a translation out of <hi>Plinie,</hi>
      <pb facs="3"/> 30. yeres agoe set downe in prose by me, <hi>Of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the ayre: Trembling of the earth, and warnings of the world,</hi> desirous euery day to publish in print that simple translation of mine, but long sicknesse held my good wil so far backe, that weake body saw no season to serue my hope. In the mean while a great learned doctor called doctor <hi>Holland</hi> most learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with great payne translated all <hi>Plinies</hi> workes, I hearing thereof reioyced much, because his torch would blaze so cleere, that the blindest sight in the world should thereby see where the sweete kirnell lay, when the hard shelled nut was crackt and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so cunningly. So taking his gallant booke as a witnes of my labors (though I neuer read one line of his translation) I boldly set foorth this worke of mine, hoping that you and the wise of the world, will accept and iudge as my paines and study may merit, in that trust and confidence I present the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of these paynes to your consideration and approued wisedome, confessing that neuer worke went from me with a greater good will nor lesse flattery, God so knowes, who increase in you grace and goodnes with worldly worship, what your owne hart desires.</p>
