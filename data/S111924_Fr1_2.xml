   <p>The diffuse and disorderly handling of these points, will also no doubt be yrksonne vnto the Reader, neither in deed take I anie pleasure therin: but let that be partly imputed to the confuse subiect (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

But vnto all the power, learning, deceipt, rage of the false Church, vve oppose that litle Booke of <hi>Gods vvorde</hi> which (as the light) shall reueale her, as the fire consume her, as an heauy milstone shall presse her and all her children, louers, partakers, &amp; abettors, downe to hell: which Booke, we willinglie receiue, as the iudge of al our controuersies, knowing that all men shall one day (&amp; that ere long) be iudged by the same: by this Booke who so is found in error or transgression, let them haue sentence accordinglie.</p>
   <p>Neither let the dreadfull, &amp; seuere iugments of GOD be lesse fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or esteemed, because they are pronounced by a frayle &amp; weake man, or that man or messenger be hardlier entreated, or iudged too seuere, because he doth deliuer the message of his Lord. The Lord assuredlie doth ratifie in heauen, whatsoeuer he pronounceth heere or earth; neither hath anie seruant of GOD power to alter &amp; change his maisters wil; they cannot loose that he bindeth, or lighten his yoke. Let then that state, people, or person, that findeth himself greeued at anie thing heere said, first inquire the truth therof in the word of GOD, &amp; so giue credit &amp; obedience accordingly; for whē<note place="margin">Amos. 3. 6. 7. 8.</note> the Lion roreth vvho should not feare when the Lord hath spoken, vvho should not prophecie.
