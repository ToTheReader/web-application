      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo extremities (dangerous)
there are which in these dayes
bringe no small detriment or
annoyance to the Church of
God. The one Atheistical prophanes, which
is fearful; and the other hipocritical conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is abhominable. And these how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they seeme to differ the one from
the other, yet the one is strengthned and
hardned by the other, and this with a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
reciprocation:</p>
   <p>Against both these, the holy Ghost applies
a soueraigne remedie: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Followe
after peace and holines, without which no man
cā see</hi> God. And <hi>Luk:</hi> 1.. 14. 15. <hi>That we being
deliuered from our enemies, might serue him
in holines and righteousnes</hi> (to auoyde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes)
<hi>before his face</hi> (to flye hypocrisie)
<hi>all our dayes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>
Of the latter of these, or rather of both,
(for the former oft times proceedeth from
the latter, howsoeuer for a while enuy palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth
it selfe vnder the name of zeale as both
are signified by one Greeke word) I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
an instance in this treatise following in
that congregatiō,<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>
      </note> which God hath made as
a spectacle for others to beware of rash, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and contentious courses.</p>
   <p>This haue I done (all other peaceable
meanes being before vsed) for the discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of mine owne duety both to God and
his Churches, the staying of others, who
would neuer be so affected to them as they
are, if they knew their fearefull estate.</p>
   <p>If eyther for the breuity or rudenes of the
stile it satisfie thee not: for the former I cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that I haue rather endeauoured to
point at things briefely, then by dilating to
fill vp large volumes, of purpose omitting
many the vilest thinges, partly for offending
chaste eares, partly for sparing them, vnlesse
further occasion be ministred by thēselues.
And as for the rudenes of the stile, either by
<pb facs="3"/>
superfluous repetitions, or redundant spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
let the inconuenience both of time &amp;
place something excuse me, being but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arriued, neyther enioying health, nor help
of bookes in the penning therof; my minde
also many waies distracted about other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses.
The time to come may bring foorth
some further thing more answerable to
thine expectation: In the meane time
accept this in the best part. And
the Lord giue thee vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in all thinges.</p>
