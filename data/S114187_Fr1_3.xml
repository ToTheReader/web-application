   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLEMEN,</hi> I vnderstand that the <hi>AVTHOR</hi> is so farre out of patience, to heare that this <hi>Pasquill</hi> is <hi>prest</hi> for the publike view, which was entended onely for the priuate satisfaction of his peculiar friends, that hee will not greet the <hi>READER</hi> so much as with a Letter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations; yet considering that in these dayes we are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carryed away with <hi>Fashions,</hi> and that it is quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the custome to put forth a <hi>Poem,</hi> without a <hi>Dedicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie preamble,</hi> let mee I pray you make bold, for want of a better scholler, to salute the courteous <hi>Reader</hi> with a few words of Complement. Who the <hi>Author</hi> is I know not, &amp; therefore on his behalfe I will be silent; yet I heare that hee is of the minde of that merry <hi>Huntsman,</hi> which would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giue nor sell his Hare, but when he saw the <hi>Trauailer</hi> gallop away with her, and that hee was out of hope to haue her againe, he cryed out, <hi>Take her,</hi> Gentleman, <hi>I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow her on you.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Poem,</hi> although I shall be thought to be <hi>sutor vltra crepidam,</hi> yet in my opinion, it is a tollerable <hi>Pint</hi> of <hi>Poeticall Sherry,</hi> and if the <hi>Muses Seller</hi> afford no worse wine, it will make <hi>Sacke</hi> better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, and goe downe the merrier.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="3"/>What the peeuish, puritanicall, and meager <hi>Zoilist</hi> out of his malitious humour shall calumniate, it skils not, for as the Prouerbe is, <hi>aut bibat, aut abeat:</hi> This dish was not drest to set his Dog-teeth on worke, and therefore if he like not these <hi>Lettice,</hi> let him pull backe his lips, for as the <hi>Poet</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Ʋirg. de Liuore.</note>
      <q>
         <l>Non lux, non cibus est suauis illi,</l>
         <l>Nec potus iuuat, aut sapor lyaei,</l>
         <l>Nec si pocula <hi>Iupite,</hi> propinet, &amp;c.</l>
      </q>
He was borne with teeth, and grynd when he first came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, he feedes vpon snakes, drinks small-beere and vinegar, keepes no good <hi>company,</hi> liues without <hi>charitie,</hi> and dyes without <hi>honestie; hic finis Zoili.</hi> Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the <hi>ingenious</hi> and <hi>candidous Readers,</hi> and all those fat honest men which are of a franke and sociable disposition, I dare be bold to promise, that this dish of drinke will not be distastfull vnto any of their stomackes, for as they haue bodies of a better constitution, so are their minds more fairely qualified, and their iudgements freer from corruption: and therefore to their taste is this <hi>Pinte</hi> of <hi>Poetrie</hi> dedicated, which if it seeme pleasant to their <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> let mee be well payd for presenting them with it in paper, and I rest satisfied.</p>
