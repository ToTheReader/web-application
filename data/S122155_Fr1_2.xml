   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo things (good Reader) have been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore controverted between Mr. Iohnson and mee, the one concerning the Power of the Christian church, which he would have instal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Ministerie thereof: the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Antichristian church of Rome, with the ministerie and baptisme thereof, which he hath pleaded to be true, though corrupted; I have proved to be false and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytfull. These things have passed publikly (through mine Opposites occasion) in Mr Richard Cliftons <hi>Advertisement,</hi> and my <hi>Animadversion</hi> therto. The former of these two points, Mr. Iohnson hath left vnanswered; so the prudent may judge of the strife, by that which we both have sayd: the latter, he hath sought to mainteyne by a colourable Plea for the Romane church, cheifly underpropped by two reasons, 1. because Antichrist should <hi>sit in the Temple of God; 2.</hi> and because Apostate Israel (the figure of this Antichristian church,) was the church of God; as he pretendeth. These, with his other like reasons, I have laboured to refell, in this treatise folowing. His order of handling them, I have altered; beginning with the Church of Rome; then with the Baptisme of that church: for so I judge the trueth of the controversie wil soonest appeare. His often longsome repetitions, I seek to abridge; as being fruitlesse, &amp; wearisome to the Readers: his bold and bitter taunts, I passe over; being not willing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer any man (and least of all the dead,) to such things. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so his marching us among the Anabaptists, for our more disgrace: his dissembling of his own former judgment and accord with us, in the things now controverted; imputing them to us and others, when himself hath formerly spoken and written for the things
<pb facs="3"/>
which he now would pull down; but hath not taken away his owne grounds. Onely wheras in his preface he intimateth <hi>sundry ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest untruthes</hi> published in the Animadversion, but nameth none: I signifie in a good conscience, that to my knowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished not any one untrueth, but rather spared him, then pressed things in extremitie. That which I suppose he aimeth at, I set downe from the report of honest faithfull witnesses, (of whome some are now at rest in the Lord,) who would not (as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded) willingly have related any thing but the trueth. Finally, as in all other my labours, so in these controversies following, I indevour to find out &amp; manifest the way and wil of God, by the light of his word; to the glorie of his name, and comfort of those that love the trueth in sinceritie.</p>
