   <head>¶ <hi>Francisco Sansouino</hi> to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Rodolph</hi> the second.</head>
   <p>MOst happie and fortunate Emperour, there is nothing more necessary for a Prince in this world thē Histories, for so much as being the mirrours &amp; maisters of our life: they shew and teach vs what the gouernment of a cittie and Prouince ought to be, what lawes we ought to institute &amp; cause our subiects to obserue, in what manner to increase &amp; maintain diuine worships, in what sort to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise morall vertues, and how to reape benefit of counsell in our affaires of importance: heerof it came to passe, that histories were called of wise men most noble, for their antiquitie, for so much as by them we receiue the creation of this huge worlde, and the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of mans generation. For their perpetuitie: because they haue endured with the world, and shall continually endure, alwaies wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp humaine Actions, for the benefit of our posteritie. For their dignitie: in respect they befit to be read and known, as the proper art and science of Emperours, of Kings, of common weales, and of great Lords and captaines, for their generalities: considering that in histories we finde written, in euery tung, in euerie Prouince, and in euerie age, those things that haue falne out either well or euil. For their iustice: because they do honour and dishonour, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doth merite &amp; deserue the same: giuing due praise to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of vertue &amp; valour, and dispraise to the vile filth of vice and idlenes. For their subiect: for that they do entreate of great things, the acts of great men which they haue accomplished to the intent to enlarge, to preserue, and to sway rule. For their end: because the same is no other, thē to sacrifice trueth to eternitie. For their profit: for the making vs to beholde thinges past, we may prudentlye by their meanes foresee that which is to come, and therfore it came to passe in former &amp; auncient time, many excellent Princes and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours not content with the glory they had gotten through their wise and valiant acts: did greatlye desire also to ioyne vnto their name this other glory, that is: eloquently to haue written histories, as did <hi>Augustus,</hi> after him <hi>Adrianus,</hi> and finally <hi>Gordianus</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours of your Maiestie. To this therfore hauing applied my studie, not to obserue onely what the cuntries, the mountaines, and <pb facs="5"/> the riuers and flouds of this world are, or to haue knowledge, how embassages were sent, of Parlaments, of the managing and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of affaires, or to vnderstand the voyages of armies, their order in ranging battailes, their encamping, their Stratagems, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seegings, their expugnations &amp; their victories, but rather to drawe and suck out of all these particular things, the sap, the sweete and marrow, reducing them into precepts, for the commoditie of great persons, that being otherwise busied, neither haue they time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they well, continually apply thēselues in reading of histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which was the onely motiue that made me take in hand this book, wherinto if any prince or gouernour will looke, he may (as though it were in a bright christal glasse) incontinently beholde the substance that fully is contained, in the volumes of the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable auncient and moderne writers. And for so much as so worthie and noble food appertaines vnto Princes, and for that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Princes, your Emperiall Maiestie is of highest degree and dignitie: therfore comming toward your Maiestie with no lesse affection of minde, then that wherwithall I was enflamed, when I applyed my selfe about this profitable enterprise: I present the same most humbly at the feete of your Maiestie, to the intent, that with your sacred name, due &amp; perfect honor may be giuen to this worke, since it shalbe vnder the protection of your Emperiall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, who carying in his noble person, the greatnes and felicity of so many famous Emperours and Heroes, of that worthie house of <hi>Austridge,</hi> which through a long course of worlds, haue gouerned and shall gouern heerafter the sacred Empire, who being no lesse benigne and affable, then high in blood and honour▪ I assure my self, that he will not disdaine to look vpon the same, for although it be little in quantity, yet notwithstanding it is very great in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, since it containes in it self a Quintesence of those thinges that haue been written for the profit and commoditie of men, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Princes. Venice the 24. of February. 1578.</p>
