      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen as (right Honourable) I had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed this my short Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue against Atheisme: Considering the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of certaine godles men, who with scorne traduce such books which confute their errour; As
<pb facs="3"/> also the blinde zeale of others, which thinke bookes of this kind not fit for these daies, I thought it verie necessarye to shrowd my selfe vnder the protection of some Honourable person, Who for his authoritie might bridle the malice of the one, and for his daily experience in the estate of this Realme, might satisfie the other. In these respects, none seemed to mee so fit as your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who for your authoritie can and do daily punish the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious dealing of Atheists. And by reason of your dailye experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in your Courts of Starre-chamber and Chauncerie, You cannot but see how necessarie such bookes are for these times. For, albeit it be a great meanes
<pb facs="3"/> to deterre Atheists from hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offences, to pun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>sh seuerely malefactors (in which respect your Honour doe daily God and your Prince great seruice, and your Countrey great good:) Yet it cannot be vnknown vnto you, that by manifest and euident proofe to make knowne vnto all men; that there is a God who will iudge all men according to their workes, is the cheefest meanes to restraine men from offending. For it cannot bee, that he which is fully perswaded that there is a God who will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish those that do euill, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward those that do well, should be careles how they liue: Much lesse without feare, daily commit hainous sins, and continue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="4"/> all their daies. As in this present age so great a number doe, as neuer the like in former ages, which is an euident proofe, that there are now more then euer there were, (thogh they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse not in words) who think in their hearts there is no God. Most necessarie therefore it is, to plant this Doctrine in the hearts of men, that there is a God who as hee made all things, so continually hee gouerneth all thinges, vnto whome all men must giue account of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Presuming therefore on your Honours wonted fauor to all Schollers, and the great neede of bookes of this kind for these times, I am bould to craue your Honour to patrone
<pb facs="4"/> this my small treatise, wherein (I hope) you shall doe that which is gratefull to God, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me and others with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to set forth the glory of god; and bind me alwaies to praye for your Honours good suecesse, in all things you take in hand.</p>
