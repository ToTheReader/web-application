                 <title>Good newes to Christendome : Sent to a Venetian in Ligorne, from a merchant in Alexandria. Discouering a wonderfull and strange apparition, visibly seene for many dayes togither in Arabia, ouer the place, where the supposed tombe of Mahomet (the Turkish prophet) is inclosed by which the learned Arabians prognosticate the reducing &amp; calling of the great Turke to Christianitie. With many other notable accidents: but the most remarkable is the miraculous rayning of bloud about Rome. Done out of the Italian</title>

   <head>❧ <hi>The Translators Epilogue.</hi>

   <p>WHat I haue done, you now both see &amp; read. For it cannot be recalled, nor do I meane to make any apology, though it be but like a spiders cobweb, fit for nothing but sweeping away, least I proue like the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, that leaped reasonable well vpon the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine taking him in his bootes, but when he thought to put them of, and make apparent his further dexterity and strength, he came far short, and thus you shall read of Protogenes pencell, that hauing made an arteficiall dogge and comming to finish it, with the muzsled haire about his chaps, he still misliked it, and wiped it away, till at last casting his pencell from him in a rage, he effected that by chance, which all his art was defectiue in: For applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I haue now done a thing as we say, <hi>ex im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouiso,</hi> not caring to what vse the reader puts it to, so I haue my owne ends: yet as I heare, it will be likt, whether I will or no, and is meerely a tricke of blind fortune to out-face both good endeauours, and true scholership: For let me neuer be trusted, if euer so hood-winckt a
<pb n="38" facs="24"/> bayard aduentured before on so hard a stile, and durst publish it as a worke, either wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the viewing, or censuring. The obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Papist will storme, and the pedanticall humorist will sweare, if not sweat: the censorious traueller will smile, the nouelist will buy it, though it were a lye; and he that liues by an Almanack will suppose, there may be something in it for direction; the yong man may affect it, being himselfe not solid enough for a Critick; and some old men may be yong enough to entertaine it: The free-hearted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman will say, it was well done to affright idlenes with some endeuors; and the man of grauitie and learning will conclude it a deuise to get money. To get money; what as this world goes? In the name of Couetousnes, who would care for money? when euery mans dores are open to the hungry belly, euery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked soule clothed, euery empty purse filled, nay a man cannot looke sadly, but his friend will aske him, what he ayleth; and if want be the cause, send him a gratuitie the next morning; when our yong Ladies will leaue off their tiers, painting, and fethers to bestow it on poore Schollers, and a man shall no sooner character
<pb n="39" facs="24"/> a booke with a <hi>Moecenas,</hi> but the Lord will send all ouer the towne to looke him out, and not trouble him to waite vpon him: when the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney shall be spared, that was wont to be spent vpon Barbers, panders, and whores, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diuided amongst men of well-deseruing. In a word, when olde acquaintance will stay his Caroch in the streets to speake to his decayed frend; and when he comes home to negotiate with him, will send for him vp without excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, though he be in bed with his Lady. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this, considering my disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous improuidence, and dogged humor to snarle at the basenes of men indeed; I was glad it got money: For if the worst fall; I shall be able while it last to pay for my dinner, and preuent the cutting my throat, in expecting to be sent for else-where: yet good Reader, in way of ciuilitie, I would it could get you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too; that is, if you cannot beleeue it as truth, yet to make that vse of it, as if it were true; and then shall you know, there is but one way to happines, and all the praedictions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies, visions, apparitions, Comets, invnda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, stormes, tempests, famine, warre, altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="40" facs="25"/> and subuersion of Kingdomes, with all the cabinet of of mysteries, tend to this end, that proemium and <hi>poena</hi> be the mastring curbs of the world: that is, that God hath a <hi>Magazin</hi> of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to inflict on the obstinate sinner with punishments; and a store-house of mercy to support the penitent soule with comfort.</p>
