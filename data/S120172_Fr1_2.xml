The times shall euer bee cleared by prayer whensoeuer they looke sadly vpon vs. Our Brethren abroad cry stil in the Churches words. <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.20.</note>
      <hi>The harvest is past, and the Summer is ended, and we are not holpen,</hi> and wee (methinks) should add with <hi>Ieremie</hi> verse 21. <hi>I am sore vexed for the hurt of the daughter of my people, I am heauie, astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath taken me; Is there no balme at Gilead &amp;c,</hi> At home, howsoeuer the Lord hath beene gracious to vs in the scarcitie, yet we may
<pb facs="3"/>in most places, <note place="margin">
         <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.20.</note> take vp the Prophets words in another sence, <hi>Is the seede yet in the Barne? as yet the Trees haue not beene deliuered of their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then?</hi> Looke into the 65 <hi>Psalme,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 65.9. <hi>10.11.</hi>
      </note> and thou shalt find that it is the Lord that finds both ground and seede, that giues both growth and ripening to the Corne, and therefore wee should waite vpon him with our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents of praise &amp; prayer, this were enough to make vs pray, but this is the least of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny motiues, for <hi>Reader</hi> thou seest the times, the World is now all eare and tongue, the most giuen with the <hi>Athenians</hi> to little els then to heare and tell newes, (vncertaine newes, <note place="margin">Demonol. l. 3 c. 1. ad finem.</note> the Authour of all lies as his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie hath told vs) the rest are willing also to heare, and to heare Gods Truth, not Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and therein they doe but as S. <hi>Iames</hi> would haue them, so as they would add doing to hearing as hee commaunds. But alas, whilst we only professe and discourse of Religion, we driue the practise of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion out of the world, as one too iustly complaines. <note place="margin">Sir <hi>W. Ral.</hi> preface</note> It is lamentable to consider the little vse that is made of Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in most places; Preachers too often (I
<pb facs="3"/>tremble to speake it) be vsed like post hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, spurd on till they be spent, and then a fresh is called for, in the meane the world sits still and thinks to be saued for hearing. <hi>Reader,</hi> Mourne for this, weepe for this, for this boades a Iudgement, the Lord will rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon for the blood of his Prophets spent as well as shed. To these reasons, it will not be hard for thee to add more, looke within thee, and round about thee, and so stirre vp thy selfe to this exercise of Prayer, an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise (I can assure thee) of vnspeakable strength and comfort, an exercise without which thou canst not liue, and by which thou mayest liue in the mouth of death. Beleeue it, wert thou in an estate, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate then death, in a place worse then hell, yet if there thou couldest pray truely, thou shouldst find comfort and strength beyond hope, for Prayer is better then our hopes, and yet God is better to vs then our prayer. First, for that which is publique, follow him who was no time-server, make no small account of publique prayers. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for priuat, pause before thou speak, remember who spake it, if a man would
<pb facs="4"/>not deliuer an Oration to a Prince <hi>extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> and so dainely, it will not become vs to open our mouths rashly before our maker, secondly, keepe touch with God: first, for extraordinary and incidental occasions, be sure to keepe thy selfe in such a state and condition of soule, as that euer thou canst recollect thy selfe, and call in all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of soule for this businesse vpon a short warning: secondly, for ordinary times, so neare as may bee, faile not of thine houre, when the Clocke strikes the Schollar runs to his booke, thou must to God leauing al, there tender thy selfe, though not alwaies alike fit, and so be in the way and place of preferment, if words will not come, sigh, <hi>God heares the sighing of his prisoners,</hi> if thou canst not sigh, breath, God hath an eare for that, <hi>Lam</hi> 3.56. However, there be, there stand, and the child that stands before his father and appeares in his place at supper time with his trencher in his hand, speakes with his countenance, and speeds accordingly: he was wise who said, <note place="margin">M. <hi>Gr.</hi>
      </note> they pray not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of fashion, who see their infirmitie in praying and are grieued for it, the worst
<pb facs="4"/>prayers that wee make(to our owne sence I meane) speede euer best, and then wee pray most happily, when wee arise most humbled.</p>
   <p>Thirdly, when thou hast prayed, do not as children, who neuer looke after their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; but as <hi>Daniell cap.</hi> 9.1. take notice of thine enlargements in prayer and of thy successe after, write downe time and place as the Prophet doth, and so helpe thy selfe in future times by former experiments, I see this Porch growes wide, and therefore I wil conclude, if thou be acquainted with prayer, thou knowest there is more in it then can be expressed, if thou bee not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, grow acquainted, and thou shalt find me true, if thou wantest furthest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues and directions, I commend (in this hast) to thee who art but a poore English priuate man. First, for the promises (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the heart must chew before prayer) the <hi>Treatise of faith.</hi> secondly, for motiues, the <hi>Epistle to the key Heauen.</hi> thirdly, for cases of Conscience and directions after prayer, 2. <hi>Treatises</hi> on <hi>Ephe</hi> 6. <hi>viz. the spiritual Armour,</hi> and now after directions and exhortations, what remaines but practise, in stead of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb facs="5"/>prailing and enter dealing in State-bu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sines, do thou pray, pray for thy Soveraign, for his seede, for the Churches, for thy self, for thy charge, and vse no more words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mens sinnes, then thou wilt make prayers for their soules in secret, if thou wilt haue comfort in thy wordes: Thus much of this, Now <hi>Reader</hi> to thee, if these plaine notes passe the Presse, know that I neither did entēd their publishing before I preached them, nor can intend notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their refining since; if the world may be bettered by them, or by any thing I can doe, I haue enough, onely I desire mercy and equitie from my friends, those notes of mine which they haue, I will my selfe (after my publique Ministerie) now shortly revise, let no man doe so ill an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as to thrust out other mens notes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their privitie, especially his, who can doe nothing worthy this Age.</p>
