                 <title>A discourse touching the doctrine of doubting : In which not onely the principall arguments, that our popish aduersaries vse, for the establishing of that discomfortable opinion, are plainely and truely aunswered: but also sundrie suggestions of Sathan tending to the maintenance of that in the mindes of the faithfull fully satisfied, and that with singuler comfort also.

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He life of christian men &amp; womē here vpon earth, is not without cause (right honourable, and right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull) neither yet vnfite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compared by the holye
<pb facs="3"/> ghost in the canonicall Scriptures, to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall combate and warfaire. Of which as the written vvord it selfe, in the sound doctrine, and approoued examples thereof, concerning this point, doth beare faithfull witnes; so, if god would giue vs grace, carefullie to obserue, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther other men, or our selues, in such sorte as vve ought, or could not but quicklie finde good warrantise for it, in the vvorld likewise. For confirmation whereof, if vve had no more, but on the other side, the darke doctrine of poperie, euerie vvhere assaying to persvvade, yea to driue men to doubting, and on the other side, the diffidence and distrustfulnesse, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we carrie about with vs in our hearts, it were as a man might say more then sufficiēt. Touching the popish opinion, it is certainelie pitifull, that they can see no other vvaye or meane to preuent proude presumption, but to incurre the daunger of distrust and doubting. And it is the more pitifull doubtlesse, by hovv much, both in Gods religion, yea and in mans reason also they can not but know &amp; confesse, that euery singular vertue or good worke, hath
<pb facs="3"/> two sins set against it, the one as disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, the other as contrarie to it. The vertue or good worke as we nowe call it here is trust in God then what can be a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vvorke, sith our Sauiour saith: <hi>This is the worke of Christ that ye beleeue in him whō he hath sent?</hi> And vvhat is more contrarie to it then to doubt or distrust? and vvhat is more disagreeing from it, thē Lucifer-like presūp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yet euen againe I say, it is the more pitifull by howe much it crosseth, euen their ovvne opinion &amp; practise. For how can that cōceit of theirs touching merit before Christ and specially of meriting eternall life, stand with the doctrine of doubting, seeing that merite, or absolute obedience, specially if men deale with one that is iust, as Christ (who is iustice it selfe) must needes shutt out doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting touching that we are sure we haue deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and he cannot choose but of iustice giue and graunt. But such vaine fantesies must they fall into, that fall avvaie from the faith and trueth of the worde, and vvill lift vp thē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against Christ our Sauiour, that so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing grace offered, and feeling it where it is
<pb facs="4"/> not to bee found, they might vanish avvay, through the disquietnes of their spirits, in the vaine imaginations of their ovvne mindes. Concerning the other: it is verie lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in so large aboundance of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises, and in so faithfull and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall performance of them, speciallie to his owne people (whereof not onely the vvord, but the vvorld, doth yeeld vs an infinite cloude of vvitnesses) mens mindes should yet be repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, vvith fearefulnesse and doubting. But such, and so great, is Sathans malice against vs, and so dull and slow of heart are vve to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, speciallie when we regard our manifold vnworthinesse, our grieuous transgressions, or the seueritie and iustice of the Lords iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it is more then marueilous, if anie man be found in better estate, considering I say, either vvhat we are by nature, or regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withall, what after our inlighting and regeneration begunne in vs, a world there is of reliques &amp; remainder of corruption in vs: which though they doe not vtterly deface and put out the good worke of God in vs, because it
<pb facs="4"/> is to maiesticall and povverfull, to be battered and beaten downe, by so weake an aduersarie, yet do they so backward and hinder the same, that in this life vvee can not attaine to that fulnesse of faith, which we greatly hunger and thirst after: and though through gods goodnes, we haue gained somewhat, yet many times we finde those graces so eclipsed and darkened in vs, that they seeme to be as if they vvere not. But what meane we to trauaile in the streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thning of these points vvhich in euerye mans minde and mouth almost, are so cleare and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall, as nothing more. The thing rather that we should striue vnto, is this, namely that sith by corrupt opinions, we are or may be dayly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted outwardly, and by Sathans subtle sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions, and our owne cursed corruptions, vve are continually prouoked inwardly, as to euerie other euill generally, so particularly to this sore sicknesse of our soules, distrust or doubting, we should in the holy wisedome &amp; cleare light of Gods vvorde, and also by the all sufficient strength and power of the blessed spirite, so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to looke vnto our selues, as that we suffer
<pb facs="5"/> not our selues, either to be infected vvith the pleasaunt poyson of false doctrine, or to bee drawne to discomfort, through the doubtfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our hearts. For as the former hazer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth (what saie I nay ouerthroweth the health of our soules, &amp; that more dangerously by much then any bodily poison doth or can doe, the state of our outward man, for in the middest of this, the minde may be safe and sure, whereas in the other, specially persisted in there insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euerlasting destruction both of bodie and soule: so the latter strongly haleth downe vpō vs, and violently bringeth vnto vs, all heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart and fearefull disquitnesse, and togeather with the same as a peculiar effect thereof, all manner of vnwillingnesse, vnfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and disabilitie in and about the seruice of Christ, whether publikely in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or priuately in the familie: as also for the carefull accomplishment of our Christian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties either at home or abroad. For what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood or probability is there that he shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before god, or doe good vnto mē, whose spirit is disquieted within him: seeing that a
<pb facs="5"/> quiet spirit is a thing much set by before god, and fitteth vs also for naturall duties? These great difcfiulties &amp; dangers, are not, nay can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be discerned, but by the light of the word: neither indeede can the euill of them, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented and beatē backe, but by carefull taking vnto vs, and dailie vsing of, all the armour that Christ himselfe, and not man hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for vs, and prescribed vnto vs in the worde of trueth. For plaine proofe whereof we may beholde (if we can) the bad effects and bitter fruits, that either the ignorance or neg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lect hereof bringeth forth in our age. And if there were no more but this, the continuall carnalitie and carnall securitie, that euerie where raigneth, til it be discouered and felt, and the distrust yea desperation, that then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, when the Lord is pleased to lay it open, and to presse it hard and home, as we saie, to to the heart, these were sufficient enough not onely to prooue the point, but also to cause vs in time to leaue our great and grieuous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and in in a good and acceptable seasō euen while it is called to day, as the scripture
<pb facs="6"/> saieth, to looke to better courses, assuring our selues, that as for poperie, it can neuer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled but by the sounde knovvledge of Gods will reuealed in his vvord, this trueth beeing as cōtrary to that errour and falsehood as daye is to darknesse: and as for assured comforte in distresse or distrust, it is no where to be found, but generally in the same word also, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the sweet promises thereof, which as God alone, that is altogether faithfull, hath plentifullye made, so vvill he, that is onely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, and doth vvhatsoeuer pleaseth him both in heauen and earth, in an acceptable time graciously performe, for his glorie, and the good of his people. And that therefore vve should endeuour, by all the good meanes that possibly we can, that the word of Christ might dvvell in vs plenteously, in all vvisedome, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and admonishing our ovvne selues, in Psalmes and Hymnes, and spirituall songues, singing with a grace in our hearts to the Lord, and doing vvhat soeuer vve shall do in vvord or in deede, either towards God in the cause of his vvorship, or in the dueties of charitie tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
<pb facs="6"/> men, in the name of the Lord Iesus. Now vvhat experience you (right honourable, and right vvorshipfull) haue had in this behalfe, I knovv not. This I am sure of that belonging to the Lord (as vpon good groun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> I doubt not, I perswade my selfe you do) you either haue had heretofore, or hereafter, before the day of your dissolution dravv nigh shall haue your portion and part of triall, both the one and the other vvaye. And though it may be that you haue through gods mercie in Christ bestowed vpon you the grace of a stedfast perswasiō, yet he that is now strong through Gods grace, may hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter through his owne wickednesse and vvants become weake, God hauing not onely ordeined that as a meane so to humble vs, least in the excellent aboundance of graces, we might be exalted aboue measure, but prouided one of vs to support and helpe an another, according to any measure of mercie that we haue receiued from him. Wherein, if I may either soundly comfort you for that vvhich is past, and dueti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prouoke christian care, &amp; minister strong consolation for that which is to come, and may
<pb facs="7"/> perceiue either the one or the other or both, not onely to dwell in your selues, but as by and and from you to bee communicated to others, specially those whose case and state is distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed either waye, I shall right hartely reioyce, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

      </gap> one in this comfortablie feeling the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our sinnes that God hath beene pleased, to make his trueth effectuall and powerfull in vs aswel for the obedience of his holie commā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, as for the vnfeigned beleefe of his blessed promises. And in this respect princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally I assure you is it, that hauing sometime since, written a discourse against all manner of doubting, (whether it be from others, as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish doctrine and Sathans suggestions, or from the diffidence and distrustfulnesse of our owne hearts) and being much and often requested, by some deare friends of mine, (vvhome I could not vvell denie) to publish it, I am bold vnder your patronages, to let it passe to the presse, and to come forth to behold the light, and from you, to cause it to come to the vievv of others, for yours and their spirituall benefite especially. And in this dedication of my poore trauailes
<pb facs="7"/> vnto you I could not but ioyne you all together as one, because that though as in respecte of your several states, degrees and callings in the common vvealth, you do somewhat differ, yet God by many gracious meanes of his mercy, &amp; particularly by open and religious profession of his trueth, and holie bande of christian mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, hath made you as it were to become one, that so growing alltogether in this life, by the power of the spirite, to the vnitie of faith, and obedience of the goodwill of God, you might in that time, that God hath set vvith himselfe from before all tines, come all together like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, to that one euerlasting life &amp; blessednes vvhich is the ende of that one faith and hope, wh rewith we are and shallbe both sealed and susteined, euen vntill and in the day of Iesus Christ. And so humblie beseeching good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of this that is done, in the singlenesse and sinplicitie of my soule, vvhich I trust you will not denie me, because I desire nothing, but that is right and reasonable, and directly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your owne good, specially spiritual: and vvithall hartilie praying the Lord to giue it
<pb facs="8"/> a blessing in your seuerall soules, for the glorie of his name, and your euerlasting comforte, whereof also I conceiue good hope, because God is large in loue, and bountifull in giuing spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnto his people, (in vvhich number I trust you are not without cause accounted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me) I do ende for this present, and vvith that submission, that is fitt for my selfe, and belongeth to persons of so great place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, take my leaue.
