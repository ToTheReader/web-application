         <hi>To the reverend and learned men, the Students of holy Scripture, in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Vniversities of Leyden in Holland, of Sanctandrewes in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land▪ of Heidelbergh, Geneva, and the other like famous scholes of learning in the Low countreyes, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Germany, and France.</hi>

      <p>The English exiles in the Low countreys, wish grace and peace in Iesus Christ.</p>
      <p>THis true confession of our faith, in our judgment wholy agreable to the sacred Scripture, we do here exhibit vnto all to be discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: and vnto you (reverend Sirs) we dedicate it for two causes. First, for that we know you are able in respect of your singular knowledge in the Scriptures, and hope you are willing in respect of your syncere piety, to convince our errours by the light of Gods word, if in any thing we be out of the way. Secondly, that this testimony of Christian faith, if you also fynd it agree with the word of truth, may by you be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, eyther in silence or by writing, as you shall think best.</p>
      <p>It may be, we shalbe thought very bold, that being despised of all, yet doubted not to sollicite you so many and so great learned men. But this we did, partly at the request of others to whom we would not deny it: partly with desier to have the truth through your help better defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and further spread abroad: partly cōstreyned by our exile and other calamityes almost infinite: partly also moved with love of our native coūtrey, and of these wherein now we live, and others else where: wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all may walk with a right foot to the truth of the Gospell, and praying daily vnto God, that the great work of restoring Religion and the Church decayed, which he hath happily begun in these latter ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, by our Gracious Soveraigne and the other Princes of these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes and ages (his servants) he would fully accomplish, to the glory of his name and eternall salvation in Christ of his elect in all places of the earth.</p>
      <p>As for the causes which moved vs to publish this Confession of faith, and to forsake the Church of England as now it stādeth, we have truly and as briefly as we could related them in the Preface to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hereafter following: and therefore thought here to omit the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of them. The Lord Iesus alway preserve you and your Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sityes to the praise of his name, the ornamēt of good learning, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation and maintenance of his pure Religion.

      <head>The preface to the Christian Reader.</head>
      <p>IT may seeme strange vnto thee (Christian Reader) that any off the Englysh nation should for the truth of the Gospell be forced to forsake their natyve contrye / and lyve in exile / especially in these dayes / when the Gospell seemeth to have free passage / and florish in that land. And for this cause have our exile bene hardly thought of by many / and evil spoken of by some who know not (as it seemeth) eyther the trewe estate of the Church of England or causes of our forsaking and separating from the same / but hearing this sect (as they call it) to be every where spoken against have (with out at all further search) accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and divulged vs as heretickes / or Schismatickes at the least.<note place="margin">Act. 28, 22</note> Yea some (and such as worst might) have sought the increase of our afflictions / even here also yf they could, which thinge they have / both secretly and openly attempted. This hath Sathan added vnto all our former sorrowes / envying that we should have rest in any part of the <note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 12.</note> inhabyted world / and therfor ceaseth not to make warre with the remnant of the womans seed / which keepe the commaundemēts of God and have the testimony of Iesus Christ. But the Lord that <note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 105, 13, 14.</note> brought his former Israell out off Egypt / and when they walked aboute from nation to natiō / from one Kingdome to an other people / suffered no man to do them wronge / but repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved kinges for their sakes: the same Lord yet lyveth to maynteyne the right off his afflicted servantes / whome he hath severed / and dayly gathereth out off the world / to <note n="d" place="margin">1 Pet▪ 2.9.</note> be vnto himselff a chosen generatiō / a royall priesthood a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Israell off God: He <note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 46.1.</note> is our hope and strength and helpe in trobles ready to be found / he will hyde vs vnder his winges / and vnder his feathers we shall be sure vntyll these myseries be over past. And though we could for our partes well have borne this rebuke off Christ in silence / and left our cause to him who iudgeth iustly all the children off men: yet for the manyfestation and clearing of the truth off God from reproche off men / and for the bringing off others togither with our selves to the same knouwledge and fellowship off the Gospell / we have thought it needfull and our duty to make knowen vnto the world / our vnfeyghned fayth in God / and loyall obedience towardes our Prince / and all Governours set over vs in the Lord / together with the reasons off our leaving the ministery worship and Church off England. Which are not (as they pretend) for some fewe faultes and corruptions remayning / such as we acknowledge man be found in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest Church on earth: Neyther count we it lawfull for any member to forsake the fellowship off the Church for blemyshes and imperfections / which every one according to his calling should studeously seeke to cure / and to exspect and further it vntyll eyther there followe redresse or the disease be growen incureable / and the <note n="f" place="margin">Apoc. 2, 5.</note> candlestick be moved out off the place.

      <p>But first we desyre thee / good Reader to vnderstand / and mynde that we have not in any dislyke of the civill estate and politicke goverment in that common wealth / which we much lyke and love seperated our selves from that Churche: Neyther have we shaken of our alleageance and dutyfull obedyence to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Prince Elezabeth her honorable Consellers and other Magistrates set over vs but have alwayes and still do reverence love and obey them every one in the Lord / opposing our selves against al enemyes forreigne or domesticall: against

Neiter have our greatest adversaryes ever bene able to attaint vs of the least disloyalty in this regarde. And though now we be exiled / yet do we dayly pray and will for the preservation peace and prosperity off her Majestie and all her domynions</p>
      <p>And wheras we have bene accused off intrusion into the Magistrates office / as goeing about our selves to reforme the abuses in that land / it is a mere malicious calumnie / which our adversaries have forged out of their owne hart.<note place="margin">Neh. 6, 6.7.8.</note> We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes both by word and practise shewed the contrary / neyther ever attempted or purposed any such thinge: but have indevored thus onely to reforme our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves and our lyves according to the rule off Gods word / by absteyning from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyll and keeping the commandements off Iesus: leaving the suppressing and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting out off those remnants of Idolatry / vnto the Magistrates / to whome it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth.</p>

      <p>First in the planting and constituting of their Churche (at the begining of our Queene Elizabets reigne) they receved at once into the body of that Churche / as members / the whole land / which generally then stood for the most part professed Papistes who had revolted from the profession / which they made in the dayes of king Edward off happy memorye / and shed much blood off many Christian Martyrs in Queene Maryes dayes. This people yet standinge in this fearfull sinfull state / in idolatry / blyndnes superstitiō and all manner wickednes / without any professed repentance / and without the meanes theroff / namely the preaching off the word goeing before / were by force and aucthority of lawe onely compelled / and together receved into the bosome / and body of the Churche / their seed bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselves receved and compelled to the Lords supper / had this ministery and servyce (which now then use) inioyned and set over them / and eversynce they and their seed remayne in this estate / being all but one body comonly called the Church of England▪ Here are none exempted or excluded / be they never soo propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne or wretched no athiest / adulterer / thiefe / or murderer / no lyer / periured / witche or coniurer and c. all are one fellowship one body / one Churche. Now let the law off God be looked into / and there wilbe found / that such persones <note n="i" place="margin">1 Pet. 2, 5. Ier. 51, 26</note> are not fit stones for the lordes spiritual howse / no meete members for Christes glorious body. <note n="k" place="margin">Act. 2, 38 40, 41 &amp; 8, 36, 37 &amp; 15 9. Ioh. 10, 3.4 5.

      <p>Secondly as they have reteyned the whole rout of the popysh multitude with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any distinction / for members of their Churche: so have they set over them (as reason was) the same popysh Clergie and Prelacy / which they receved from the Romysh Apostasie and this day is to be found in the popysh Churches:<note place="margin">About forty eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish offices are at this daye in the Churche of Englād ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a one ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed by Christ in his testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap> / <hi>Archbs, Primats, Bbs, Metropolitanes, Suffraganes, Archdeacōs, Deanes, Chauncellors, Commissaries,</hi> and the rest of that rable / which rule and governe these assemblyes according to the popysh cannons / rites / and customes. These have the power and aucthoritie in their hādes to set forth iniunctions / to make and depose ministers▪ to excomunicate both priest and people which they do very exquisitly if they yeld not vnto them their due homage and obedience. These have both Ecclesiasticall and civill aucthoritie / to reigne as Princes in the Churche and lyve as Lordes in the common wealth / to punysh imprison / and persecute evē to death all that dare but once mutter against their vnlaufull proceedinges. Of these prelates tyranny cruelty and vnlawfull aurthoritie the better sort both of preachers and people have cryed out / and longe tyme sued vnto the Prince and parliamēt to have them removed out of the Churche / as being the lymmes of Antichrist.<note place="margin">Apoc. 13.</note> But not prevay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they are now content (for avoyding of the crosse of Christ / to submitt them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves and their soules to this Antichristian Hierarchie / and beare the sinfull yoke and burthen of their traditions / and to receve and carry aboute the dreadfull and detestable marke of the beast vpon them.</p>
      <p>Thirdly / The inferiour ministery of that Churche / consisteth of Priests / Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons / Vicars / Curats / hired preachers / or <hi>Lecturers,</hi> with <hi>Clarkes, Sextons, &amp;c.</hi> all which have receved their offices callings and aucthoritie from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

These ministers generally / as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel preachers as other / lyve in feare and servitude vnder their foresaid Lords the <hi>Bbs.</hi> for as without their lycence wrytten and sealed they cannot preach / so vpon their displeasure and for not obeying their injunctions / they are many tymes sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pēded degraded / and if they will not be ruled / put in prison: so that sundry of them have bene suspended and imprisoned for preaching against the <hi>Prelats,</hi> not subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to their devised articles and booke of comon prayer not wearing the square capp and surplus / not reading the service booke / and be tyed to the same / not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Bishops courtes / visitations / inquisitions / and c. tyll now of late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wearyed with these trobles / they give place to their tyranny / and are content to conforme themselves / and yelde their canonicall obedience according to their oathe / keeping now silence / yea going back / bearing and bolstering the thinges / which heretofore by word and wryting they stoode against so longe as there was any hope that the Queene and Counsell would have harkened vnto them / and put these adversary Prelats out of the Churche.</p>

And this is all the worship and service which many parishes have contynually / except peradventure some wrytten homelyes which the vnlearned priestes read vnto them.

To these Churches ministers and servyce must all the people there come e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very daye / yea though they have in the next parish a preacher / and in their owne a dumbe vnlearned priest / yet are they all tyed to their owne Church / and minister / and must at the least twise a yere receve the Sacrament at his handes. If they refuse this / or do not ordinaryly come to their parish Churche then are they sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned / excommunicated / and imprisoned / tyll they become obedient. In this bō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage are our countrymen there held vnder their Priests and Prelates: and such as by the word of God witnes against and condemne these abhominations / they hate punysh put to death / and persecute out of the land. Who now in whome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sparke of true light is cannot playnly perceive this their ministery worship and Churche to be false and adulterate? doth Christes eternall testament or deyne and approve of suche popish Lordes and Prelats to reigne over his Churche? are these those Christian Bishops / that is <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 12 1.

Or can chose preachers which are thus created and deposed by / thus sworne and obediēt vnto / their spirituall lordes / be deemed true teachers of the Gospell of Christ law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called and ordeyned to that ministerye? Is that their Englysh Masse the trewe and <note n="p" place="margin">Iohn. 4, 24 Mat 15, 9</note> spirituall worship of God according to his owne wil? we are taught in the scriptures <note n="q" place="margin">Deu 6, 4, 5 Mat. 16, 6 2.

      <p>If Christ be God let vs follow him: but if the pope be God / what shall wee say? why have we left him / his Church and ministery / his worship and jurisdiction / or what halting and mocking with the Lord is this / to put away the popes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and retayne his prelacy and ministery his Lawes / Traditiōs and Cannons / his worship and service:<note place="margin">Mat. 6, 24.</note> or at the least to frame vnto our selves a worship mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery and Church after the patterne and mould of the Apostacye of Roome / which what other thing is it / them to make an Image of that first wild beast / and force men to worship it?<note n="x" place="margin">2.

For so great is the malice and power of those romysh priests / that they persecute vnto death such as speake against them: and such poore Christians as they cast into their noysome prysons / can seldome or never get out (except with shipwracke of cōscience) vntyll they be caryed forth vpon the Bere. Neyther is there any care taken for their reliefe in this case: but being thus cast into pryson / there they are deteyned without any alloweance of meate or money for their mayntenance / be their want and poverty never so great. If they have any thing of their owne / there they are driven to spend it vp: if they have nothing / there they are left by the Prelats to feede on the ayre. And that they maye more readily be sterved / or weakened in the truth / they are comonly shut vp in close prison / their frends and acquayntance being not suffered to come at them: Nay even their wyves and children being kept and debarred from them by the tyranny of these bloddye Prelats and their instruments: whose hard har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and vnnaturall cruelty / if thou didest vnderstand (gentle Reader) as many of vs have felt / and to this daye yet feele it would make thy hart to bleede / conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their vnmercyfull and barbarous dealing. And how many soules have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in their prisons through miserable vsage / how many have ben put to death and how many banyshed / though we could to their eternall infamy relate to all the world / yet wil we not blaze abroad their acts (for we take no delight in laying open their shame) but mourne for them in secret / commytting our cause to God that judgeth justly / knowing that he <note n="z" place="margin">Ps. 9.12▪</note> that maketh inquisition for blood remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth it / and will not forget the complaint of the poore. And thou (Christian Reader) voutch safe to remember vnto God in thy prayers such as yet remayne in bandes and pryson amongest them for the testymony of Iesus / enduring a hard fight of afflictions / and having the sentence of death in themselves are lyke (if the Lord send not vnexspected delyverance) there to end their dayes.<note place="margin">Heb. 13, 3▪</note>
