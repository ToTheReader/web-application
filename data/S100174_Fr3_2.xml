      </gap> left to you in tyme of peace, and for defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that by singular constancy in your sufferings, which they both receiued, &amp; left you by quiet Traditiō.</p>

   <p>Which Tradition, or Catholike religion being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and declared most cleerly in this second age or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury; I doe by offering the same vnto you, but present the history of your own Kings of Scotland, the records and Chronicles of your owne families, the pedigree &amp; Genealogy of your owne Forefathers, the antiquity &amp; Nobility of your own progenitors, together with your iust Title &amp; Clayme to their Inheritance, producing iointly for the same the word of God, the Scripture, the Bible, the testimonies of the holy Fathers of this age, yea, the very monuments of your owne Kingdome, which no man but foolish, can deny or call in doubt.</p>
   <p>True it is, that by Gods holy prouidence you are borne in this time of warre, tribulation and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, insteed of that large peace and tranquillity which your ancestours enioyed, in the vse and exercise of that religion, for which you striue and suffer now presently in SCOTLAND; which sufferings of yours though for the present they seeme vnpleasāt &amp; distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to flesh &amp; bloud, yet assuredly will the houre come when it shall proue a most singular benefit, an eternall blisse, glory &amp; honour in your behalfe; by reason that,<note n="(a)" place="margin">1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.</note>
