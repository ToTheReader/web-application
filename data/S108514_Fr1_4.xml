   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecause it is the most usuall manner (friendly Reader) of those that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish any thing in writing, to bestow an Epistle upon the courteous and well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Reader, I resolved also to follow the same order: But I stood long in doubt, whether I should do it by way of Apology, for sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeing the world with more books, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that seemeth overfull; for writing of so meane a subject, when all mens minds conceit great matters: or for that my selfe, being one of the least, should presume to thrust in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion among so many rare, and excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions found out by the curious wits of these dayes: or else following the most ordinary and old fashion, when all men enquire after new, I should fall to commendation of the matter I write of, and the profit and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that may grow by the well-ordering of the same. Yet at the last I determined to say something concerning them all.</p>

      <pb facs="5"/>they account a part thereof; whom our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish writers following, have not a little erred. And this is the cause that concerning the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and keeping of Bees, little is found amongst them (some precepts of Mr. <hi>Southerns</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) worthy remembrance.</p>
   <p>And although that for the breeding, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, art, and government of Bees, they have written many curious and good observations of the Ancients, which are worthy the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, especially of such as keep Bees; againe, I was not much diswaded from my intention, because the greatest use of this book will be for the unlearned and Country people, especially good women, who commonly in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try take most care and regard of this kinde of commodity, (although much the worse for the poore Bees) because sometimes they want help, sometimes diligence, but most times know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how to use them well. And this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally moved me to undertake this work, which I have performed without Art or Eloquence, and after a different method or order from all those which have formerly written of Bees, having set down every thing that I supposed worthy observatiō. And notwithstanding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="5"/>of them at the first sight may peradventure seeme to bee of little worth, or else needlesse, for being commonly known to most that keep Bees: Yet I would intreat your patience in reading of those also, and I suppose that my purpose being to teach, I was unwilling to omit any thing (were it never so little) worthy the noting. Moreover, have I written any thing contrary to the common received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or different from your conceit; bee not over hasty to censure it, but observe and then try before you give iudgement. And thus much by way of Apology. Last of all, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the excellency of hony and wax, let this only suffice, that they are numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the notable and chiefe commodities of some Kingdomes, and the very Land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise it selfe, to give the Israelites a better liking unto it, was called the Land that flowed, or to use our English phrase, abounded with Milk and Hony, which were esteemed at that time, amongst the principall earthly commodities that were to bee expected from the blessing of God. And as for the profit of this booke, I referre it to the successe that it shall please God to give in the use of it.</p>
