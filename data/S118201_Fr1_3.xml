   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He whole Scripture is the rich treasurie of the great King of glorie, wherein not one kind of precious stone or mettall is laid vp, or in one roome, but in sundrie drawers as in sundrie caskets, many seuerall pearles and precious things are reserued,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Scriptura com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune promptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arium bonorum documentorū. Basil. mag. in 1. Psal.</hi>
      </note> and safely laid vp for the vse of the Church of God. In one place lyeth the summe of holy doctrine, another holdeth the precepts of godly life. In one corner is the refutation of adulterate and erronious doctrine; In another the reprehension of impure and scandalous life. And as all the parts of Christianitie are distinct one from another, so lie they heare or there in these rich coffers distinct, so as euery Christian may draw out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, direction, and consolation according to his owne necessitie. This Epistle breathed from the same spirit, and bearing the same superscription with all the rest, herein disagreeth not from them;<note place="margin">
         <hi>Epitome Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum epistola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
      </note> but as by the learned it is called an <hi>Abridgment of all Pauls Epistles</hi>: so is it fraught with such varietie of precepts sitted to all sorts, sexs, ages, and conditions of men, as whatsoeuer he hath in all his Epistles more largely handled, the same he seemeth to haue summarily reduced into this one: wherein as in a mappe or modell he would deliuer his whole spirit, stile, and vnderstanding in the doctrine of saluation: And which he would leaue to the Church as a manuall or compendious summe of all Christian religion, to the end that Christians beeing hence instructed in the matter of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>manners,</hi> might he made not only wise to saluation, but profitable and fit for the place which God hath in any of the societies of <hi>1. Church, 2. Common-wealth, 3. Familie</hi> assigned them vnto. For if in any hee enlarge the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of mans <hi>miserie</hi> by sinne, or magnifie the doctrine of the Gospel and mans <hi>diliuerance</hi> from sinne: If in any he cleare the doctrine of free iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>faith</hi> alone, or enforce the doctrine of <hi>good workes</hi> the fruites of that faith: If in any he largely propound either such duties as belong to publike persons, as namely, the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> or such offices
<pb facs="6"/>
as are fitted to the seuerall conditions of priuate men. If in any he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke to the practise of Christian curtesie and kindnesse: or else (if neede require) of Christian seueritie and sharpnesse: surely in this Epistle he doth with such admirable plainnes and shortnesse all these, as no other, nor all the other shew him a more skillfull workeman then this doth. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it follie to paint a pearle, I will rather now giue some tast and reason of that I haue done: as also remooue some scruples which may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise perhappes be mooued against it.</p>
   <p>Gold lyeth not vpon the face, but in the bowells of the earth, and the richer any minerall is, the more industrious hath nature beene to laid it vp in the deepest vaines.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Prou. 3.15.</hi>
      </note> Euen so considering that the price of the wisedome of God cannot be found, to which the purest gold of Ophir, nor all pearles are to be compared: we may not thinke that the Lord is so prodigall of it, or carelesse as to leaue it abroad for euery stranger that passeth by to take vp with an idle hand; or to trample vnder his wandring feete: but that hee hath disposed it as men doe their treasures which they hide and locke in their surest coffers, and that vnder their eye. And were it not so; needlesly should we be commanded to <hi>seeke for her as for siluer, and search for her as for treasures:</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Prou. 2.4.</hi>
      </note> vpon which condition only it is couenanted that we shall <hi>vnderstand the feare of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.</hi> For howsoeuer we may not ascribe darkenesse and obscuritie vnto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, vnlesse we will say, that the Lord hath spoken something which he would not haue vnderstood;<note place="margin">
         <hi>Deus noluit ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceri quod volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it scribi. August.</hi>
      </note> and also falsifie that of the Apostle, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the word of the Prophets (which of all parts of the Scriptures are the darkest) to a light shining in a darke place: yet the wisedome of God would haue (not all but) some places more difficult to our darke vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: not only for the dazeling of the eyes of the worst, who neuer care to know or comprehend any of these mysteries: but that the best also might <hi>1.</hi> see their owne dulnesse of conceit in heauenly things: so to keepe them low in their owne eyes, as who cannot attaine such an high knowledge of themselues. <hi>2.</hi> be stirred vp to more diligent studie, reading, hearing, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and prayer, that by this continuall exercise in the word▪ they may profit, and proceed in the knowledge of God, and in the vnderstanding of these mysteries, which are admirable to the Angels themselues. <hi>3.</hi> make so much the more both of the word and the ministerie of it: the Lord foresaw, that the things that are easie we easily contemne, and that things lightly come by are lightly set by. That any part of this booke is <hi>clasped</hi> and <hi>sealed,</hi> it is in regard of our naturall blindnesse, who cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the brightnes of the sunne of righteousnes shining in the Scriptures.<note place="margin">

   </p>
   <p>But that this naturall corruption might not raigne in the elect for their hurt, the Lord Iesus hath left to his Church the gift of interpretation,
<pb facs="6"/>
which is as the key to open this closet of God: and hath stirred vp faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men from time to time endued by his spirit, who in attentiue and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent reading of the Scriptures by the helpe of <hi>1.</hi> Arts, as Grammer, Rhetorike, Logicke, Philosophie, &amp;c. <hi>2.</hi> knowledge of the proprieties of words and phrases of the tongues wherein they were written. <hi>3.</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of Scriptures with themselues, antecedents with consequents, obscure places with plainer: and figuratiue speaches with more proper. <hi>4.</hi> soundnesse of iudgement in the agreement and analogie of faith. <hi>5.</hi> diligent obseruation of predictions with their accomplishments, of types with their truth, and of the historie of the Church which it selfe is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie of Scripture, haue beene themselues enabled to vnderstand: as also partly by liuely voice in the Ministrie, and partly by their learned monuments and writings, to make the people of God vnderstand euen the darkest mysteries conteyned in them, so farre as is necessarie for the saluation of beleeuers. Whose labours and writings to contemne, sauoreth of a proud Anabaptisticall spirit, who while they complaine of so many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mētaries, despise the gifts of God, who by his seruants he communicateth to his Church, and so are iustly left of God in the ignorance of the Scriptures: or else in the grosse and ridiculous peruerting of them. Well said that noble Eunuch, <hi>How can I vnderstand without an interpreter?</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Act. 8.</hi>
      </note> what was Moses but an interpreter of the law? what were the Prophets but interpreters of Moses? what was Christ but an interpreter of the Prophets? what were the Apostles but interpreters of Christ? what are all Pastors and teachers wherewith Christ hath euer furnished his Church since he ascended into heauen, but interpreters of the Apostles? Well knew the Sonne of God commanding it, and his Apostles commending it,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ioh. 5.39.</hi>
      </note> how behoouefull it was for the edification of the Church, by interpretation of the Scriptures,<note place="margin">
         <hi>1. Thes. 5.19.</hi>
      </note> to draw out both the true <hi>sence,</hi> and the true <hi>vse</hi> of them (which are the two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts of interpretation) seeing so many things are to vs hard to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, and things which for their <hi>sense</hi> are easiest, cannot so easily of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one be applyed to their proper <hi>vse</hi> without this helpe. This is that edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying gift which the Apostle so highly advanceth, <hi>1. Cor. 14.3, 4. He that prophesieth speaketh vnto men to edifying, to exhortation, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</hi> and, <hi>he that prophesieth edifieth the Church.</hi> This is that which the auncient Fathers since the Apostles haue fruitfuly laboured in, as appeareth by their learned Sermons preached &amp; written. This is that which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pastors in all ages (especially of later daies since the cleare light of the Gospel was restored) haue so industriously and happily employed themselues in; as there is almost no place in the Scriptures so hard, whether matter of Historie of things past, or prophecy of some things yet to come, vnto which they haue not endeauoured to bring some perspicuity and clearnes:
<pb facs="7"/>
as witnes all the worthy Commentaries extant, which haue more opened the Scriptures within this last hundreth yeares, then in a whole thousand and some hundreths before.</p>
   <p>Now setting before me the singular good accrewing hereby vnto the Church sundrie wayes, I thought that my selfe could not more profitably be spent thē in this seruice of the Church; nor more acceptably lay out my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters talent then in adorning this worthy Epistle, which hath not been by any before me so largely handled as here thou hast it. In the opening of which I haue examined the nature of the words; cast euerie branch into his proper place by an easie and familiar method; sifted out the true sense which might best stand with antecedents▪ consequents, parallel places, and analogie of faith: conferred with the best interpreters, consulted in matters questiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the auncient Fathers, raised naturall doctrines, and applyed them to their seuerall vses of instruction, reprehension, consolation, or confutation. In some whereof howsoeuer I aimed at the necessitie and occasions of mine owne auditorie, yet generally I haue presented generall instructions; and all this in that plaine stile wherein it was deliuered; both then and now, more aiming at soundnesse of matter then sounding of words, and more inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to perswade the hearts then to please the eares of men.</p>
   <p>If it be here obiected that this Epistle concerneth but one person, and one more generall might haue beene more profitably and fitly chosen. I answer, That <hi>1.</hi> my choise was fitted to my auditorie, wherein were as many young Titusses to be instituted to the seruice of the Church, as ordinarie Christians to be instructed in the duties of a religious life. <hi>2.</hi> This Epistle was not so much written for Titus, as for the whole Church, and therefore he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>teach these things</hi> publikely,<note place="margin">
         <hi>cap. 2.15.</hi>
      </note> as things of speciall vse for all the people of God: and in all probabilitie this Epistle was openly read by Titus to the whole congregation, whom in the ende he saluteth in these words, <hi>Grace be</hi> (not with thee, but) <hi>with you all. 3.</hi> We haue not onely the spirit of God recording it among other holy writings to the whole Church, but sundrie gracious Pastors haue beene delighted to be conuersant in it: as M. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> acknowledgeth of himselfe to M.

<pb facs="7"/>
the interpreting of such a materiall Epistle in one moneth: neither did I think it the part of a faithfull expositor, either wholly to neglect things pertinent, though they seeme smaller, or altogether to avoide treatises which might prooue more laborious. <hi>3.</hi> Seeing corruption of manners is the rifest griefe of our dayes, I cannot be iustly blamed if I haue more enlarged my selfe in bending my greatest forces against this most dangerous disease: and yet my hope is that my Reader shall not iustly challenge mee with multiplication of matterles words, who haue laboured to thrust much varietie of matter into as fewe words as possibly I could. If it be further obiected, that there is no great neede of writing bookes in this age, which rather surfetteth of them then otherwise. Although this no more concerneth me then others, whose labours merit better respect then they meete with, yet I answer, that <hi>1.</hi> pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers complaine not of any surfet of sound Commentaries of the Scriptures, especially of some bookes (whereof this is one) but rather haue cause to wish more helpes of this kinde then they haue, as my selfe did when I first attempted this Epistle. <hi>2.</hi> be it graunted that the learned haue many good helpes, yet ordinarie Christians complaine of want of sauourie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries in our owne tongue, who are in their godly desires to be respected. <hi>3.</hi> he that obserueth how thicke Popish bookes are sent in amongst vs, and what armies of Popish Priests and Iesuites are without intermission dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the seducing of our simple people from their loyaltie to God and their soueraigne; cannot with any conscience prosecute any such allegation. <hi>4.</hi> besides the instance of many godly friends, my owne present condition helped forward this labour: for beeing hindered in my course of ministerie, how could I better spend my silent time, then by casting such a mite as this into the publike treasurie of the Church.<note place="margin">

      </note> As for other sinister or selfe-respects in writing, God and mine owne conscience shall free me, in the presence of both which I professe with Clemens Alexandrinus, that not ostentation or the vaine winde of men set me forward, but cheifely the desire of doing some dutie whereby I might further my owne reckoning in the day of account, and helpe some others also forward in the same worke. Wherein if I may knowe my labour fruitfull and acceptable to Gods children, I shall not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to goe on in some other endeauours as the Lord shall affoard mee strength and life.</p>
   <p>And now Christian Reader before I dismisse thee, I would commend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy practise these fewe rules in the reading of this and all other Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall expositions.</p>
   <p n="1">
      <hi>1.</hi> Obserue diligently the difference betweene the Scriptures which are the primarie truth reuealed,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Scriptura prima veritas reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata.</hi>
      </note> and other mens writings which are but secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie. The Scriptures are to be read and receiued as such which cannot erre, or speake any thing contrarie to the truth, or to themselues, though we
<pb facs="8"/>
vnderstand it not: but all other mens writings, readings, sermons, exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and determinations (suppose of whole Churches and Councels) must onely be receiued so farre as they agree with the Scriptures, which are the rule to which all other diuine writings must be laid, and the touchstone by which they must be tried.</p>
   <p n="2">
      <hi>2.</hi> Read godly expositions, not to be turned from the reading of the Scriptures or from preaching▪ but to vnderstand better both what thou rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest in Gods booke, and hearest from Gods mouth.</p>
   <p n="3">
      <hi>3.</hi> Beeing perswaded that no man by his own quicknesse or apprehension can finde out the true sense and vse of the Scriptures; bring prayer with thee,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal. 119.18. Iam. 1.5.</hi>
      </note> that God would be pleased to <hi>open thine eyes to see the wonderfull things of the lawe.</hi> If any man <hi>want wisedome he must aske it of God:</hi> The foote of Dauids song was, <hi>Teach me thy statutes</hi>: Thus shalt thou be taught of God, and not onely by the ministerie of man.</p>
   <p n="4">
      <hi>4.</hi> Seeing the feare of God is the beginning of wisedome, and his secret is with them that feare him; bring a teacheable, and an humble heart, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to God, louing his truth, desirous and industrious to obey that part of his will alreadie reuealed vnto thee: for he <hi>teacheth the humble in his way:</hi> and, <hi>if any man will doe his will, he shall knowe whether the doctrine be from God or no.</hi>
      <note place="margin">

   </p>
   <p n="5">
      <hi>5.</hi> In thy reading let not thine ende be to seeke out and finde out curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and subtilties; but to finde and meete with Christ: desirous to knowe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Christ and him crucified, which is the scope of all the Scriptures, as also of the gift of interpretation of them.</p>
   <p n="6">
      <hi>6.</hi> Read not by halues, but goe through the author thou hast made choise of once and againe: nor idlely, but with attention, as painfully digging for the treasure: nor carelesly, but with dilgence trying these mettalls, vnlesse thou wouldst take copper washt ouer for gold.</p>
   <p>Lastly, bring all thy reading into vse and practise, meditate of it often by thy selfe, and cheerefully communicate it to others: for by vsing and laying out thy talent thou encreasest it and know that not they which reade, heare, or speake much are blessed, but those which doe it. Thus come furnished to the reading of this or any other godly booke, and I assure thee thou shalt not loose thy labour, but shalt so redeeme thy time, as that thou shalt be able to giue a good and comfortable account of it in the day of thy reckoning. If thou meetest with any doubtfull things, helpe me with thy best construction: If with any escapes, helpe me with thy best counsell: If with any helpe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in thy holy course, praise God, and helpe me with thy prayers.</p>
