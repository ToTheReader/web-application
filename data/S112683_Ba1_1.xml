      <head>To his worthy friend, the Author of the <hi>Nights Search.</hi>
      </head>
      <l>WHen I had found thy drift, in this thy Night,</l>
      <l>Which is to bring such vassals to the light</l>
      <l>As undermine the world; how by thy pen</l>
      <l>The living dye, the dead to live agen;</l>
      <l>Thy various Searching; and thy lofty straines,</l>
      <l>Thy quaint expressions; how thy knowing braines</l>
      <l>Set out their sins: thy witty usefull parts,</l>
      <l>Thy honest end; how thou dost cast thy darts,</l>
      <l>That Hell-hounds fall before thee: how the times</l>
      <l>May see and hate the vilenesse of those crimes</l>
      <l>That are unmask'd by thee; thy <hi>Muse</hi> went in,</l>
      <l>Yet thou didst never know that cursed sin.</l>
      <l>Complaints and griefe are kept alive so rare</l>
      <l>That I am forc'd to weep and beare a share.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>I thought to praise thee, but again thought I</l>
      <l>'T will but disgrace thy worth and industry.</l>
      <l>But with this reason did my thoughts agree,</l>
      <l>'T will be my honor if I write of thee!</l>
      <l>'T will be my pride if these low lines of mine</l>
      <l>May be thought worthy to be bound with thine.</l>
      <l>Though I come late, let me this favour find,</l>
      <l>That I may wait upon thy <hi>Muse</hi> behind.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Thou hast not rob'd the dead, nor dost thou strive</l>
      <l>To scrape a line from any man alive.</l>
      <l>Invention's rich in thee; for I find still</l>
      <l>Thy <hi>Genius</hi> is too nimble for thy quill.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="169"/>Thou do'st not rub thy braines a day or two</l>
      <l>To hatch a fancy, as some others do:</l>
      <l>Nor blot out often, what thou once do'st write:</l>
      <l>'Tis worth the trusting what thou do'st indite.</l>
      <l>I would have read thy searching <hi>Muse</hi> throughout,</l>
      <l>Had it been meane: but to resolve the doubt,</l>
      <l>'Tis worthy to be studied: every page</l>
      <l>May teach a lesson to this puny age.</l>
      <l>So much I found as pleas'd me; for the rest,</l>
      <l>I'le read and study it, when once'tis prest.</l>
      <l>Thy praise will live, though pride and envy burst,</l>
      <l>And all th' infernall troop that are accurst,</l>
      <l>Spit fire at thee: wisemen all know well</l>
      <l>They envy thee because thou do'st excell.</l>

      <head>To the Author on his exact description of the Night-walkers of our time.</head>
      <l>I Lately walk'd your round, took full survey</l>
      <l>Of all, (all being worth notice) in my way:</l>
      <l>Observ'd the order of your scouts, how fast</l>
      <l>The silly dotrels to their ruine haste,</l>
      <l>How the delinquents met your lash, and how</l>
      <l>Those that escap'd, had in conceit enough</l>
      <l>Sense of your scourge: which being so severe,</l>
      <l>Made them lesse wicked, not for love, but feare.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="170"/>Thus English <hi>Juvenal,</hi> thy whip doth good,</l>
      <l>Not gently laying on, but fetching blood.</l>
      <l>For our depraved times, and manners too,</l>
      <l>Wanted too long a Censor like to you.</l>
      <l>Which can with your meere frowns make all men shun</l>
      <l>At once the sin, and the temptation:</l>
      <l>But how the Roysters of the time will rage,</l>
      <l>When they shall see th'abuses of our age</l>
      <l>Reform'd! and they for their supply, must be</l>
      <l>Enforc'd to travell France and Italy,</l>
      <l>To finde their overthrow; when all they gaine,</l>
      <l>Is but a sad experience of their paine.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Me thinks I see the mincing Dames approve</l>
      <l>Thy quaint description of their wicked love:</l>
      <l>And with unusuall teares repent those times,</l>
      <l>That wrong'd their husbands by their shamefull crimes.</l>
      <l>The sharking Pander will deplore the state</l>
      <l>Of his lewd conversation; and will hate</l>
      <l>His servile drudgerie; and wish he were</l>
      <l>Againe some Serving-man, to quasse and sweare;</l>
      <l>Or what ills else to act, which might obtaine</l>
      <l>His Mistris favour, or his Masters gaine:</l>
      <l>To wait upon some chamber-maid, which hee</l>
      <l>Knowes well his Master keepes at liverie,</l>
      <l>Which may ingratiate to his willing eare</l>
      <l>His service, and for that esteeme him deare.</l>
      <l>Sometimes he might content his Mistris too,</l>
      <l>And for her sake, more than his Master do.</l>
      <l>And this were better far, and lesser ill,</l>
      <l>Than to be slave unto a Wantons will:</l>
      <l>And after all, to be reproach'd for't thus,</l>
      <l>For serving an incarnat <hi>Incubus.</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The rampant Doxie now the twilight feares,</l>
      <l>Nor (as her usuall wont) abroad appeares:</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="170"/>The plodding Cheat's reclaim'd, and rather will</l>
      <l>Work hard all yeare, than one weeke at the Mill.</l>
      <l>Thus in the worst of times, 'tis to be thought,</l>
      <l>Thou hast a generall reformation wrought.</l>
      <l>And yet, if there be any dare persist</l>
      <l>In their lewd courses, like the Sensualist;</l>
      <l>They, even they, thy fancies will admire,</l>
      <l>And praise the tartnesse of thy fiercer ire.</l>
      <l>For if that any of their Order be,</l>
      <l>By thy advice, falne from the liverie,</l>
      <l>Though they themselves do their lewd wayes retaine,</l>
      <l>Yet with their praise will they applaud thy paine.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And as the Vsurer did the Preacher fee,</l>
      <l>That none at length might use that trade but hee,</l>
      <l>So will these Hackney Strumpets with their crue,</l>
      <l>All that they can, strive now to honour you.</l>
      <l>How can this work of thine then chuse but sell,</l>
      <l>When they, 'gainst whom 'tis writ, say, 'tis done well?</l>
      <l>What now shall I commend in thee? let all</l>
      <l>Who view this coppy, praise th'originall.</l>
      <l>'Twould be absurd, thy wit, or Art to praise,</l>
      <l>Or with our garlands to adorne thy Bayes:</l>
      <l>Let thine ownelines (and not some others) bee</l>
      <l>The perspective, by which we may ken thee.</l>
      <l>And surely 'twere but labour lost, to write</l>
      <l>(What thine owne works make publish to the sight)</l>
      <l>Thy merits and thy praise, let the world then</l>
      <l>Beleeve Fames trumpet is become thy pen.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But yet behinde thy back I dare be bold,</l>
      <l>Some secret truths concerning thee, unfold:</l>
      <l>And to acquaint the world, there is in thee</l>
      <l>The choyser seeds of honour'd poesie:</l>
      <l>Cleantbes-like, each day thou do'st apply</l>
      <l>Thy selfe unto thy taske with industry;</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="171"/>And when the night drawes neare, thy waking minde</l>
      <l>Doth something (worthy of our wonder) finde</l>
      <l>Whereon to contemplate; how many now</l>
      <l>Dreame their whole time away, and nothing doe</l>
      <l>They dare record; yet at those houres, when sleepe</l>
      <l>The most part of the world in rest doth keepe,</l>
      <l>Thou art not idle; but hast done far more</l>
      <l>By night, than many all their dayes before.</l>
      <l>Heaven gave thy soule wings, that she still might be</l>
      <l>Soaring aloft unto her Hierarchie:</l>
      <l>Not that with them thou should'st thy pillow stuffe,</l>
      <l>And so give nature more than what's enough.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Thou hast withdrawne times curtairs, and hast shown</l>
      <l>Those hidden truths, which he may blush to owne.</l>
      <l>O how in everie page might learned men</l>
      <l>Descrie the rare conceits flow from thy pen!</l>
      <l>I have perus'd it throughly, and confesse</l>
      <l>I were quite stupid, should I wonder lesse.</l>
      <l>Go onwards, worthy Sir, and as 'tis fit,</l>
      <l>Make all the world to wonder at your wit.</l>
      <l>That as you have this piece compos'd, to please</l>
      <l>Your selfe, let others it enjoy, which ease</l>
      <l>And idle houres have foster'd: that it may</l>
      <l>Remaine your monument at your dying day.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Haec quorsum premis? ut percant quis talia condit?</l>
      <l>Edere si non vis omnibus, ede tibi.</l>
