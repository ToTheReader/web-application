      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
these two ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
(right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull)
diuers of
my friendes reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
a Copie of
them: the which they craued ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
&amp; at the last I graunted hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
I had small leasure to pen my
Sermons for them, and thought it
lesse honestie, and as little curtesie to
denie them. But when through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
they had gotten the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hande, and receiued my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
at my handes, they went pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after a viewe taken of them,
vnto the Printer to haue them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.
They vsed many reasons to
persuade me to yeeld therevnto, but
<pb facs="3"/>
but when they coulde by no reason
moue me to agree to their attempt,
they protested that my Sermons
shoulde bee printed, though I were
neuer so vnwilling, they hauing the
copies in their handes: in the ende,
whē I could nothing preuaile with
them, but perforce was constrained
to yeelde to the publishing of these
my Sermons. I Purposed, as duetie
moued mee, to commend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them vnto your worships, to
whom I doe acknowledge my selfe
diuers wayes much bounden: and
the rather was I mooued to hide
them vnder the winges of your
worships protection, because your
fauour in mainteining the Gospell,
your zeale to Gods worde, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that you haue of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
is knowne, not to mee only,
who haue often times perceiued it,
but to all thē, which although they
know not you, yet both know &amp; do
<pb facs="3"/>
acknowledge your good deedes.
The Lorde powre downe his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
plentifully vpon you, kindle
more &amp; more in you the true zeale
that alredy burneth, increase the
loue and good affection which you
haue toward the gospel, that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pillers in the Church of Christ
militant, may also bee pillers in his
Church triumphant. And thus, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
your worships to accept this
my simple and rude worke, with
my humble commēdations to you,
and to the vertuous Ladies your
wiues, I bid you hartily fare well,
from London this xix. of Ianuarie.
