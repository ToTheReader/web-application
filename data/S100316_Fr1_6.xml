   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Booke (of what worth I say not; but more men, I feare, will commend it, then will know how to make use of it:) after it had for so many ages undeservedly beene buryed in darkenesse: is now first; if I may not say brought unto light, yet at least made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and intelligible. Twice it is true, within these 80. yeares it hath already beene set out in its owne originall Greeke: and set out both times with a Latin Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, much revised and corrected in the latter edition. Yet such are those editions, both of them, so confused, and so corrupt; and such is the Translation in both the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, so imperfect often, and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; that I say not so absurd and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as that it is not easie to determine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be harder to understand Antoninus his meaning by the Greeke that is printed;
<pb facs="7"/>or the Greeke that is printed, by the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slatiō of it: but that of both we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peremptorily conclude; of the one, that it cannot possibly bee understood, as it is printed; and of the other, that it would be more for the credit of the Author (a man otherwise acknowledged very learned:) if wee did take no notice of it at all. I must adde besides, that there hath beene many yeares agoe a certaine Booke, first written in Spanish, and since translated into Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, French, English, and how many tongues more I know not; pretended by the Title to be a Translation of <hi>M. Aurel. Antoninus.</hi> But that the Author of it, (a learned Spaniard) was in good earnest, I could never have beleeved, and would have thought I had done him great wrong to say it, had not I read his Prefaces, where he so earnestly by reasons, such as he could finde, goes about to make his Title good, and as earnestly expostulates with men for their incredulity, who did not take his reasons for current and cleere ones. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but commend his intention, which
<pb facs="7"/>certainely was to doe good; but his way I much abhorre, and wonder as much at his judgement and discretion. Sure I am that by his whole booke it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that hee had ever so much as seene that himselfe, which his Title doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise unto others, <hi>M. Aurel. Antoninus</hi> his booke: which either must bee this here, or none. For besides this, there is not any other, that ever was extant. For as for those other writings of his, which either he himselfe in his second booke, or <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolinus</hi> in his life, or <hi>Nicephorus</hi> in his Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Historie (lib. 3. cap. 31.) or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others mention, they mention them as books written, and composed by him, but not as ever publikly extant; which if they had, <hi>Suidas,</hi> or whosoever they be, whom <hi>Suidas</hi> in his Dictionary, in the word <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> doth alleage, would not have omitted them. Thus much I thought good here briefly to acquaint the Reader with; who if he please, may receive further satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the ensuing Discourse.</p>
