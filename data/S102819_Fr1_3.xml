   <head>To the learned brethren of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, discontented with the gouernement of the Church of England, and to all of that side, <hi>Grace and peace.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Take god to witnesse, whom I serue in my soule, that in all singlenesse of mind, in a tender regard of the peace of the Church, and the welfare of you al, I haue addressed my selfe to this treatise: his great name in my deuotions being first inuocated, that it would please him to sanctifie these studies, and to giue me the tongue of the wise, and the pen of the ready writer, to put forth thinges in season to the strengthning of the weak, to the encouragement of the forward, to the instigation of the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the conuiction of the obstinate. In the vnquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble assurance whereof, I speake now vnto you, (my certificate being the cheerfulnesse he hath giuen me, all the while I was in hand with the following discourse:) and am so zealous in the cause: the fire of his spirit, the worke of all good motions, kindling the coales of these meditations. So that I take vp the saying of the Poet:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Est deus in nohis agitante calescimus illo.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ouidius.</note>
   </p>
   <p>And though I speake but to your eare onelye, or rather to the ayer: yet my witnesses are in heauen, with what affections I
<pb facs="6"/>am trained to this treatise that will beare me record, my scope is to shew you: that the oddes betweene you and vs are not of that importance to deuide and sunder you from vs: but that seeing graue and godly authority will not that we should come to you, that you for order and godly authority sake would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply your selues to vs. That by our ioynt conformity we might all proceede in the common cause of Religion, and leade the people in the right way, of the knowledge of Christ crucified: as the Israelites ledde <hi>Dauid</hi> to <hi>Hebron,</hi> with a simple and perfect heart. That thereby we might be built like <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that is a city that is at vnity with it selfe,<note place="margin">Ezech. 37.</note> and as the Angles of the mercy seate, that turnes face to face: and not thus to be tyed back to back, as <hi>Sampsons</hi> foxes that made nothing but spoile and waste where they went: or to be as a disordered or confused army of such seuerall behauiour: one part ioyning, another deuiding companyes: Some standing still, other some running away. Read with Iudgement without preiudice, and let me haue but loue for loue again, and I desire no more. And so much I do deserue: wherefore if thou beest wanting therin, thou doest me more wrong, &amp; the blame is only thine. Reason would that none should be so wedded to his will: but that he should change it, when better reason mooueth. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
