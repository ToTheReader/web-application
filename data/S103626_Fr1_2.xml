      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ay it please you to giue me leaue to grace my Labours with your Noble Name, which shalbe vnto them as much grace as a good Light vnto a Picture. If herein there were any thing worthy of respect, they do belong vnto your La<seg rend="sup">ip.</seg> in many respects. For would I be a Trumpeter of your priuate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, I could sound out an Allarum both of your pitty &amp; Piety which you shewed both vntome &amp; mine, whilst I liued at <hi>Garlick-Hithe</hi> among those louing &amp; liberal Parishioners. But I know you are too sound to loue such Sounds, else would my poore Childrens bellyes, and mine owne backe (which you haue so often filled, &amp; this time presently cloathed) declare your praise in the Presse. Well then, what shall I render vnto you for your bounty but duty, honour &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? These premised of all that know what you haue bene vnto me and mine, I thinke doe make
<pb facs="3"/>them thinke, that if ought els might be added, it were no more then became a thankfull man.</p>
   <p>Take this then vertuous Lady (for a Newe-Yeares guift) that hath nothing besides himselfe to giue vnto you; which indeed I present, not so much to Instructe you, as to remember you in that which you are so well learned in: and that is TRVE HVMILITY, which you finding by a comfortable experience to be the HIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WAY TO HONOVR, you doe well to tread that Tracte; And good Madam goe on, for that will truely ennoble you, and bring you to great honour &amp; high exaltation. In which progresse of Yours, if this poore Sermon of mine might be either a Light, Guide or Staffe, it would glad my heart, and reioyce my soule, and make me thinke that my labour had in some measure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered your La<seg rend="sup">ips.</seg> loue, though not to the full. Will you Patronage so weake a worke? if not, yet pardon the workeman, who vndertooke the taske onely as a Token of a faithfull minde, who euer desires to shewe himselfe</p>
