   <p>MAruell not, good Reader, that ī doe not affixe my name to
this my Treatise. It is not knowen who was the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>riter of
the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and of diuerse other monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes

our Church in England. If a truth, &amp; nothing but the truth be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
it skilleth not whether the professor therof be knowen or not. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I doe iustlie cōdēne the vaine cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

vvherein an indifferent vvell vviller maie scarcely bee hearde to

      </gap>euous molestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to others, and vnprofitable pleasure that maie hereby ensue
vnto them selues, they woulde bridle these vnrulie longing affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
least that they preuayling against them in needelesse tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles,
doe at length g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tte ground vppon them in greater matters.
<hi>Rahab</hi> hath procured to hir selfe a memorable commendation for
<pb n="59" facs="30"/>
hiding Gods seruauntes when their aduersaries and her Maisters,
sought to apprehende them. If the holy man that wrote to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi>
thought it most cōuenient in godly policy to keep his name vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen,
assuredly they should haue beene deemed curious and idle brai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that would eyther haue beene inquisiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>e to know the same, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
knowledge thereof, would foolishlie haue blabbed it abroad to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Which thinges I speake rather in behalfe of others, than in feare
of axie danger that might growe vnto my selfe by this enterprise. For
first, that which I haue writen, cannot I trust, offende anie reasonable
and not partiallie affected person: or if it doe, the vprightnesse of mine
owne conscience, and loyaltie both to this Church and commonwealth,
will (I hope) inable me to sustaine and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>dure with cheerefulnesse, all
the malice and displeasure of anie enemie to a godlie peace. Secondlie, I
doe not desire at any mans hands the fauour of concealement in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
For although I haue attempted and published this my trauell
without making my selfe knowen to any creature, yet when my appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
shall be found more profitable to the Church then my conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I will come forth and iustifie my words in such maner and forme
as I haue writen. In the meane time I wish euery true harted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<hi>To pray for the peace of Ierusalem,</hi> that nowe at length her
Maiestie (of God will) rather then any other Prince succeeding, may
haue the honor in reconciling the two twinnes that striue togither is
the body of our Church, to the great perill and danger of the whole.
