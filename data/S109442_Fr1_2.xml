      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLEMEN,</hi> here is that presented to your eyes, which not long since sounded in your eares; that common Apologie for being men in print, (the importunity of friends) cannot be altogether mine, for some whom this may most concerne, will least desire it; but when I remember that ancient saying of <hi>Lucian,</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">Encomien pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae.</note>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, that the smoake of a mans owne country is better than the fire of another; I doubt not but that these my tender labours (which are but smoaky vapours of ignorance, compared to the enlightning fire of others knowledge, such as daily you heare) shall finde an easier passage into your acceptance, because here I had my first being where you all have your happy dwelling. 'Twas once farre from my meaning to have exposed my selfe to the paraphrase of this censorious age, but rather to have hid this weak conception, never to have
<pb facs="3"/>come to the birth: but when it would no longer endure to be imprisoned in the womb, but violently breake forth; I thought (being my first borne) to deale cautelously with it, though not with the Aegyptians cruelly to murther it; yet with <hi>Moses</hi> his parents charitably to hide it for my owne private use, it might have had the hap to have been still-borne, but it hath cried, and some that then heard it, have since desired to heare it speake, thinking it may live and doe some good, and although it speake somewhat bitterly, and bite so close (which perhaps some may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish) yet it bites nothing but sinne, I see no reason why we should spare the least sinne, since for it the world was drowned to punish it, the Law given to prevent it, the Sonne of the most high dyed to satisfie for it, and the world shall againe be destroyed to finish it, much lesse a sinne of this nature, so hainous, so detestable. For the matter hereof I have imitated, not the spider, but the Bee, the spiders web is not the more commendable because it is woven out of its owne bowels, nor the Bees honey lesse use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pleasant because it is gathered from severall flowers, what ever it be 'twas yours first in the intention and occasion; now in the protection and nourishment: 'tis not so farre put forth to nurse, but that the parents shall quickly see the good usage of it, if it thrive in your kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, you have crowned the desires and endeavours of him who is at</p>
