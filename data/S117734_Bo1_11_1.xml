counsell, that though your enemies are mightie and many, and that they doe preuaile against you, and
with their multitude take from you both the flesh and feathers of the Goose, (which indeed belongs not to
you, nor doe I dedicate them to you) yet here is your true honour, and that which makes all me admire
you, that her better part, her genious, her intellectuall vnderstanding, her capacity, and reuerend gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity,
her wisedome, and her very spirit; neither man, Deuill, or Dragon, is able to bereaue you of, as
long as you haue a sword to defend it. I haue dedicated a Booke of a <hi>Begger</hi> at this time to <hi>Archy,</hi>
