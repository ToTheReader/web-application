      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Cobler become a Corrector? Ho, Ho, Ho: it was not so when <hi>Robin Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow</hi> was a Ruffler, and helpt the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie wenches to grinde their Mault: Then gentlemen, the Ploughswaine medled with his Teame: the Gentlemā with his Hound &amp; his Hawke: the Artificer with his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: &amp; the Scholler with his booke: euery degree cōtented him within his limits. But now the world is growne to that passe, that Pierce Plow man will prie into lawe, naie into Diuinitie, and his duncerie must needs be doctrine: tush, what of higher powers? what of Vniuersities? the text to put downe them, <hi>Babes &amp; Sucklings,</hi> and no more. This makes <hi>Robin Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow</hi> that was so merry a spirit of the Butterie, to leaue all and keepe himselfe in Purgatorie, for Hospitalitie is so cleane run out of the Countrie, that he needs not now helpe the maids to grinde mault, for the drinke is so small that it needes little corne: and if he should helpe them, where he was woont to finde a messe of Creame for his labour, he should scarse get a dish of floate Milke. Why? see you not how cranke the Cobler is, that will forsooth correct <hi>Dick Tarltons</hi> dooings, a man famous in his life for merrie conceits, and especially a Booke of my publishing? well Gentlemen, if you suffer it, and <hi>Dick Tarlton</hi> pocket it vp without a reuenge, or a drie blowe at his breeche, <hi>Robin Goodfellow</hi> makes a vowe, to haunt him in his sleepe, and after his olde merrie humour, so to playe the knaue with the Cobler, that hee shall repent hee medled so farre beyonde his latchet. But I will carrie my friends these
<pb facs="5"/> newes to Purgatorie, where I know for anger he will almost breake his Taber, and will not rest till he haue reuenged: we will lay both our wits together, to put downe the paltring Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and heere I make a vowe, either to get the conquest, or els neuer to come in your sightes: and to say as I was woont: What Himp and Hampe, heere will I neuer more grinde nor stampe.</p>
