                 <title>A newe treatise of the right reckoning of yeares, and ages of the world, and mens liues, and of the estate of the last decaying age thereof : this 1600. yeare of Christ, (erroniouslie called a yeare of Iubilee) which is from the Creation, the 5548. yeare. Conteining sundrie singularities, worthie of observation, concerning courses of times, and revolutions of the heauen, and reformations of kalendars, and prognistications: with a discourse of prophecies and signes, preceeding the latter daye, which by manie arguments appeareth now to approch. With a godlie admonition in the end, vpon the words of the Apostle, to redeeme the time, because the dayes are evill. By M. Robert Pont, an aged pastour in the Kirk of Scotland. The heades are set downe in certaine propositions, in the page following</title>

concerning controllment and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of times, by occasion of this
incident 1600. yeare of Christ, which
is reckoned by the Papistes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
applauding to their superstition,
to be a yeare of <hi>Iubilee;</hi> I thought
good to prevent that errour, by this
little Treatise: discevering thereby the vanitie of divers men
of this Ile, &amp; of others far cuntries, who with great los of time
and hazard, not onely of their substance and liues, but also of
their soules and consciences, minde to visite that Idole the
Pope, and to be present in <hi>Rome,</hi> onely to see his yeare of
<hi>Iubilee:</hi> falsely being counterfaited to the imitation of the
<hi>Iubilees</hi> of the Iewes, but indeede derogatory to the true <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee,</hi>
and spirituall libertie purchased vnto vs by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ. And for-as-much as this instante yeare is the
ende of a great Period of time, to witte, sixteene hundreth
yeares, from Christ his nativitie, wherein there appeares
diverse great mutationes, to fall out, aswel in the estate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as in civill affaires and common wealthes: I haue
herewith, not onely discovered diverse erroures, in reckoning
of times, and ages of the Worlde, and laboured to finde out
the right reckoning, but also touched the revolution of the
heauen, and reformation of Kalendars and Prognostications,

and declared my iudgement, concerning the Prophecies and
