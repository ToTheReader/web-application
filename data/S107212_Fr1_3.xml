   <head>The Argument vpon the Epistle to the <hi>Galathians by M. Iohn Caluine.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is sufficiently knowne what</hi> part of <hi>Asia</hi> the Galathians inhabited, and with what limits their Countrey was boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but whence they had their beginning, appeareth not so well among Writers. All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that they were Gaules: and therof they were named Gaulegrecians. But out of what part of Gaule (or Fraunce) they came, they doe not so well agree. Strabo thought that the Tectosages came out of Gaule Narbon, and that the other were Celtae: vvhome all for the moste part haue followed. But vvheras Plinius reckoneth the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biani vvith t e Tectosagi, and beside that, by the consent of all, that they had the Tolistobogi to their fellowes, vvho dwelt vpon the borders of the Rhine: it semeth to me more likelye that they vvere the Belgae, inhabiting the farmost coast of the Rhine, toward the Brittaine Sea. For the Tolis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tobogi held that portion in vvhich nowe the Cleueners and Brabanders do inhabite. But hereof sprong the error, in my opinion: that whereas some band of the Tectosages hadde made an inroade into Gaule Narbon, they retained their name, &amp; called the Region which they by force possessed, by it. And this doth <hi>Ausonius</hi> shew, where he sayth, Euen so far as to the Teutosagi who at the first were called Belgae. For he both calleth them Belgae: &amp; testifieth that in the beginning they vvere called Teutosagi, who afterward were named Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctosagi. And whereas Caesar doth place the Tectosagi in the wood called Hercinia, I vnderstād that to be done by going out of their own country thither: and by the story you may also gather it. But as touching the originall of the Nation, more thā sufficient hath ben spoken, as in regard of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent place. The Galathians which held that portion of <hi>Asia</hi> which toke the nam of thē, as they wer deuided into 3. prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal peoples, namly the Tectosages, Tolistobogi, &amp; the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cmi, so also, saith Plinie, they had three principal Cities. They
<pb facs="4"/> flourished with so greate force once among their weake neighboures, that a great part of the lesser <hi>Asia</hi> vvas tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie to them: at length their Countreyes vertue wearing out, they gaue themselues to delicacie and excesse. So vvith no great adoe they were ouercome in battayle, and subdew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Cneus Manlius,</hi> the Romane Consul. in Saint Paule his tyme they were vnder the Romanes. Furthermore whereas he had purely and faithfully instructed them in the Gospel: there came, while he was away the false Apostles, who cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the true seede (of the Word) with false and corrupt Doctrines. For they taught that the obseruing of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies was as yet necessarie. It might seeme a thing of light ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in shewe. but Paule contendeth about it as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall poynt of the christian faith: and not without a cause, for it is no smal euill to smother the brightnesse of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, to lay a snare vpon the consciences, to take awaye the difference of the old and new Testament. he did see besides this, that vnto these erroures there was ioyned also a wicked and hurtfull opinion of deseruing righteousnesse. This is the cause why he striueth with suche vehemencye and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. that we also being admonished how waightye and serious a matter is here handled, maye be the more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to reade it. If a man estimate the cause by the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of Origen or Ierome, he shall wonder that Paule was so greatly moued for certaine outward customes. but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shall looke vpon the beginning it selfe, shall confesse that they were matters not vnmeete to be so sharpely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended about. For in that the Galathians by ouer swift cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, nay rather by lightnesse and folly suffered themselues to be lead away from the truth: therefore he reprehendeth them the more sharply▪ for I am not of their opinion, which suppose that they were the hardlyer handled for because of the dulnesse of their witte. The Ephesians and Colossians were assayed also. and if they had so lightly yielded to their deceites, thinke we that Paule would haue dealte any more mildely with them? The nature of the people then moued him not thus franklye to chide them, but it was rather the
<pb facs="4"/> hatefulnesse of the matter that enforced him. Now that we vnderstande the cause why he wrote this Epistle: let vs come to the order of the handling thereof. He contendeth in the two firste chapters about the authoritie of his Apostleship: sauing that by occasion, about the end of the second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he entreth into the principall (state of the matter): that is to say into the question of the iustification of man: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of neuerthelesse at the last in the thirde chapter he openlye frameth a full disputation. Although he seeme to intreate of many thinges in these two Chapters: yet this one thing he indeauoureth, to proue himselfe equall with the highest A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: and that he lacketh nothing but that he maye bee reckoned an Apostle in like degree of honour, as they. But it is worth the while to know why hee tooke so great pains about the triall of his estimation. for so that Christ raigne, and that the puritie of doctrine remaine sound, what skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it whether he be aboue Peter, or lesse then Peter, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee all equall among themselues? If all must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, that only Christ may encrease, vnfruitfull is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention about the dignitie of men. Moreouer this maye bee demaunded, why he compareth himselfe to the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, for what controuersie had he with Peter and Iames, and Iohn? to what purpose then did it belong, that those who were of one mynde and good friendes among themselues, shoulde be at oddes against themselues? I aunswere, that the false Apostles, who had beguiled the Galathians, to the end they might the better aduaunce themselues, pretended the names of the Apostles, as though they had ben sent of them. This was a notable shouldring in of thēselues, for that they were beleeued to be the Apostles deputies, and spake as it vvere out of their mouth: and in the meane while did pluck away from Paule the name and right of an Apostle. For they did obiect that he was not chosen of the Lord, one of the twelue, that he was neuer acknowled to be such an one by the colledge of the Apostles: and that not only hee had his doctrine not from Christ, but not so muche as from the Apostles, so came it to passe that not onelye the authoritie
<pb facs="5"/> of Paul vvas diminished: but that he was as some one of the multitude, much baser then themselues. If the matter had bene concearning persons only, it had bene no great matter for Paule to haue bene reputed some common Disciple: but vvhen he did see his Doctrine thereby beginne to grow out of credite, and to be set lesse by: he ought not to holde his peace, but stoutlye speake against it. This is the wylinesse of the Deuill, vvhen he dareth not assayle the Doctrine mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly, vvith crooked mynes to hurle down the maiestie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Let vs remember than, that in the person of Paule the truth of the Gospell vvas assaulted, for if he had suffred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be spoyled of the honour of Apostleship, it followed that he had vsurped more hitherto than vvas his right. and this false boasting woulde haue made him bene suspected in other thinges also. And therupon also did hang the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his doctrine, in that it should haue the beginning and was receaued not as proceeding from an Apostle of Christe, but from some common disciple. On the otherside hee was ouerwhelmed with the maiestie of great names and stiles. For they wheras they boasted them of the title of Peter and Iames and Iohn, did chalenge to themselues Apostolicall authoritie. And had not Paule manfully resisted this boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, he should haue geuen roome for a lye, and moreouer should haue suffered in his owne person the truth to haue bene trodden downe. Therefore doth he seriously contend about both, (namely) that he was an Apostle appointed of the Lord, and also that he was nothing inferiour to the rest: but that he was of like right and dignitie as they, euen as he had like name with them. He might haue denied either that they were sent by Peter and his felowe Apostles, or that they had any commandement from them: but this defence hath much more waight, that he geueth not place to the Apostels themselues: for if he had shunned that, he should haue bene thought to haue distrusted his own cause. Ierusalem in those dayes was the mother of all Churches, for that the Gospel did flowe from thence into the whole worlde, and it was as it weare the principall seate of the kingdome of Christe.
<pb facs="5"/> Whosoeuer came from thence into other Churches he vvas reuerently receiued, and not vvithout good cause. But ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were swolne vvith a foolish glory, because they vvere fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milier vvith the Apostles, or at the leastwise instructed by their teaching. Therfore nothing liked them, but that which they saw (done) at Ierusalem. all other rites or vsages not there vsed, they not only reiected, but hardily also condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Such vvaywardnesse is a plague very euill: vvhen vvee vvill haue the fashion or custome of one Church to stand as a generall law. And it riseth of a preposterous zeale vvhen vve are so vvedded to some teacher or place, that vvithoute vvaying the matter, vve vvould bynde all places and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to the sence and vvill of one man, and to the orders of one place, as to a generall or common rule, although ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alway mingled to it: yea rather ouermuch vvayward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is full of ambition. But to returne to these false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles: if onely vpon an ill emulation they had assayed in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place to thrust in the vsage of the ceremonies, which they saw kept at Ierusalem: in so doing they had done no small offence. for it is iniurious of a custom straight vvay to make a rule. But there vvas more euill in their Doctrine being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and pernicious, for that they vvould holde the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences bounde by a religion, for that they placed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the obseruation thereof. Nowe vve perceiue vvhy Paule vvas so stoute in the avouching his Apostleship, and vvhy he doth set himselfe (by way of comparing) against the other Apostles. And that doth he til the ende of the second Chapter, vvhere he maketh away ouer vnto the handling of the matter: namely that vve are iustified freely before God, not by the workes of the law. For he vseth this argument, If ceremonies haue not power to iustifie, then the obseruing of them is not necessarie. although he speaketh not of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies alone, but reasoneth generally of vvorkes: or else all his argument vvere caycolde. If this seeme vnto any to bee farre fetched, he must consider two thinges. First that hee could not otherwise dispatche the question, but by taking the generall principle (which is) We be iustified by the mere
<pb facs="6"/> grace of God: vvhich excludeth not ceremonies onlye, but also other vvorkes. Secondly that Paule made not so muche adoe concerning ceremonies, as about the vvicked opinion of getting saluation by vvorkes. Lette vs marke then that Paule beginneth not at the egge (as they say): but he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of necessitie the very spring head: that the readers maye know, that contention is not moued here about the shadow of the asse▪ but about the greatest matter of all, (namelye) By vvhat vvay vve shall get saluation. They are beguiled than vvho thinke that the Apostle keepeth himselfe in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the perticuler question concearning ceremonies: for he could not vvinde him out of it by it selfe. We haue the like example <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2. Strife and contention vvas moued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ceremonies, vvhether they vvere necessary to be kept: about discoursing vvherof the Apostles preach Of the yoke of the Law not able to be borne, Of the free remission of sinnes. To what purpose are these thinges? for it seemeth to be an absurde digressing from the purpose: but it is not so. for the perticuler errour could not otherwise be soundlye confuted, but by taking in hand the generall principle. As for example, If I must reason about the forbidding of eating flesh, I vvill make mention not onely of meates, but I vvill arme my selfe with the generall doctrine: how farre mans traditions ought to preuayle to the binding of the cōscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. and this will I take hold of, that there is one law giuer, vvhich hath power to saue and destroy. Let this be the sum: Paule in this place reasoneth from the generall to the speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all negatiuely: vvhich is an ordinarie and most naturall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of disputing. But with vvhat testimonies and reasons he proueth this sentence, <hi>We are iustified by the only grace of Christ,</hi> vve shal see in his place. This he prosecuteth euen to the end of the third Chapter. In the beginning of the fourth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he intreateth of the right vse of ceremonies, and vvhy they vvere ordained: vvhere also he sheweth that they are now abolished. For he must preuent this absurditie, vvhich straight vvay might haue come in any mans minde, To what end than vvere ceremonies? were they vnprofitable? did the
<pb facs="6"/> Fathers occupie thēselues in thē in vaine? He determineth both breefelye. (namelye) that in their time they vvere not superfluous &amp; also that now they are abrogated by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ: because he is the truth and ende of them, wherefore he teacheth that we must abide in him. where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hee briefely toucheth, what our state differeth from the state of the Fathers. whereof it foloweth, that the doctrine of the false apostles, which darkeneth the brightnesse of the Gospel with the shadowes of the old Lawe, is a peruerse and hurtfull doctrine. with his doctrine hee mingleth certayne exhortations to moue the affections. About the ende of the Chapiter he setteth out his matter with a fine and pleasant allegorie. In the fifte chapiter he exhorteth to holde faste the libertie purchased by the blood of Christ, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer not their consciences to be entangled vvith the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of men. but yet withall he admonisheth what is the lawfull measure of libertie. And vpon this occasion he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, which are the true exercises of Christians: least whileste they are in vayne occupied about cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, they passe ouer those things that are principall.</p>
