      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F writers of books in former ages have made
a gratefull commemoration in the front of
their workes, of worthy, men who for their
brave deeds either in Peace, or War, Church
or Common wealth were renounced, thereby
to enternize their fame, and by their examples to extimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
others to the imitation of their vertues; nothing
could expiat my trespasse, if I should passe over your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
most accomplished rare vertues, thereby to deprive
posterity of so excellent a President, especially amongst
your other many exquisite perfections you being in this
barren age so worthy a patterne, and Bountifull Patron of
letters and literate men. Let antiquity boast it selfe of the
integritie of a Greeke Aristides, in the gravity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibilitie
of a Roman <hi>Cato,</hi> and the rest: yet our age
<pb facs="79"/>
may rejoyce to have all these accumulated on your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
alone; Envy cannot conceale with what credit and
generall applause (as through the Temple of Vertue to the
Sacrary of Honour) you have past all the orders of our
Senatoriall Tribunall even to the highest dignity; where,
like an Oracle, you strike light through most foggie and
obscurest doubts. The continued favour of Kings, the
aggrandizing of your estate by well managed fortune, the
peopling by the fecunditie of your fruitefull loynes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
your owne large stocke but many of the most ancient and
honourable families in our nation, may well set out your
praises to the world, but the true Panegyrick which I (if
able) would sound abroad your Honours due deserving
merits, to which, in all humility and reverence, I offer
this small pledge of my entirer affection, hoping ere long
to present them with something more worthy the studies
