   <head>TO THE RIGHT
worshipfull, my very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and Christian friend, Sir
Williā Gee, knight, one of his
Maiesties honorable Counsel
in the North. Recorder of the
Townes of Beuerley and Hull,
and one of his Maiesties Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices

of the Countie of Yorke,

Grace and peace from

   <p>AMongst the many
reasons (Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Sir) which haue
perswaded me that Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
cannot be the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
this is not the least:
<pb facs="3"/>
the insufficiencie of their
doctrine of faith and repē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
which two things,
though they be the chiefe
and principall points in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and so necessarie,
that he, who doth not but
know, and practise them
aright, can neuer bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
yet I dare auouch,<note place="margin">Canitius in Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
         <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>hismo. Costerus in Enchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridio.</note>
that the faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Romish
church, as they are taught
by many of the best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued
Papists, are no
better thē such a faith, and
such a repētance as an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
and a very repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
may attaine vnto. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
to insist vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb facs="3"/>
only (they make
many faire florishes, they
call it penance, they make
it a Sacrament,<note place="margin">Corradus, Nauar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Loper Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Grasffius, Hallus, and many other.</note> and say it
is a boord that saues a
man after shipwracke, and
write great volumes of it,
and of <hi>confession,</hi> and of
<hi>Cases of Conscience,</hi> (as you
good Syr in your owne
reading knowe better then
I) and yet alas, when all is
done, it is but a shadowe
of repentance; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
how can they teach
aright the doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
which erre so
fowly in setting downe
the iustice of God, and
the vilenesse of sinne:
<pb facs="4"/>
Which two points a man
must know, else hee will
neuer repent: but Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
misconceiuing the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of God, teaching it
not to bee infinite, in as
much as it needes not an
infinite satisfaction, and
misconceiuing the nature
of sinne, teaching euery
sinne not to be damnable,
nor to offend Gods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
iustice, erring (I say)
in these two, how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
they should conceiue
aright the nature of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?
by which a
man seeing his sinnes, their
foulenesse, their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and his owne mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="4"/>
by them, confesseth
them, bewailes them, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Gods iustice, flieth
from it, and craues for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse
of his mercy:
and lastly purposeth, and
indeuoureth to leaue thē
all, and to leade a new life.
The serious considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
heereof, hath often
made mee wonder, why
many popish treatises, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in some sort exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to repētance, should
be so accounted of as they
are by some: for though I
confesse, there are in
some of them, good and
wholesome meditations,
and manye motiues
<pb facs="5"/>
to mortification, &amp; good
life, yet woulde I gladly
learne of any man but this
one thing, howe those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
can bee pithie,
or powerfull, sound, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
way sufficient to moue
a man to repentance, whē
as, not those bookes, not
all Poperie is able to
teach a man sufficiently
what true repentance
is.</p>
   <p>If any man reply: I will
therefore learne the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
out of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
bookes: and vse
the Papists for exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
onely: I then answere;
Is it not a more compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
<pb facs="5"/>
and conuenient,
and a lesse scandalous
course, to seeke exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of such writers, as
do teach the doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right?
nay I doubt howe it
is possible to finde a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
exhortation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
in any Papist,
who erres in the Doctrine:
the reason is manifest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Doctrine is the
ground of exhortation:
and if the doctrine bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound,
how can the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
bee any better? Let
vs therefore leaue these
muddie puddles, and
fette our water at the
Fountaine: the water
<pb facs="6"/>
of life, at the fountaine of
life: I meane the doctrine
of faith, and repentance,
at the written worde of
God, and at such mens
writings as are grounded
thereupon, and agreeable
thereunto.</p>
   <p>Nowe,<note place="margin">Deering, Greenha, Bradford, and many.</note> amongst those
many instrumentes of
God, who haue laboured
with profite in this great
point of Religion: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repentance, drawing
their doctrine out of the
breasts, of the two Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
of Gods booke, I
may well say, (to say no
more) that this man of
GOD, Maister <hi>Perkings,</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>
deserues to haue his
place: whose labours,
whilest he liued, and his
yet liuing labours, what
they deserue, I had rather
others should proclaime,
then I once name: who
professe my selfe to be one
of those many, who many
truly say, that by the grace
of God, and his good
meanes principally, I am
that I am: But leauing
him in that glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which Christ the
Lord of the Haruest hath
prepared for him: and
now giuen him: I returne
to my selfe, and doe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
praise the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb facs="7"/>
who gaue mee my
time in the Vniuersitie, in
those happie daies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in)
beside many worthy
men of God, whereof
some are falne a sleepe, and
some remaine aliue vnto
this day) this holy man did
spend himselfe like a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
to giue light vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
   <p>The scope of all his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeuours was to teach
<hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and much laboured
to moue all men to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that as our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
hath made Poperie
ashamed of their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
so our holy liues
<pb facs="7"/>
might honour our holy
profession. And as repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
was one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
endes, both of his
continuall preaching and
writing: so especially and
purposely hath hee twise
dealte in that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
   <p>First, in his Treatise of
Repentance: published,
1592. wherein briefly
(as his manner was▪) but
soundly, pithily, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
he laieth down the
Doctrine, and the very
nature of Repentance:
and after the positiue
Doctrine, hee toucheth
some of the principall
<pb facs="8"/>
controuersies and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in that doctrine, but
afterwards thinking with
himselfe, that hee had not
seriously and forcibly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
vrged so great and
necessarie a lesson as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is, therefore
shortly after, being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and called to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Preaching, in that
great, and generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at <hi>Stirbridge Faire,</hi> hee
thought it a fit time, for
this necessarie and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
exhortation to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
to the intent,
that as wee were taught
the Doctrine of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
in the former trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise:
<pb facs="8"/>
so in these Sermons
wee might be stirred vp to
the practise of it. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
(good Sir:) I iudge
there coulde haue beene
no matter, more fitte for
that assembly, then an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
to repentance:
for as the audience was
great and generall, of all
sorts, sexes, ages and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of men, and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
out of many corners
of this kingdome, so is
this doctrine generall for
all: some doctrines are for
parents, some for children,
some for schollers, some
for trades-men, some for
men, some for women,
<pb facs="9"/>
but repentance is for all:
without which, it may bee
saide of all, and euery one
of age, not one excepted:
No Repentance, no salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
   <p>These Sermons being
in my hands, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
to mee from hand
to hand, but takē with this
hand of mine, from his
own mouth, were thought
worthy for the excellēcie,
and fit for the generalitie
of the matter, to bee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the publique view:
I haue also other works of
his in my hands: of which
(being many,) I confesse
my selfe to be but the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb facs="9"/>
for the time, taking
my selfe bound to keepe
thē safely, to the benefite
of Gods church, of whose
treasure vpon earth I make
no question, but they are
a part: and I hartily desire
you (my good friendes)
and all other faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
to solicite the Lord
in praier for me, that I may
faithfully discharge my
selfe of that great charge
which in this respect lieth
vpō me: &amp; that his grace &amp;
blessing may be on me and
all others, who are to bee
imployed in this seruice,
wherein (had the Lord
so pleased) wee coulde
<pb facs="10"/>
heartily haue wished ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to haue bene imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
but that his life might
haue eased vs of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
and that as I begin
with this, so I, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
better able (which I
rather desire) may goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
vndertaking the
weight of this great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
and not faint, till he
haue made a faithfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to the Church of
God, of all the Iewels deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
to our trust.</p>
   <p>And nowe these first
fruites of my labours, in
another mans vine yard,
as also all that hereafter
do or may follow, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb facs="10"/>
consecrate to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
spouse of Christ Iesus,
the holy Church of God
on earth, and namely to
the Church of England,
our beloued mother, who
may reioyce, that shee was
the mother of such a son,<note place="margin">Maister Perkings, but fortie yeares olde at his death.</note>
who in fewe yeares did so
much good to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
cause of religion, as
the wickednesse of many
yeares shall not bee able to
weare out. But first of all,
and especially, I present
the same vnto you (my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
worshipfull and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
friendes) who (I must
needes say) are very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it in many respects.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="11"/>
1. For the matter it selfe,
which is repentance, my
selfe being able to testifie,
that you are not hearers,
but dooers, rise in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and rise in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of Repentance: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as I dare from the
testimonie of my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and in the word of a
Minister, pronoūce of you
that as you haue heard and
knowne this doctrine of
repentance, so blessed are
you, for you doe it.</p>
   <p>And 2. for him who was
the author hereof (whose
mouth spake it from the
feeling of his soule, and
whose soule is now bound
<pb facs="11"/>
vp in the bundle of life:
I know, &amp; cannot in good
conscience conceale the
great delight you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
had in the reading
of his books, the reuerend
opinion, you had of him
liuing, &amp; how heauily and
passionately, you took his
death &amp; departure: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to cheare you vp in
want of him, I send you
here this little booke, his
own child, begotten in his
life time, but borne after
his death: obserue it
well, and you shall finde
it, not vnlike the father,
yea, you shall discerne in
it the fathers spirit, and it
<pb facs="12"/>
doubts not, but to finde
entertainment with them,
of whom the father was so
well respected.</p>
   <p>And for my selfe, I spare
to rehearse what interest
you haue in me, and all my
labours, it is no more then
you worthily deserue, and
shall haue in me for euer:
you are the fairest flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in this garden, which
in this place, I after others
haue planted for the Lord
(or rather God by vs):
And two principall pearls
in that Crowne, which I
hope for, at the last day
from the Lord my God,
whose word at my mouth
<pb facs="12"/>
you haue receiued with
much reuerence, and with
such profit, as if I had the
like successe of my labours
in others, I should then
neuer haue cause to say
with the Prophet, I haue
laboured in vaine, &amp; spent
my strength in vaine, but
my iudgement is with the
Lord, and my worke with
my God.</p>
   <p>And if I knew you not,
to bee such as take more
delight in doing well, then
in hearing of it, I would
prooue at large, what I
haue spoken of you: yet
giue me leaue to say that,
which without open
<pb facs="13"/>
wrong, I may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale,
that beside your
care, knowledge, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
zeale to religion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
duties of the first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God himselfe, your
charitie and pietie to the
needie distressed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
at home and abroad:
your mercifull dealing
with them, who are in
your power; your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence
to learning, and
namely to some in the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersitie,
do all proclaime
to the worlde those your
due prayses: which I (well
knowing your modesties)
doe spare once to name:
neither would I haue saide
<pb facs="13"/>
thus much, were it not for
this cold and barren age,
wherein we liue, that so,
when our preaching can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
moue, yet your godly
examples might stirre vp.
Pardon me therfore I pray
you, &amp; thinke it no wrong
to you,<note place="margin">Ps. 11. 16.</note> which is a benefit
to Gods Church:<note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 10.</note> But goe
forward in the strength
of the Lord your God,<note place="margin">1. Thes. 5. 24.</note> &amp;
hold on in that happie
course you haue begun,
be faithfull vnto the ende,
the Lord will giue you
the Crowne of life:
faithfull is hee, which
hath promised, who will
also doe it: proceede
<pb facs="14"/>
(good Sir) to honour
learning in your selfe and
others, and religion espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
which is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallearning,
and proceede
both of you, to practise
religion in your owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
and in your family,
hold on to shine before
your familie, and amongst
the people, where you
dwel, in zeale and holines:
holde on hereby, still to
shame poperie, to stoppe
your enemies mouthes,
and to honour that holy
religion, which you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
to gaine comfort of
good conscience to your
selues, &amp; assurance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="14"/>
reward: and lastly, to
encourage mee in those
painefull duties which lye
vpon mee: for I openly
professe that your religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
zeale and loue of the
truth, with many other
good helpes, are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
encouragementes in
my ministerie, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
motiues vnto mee, to
vndertake the charge of
publication, of so many
of the workes of this holy
man deceased, as may not
in better manner be done
by others. But I keepe you
too long from this holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
following; I
therefore send you it, and
<pb facs="15"/>
it to you, and from
you, to the Churche of
God: for I dare not make it
priuately yours and mine,
wherein the whole church
hath interest, as well as we:
It was Preached in the
field, but it is worthy to be
admitted into our hearts:
I found it in the opē field,
but vpon diligent viewe,
finding it to bee Gods
corne, and a parcell of his
holy and immortall seede,
therefore I brought it
home, as good corne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues:
And as it is Gods
corne, so in you, I desire all
holy Christians to lay it vp
in Gods garners, that is, in
<pb facs="15"/>
their hearts and soules.</p>
   <p>And thus committing
this little volume to your
reading, the matter to
your practise: you and
yours, to the blessed fauour
of that God, whome you
serue: and my selfe and my
endeuours, to your hartie
loue, and holy prayers, I
take leaue: From my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die;
<hi>August.</hi> 7. 1607.</p>
