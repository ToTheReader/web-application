   <p> I speake to as manie as bee
vpright <hi>Subjects</hi> of this <hi>Kingdome;</hi> of which number
I am sure, there is not one, to whome the principall scope
of this <hi>Discourse</hi> will not bee gracious and plausible. If
some <hi>Passages</hi> doe perhaps displease, it is for too narrow
compting in your <hi>Particulars.</hi> And if I haue toutched these
points moderatelie, and haue in them also my interesse equall with yours, it doeth

hath not beene intended for you, or mee, or for another, but for the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Wee haue spent our whole Yeares gone to our <hi>Private Studies, Pleasures,</hi>
or <hi>Emolument,</hi> without the meanest distraction by anie sort of <hi>Tyrannie,</hi>
or <hi>State-Calamitie,</hi> Our dayes haue beene like vnto that jubilant age of the

         </gap>m quam antea. There is</hi> (sayeth <hi>SALOMON</hi>) a tyme for Peace,
and a tyme for Warre: a tyme to gather and keepe, and a tyme to
cast away: and GOD doeth these things that men should feare
before Him. The golden tyme of Peace, and collection, that wee haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
vnder our late King of blessed memorie, hath so besotted our Myndes,
with Securitie, that wee are even Ignorants of the ordinarie vicissitude of the
World; so farre, that the verie first threatnings of change, doe confound vs;
where as by the contrarie, they should make vs turne to our GOD, and feare
before Him: resolving to accept at His Hands, patientlie, and thankfullie, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so long <hi>Prosperitie,</hi> the Corrections, for our sinnes proper to vs; and in the
nature of thinges common with vs, to all People.</p>
   <p>I haue presented before you, in this <hi>Treatise,</hi> as vpon a <hi>Board,</hi> a summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Portract of the <hi>estate of this tyme,</hi> and of the dangers where-of wee are
so much affrayde: which if yee shall diligentlie contemplate, it will helpe both
your knowledge and your resolution. As for some few particulars, that for
the first face, may bee some-what disagreeable with you, yee shall finde here
also conjoyned with them, their soveraigne remeadies and solaces. If yee will
but ascende a while, with mee vpon this <hi>Stage,</hi> to agitate the cause of your
<hi>Prince,</hi> your <hi>Countrey,</hi> your <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> when
wee shall looke backe vpon the invincible couerage of our <hi>Predecessours,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
so manie mightie <hi>Nations,</hi> for the standing of this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were <hi>Christians;</hi> and that more than humane magnanimitie of the
Heathen <hi>Codrus</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> and others lyke to him, the <hi>Bruti</hi> of <hi>Rome,
decios{que} caput fatale voventes,</hi> and these heroicke <hi>Decij,</hi> how in sacred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies
of resolution, they did devote and sacrifice their lyues, for safetie of the
States where-of they were members; such speculations shall make vs ashamed
of some of our discontentments, and languishing amidst so great exigence, and
appearance of publicke distresses.</p>
   <p>I know there is no generose spirit, but will bee much delighted with this
subject, nor anie wise-hearted man, who will not esteeme it a vertuous and
laudable part, to bee fore-seeing of so capitall dangers.</p>
   <p>With-in these three, or foure Yeares, the <hi>Palatinate</hi> did lesse dread the
<hi>Spanyard,</hi> than wee doe now. <hi>Tum tua res agitur, paries dum proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
ardet.</hi> If wee doe feare the LORD, obey our <hi>Prince,</hi> and bee of
vnited Myndes, tymouslie to employe the meanes that GOD hath given vs,
to with-stand so strong an Enemie; then there is no doubt, but wee shall bee
bastant to oppose him: but if wee bee relenting in these, then I would say, as

one of the <hi>Parthian</hi> Kings sayde, long before they were conquered, by the

Wee haue great cause to project <hi>Feares,</hi> and long before to parralele
the flowrishing destinies of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Empyre: which, lyke vnto a Torrent,
hath with-in these hundreth Yeares, over-flowed the fairest and strongest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes
of <hi>Europe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Certainlie, it is no time for vs to delay in murmurations, and to object our
povertie, amongst infinite <hi>Examples</hi> that bee in <hi>Histories,</hi> of the fatall
ruine that hath followed to <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> by such doing: the pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and mercilesse sackage of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the second,
may onelie serue, to terrifie vs from the lyke: the <hi>Citizens</hi> of that <hi>Towne</hi>
being full of <hi>Ritches,</hi> did so misregard their late Emperours, that one of them,
<hi>Baldwine,</hi> after hee had solde his <hi>Silver Plate, Iewels,</hi> and best <hi>Moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables,</hi>
hee was forced to pawne his <hi>Sonne</hi> to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for Money to
maintaine <hi>Warres</hi> against the <hi>Turkes.</hi> The last of them, <hi>Constantine</hi>
the eight, being desperatelie besiedged by the saide <hi>Mahomet,</hi> was not able to
furnish <hi>Pay</hi> to his <hi>Souldiours,</hi> by reason of exorbitant <hi>Vsuries,</hi> exercised by
his <hi>Merchands;</hi> nor <hi>Corne,</hi> nor <hi>Victuals,</hi> by reason of their <hi>Monopolies,</hi>
although there was great store of both with-in. Where-vpon, after some
Weekes of mutuall grudges, and exclamation of the <hi>Emperour</hi> against his
<hi>Subjects,</hi> and of them against him, that glorious <hi>Citie,</hi> so commodiouslie sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(for dominion over the <hi>World</hi>) vpon the shoulders of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi>
so <hi>Emperesse</hi>-lyke over-looking both, was taken by the <hi>Turkes,</hi> her miserable
<hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People</hi> cruellie murthered, her beautifull <hi>Churches</hi> turned in
<hi>Stables,</hi> her hudge <hi>Ritches</hi> possessed by the <hi>Enemies,</hi> and shee made a <hi>Port</hi>
for that bloodie and barbarous <hi>Nation,</hi> to come in vpon the necke of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
I will no more insist thus in this place, because the <hi>Treatise</hi> is full of
<hi>Practises</hi> and <hi>Examples,</hi> convenient for your present vse: I will onelie say
againe, That it is no tyme for vs now to contest with our <hi>King,</hi> when question

Children</hi> of this <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> that wee may all in one voyce say
with <hi>Pericles</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> when his <hi>Citie</hi> was reduced to great straites, for

a naturall Argument, to corroborate his supernaturall Beliefe, for the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his Bodie. And the learned <hi>Scaliger,</hi> in his <hi>Exercitations</hi> against
<hi>Cardan,</hi> discoursing of the Angelicall nature, hee calleth that kinde of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
fastigium omnis scientiae, the top of humane <hi>Wisdome:</hi> and doth verie
confidentlie censure the contemners there-of, saying, <hi>Irridebuntur ista à qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busdam
sectis nebulonum qui otio &amp; supinitate marcentes fasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium
scientiae contemnunt titulo curiositatis:</hi> noting two sorts of them,
who (sayth hee) doe constantlie barke against the search of anie other thing
than the naked and literall sense in the <hi>Scripture:</hi> one is of those who bee
meerlie naturalists, <hi>&amp; nunquam assurgunt ad supremam causam:</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
of some presumptuous, but shallow-brained <hi>Theologues,</hi> who covering
their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> with pretext of <hi>Holinesse, semper assurgunt ad supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam
causam,</hi> they are ever speaking, and talking of the knowledge of GOD,
but may not abyde one word of <hi>Nature;</hi> contemning the high contemplations
there-of, which are the verie paeth-way that doe leade vs vnto that <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
Neither of which two (sayeth hee) haue tasted this sweet <hi>Science</hi> of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall</hi>

and eternall: and as the shadow of anie creature doeth perfectlie declinate vnto
vs the shape, the forme, the space, and name there-of, although wee doe not see
the bodie it selfe; so (sayth hee) into this great bodie of visible <hi>Nature</hi> (which
is the Image of that intellectuall and infinite <hi>World</hi>) there is the true delinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

The Prophets of the olde Law did receiue their revelations from the Angels in

And of Him sayeth Sainct <hi>Marke, That without Parables Hee spake

Hee did delyver to them, all which doe thus begin, <hi>Simile est regnum coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum:</hi>

         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>lato,</hi> but with <hi>Hosea</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Non est veritas
in terra:</hi> the pure Veritie hath left the Earth. So that I say to you, Yee must not
be disgusted if vpon the sudden ye cannot comprehende everie symbolicall Veritie
that is propounded vnto you: which, if it could bee, then wee should vilipende the
Mysteries of GOD, as things triviall and vulgar. It is sayd in <hi>Eccles</hi> that <hi>God
hath made the world beautifull, &amp; did set it in the heart of man,</hi> even
that he may admire it, and vexe him-selfe to explore the nature there-of: <hi>Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
dat intellectum,</hi> sayeth the same <hi>Salomon.</hi> And I say, that as the intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
spirits of our Brayne, which are the Scarchers of the Veritie, are most subtile
in them-selues, and closed vp from our Eyes, within diverse Cabinets of our Head:
Even so the Veritie it selfe, which is the thing searched by them, is much more
subtile, and involved from our sight. The first Ages of the <hi>World</hi> did embleme
the <hi>Veritie,</hi> by a <hi>Triton,</hi> standing aboue the Temple of <hi>Saturne,</hi> with a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
in his mouth: signifying, that her habitation was most high, &amp; with the most
ancient Gods, and that therefore she must be sought laboriouslie, and from afarre.
GOD Him-selfe, who is onlie <hi>Veritie,</hi> hath made His Mysteries to bee vmbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
and as at wee-light before vs, (<hi>whiles He Him-selfe doeth inhabite
the inaccessible light,</hi> as is sayd, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6,) represented to vs by the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims,
<hi>Esa.</hi> 6. beholding Him through two wings; and by the darknesse of the
Clowde, where-through <hi>Moses</hi> did enter into the light of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb facs="8"/>
the Law; and by that Pillar of Fyre, that conducted <hi>Israel,</hi> which was in
lyke manner locked vp in a Clowde. All these doe figure vnto vs, that al-be-it the
<hi>Veritie</hi> (lyke to the Branch of Golde, that did secure the Voyage of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Elisean</hi> Fields) shall at length open a Passage for vs, to the inaccessible
Light. Yet for the present of our mortall lyfe, there be infinite Mysteries of the
<hi>Veritie,</hi> which wee cannot see other-wayes, than through darke and doubtfull
Clowds: amongst the which, this of the number 10, hath fallen in myne hands;
it may be, as a precious Iewell commeth to an vnskilful Gold-smith; who, although
he cannot mount it curiouslie, yet he setteth it so, as it may be carried, viewed, and
valued, of all men. The ancient <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Theologues, did call
the Bodie of GOD, <hi>Light;</hi> and His Soule, <hi>Veritie:</hi> to declare vnto vs, that the
<hi>Veritie,</hi> when it is found by vs, it should by our means shyne to others. And, as
a Lanterne carried by a Man in the night tyme, is better seene of those who bee
about him, than by him-selfe; Even so, perhaps, this Noble Mysterie, once poynted
at by me, shall bee now vnderstood better by manie of you, than it is by mee, who
did marke it vnto you: and I pray GOD it may be so.</p>
