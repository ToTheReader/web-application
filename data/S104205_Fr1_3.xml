<pb facs="5"/>As for the <hi>Concordancy of Yeares,</hi> I know certainly, that when you vnderstand the true vse thereof you will confesse, that it is far more easie, more true, and more profitable, then any booke yet extant of like purpose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

The wants of the old <hi>Computation</hi> be a little remembred in my <hi>Concordancy,</hi> not as if the Author thereof wanted vnderstanding in that point, for I suppose him right sufficient; but in that <hi>facilius est addere, quàm nouum compone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re:</hi> Yet I haue borrowed nothing, but what is common to all: If any thing be wanting, I wish you my further paines to supply it, and would haue wrote more, had I not feared to tire you with an ouer-great volume: But as it is, I hope it will be offensiue to none, since it is made for the good of all.
