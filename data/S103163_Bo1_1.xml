to how great a security men of our age were growne, as if there rested no cause at all of feare. Wherefore considering with some, whatsoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction of heart, full often in my amazed minde these things, and very many other, which because of briefenesse I have determined to omit. If (quoth I) our Lord hath not spared his people so peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chosen out of all Nations, his royall race, and his solely Country, (to whom hee said, <note n="*" place="margin">

and in supportable to foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Apostataes; of whom the first, (unlesse I am deceived) will with teares perchance that flow from the charity of God, receive the same, and the last with sorrow, but such as is outwrested from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and pusillanimity of an attainted conscience.
