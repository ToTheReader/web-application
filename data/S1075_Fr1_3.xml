   <head>The Preface.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may iustly be spoken of
many in this age, which
the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
spake of the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. 12.</note>
      <hi>When, as concerning the time,
yee ought to be teachers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
yee haue neede againe that
wee teach you the first principles
of the word of God, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
such, as haue neede of
Milke, and not of strong meate:</hi>
they professe faith in Christ, but in
truth doe not beleeue in him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yet can they, because they know
him not: they are baptised in his
name, but are not bureid with him
<pb facs="9"/>
through Baptisme, neither raised
vp together, through the faith of
the operation of God, that raised
him from the dead: they carrie his
cognisance and badge, but are not
militant vnder him in his warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
   <p>As the Athenians sacrificed, <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noto
Deo,</hi> to a strange God, and the
Samaritans worshipped that, which
they knew not; so our Atheists,
<hi>profitentur ignotum Christum,</hi>
professe a strange Christ: they know
not what he is in himselfe, nor how
hee is become ours, nor what hee
hath done for vs: and therefore
neither in life, nor death, doe they
expresse his vertue. They liue licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously,
<hi>reprobate vnto euery
good worke,</hi> dishonouring Christ,
as if hee were a Sauiour who
had no power to sanctifie those
which are in him; and they dye
<pb facs="9"/>
without comfort, as if Christ by
death had not obtained life, and by
death did not transport to life, all
that are in him; thus while they
professe fellowship with him, they
declare themselues to be strangers
from him.</p>
   <p>It is witnessed by the Lord, in
<hi>Ezechiel,<note place="margin">Ezech. 18. 20.</note> the same soule that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
shall die: the sonne shall not
beare the inquitie of the father,
neither shall the father beare the
iniquitie of the sonne, but the
righteousnesse of the righteous
shalbe vpon him, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
of the wicked shalbe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himselfe.</hi>
      <note place="margin">A question good to waken drousie Christians out of their dead security.</note> If according to this
testimonie of the word, it be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of them, seeing Christ is holy,
and righteous, and wee are the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
how is it that hee is punished
and wee are spared? This is but one
of the least of Sathans assaults, by
<pb facs="10"/>
which he impugnes the faith of men,
and yet if they be required to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
it, they shall soone bewray
themselues to be voide of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and solide faith, confident one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a naked profession, which will
not faile in the end to beguile them.
For as an house faultie in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
cannot abide the stormy
windes,<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> and raine, no more can a
Christian not informed with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
not rooted, grounded, and
builded in Christ Iesus, by faith,
endure in the houre of tentation.</p>
   <p>That therefore the doctrine of
Christianitie may be learned by such
as knowes it not,<note place="margin">The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised in three arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie, Baptisme, and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> from the very
foundation, we haue here proposed
three most necessary points to be
entreated: The first, is Christs Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie:
the second, his Baptisme:
the third, his Tentation. In the
first, wee are taught what manner
<pb facs="10"/>
of man our Lord is in himselfe. In
the second, what manner of way he
is become ours. In the third, what
manner of way he did begin to worke
the worke of our Redemption: all
most necessary to be knowne, for the
right grounding of our Faith on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
him.<note place="margin">The first is to know that Iesus the sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</hi>
      </note> In his Genealogie wee see how
Iesus, the sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> is that
same blessed seede of the woman,
whom the Lord promised in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
to whom the Prophets, of all
times, pointed, and for whom the
godly fathers of all ages waited, and
expected, lineally desended from
<hi>Adam,</hi> by seauentie and foure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
In his Baptisme wee see how
he was consecrated,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ours.</note> and ordained, in
most solemne manner, to doe the
office of the <hi>Mesias,</hi> that is, of an
anointed King, Preist, and Prophet,
for our Saluation, so that he is now
no more a priuate man but a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
<pb facs="11"/>
by most sure authoritie, and
in most solemne manner, become our
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> head and redeemer.<note place="margin">The third, how hee hath done the worke of a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> And in his
temtation we see how immediately
after his ordination, he encounters
with Sathan in a singular combat,
ouercomming him in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
who before had ouercome our
parents in paradise: and so by his
first deed after his consecration,
makes it manifest that he was come
to destroy the workes of the Diuell.<note place="margin">These three ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make vp a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie.</note>
   </p>
   <p>If these three be ioyned together
in one, wee shall finde them making
vp vnto vs a compleat doctrine of
Christian consolation. The Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
in regard of his diuine nature,
is called by the Prophet <hi>Zachary,
Gnamith,<note place="margin">Zach. 13. 7.</note> Iehoua,</hi> that is, the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and companion of <hi>Iehoua,</hi>
      <note place="margin">☞</note> or
as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it,<note place="margin">Iohn 2. 6.</note>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>,
equall with God. In regard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
of his humaine nature,<note place="margin">Iob 19. 25.</note>
      <hi>Iob</hi>
      <pb facs="11"/>
calleth him <hi>Goel,</hi> my kinsman. In
regard of his vnited natures, he is
called by <hi>Esay,<note place="margin">Esa. 8. 8.</note> Emanuel,</hi> God with
vs.<note place="margin">Nomb. 3 5.</note> Now we know that by the law he
who was neerest kinsman,<note place="margin">How Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers equal and our kinsman is properly the true auenger and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of his brethren.</note> had power
to reuenge the blood of his brother
vpon the Murtherer, if hee had
found him without a Citie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge;
and therefore was he stiled by
the name of an auenger, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
hee had power to redeeme the
inheritance which his brother,
through pouertie, had lost: for the
word <hi>Gaal,</hi> from which <hi>Goel</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
hath in it these two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
significations, to <hi>redeeme,</hi> and
to <hi>reuenge;</hi> So that heere wee see
how the Lord Iesus, being neerest
of kinne vnto vs, as wee may see out
of his Genealogie, being likewise
clad with the power of a redeemer
and reuenger, as wee shall learne
out of his Baptisme, commeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb facs="12"/>
after his entrie to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
Office of the Messias, vpon
Sathan that murtherer, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him out of a Citie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
enters into combat with him,
to reuenge the blood of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and to redeeme the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
which they had foolishly sould
for nothing: yea moreouer he doth
that which no tipicall <hi>Goel</hi> vnder
the <hi>Law,</hi> was able to doe; for not
onely doth hee ouerthrow the
murtherer, but restoreth
life againe to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
that were
slaine and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred
by
him.</p>
