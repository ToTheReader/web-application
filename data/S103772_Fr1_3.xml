      <l>None haue behynd theim, left so greate treasure</l>
      <l>Ne to their posteritee, haue dooen suche delite</l>
      <l>As thei whiche haue taken peines to write</l>
      <l>Chronycles and actes, of eche nacion</l>
      <l>And haue of thesame, made true relacion.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ By Chronycles we knowe, thynges auncient</l>
      <l>The succession of tymes, and menne</l>
      <l>The state of policies, with their regiment</l>
      <l>Howe long eche partie hath ruled, and when</l>
      <l>And what were all their procedynges then.</l>
      <l>Chronicles make reporte of matiers dooen</l>
      <l>And passed many thousand yeres gooen</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ By Chronycles we knowe, in eche countree</l>
      <l>What men haue been, of prowesse marciall</l>
      <l>What persones chiefly in actiuitee</l>
      <l>When and betwene whom, warres haue befall</l>
      <l>Either ciuile or els externall</l>
      <l>Howe thesame haue been, conueighed &amp; wrought</l>
      <l>Or els appeaced, and to quiete brought</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Chronicles dooe recorde and testifye.</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="6"/>
Euen from the worldes first beginninges</l>
      <l>And dooe kepe in continuall memorie</l>
      <l>The course and processe, of all maner thinges</l>
      <l>The liues and maners, of princes and kynges</l>
      <l>Aswell Gentiles as Iudaicall</l>
      <l>Aswell Iuste and godly, as tyrannicall</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ What persones to their prince and countree</l>
      <l>Haue been louing true and obedient</l>
      <l>And at all times of necessitee</l>
      <l>Haue serued thesame, with good entent</l>
      <l>And constauntly therin, haue their liues spent</l>
      <l>In Chronicles are regestred feithfully</l>
      <l>To their immortall honoure and glorye</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Contrarye wise, who to their souerains</l>
      <l>Or to their countrees, haue been wicked traitours</l>
      <l>Or by collusion and crafty traines</l>
      <l>Haue rebelled against their gouernours</l>
      <l>Or the same to helpe, haue been slacke proctours</l>
      <l>Are sembleably sette out by name</l>
      <l>To their endelesse infamy, reproche, and shame.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ These thinges, and others a thousande mo</l>
      <l>Wherby realmes, haue decaied or growen</l>
      <l>Chaunged in processe, and altered to and fro</l>
      <l>Fruitefull and expedient to bee knowen</l>
      <l>Are in Chronicles, so plainly shewen</l>
      <l>That thinges antique, to vs bee as apparent</l>
      <l>As yf at their doinges, we had been present.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Wherfore Goddes worde and holy scripture</l>
      <l>Whiche abandoneth all maner vanitee</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="6"/>
Yet of Chronicles admitteth the lecture</l>
      <l>As a thing of greate fruite and vtilitee</l>
      <l>And as a lanterne, to the posteritee</l>
      <l>For example, what they ought to knowe</l>
      <l>What waies to refuse, and what to folowe.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ The bible bookes, of Iudges and kynges</l>
      <l>Althoughe moste full, of high diuine misterie</l>
      <l>And farre surmounting all Ethnike dooynges</l>
      <l>Yet yf they bee read, and take literally</l>
      <l>Hath the fourme and course of a plain historie</l>
      <l>What kynges serued God, and who trangressed</l>
      <l>Whiche thereby prospered, or wer oppressed</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ The bookes of the kynges euery where</l>
      <l>Yf thinges seme touched ouer briefly</l>
      <l>To a larger storye, dooeth vs referre</l>
      <l>Whiche were Chronicles of eche manne truely</l>
      <l>Sette out at length, to our memorie</l>
      <l>Albeit those Chronicles (as it is euident)</l>
      <l>Are loste, and dooe not remain at this present</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ The bookes inscribed, Paralipomena</l>
      <l>A perfecte membre, and piece of the bible</l>
      <l>Is a summarye, of the kynges of Iuda</l>
      <l>And therfore in Hebrue, it hath the title</l>
      <l>And appellacion, of a Chronicle</l>
      <l>The Machabees also, by my deming</l>
      <l>Is a plaine historye, of holy writing</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Whiche bookes, if they had neuer been set out</l>
      <l>It had been a greate maime to our knowlage</l>
      <l>A lamentable lacke, with outen doubte</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="7"/>
A greate cause of blindnesse to our age</l>
      <l>And to our faith, inestimable damage.</l>
      <l>But the spirite of God, the authour was</l>
      <l>That those examples, might bee our glasse.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Chronicles therfore, of true reporte</l>
      <l>Whether of Christian realmes or no</l>
      <l>Are matier of pleasaunce, fruite, and comforte</l>
      <l>And for a thousande causes and mo</l>
      <l>Diligently to bee attended vnto</l>
      <l>Yea, and all maner writers of the same</l>
      <l>Worthie laude, thanke, honoure &amp; immortal fame</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Neither is any one to bee reiected</l>
      <l>That in this behalfe, hath dooen his endeuoure</l>
      <l>For though some bee, such as might bee corrected</l>
      <l>Yet those that haue, therein bestowed laboure</l>
      <l>Haue minded to profyte vs to their power</l>
      <l>Neither any is so full, but somwhere dooeth faile</l>
      <l>Nor any so bare, but dooeth somthing auaile.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ And what an exceding benefite trowe ye</l>
      <l>Is it for eche manne, to haue cognicion</l>
      <l>Of all actes, bothe of his owne countree</l>
      <l>And also of euery forein nacion</l>
      <l>As yf he had liued, when eche thing was dooen</l>
      <l>And to view the actes of antiquitee</l>
      <l>As though he did nowe, presentlye theim see</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Chroniclers therfore, I can highly cōmende</l>
      <l>And emonge others, this authour Ihon Harding</l>
      <l>Who with all his power, to this point did contēd</l>
      <l>To the vttermost extent of his learning</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="7"/>
That Englishe men might haue vnderstanding</l>
      <l>Of all affaires, touching theirowne countree</l>
      <l>Euen to his dayes, from olde antiquites</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ And though his cōning, were not so muche</l>
      <l>As some others, nor his intelligence</l>
      <l>Yet his good minde, entent, and zele was suche</l>
      <l>That in hym lacked, no pointe of diligence</l>
      <l>After suche bookes, as he thought of credence</l>
      <l>Feithfully to describe, suche thinges in rime</l>
      <l>As happened to Englande, from tyme to tyme</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ But in thinges dooen, before his owne dayes</l>
      <l>He foloweth his authours, at auenture</l>
      <l>Without choice or difference of the true wayes</l>
      <l>Nor well assured, who were corrupte or pure</l>
      <l>Nor whether they were certaine orelles vnsure</l>
      <l>Whether fabulous, or menne of veritee</l>
      <l>Whether vaine, or of good authoritee.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ But what soeuer, in his owne time was dooen</l>
      <l>That he reporteth with all fidelitee</l>
      <l>Right so as eche thing, ended or begonne</l>
      <l>Withoute any spotte of insynceritee</l>
      <l>Or dissimulation of the veritee</l>
      <l>He founde all meanes, the veray trueth to know</l>
      <l>And what he knewe certainly, that did he shewe.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ From the beginning of Henry y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fourth kyng</l>
      <l>Of this realme of Englande, after the conquest</l>
      <l>Euen to Edwarde the fourthes reigning</l>
      <l>Whiche was thre score yeres and one at the leste</l>
      <l>He leaueth nothing vnwriten at the largest</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="8"/>
That was or semed to bee of importaunce</l>
      <l>Touchyng peace and warre, wyth Scotlande or Fraunce</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Vnto the Scottes, he coulde neuer bee frende</l>
      <l>Because he sawe theim towardes England</l>
      <l>False from the begynnyng, to the last ende</l>
      <l>Neuer standyng to anye league ne bande</l>
      <l>Homage, fealtee, ne wryting of theyr hande</l>
      <l>Neuer so readie to make rebellyon</l>
      <l>As when thei promised moost subiection</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ That if Ihon Hardyng, bee a trew man</l>
      <l>And in this behalfe inspyred with prophecie</l>
      <l>Thei wyll neuer bee, but as thei were than</l>
      <l>Falle to England, suttle, and craftie</l>
      <l>Entendyng myschiefe, when thei shewe contrary</l>
      <l>Spoylers and robbers, that amende wyll neuer</l>
      <l>Tyll our kyng shall haue made theim Englyshe for euer</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Neither is there anye, that euer wrote</l>
      <l>Which in mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ers of Scotland could better skill</l>
      <l>Nor which their falshoode and vntrueth to note</l>
      <l>Had more affection or better wyll</l>
      <l>Or better knew water, woodde, toune, vale &amp; hyll</l>
      <l>Or was more feruente the Scottes to persue</l>
      <l>Who to England he knew, woulde neuer be true</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Neyther anye Chronicler that euer was</l>
      <l>Eyther dooth or can, more largly declare</l>
      <l>Euen from Brutus, howe it came to passe</l>
      <l>That kynges of Englande the soueraines are</l>
      <l>And ouer Scotlande oughte rule to beare</l>
      <l>Hymselfe is wytnes, of their subiection</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="8"/>
And homage, vnder Englandes protection</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ In other thinges, the tymes were suche</l>
      <l>That though this werke haue some spice of blind<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse</l>
      <l>Yet is the authour, not to be blamed much</l>
      <l>For Popyshe errour, that season doubtlesse</l>
      <l>Did all the worlde ouer go and oppresse</l>
      <l>Therfore such thinges, we must in good part take</l>
      <l>And pardon that faulte, for the tymes sake</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Yet haue we thought best, the autour to set out</l>
      <l>Euen in suche fourme, as hymselfe dyd endite</l>
      <l>It wer an vnquod thyng, yf we should go about</l>
      <l>To alter and chaunge, that olde men haue wryte</l>
      <l>Secondly to vs, it maye bee greate delyte</l>
      <l>The blindnesse of those tymes to consider</l>
      <l>From whiche hathe pleased God vs to delyuer</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>¶ Fynally the darkenesse of those dayes to see</l>
      <l>To the honoure of our kyng dooeth redound</l>
      <l>To whom by goddes helpe geuen it hath bee</l>
      <l>All Popyshe trumperye for to confounde</l>
      <l>Which thyng, al trew English hertes hath boūd</l>
      <l>Incessauntly to praye, for kyng Henrye y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> eyghte</l>
      <l>Whose godly wisedome, hath made all streyghte</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>And for asmuch as Hardyng, his boke doth ende</l>
      <l>With Edward the fourth, whose seruaūt he was</l>
      <l>And to whome also, this booke he dyd commende</l>
      <l>Consideryng also, the tyme and space</l>
      <l>Beyng .lx. yeres and more, I coulde not let passe</l>
      <l>So many goodly statutes and decrees</l>
      <l>Battayles, and stories, not good to lese.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="9"/>
      <l>Wherfore I annexed theim by continuacion</l>
      <l>Begynning wyth Edwarde the fourth of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> name</l>
      <l>Then Edward the fyfth, kyng by generation</l>
      <l>Whom Richard the third, to his immortal shame</l>
      <l>Cruelly murdered, the story sayeth the same</l>
      <l>But plaged he was, to hys greate greuaunce</l>
      <l>With a shamefull death, as Goddes vengeaunce</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Then Henry the .vii. nexte doothe ensue</l>
      <l>Father vnto our moost dred soueraigne lorde</l>
      <l>And of Henry the. viii, some thyng that is true</l>
      <l>I haue here set forth, as wryters dooe accorde</l>
      <l>Not in metre, but obseruyng worde, for worde</l>
