      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian REA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER, though mine owne Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations haue hither-to euer shunned the common view of the World, contenting my selfe with the priuate Approbation of mine owne Charge: yet considering the generall good that may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue vnto the whole Church of Christ, by these labours of my Reuerend Kinsman, Master <hi>Stephen Egerton,</hi> I haue ventured to commend them vnto Gods Church,
<pb facs="3"/>
being thereunto also intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I know, without my commendation, they will be worth your small cost in procuring, your little labour in perusing. For it is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to consider, that in these preaching and hearing <note place="margin">
         <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 32.</note>dayes, such faithfull prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, such frequent hearing, so many should yet bee pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest as it were with a dumb <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1.</note>Deuill, and all our Sermons to the most of men but as sounding Brasse or a tinkling <note place="margin">
         <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 17</note>Cimball. So wee pipe, and no man danceth, we mourne and no man weepeth, wee preach peace, but no man sorroweth for his sinne. May <note place="margin">
         <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 6, 7.</note>we not say of these, as <hi>Dauid</hi> of the Idolls, <hi>They haue eares and heare not?</hi> or as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our translateth that fearefull
<pb facs="3"/>
commination against the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisers of his Word; <hi>Hearing they shall heare, and shall not vnderstand, least they heare</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Esa.</hi> 6. 9, 10 <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 14</note>
      <hi>with their eares, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand with their hearts, and bee conuerted and healed.</hi> So to heare then, is to attend with the eare, to receiue with the heart, to conuert in the life and conuersation, else our sinfull soules can neuer bee healed.</p>
   <p>And therefore this is the voyce of the Spirit vnto the seuen Churches of <hi>Asia, Hee</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Reue.</hi> 2. 17.</note>
      <hi>that hath eares to heare,</hi> let him heare <hi>what the Spirit saith vnto the Churches.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>There are fiue sorts of eares that are not hearing eares. The first, is a dull Eare, when a man is either
<pb facs="4"/>
drousie, or carelesse, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
   <p>The second, is a stopped Eare, as <hi>the Serpent stoppeth his eare against the voyce of the Charmer.</hi> Such are our Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, and secure Persons, that will not heare, lest they should bee thawed from their dregs, and so conuerted and saued.</p>
   <p>The third, is a preiudiciall or sinister Eare: this man like <note place="margin">
         <hi>Luke</hi> 10.</note>
      <hi>Malchus</hi> hath lost his right Eare, and hee comes as the Pharisee to Christ, to tempt the Minister, to catch him in his talke, turning all his speech to the worst, because hee hates or despiseth the person of the Preacher. This man is like the Spider that sucketh poyson out of the sweetest flowers.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 10 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3.</note> The fourth, is the nice or itching Eare that must bee clawed, that will heare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but nouelties, and dainties, that lookes not so much to the goodnesse of the meat, as to the sweetnesse of the sawce. Surely this man must needes haue a thinne and pined soule, and he often meets with that hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth not, meate that hee cannot digest, and so seldom or neuer profiteth by the Word of God.</p>
   <p>The fift, is an adulterous Eare, that will heare any but the voice of their owne Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds. You shall know them as the Harlot is knowne, they are euer gadding to seeke their new Louers: but God shall one day discouer their adultery to the shame of their
<pb facs="5"/>
Persons, to the disgrace of their Profession, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of their faces. To such let mee say, as Christ to the woman taken in adulterie, <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 10.</note>
      <hi>Goe and sinne no more.</hi> Now all these haue Eares and heare not, and therefore haue <note place="margin">
         <hi>Mark.</hi> 7. 34.</note>neede to haue the word <hi>Eph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phata</hi> pronounced vnto them as vnto the deafe man. And for their better direction in this dutie, this present Tract is of excellent vse, being plain and familiar for the manner, and sound for the matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded vpon many excellent exhortations, and rules in the Holy Scripture: whereby men may know how to heare with glorie vnto God, honour vnto his Ordinance, and profit vnto their owne soules.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="5"/>
The necessitie of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the Apostle proues where hee thus argueth, <hi>Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17</note>
      <hi>by hearing,</hi> &amp;c. Now without faith it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to please God.</p>
   <p>The neglect or contempt, or ignorance of this dutie, is the cause of all prophanesse▪ whereas if men would heare as they ought, this hearing would beget faith, and faith would bring forth all excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent graces, accompanying saluation. The seruant which bound himselfe to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall seruice of his master be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he loued him was to be broght vnto the doore of his <note place="margin">
         <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 6.</note>house, and his Master, was to boare his eare with an Awle. Whosoeuer he is that enters into Gods seruice, hee must haue this marke, euen an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb facs="6"/>
eare, and it must be boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the Doore of Gods <note place="margin">
         <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4. 17</note>house, that he may be readier to heare, then to offer the Sacrifice of fooles. The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> say, it is the right eare that must bee boared: and surely if men heare with a sinister eare, they doe not expresse themselues true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God. Whosoeuer therfore hath dedicated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the seruice of the Lord, let him expresse his Obligation or Indenture, by his open eare to the Word of God: for his sheepe heare his voyce, and his Familie doe his command. God giues vnto euery one that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth into his seruice, this Iewell to hang in his eare, namely, to heare with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reuerence.</p>
   <p n="1">
      <pb facs="6"/>
1. Whatsoeuer God spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
   <p n="2">2. When soeuer hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
   <p n="3">3. By whom soeuer hee speaketh.</p>
   <p>The next punishment vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death by our Nationall law, is losing the eares. And certainly whose eares or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God hath suffered to be taken away, they are in a dangerous or desperate case, because the Word is the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi>

         </gap>. 16.</note>of life vnto the right hearer, and the sauour of death vnto him that heareth not as hee ought. Now that you may heare with your eares, and vnderstand with your hearts, and be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from your euill wayes, and bee healed of all your sins; vse this short and easie
<pb facs="7"/>
receipt; and as you find the effect of it, returne the glory to God, esteeme of him who hath presented it to your view, and vse as one that hath good will vnto <hi>Sion,</hi> and moaneth for the deafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Daughter of his People, and shall euer pray <note place="margin">
         <hi>Ephphatha</hi> be open. <hi>Mark.</hi> 734.</note>that this word <hi>Ephphatha</hi> may bee by the Spirit of the Lord effectually pronounced vnto all those who desire to heare the glad tidings of the Gospell of Iesus Christ. To whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, bee all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and praise, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence yeelded, now and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</p>
