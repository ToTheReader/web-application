   <lg>
      <l>When hardned heartes, could not become so wise,</l>
      <l>By others harmes, to learne their owne beware:</l>
      <l>While fresh record presented to their eies,</l>
      <l>Ten brethren tribes, subdude to slavish care;</l>
      <l>Whom the <hi>Assirian</hi> monarch, did subdue;</l>
      <l>And made of freemen borne, a captiue crue.</l>

   <lg>
      <l>When eke they were vnmindefull how their king,</l>
      <l>Younge <hi>Ieconias,</hi> but nine yeares before;</l>
      <l>And thousandes moe: the sanctus blacke did sing.</l>
      <l>(What time they did their dismall day deplore)</l>
      <l>While captiues thence in bondage led to dwell,</l>
      <l>They crying, weeping schreeching, say farewell.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>When princes, rulers, priestes and people base,</l>
      <l>Exceeded farre, all heathen in their sin.</l>
      <l>When <hi>Sadom</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> might giue place,</l>
      <l>And not come neere, the waies they walked in.</l>
      <l>When harmelesse men, were held of none account,</l>

   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>When whistling for the Bees of <hi>Babel</hi>-land,</l>
      <l>Came <hi>Nabuchadnetzar</hi> (sirnamd the great)</l>
      <l>And brought with him a most puissant band,</l>
      <l>Of souldiers; skild in every war-like feate.</l>
      <l>For as the clustring bees, in swarmes doe clinge;</l>
      <l>So flockt the <hi>Chaldeis,</hi> round about their kinge.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Then <hi>Salem</hi> saw, a sad heart-breaking sight;</l>
      <l>Resolved foes entrench'd about her walles,</l>
      <l>In glittring armou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>, many a warlike wight,</l>
      <l>Most fully bent (what ever hap befalles)</l>
      <l>By dint of sword, to winne eternall fame;</l>
      <l>Or pawne their liues, in purchase of the same.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>But most of all this griefe the conscience gaules;</l>
      <l>And ever mates their mindes (so overtaken,</l>
      <l>By deepe despaire) to thinke amidst these brawles,</l>
      <l>That God for sin, their citie had forsaken.</l>
      <l>A matchlesse woe; if God the cause withstand,</l>
      <l>A fearefull conscience makes a seeble hand.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Adde more to this; the seige so long doth lie,</l>
      <l>That famine in the citie is so soare,</l>
      <l>The people pine, consume, doe droope and die;</l>
      <l>While horses in the field; haue forrage store.</l>
      <l>Death in the house, destruction in the streete:</l>
      <l>Sword in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

      <l>Amidst these woes, the rumbling <hi>Ecchoes</hi> sound;</l>
      <l>How dreadfull drums, strike vp the fierce allarme,</l>
      <l>And ratling trumpe, (with bloudy noates rebound)</l>
      <l>The valiant heartes, to fell assault doth charme.</l>
      <l>When herauld first, had summond them to yeeld,</l>
      <l>Or to expect, a mercy-wanting field.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Then for supplie, of thundring cannon shot,</l>

         </gap>am and engine, to the walles (a pace.)</l>
      <l>The Pioner he, bestirres him in his plot,</l>
      <l>To make huge towers, to giue the souldier place.</l>
      <l>On either part, their powers they fully bend,</l>
      <l>To giue assault, and from the walles defend.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Ensignes advaunce, and glory scales the fort,</l>
      <l>The ladders then are hoysed to the walles,</l>
      <l>And honors hope, th'assaylantes doth exhort,</l>
      <l>To climb from whence, an other headlong falles.</l>
      <l>While Archers shoote, from tough wel-timbred bow,</l>
      <l>Their thirled singing shaftes, as thicke as snow.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>When once the eager souldier, hath made way,</l>
      <l>Within the walles; and might commaund the towne;</l>
      <l>Then as a hungry Lyon for his pray;</l>
      <l>He rangeth, rageth, killeth, knocketh downe.</l>
      <l>Then might be seene, (like streames to make a flood)</l>
      <l>The streetes and channels, flow with crimson blood.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The bedlem handes, do deale foorth murthring blowes,</l>
      <l>The victor rageth restlesse, (Lyon-like)</l>
      <l>While mercie craving vanquish'd, pleades his woes,</l>
      <l>To him that hath no eares, but handes to strike.</l>
      <l>The maid, the wife, is subiect to this rage;</l>
      <l>The suckling, babe and he that stoopes for age.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="8"/>
      <l>For as the mower, with his keene edg'd sickle,</l>
      <l>Cuts downe aswell the greene, as seeded grasse;</l>
      <l>Evē so the souldiers sword, (though teares downe trickle)</l>
      <l>Permitteth not a breathing soule to passe.</l>
      <l>He spareth none that happen in his way;</l>
      <l>Faire wordes, chast lookes, entreaties, beare no sway.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Then sounded foorth, the screitching griesly crie,</l>
      <l>Of slaughtered soules; and many a deepe fet groane,</l>
      <l>Of such as murthred, yeelde the ghost and die,</l>
      <l>From wounded lungs, yeelding a hollow moane.</l>
      <l>While manly men, that whilome stoutly stoode,</l>
      <l>Dismembred now, lie weltring in their blood.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Then might be heard, and seene with wofull eies</l>
      <l>The living soules, lamenting for the dead;</l>
      <l>Powring out plaintes, with sobbes with sighes and cries.</l>
      <l>And bitter teares, as bleeding heartes might shed.</l>
      <l>The old lament, long life to be forlorne,</l>
      <l>The young repent, that ever they were borne.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The wife shee soundes (and yeeldes her vitall breath)</l>
      <l>To see her husband die (in wofull case)</l>
      <l>The husband feeles a fit, far worse then death,</l>
      <l>To see his wife defild, before his face.</l>
      <l>And seely babes, (poore heartes) to perish this,</l>
      <l>That never did offence, or thought amisse.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The mourning mothers, tugge, and hale their heares,</l>
      <l>To see their slaughtred seede, remedilesse.</l>
      <l>The children bath their cheekes, with bloudy teares,</l>
      <l>To see their wretched parentes, in distresse.</l>
      <l>While help-lesse handes, doe trust vnto their feete▪</l>
      <l>And leaue poore infantes, crawling in the streete.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <pb facs="9"/>
      <l>For now the men of armes, were fled by stealth;</l>
      <l>And every soule was left, to shift for one.</l>
      <l>Counsaile did want; regard was none of wealth,</l>
      <l>Of kin, or friend, or who were left alone.</l>
      <l>Who makes not hast, death and destruction feeles,</l>
      <l>The happrest wight, doth shew the swiftest heeles.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>When souldiers slaughtring sword, embrewd with blood,</l>
      <l>Found not a man, that durst resistance make:</l>
      <l>Then bedlem minde, gan grow to milder moode,</l>
      <l>(If mildnesse be as bad a course to take)</l>
      <l>For now vnbridled lust, at large doth stray;</l>
      <l>And prowles about, for pillage, and for pray.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Had chast <hi>Lucrecia,</hi> dwelt amongst those dames,</l>
      <l>Full many a <hi>Tarquin,</hi> would haue wrought his will.</l>
      <l>Had good <hi>Susanna,</hi> wandred in those flames,</l>
      <l>Her spot-lesse corpes, had bin constrain'd to ill.</l>
      <l>While seely lambes, the chastest, and most iust,</l>
      <l>Became a pray vnto a peysantes lust.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The matchlesse vessels, of magnificence,</l>
      <l>The temples treasure, (many a millions mate)</l>
      <l>The wealth, of <hi>Zedechias</hi> excellence,</l>
      <l>The riches of his Lordes, and men of state:</l>
      <l>These things were sent away to <hi>Babilon;</hi>
      </l>
      <l>As fit for <hi>Nabuchadnetzar</hi> alone.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>What else was left, of Iewels, gold, and plate,</l>
      <l>Amongst the meaner sort, (which might be much)</l>
      <l>Each souldier held, what so thereof he gate;</l>
      <l>While they with other spoiles themselues enrich.</l>
      <l>And when the pilfring hand, had his desire;</l>

      <l>The pioner spares, nortemple, house, nor bower,</l>
      <l>The time is spent, to spoile and to deface.</l>
      <l>There was not left one monument of fame,</l>
