   <head>This Dedication is directed, to his well-Affected and much Respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, his often Approved, and truly beloved, Mr. <hi>Thomas Godfrey,</hi> Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Game for Beares, Bulls, and Dogges.</head>
   <p>KInd friend, I am sure you can defend me from being bitten with your <hi>Beares,</hi> though not from being back-bitten by <hi>Envie;</hi> you can stave me, and save me, from the Goring of your <hi>Bulls,</hi> but there are too many heards of other Horned Beasts to But at my Inventions, and tosse my harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb facs="3"/>
meaning, as their empty Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Witlesse fancies are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd; howsoever I am resolv'd to love you, and not to Respect them I am glad that you can say that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive time of charge is past with you, and I hope for better dayes and times. I have touched here and there merrily upon the Game, but so farre from offence, that I doe expect that it will be pleasing both to the Wise, and to the Indifferent Readers. And mee thinkes very fools should not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with it, for I have thrust in a great many Bables to please them to If any thing doe seeme distastefull in it, my Comfort is, that a Wise man will not set his Wit to mine, and be offended but if a Foole be angry, then I will
<pb facs="3"/>
not set my Wit to his, and take excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And thus with my best wishes to you and yours, I remaine a poore friend to you and yours,</p>
