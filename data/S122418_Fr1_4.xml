                 <title>Mr Henry Barrowes platform : Which may serve, as a preparative to purge away prelatisme: with some other parts of poperie. Made ready to be sent from Miles Mickle-bound to much-beloved-England. Togither with some other memorable things. And, a familiar dialogue, in and with the which, all the severall matters conteyned in this booke, are set forth and interlaced. After the untimely death of the penman of the foresaid platforme. &amp; his fellow prisoner; who being constant witnesses in points apperteyning to the true worship of God, and right government of his Church, sealed up their testimony with their bloud: and paciently suffred the stopping of their breath, for their love to the Lord.

   <l>TAke wings o Booke and fly abroade with speed,</l>
   <l>The things in thee are good for men to reed;</l>
   <l>Which haue not seen what thou canst to them show,</l>
   <l>And what thou speakst is meete for all to know:</l>
   <l>Who would discern some things amiss that bee,</l>
   <l>Within the Land of our Nativitee:</l>
   <l>To such thou shalt be iudged wondrous kinde,</l>
   <l>Because thou canst right well informe their minde:</l>
   <l>In such a sort as they shall bettred bee,</l>
   <l>And well advantag'd by the things in thee.</l>
   <l>Yet foes enough thou shalt be sure to finde,</l>
   <l>'Mong Priests that have the soules of many pinde:</l>
   <l>And Prelates too, which very seldome preach,</l>
   <l>Or suffer those that carefully would teach</l>
   <l>Gods truth, and give Christs sheep their wholsome food,</l>
   <l>All such Restreyners make the sinfull brood.</l>
   <l>And of that Ranck not one of them is found,</l>
   <l>That feeds the flock in wholsome pasture ground.</l>
   <l>If such bring food, they poison give withall,</l>
   <l>Which proveth worse then wormwood mixt with gall.</l>
   <l>They suffer not the milk of Gods word pure,</l>
   <l>To work vpon the soules of men a cure:</l>
   <l>Though sincere milk therof, that some is it,</l>
   <l>Which makes for God the soule of each man fit.</l>
   <l>And thou directs them in no other wise,</l>
   <l>Nor wouldst haue any follow such mens guise;</l>
   <l>As will not to that wholsome Word bend care,</l>
   <l>And all his pathes unto Iehovahs seare.</l>
