   <head>TO THE CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIAN READER, Grace and Peace be multiplied.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Arch-enimie of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, <hi>Sathan,</hi> that olde Aduersarie, as he dared to giue the assault vpon the Author of Saluation himselfe; so hath he not rested from the beginning, to lay battrie to the fortresse of Fayth, seeking by all meanes to beat it downe, and vtterly to rase the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of it. And to this end, hath he not left vnshaken any one article of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian beliefe, both by old and new Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, the wicked instrumentes of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall warringes. So maliciously is he set against vs, that like a ramping and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lion, he goeth about seeking whom
<pb facs="3"/>be may deuower: And where GOD hath his Church, be euermore adioyneth his Chappell, with his counterfaite, false, and faigned Religion, odious to God, and wonderfull to the world. Amongest the rest, he hath not onely of old, but euen of late, battered the soule, yea euen the life of the soule of man: yea euen now doth he most stoutly batter it; by perswading some, that it is corruptible and mortall; and putting into their mouthes the most venomed swordes of poysoned sophisticall Argumentes to maintaine the same, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the most certaine and necessarie trueth of the Soules immortalitie. For not onely the <hi>Saduces</hi> did dispute against the immortalitie of the Soule; yea, and they in like manner, who sayd in Saint <hi>Paules</hi> time, that the Resurrection was past alreadie to him that beleeueth; and made no other resurrection, besides the resurrection of the regenerate. But also the <hi>Anabaptistes</hi> of later yeares, doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb facs="3"/>the Soule to be immortall. And <hi>Paul</hi> the third of that name, Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he was breathing out his Soule and readie to die, sayd; that now at length he should try and know three things: First, whether there were a GOD: second, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Soules were immortall: third, whether there were a Hell or no; whereof all his life time he was in much doubt. Yea verily euen at this very day, there are now wicked <hi>Epicures,</hi> and gracelesse <hi>Atheistes,</hi> whom the Diuell to lull them faster a sleepe in their sinnes, and enforce them to heape sinne vpon sinne, hath so suggested them, that they are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that there is no rewarde for the Good, nor punishment of the Wicked; but that Man perisheth as Beast, and the Soule to come to nothing: according to that wicked verse of <hi>Horace: Et re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in nihilum, quod fuit ante nihil.</hi> For they affirme, that the Soule of man, like as of brute Beastes, is nothing else, but
<pb facs="4"/>Life, or the vitall power, arising of the temperature and perfection of the Body; and therefore dyeth, and is extinguished togeather with the Body. And some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine say, that the Soule sleepeth, when the Body dyeth that is, is without motion or sense, vntill the raysing of the Body: which indeed is nothing else, but that the Soule is mortall; that is, a meere qualitie onely in the Body, which when the body is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, becommeth nothing; because if it were an incorporeall substaunce, it could not be without sense and motion.</p>
   <p>Wherefore hauing my selfe met with some of this badde sort, and hearing of moe, I thought good euery way to fight in the cause of Christ Iesus, with the weapon put in mine hand by my grand Captaine, and with might and maine, to heaw at these two Monsters, and vtter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Soule. Therefore seeing that the print of the Penne may come vnto the eyes of moe, than the sound of the voyce
<pb facs="4"/>into the cares, I (by Gods assistance) haue set my talent on worke, against them both, proouing the contrarie: First, that the Soule is not (as they say,) mortall, but immortall: Secondly, that the Soule is not a forme, perfection, temperament, force, power, or agitation arising out of the temperature of the Body; but a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce incorporeall, liuing, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, dwelling in the Body, and susteining and moouing it. And this latter, is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued true by these Scriptures, Psalm. 48. <hi>His Soule shalbe blessed in life.</hi> Heb 12. <hi>God is called the Father of Spirites.</hi> And it is sayd of the faythfull; <hi>Yee are come to the Celestiall Ierusalem, and to the companie of innumerable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and to the Spirites of iust and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect men.</hi> 1. Cor. 2.11. <hi>Noman know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the thinges of a man, saue the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of man, which is in man.</hi> In these, and like places of Scripture, both the Soule of man is called a Spirit, and the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="5"/>of a liuing and vnderstanding sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce are attributed vnto it; therefore it is a substaunce. And therefore to no purpose, doe the aduersaries of this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, oppose those places wherein the soule is taken for the life and will of man; as Mat. 6. <hi>The Soule is more worth then Meate.</hi> Iob. 13.14. <hi>I put my Soule in my hand.</hi> For by the fore alleadged pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it is manifest, that this is not generall, but is vsed by figure of speach; whereby we call the effect, by the name of his cause. Now for the former, that the Soule is not mortall, but immortall; and also for a further declaration of this latter, I haue translated foorth of latine (for their sakes that vnderstande not latine) a certaine Treatise of the Immortalitie of the Soule; and thereunto haue adioyned other mens iudgments and reasons, for the helpe of the matter, &amp; Scriptures confirming the same, and confuted the Aduersarie.</p>
