   <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER, THE PVB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISHER HEEREOF wisheth, Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from the Lord Iesus Christ our Saviour.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian Reader, Thou hast heere offered unto thee (a rare boxe of precious pearles) on most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, many sweete, grave, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, wholesome, fit, and choise passages. What the Author was, what his care for Gods glory, his delight in Gods worship, his desire of the good of others, his hatred of
<pb facs="8"/> sinne, his griefe for sinne, his zeale and fervencie in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, his knowledg of the word, his contempt of the world, his experience of Satans subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, his compassion towards the afflicted members of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, his skill in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting, dehorting, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, comforting; his joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse in the society and company of Gods children, his usuall endeavours and employments, his dayly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, his ordinary spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, his grouth in grace, and measure of sanctification, &amp;c. may be easily perceived, and plainely discerned by this his ensuing Treatise. Well knew he the worth of time, well knew he, in like manner, how to employ the same to his best advantage. Apparent it
<pb facs="8"/> is, that he thought that time to be ill spent, wherein he was not doing some good to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe or others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavoured alwayes to be thus employed. Was he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone? then was be either oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in prayer, reading, meditation, or such like Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian exercise. Was hee in company? then were not his words, idle, vaine, worldly, unprofitable, but gracious, poudered with salt, tending to edification. Was he at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or supper? then would he take occasion to speake of the use of Gods creatures, the thankefulnesse we owe unto God for the plenty wee enjoy, together with the usual abuse of Gods mercies by most men and women. Was there a question propounded unto
<pb facs="9"/> him? in the resolution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would he take occasion to dehort from some one or other vice, exhort to some one or other vertue. Did he observe in himselfe any thing defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive? how did he labour for humiliation; for a supply? Did he observe sinnes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which were not in himselfe? how did he pitty and pray for them, blesse God for himselfe, yea be hereby perswaded that the Lord lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, as through whose goodnesse he was made to see and hate such things as are so highly esteemed in the world, and pursued by men of this world, whence he became de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous<note place="margin">This Booke (being of M. <hi>Gulver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> owne hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) doe I finde to have beene begun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 40. yeeres agoe and to have beene writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times, and upon severall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, some passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges being night me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, some utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, some upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a question propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon occasion of some one or other trouble. &amp;c.</note> the more to love the Lord with all his heart, and to be so delighted in him, that hee might esteeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="9"/> without him, nor bee carryed away by any thing from him, in whose favour is all fulnesse of joy for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. A faithfull Steward hee was of the mysteries of God, and who well knew, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
