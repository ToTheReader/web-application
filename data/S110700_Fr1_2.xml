norant people like my selfe, I heare to say mutteringly, O Lorde, what doe these Gentiles meane so to roome from home that enioye such wealth as they doe, and maye staye at their owne pleasure, but the rein they shewe their basenesse, which is so vnanswerable to the mindes of the valiant, as the flint stone to the precious diamonde, but such are those base fellowes as for gaine at home will not sticke to doe any thing, when the noble minde abroade aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for fame, which when with great peril they haue most valiantly atchieued, the enuiousnesse of our countreymen is such as they disdaine to giue them the honour they haue gained for their right as it is well séene by that worthye Knight Sir Humphrey Gylbert whose valour deserued thankes of his countrey if they had bene gratefull, the which they be lothe to bestowe vpon him, but he is dead, and in countreyes cause shortened his life, leauing many sorowe for his death, yet I thinke it were great pity seeing his actions were such, as your worship I knowe can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be honourable that his valiant name should so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly die with his bodie, without some remēbrance wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his children hereafter might reape the rewarde of their fathers fame, and by his good actions be encouraged to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate his wayes. This renowmed Knight as your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse is more then any I knowe, and that you haue so well deserued, I trust some learned which can write, will of their good nature emploie their paines to your praise &amp; in learned stile register your noble fame, whereas I poore I can doe nothing yet haue this rudely aduentured, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to shewe what zeale I haue to such honourable mindes as your selfe, that in your absence by these fewe lines pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished you may be remembred when you shall be absent in this your honourable voyage, and the rather haue I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken this because I neuer sawe any to bid you farewell from Englande, and partly for countries cause being borne in Deuonshire where your worship was, these causes good Syr considered, first that by my simple writing it may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
