   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Hrine</hi> a Harlot, at a publique feast where many Ladies and Gentlemen were assembled, vncouering her painted face, tooke warm water and wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off her <hi>Fucus</hi> wishing all other Ladies there present to imitate her plainnesse. I sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose it was a griefe to the Ladies to haue that noted by publike taxation, which was as publikely noted &amp; obserued by al men. If al ladies &amp; gentlewomen shold be so serued at any publike meeting, many wold make (if it were possible) their natural red of blushing show through their painted red &amp; ouerlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mask of impudency &amp; boldnes. But wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, poore soules that haue nothing to bee proud of but their outward beautie, may be pardoned, if they seek to maintain their best hold, with anye deuise and addition of Arte, when as men who should glorie onelye
<pb facs="4"/>in their inward essence of worth and vertue, learning, prouidence, discretion, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, valoure, and magnanimitie, seeke to laye such painted faces vpon their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous desires they haue to be thoght worthy, in any to be admired or respected qualitie. Painting was in request in <hi>Iezebels</hi> time, and her example could not, nor euer wil scare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way either pride from the heart, or painting frō the face. If I were of the noble science of painters, I would put vp a bill against woe-men, for their intrusion into the profession of facemaking and coulouring: but if I were a states-man, I would publishe some seuere lawe, against such bolde intruding professors and shew-makers of such thinges, as many gaine by boldnes and impudency, among the world both respect and commoditie. Heereafter I may happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take occasion to speake and set out your women painters, at this time you shall finde some painted faces of policy, deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered.</p>
   <p>As in meates, that which commonly
<pb facs="4"/>liketh one doth distast another: so may this worke prooue like meats or banket-made-disshes, reiected of some, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like <hi>Homers</hi> Iliads be laid vnder other mēs pillowes. You rabble and ramping idle rout auaunt, the play-house-dores are now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for you, the Author dooth not inuite your company to his feast, for he knowes you are apter to fashion strange interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of what was neuer meant, then like ciuil guests cut fairely and respectiuely of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions. Howsoeuer he exposeth this his <hi>Philaitetes</hi> to his good fortune, &amp; if any of the iudicious rank taste of him with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, he is filled vp &amp; regorged with satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
