            </gap> our selues haue bin comforted of God. And bethinking wee of one vnder whose protection it might passe in publicke, I thought best to make bold with your Lordship. For though all sorts peraduenture may bee fitted with some thing or other in this pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="3 letters">

Now your good Lordship hauing bin deliuered more then once or twice from dangerous sickenesse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">

Besides, I haue bin so especially beholding to your honour, euen since you were first of S.
