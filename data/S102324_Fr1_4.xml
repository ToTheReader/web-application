      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIAN and Truth-louing Reader, I offer here to thy most retired and serious considerations the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> and <hi>Complaint</hi> of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> our Sauiour, with such vndeniable consequences as necessarily follow from the same; that so thou maiest obserue from his mouth, who is the best Pilote, what course to steere in this troublesom and tempestious age, to bringe that pretious Iewell &amp; Vessell of thine, thy yet floting Soule vnto the Hauen of true happines; that it may not be surprised by Seducers; suffer shipwrack against the Rocks or late sunke Vessels of errour, nor runne a ground in the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of ignorance;
<note place="margin">
         <hi>Ephes. 4.14.</hi>
      </note>
      <hi>That wee henceforth be noe more children tossed to and fro, and carried aboute with euery winde of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftinesse, whereby they lie in waite to deceiue: But following the Truth in loue, may grow vp into him in all things which is the head, euen Christ:</hi> A worke that might haue beene vndertaken by one more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in such sacred mysteries, and better qualified for them, then I am. Yet if a man that is but an ordinarie Passenger in a ship, shall espie it to be neere a Rocke, a Ship sunke, or some other Sea marke, set vp to discouer a danger; who will blame him, if, while others that should watch, are sleeping, or otherwise buisied, he giue notice thereof to them that are with him embarked in the same Ship, or in any other within hearing, that the dangers may be auoided?</p>
   <p>Such as beare good will to Sion, <hi>pray for,</hi> &amp; truly seeke <hi>the peace</hi> of our <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> will soone perceiue that my indeauours, herein, are only exercised in seeking the Kingdom of God, the honour and safety of our Soueraigne Lord the Kinge, the peace and happines of his <hi>Maiesties</hi> Kingdoms, and of Gods Church in them; together with the conuiction and amendment of such as haue donne euill offices to any of theese,

      <hi>If God peraduenture will giue them repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth: and that they may recouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues out of the snare of the Deuill, who are taken captiue by him at his will.</hi> But on the other side, if any that haue exchanged theire best iudgments for such honours, and other <hi>gifts</hi> of the World, as <hi>blinde the eyes of the wise,</hi> or for the hopes of them; If any who
<pb facs="8"/>are Iesuited, or poisened with Romish or Pelagian errours, finding themselues touched with theese lines, shall make a worse construction of them, to cleare themselues or theire adherents, then can with good Conscience be giuen, and framing a minde to me out of theire owne, shall therevpon begin to inueigh against this litle tratise, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser thereof; the Booke it selfe will I hope say enough to stop such mens mouthes; and if that doe not, I know a longe Epistle can not doe it: I will therefore leaue all further Apollogies, and appealing from them to <hi>God, to whome all hearts lie open,</hi> implore his almightie protection: In the meane time hopeing such things of thee as accompany saluation, and beseeching thee to excuse and correct with thy pen such faults, as (not without wronge donne to me) haue escaped the Printer in the printing; I rest</p>
