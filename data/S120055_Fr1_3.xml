      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot be so weake, as not to presuppose, that so great, and bold a worke must needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe variety of constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: There will not want some, I doubt not, who will be of opinion, that this labour might have beene better spared; as thinking the Scriptures to lie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too open to vulgar hands; with whom it is not now seasonable to argue that beaten questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning the expedience of the free allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Gods Booke to Laick readers; wherein the Church of England (our deare and blessed mother) hath sufficiently declared her judgement (besides words) by her ingenuous practice; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore taking this liberty for granted, I shall easily from hence evince the usefulnesse of some such plaine and orthodox explication; For, since the Scriptures are through the liberall bessing of God, promiscuously allowed to all hands, I aske whether it bee not much better they should bee put into the way of being rightly understood by the simplest, then to lie under the danger of an ignorant mis-construction; Neither doe I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by indevour to make them more common, but better conceived; that, where the letter is in use, the sense may not be mis-taken; The inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that are pretended to have followed upon the open, and free permission of Scriptures in
<pb facs="8"/> vulgar languages, have sensibly arisen from the mis-understanding of them; remove that perill, &amp; the frequence and universality of thē can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a blessing; This service I have here inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to perform; having cōmonly in the passages of this worke, trod in the steps (as I have judged) of the best interpretations: &amp; seldome when, gone alone: Neither doe I offer to obtrude these my explications upon any reader, as Magisteriall, and peremptory; Who am I that I should take upō me to governe, and command other mens thoughts? but modestly and humbly propound them to Gods Church, as probable helpes to weaker judgements: leaving my reader free, in the meane time, if my sense satisfie not, to his owne further disquisition: Onely, since all men have not choice of commenters, nor leasure to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them, nor skill to judge of the fairest sense, I have undertaken this paines for the ease and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of my plaine reader, to cull out, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto him, the most safe, and likely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations. In the historicall part, he shall need little help, in the Poeticall, or Sapientiall, more; in the propheticall most of all; in many passages whereof, every line is a riddle; I should bee vaine to brag of my fidelity herein; as who have not knowingly omitted any clause, wherein there seemed to be any shew of difficulty; nor clogged the volume with glosses that I conceived unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
   <p>Some perhaps will imagine it might have been much better, to have taken the whole text before me, then to have thus selected some noted periods of harder construction; Who may be pleased to consider how much vastnesse might so have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crewed to this labour, and how little use; To pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase easie texts, had beene to set up a candle
<pb facs="8"/> before the Sunne; and to publish the whole Text, with a partiall explication (if leave might possibly have beene obtained for so bold a project) had beene to raise the bulke, and to lose the vigour and benefit of the worke: Since there be some historicall bookes of Scripture, wherein there is very little use of any Paraphrase; and some (as those of the Chronicles) wherein there is none at all; Herein therefore I have done that, which I judged to availe most to the use and profit of my Christian Reader; whō I must suppose furnished with a Bible at home; and willing to helpe his understanding in places of more obscurity.</p>
   <p>To fore-mention the particularities of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which may arise to Gods Church in the use of so plaine an enarration of the meaning of his holy Spirit, were both too much to distrust the judgement of others; and to seeme to set forth the glory of my owne indevours; the infirmities whereof, if they may receive pardon from God, and my Superiours; and amendment from more able hands, to whose aide and correction I doe humbly submit my selfe, and them, it shall bee the utmost of my ayme, and ambition.</p>
   <p>That good God, who hath graciously inabled mee, notwithstanding the throng of other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, to goe through with this well-meant worke, blesse it to the behoofe of his Church, and the glory of his owne Name. <hi>Amen.</hi>
