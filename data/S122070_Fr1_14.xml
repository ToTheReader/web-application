   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncernyng two sundry sortes of people, it seemeth much necessarie that some thyng be sayde in the entrie of this booke by the way of a preface or prologue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hereafter it may be both the better accepted of them which hitherto coulde not well beare it, and also the better vsed of them which heretofore haue misused it. For truely some there are that be to slowe and neede the spurre, some other seme to quicke, and neede more of the brydle: some lose their game by short shotyng, some by ouer shotyng, some walke to much on the left hande, some to much on the ryght. In the former sort be all they that refuse to reade, or to heare redde the scripture in the vulgar tongue, much worse they that also let or discourage the other from the readyng or hearyng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In the latter sort be they which by their inordinate readyng, vndiscrete speakyng, contentious disputyng, or otherwise by their licentious lyuyng, slaunder and hynder the worde of God most of all other, wherof they woulde seeme to be greatest furtherers. These two sortes, albeit they be most farre vnlyke the one to the other, yet they both deserue in effect lyke reproche. Neither can I well tell whether of them I may iudge the more offendour, hym that doth obstinately refuse so godly and goodly knowledge: or hym that so vngodly and so vngoodly doth abuse the same. And as touchyng the former, I woulde maruayle much that any man shoulde be so mad, as to refuse in darknesse, lyght: in hunger, foode: in colde, fire: for the worde of God is lyght: <hi>Lucerna pedibus meis, verbum tuum.</hi> Thy worde is a lanterne vnto my feete.<note place="margin">Psal. cxix. a Math. iiii. a. Luk xii. g.</note> It is foode: <hi>Non in solo pane viuit homo, sed in omni verbo dei.</hi> Man shall not lyue by bread only, but by euery worde of God. It is fire: <hi>Ignem veni mittere in tertam, &amp; quid volo nisi vt ardeat?</hi> I am come to sende fire on the earth, and what is my desire but that it be kindled? I woulde maruayle (I say at this) saue that I consider how much custome &amp; vsage may do. So that if there were a people as some write, <hi>de Cymeriis,</hi> which neuer sawe the sunne, by reason that they be situated farre towarde the North pole, and be inclosed and ouershadowed with hye mountaynes: it is credible and lyke inough, that yf by the power and wyll of God, the mountaynes shoulde sinke downe and geue place, that the lyght of the sunne myght haue entraunce to them, at the first some of them woulde be offended therwith. And the olde prouerbe affirmeth, that after tillage of corne was first founde, many delited more to feede of mast and acornes wherwith they had ben accustomed, then to eate bread made of good corne. Such is the nature of custome, that it causeth vs to beare al thinges well and easyly wherwith we haue ben ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed, and to be offended with all thynges thervnto contrary. And therfore I can well thinke them worthy pardon, which at the commyng abrode of scripture doubted and drewe backe. But such as wyll persist styll in their wilfulnesse I must needes iudge not only foolishe, frowarde, and obstinate: but also peeuishe, peruerse, and indurate. And yet, if the matter shoulde be tryed by custome, we myght also to aleage custome for the readyng of the scripture in the vulgar tongue, and prescribe the more auncient custome. For it is not muche aboue one hundred yere ago, since scripture hath not ben accustomed to be read in the vulgare tongue within this realme, and many hundred yeres before that, it was transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and red in the Saxones tongue, which at that time was our mother tongue, wherof there remaine yet diuers coppies founde lately in olde abbaies, of suche antique maner of writing and speaking, that fewe men now ben able to reade and vnderstand them. And when this language waxed olde and out of common vsage, because folke should not lacke the fruite of reading, it was againe translated into the newer language, whereof yet also many copyes remayne and be dayly founde. But nowe to let passe custome, and to way as wise men euer shoulde, the thyng in his owne nature: let vs here discusse what it auayleth scripture to be had and redde of the lay and vulgar people. And to this question I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende here to say nothyng: but that was spoken and written by the noble doctour and most morall diuine, saint Iohn Chrisostome in his third sermon <hi>de Lazaro,</hi> albeit, I wyll be some thing shorter, and gather the matter into fewer wordes and lesse rome then he doth there,<note place="margin">S. Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.</note> because I woulde not be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. He exhorteth there his audience, that euery man shoulde reade by him selfe at home in the meane dayes and time, betweene sermon and sermon, to the intent they might both more profoundly fixe in their mindes and memories that he had saide before vpon such textes, whereupon he had alredie prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: and also that they might haue their mindes the more redie and better prepared to receaue and perceaue that which he should say from thencefoorth in his sermons, vpon such textes as he had not yet declared and preached vpon, therfore saith he there: My comon vsage is to geue you warning before what matter I entende after to entreate vpon, that you yourselues in the meane dayes may take the booke in hand, reade, waye, and perceaue the summe and effect of the matter, and marke what hath ben declared and what remaineth yet to be declared, so that thereby your minde may be the more furnished to heare the rest that shalbe saide.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="24"/>And that I exhort you (saith he) and euer haue &amp; wil exhort you, that you (not only here in the Churche) geue eare to that that is sayd by the preacher: but that also when ye be at home in your houses, ye apply your selues from tyme to tyme to the readyng of holy scriptures: which thyng also I neuer lin to beate into the eares of them that be my familiers, and with whom I haue priuate acquaintaunce and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation. Let no man make excuse and say (saith he) I am busied about matters of the common wealth, I beare this office, or that, I am a craftes man, I must applie mine occupation, I haue a wyfe, my children must be fed, my housholde must I prouide for: Briefly, I am a man of the worlde, it is not for me to reade the scriptures, that belongeth to them that haue bidden the worlde farwell, which lyue in solitarinesse and contemplation, and haue ben brought vp and continually nosilled in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and religion. To this aunsweryng: What sayest thou man (saith he) is it not for thee to study and to reade the scripture, because thou art encumbred and distract with cares and businesse? So much the more it is behouefull for thee to haue defence of scriptures, howe much thou art the more distressed in worldly daungers. They that be free and farre from trouble and entermedlyng of worldly thynges, lyue in safegarde and tranquilitie, and in the calme, or within a sure hauen. Thou art in the middest of the sea of worldly wickednesse, and therfore thou needest the more of ghostly succour and comfort: They sit farre from the strokes of battayle, and farre out of gunne shoote, and therfore they be but seldome wounded. Thou that standest in the forefront of the hoast, and nyest to thine enemies, must needes take nowe and then many strokes, and be greeuously wounded, and therfore thou hast most neede to haue thy remedies and medicines at hande. Thy wyfe prouoketh thee to anger, thy chylde geueth thee occasion to take sorowe and pensiuenesse, thine enemies lye in wayte for thee, thy friende (as thou takest hym) sometyme enuieth thee, thy neyghbour misreporteth thee or picketh quarels agaynst thee, thy mate or partener vndermineth thee, thy lorde, iudge, or iustice, threatneth thee, pouertie is paynefull vnto thee, the losse of thy deare and welbeloued causeth thee to mourne, prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie exalteth thee, aduersitie bringeth thee lowe: Briefly, so diuers and so manifolde occasions of cares, tribulations, and temptations, beset thee and besiege thee rounde about. Where canst thou haue armour or fortresse agaynst thine assaultes? Where canst thou haue salues for thy sores, but of holy scripture? Thy fleshe must needes be prone and subiect to fleshly lustes, which dayly walkest and art conuersaunt among women, seest their beauties set foorth to the eye, hearest their nice and wanton wordes, smellest their baulme, ciuet, and muske, with many other lyke prouocations and stirringes: except thou hast in a redinesse wherwith to suppresse and auoyde them, which can not elswhere be had, but only out of the holy scriptures. Let vs reade and seke all remedies that we can, and all shalbe litle inough. Howe shall we then do, yf we suffer and take dayly woundes, and when we haue done, wyll sit styll and searche for no medicines? Doest thou not marke and consider howe the smith, mason, or carpenter, or any other handy craftesman, what neede soeuer he be in, what other shift so euer he make, he wyll not sell nor lay to pledge the tooles of his occupation: for then howe shoulde he worke his feate, or get his lyuyng therby? Of lyke mynde and affection ought we to be towardes holy scripture. For as mallets, hammers, sawes, chesils, axes, and hatchets, be the tooles of their occupation: So be the bookes of the prophetes, and Apostles, and all holy writers inspired by the holy ghost, the instrumentes of our saluation. Wherfore let vs not sticke to bye and prouide vs the Byble, that is to say, the bookes of holy scripture: and let vs thinke that to be a better iewell in our house then either golde or siluer. For lyke as theeues be loth to assault an house where they knowe to be good armour and artillerie: so whersoeuer these holy and ghostly bookes be occupied, there neither the deuyll nor none of his angels dare come neare. And they that occupy them be in much safegarde, and haue a great consolation, and be the redier vnto all goodnesse, the slower vnto all euyll: and yf they haue done any thyng amisse, anone euen by the syght of the bookes their consciences be admonished, and they waxe sory and ashamed of the fact. Peraduenture they wyll say vnto me: howe and yf we vnderstande not that we reade, that is conteyned in the bookes? What then? Suppose thou vnderstande not the deepe and profounde misteries of scriptures, yet can it not be but that much fruite and holinesse must come and growe vnto thee by the readyng: for it can not be that thou shouldest be ignoraunt in all thynges a lyke. For the holy ghost hath so ordered and attempred the scriptures, that in them aswell publicanes, fishers, and sheepheardes, may fynde their edification, as great doctours their erudition. For those bookes were not made to vayne glorie, lyke as were the writynges of the gentile Philosophers and Rethoritians, to the intent the makers shoulde be had in admiration for their hye styles and obscure maner and writyng, wherof nothyng can be vnderstanded without a maister or an expositour: But the Apostles &amp; prophetes wrote their bookes so, that their speciall intent and purpose myght be vnderstanded and perceaued of euery reader, whiche was nothyng but the edification of amendement of the lyfe of them that reade or heare it. Who is it that readyng or hearyng read in the Gospell, <hi>Blessed are they that be meeke, Blessed are they that be mercifull, Blessed are they that be of cleane heart,</hi> and such other lyke places, can perceaue nothyng except he haue a maister to teache hym what it meaneth? Likewyse the signes &amp; miracles with all other histories of the doynges of Christe or his Apostles, who is there of so simple wit &amp; capacitie, but he may be able to perceaue and vnderstande them? These be but excuses and clokes for the rayne, &amp; coueringes of their owne idle slouthfulnesse: But styll ye wyll say I can not vnderstande it. What mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle? Howe shouldest thou vnderstande, yf thou wylt not reade, nor loke vpon it? Take the bookes into thyne handes, reade the whole story, and that thou vnderstandest, kepe it well in memorie: that thou vnderstandest not, reade it agayne, and agayne: yf thou can neither so come by it, counsayle with some other that is better learned. Go to thy curate &amp; preacher, shewe thy self to be desirous to know &amp; learne: and I doubt not but God seyng thy diligence and readinesse (if no man els teache thee) wyll hym selfe vouchsafe with his holy spirite to illuminate thee, &amp; to open vnto thee that which was locked frō thee.
<pb facs="24"/>
Remember the <hi>Eunuch</hi> of <hi>Candace</hi> Queene of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> which albeit he was a man of a wylde and barbarous countrey, and one occupied with worldly cares and businesse, yet rydyng in his charret, he was readyng the scripture. Nowe consider, yf this man passyng in his iourney was so diligent as to reade the scripture: what thynkest thou of lyke was he wont to do sittyng at home? Agayne he that letteth not to reade, albeit he dyd not vnderstande: what dyd he then trowest thou, after that when he had learned and gotten vnderstandyng? For that thou mayest wel knowe that he vnderstoode not what he redde: hearken what Philip there saith vnto hym. Vnderstandest thou what thou readest? And he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng ashamed to confesse his ignoraunce, aunswered: Howe shoulde I vnderstande hauyng no body to shewe me the way? Lo, when he lacked one to shewe hym the way, and to expounde to hym the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet dyd he reade: and therfore God the rather prouided for hym a guide of the way, that taught hym to vnderstande it. God perceaued his wyllyng and towarde mynde, and therfore he sent hym a teacher by &amp; by. Therfore let no man be negligent about his owne health and saluation: Though thou haue not Philip alwayes when thou wouldest, the holy ghost which then moued and stirred vp Philip, wyll be redy and not fayle thee yf thou do thy diligence accordyngly. All these thynges be written vnto vs for our edification and amendement, which be borne towardes the latter ende of the worlde. The readyng of the scriptures is a great and strong bulwarke or fortresse agaynst sinne: the ignoraunce of the same, is a greater ruine and destruction of them that wyll not knowe it. That is the thyng that bryngeth in herisie, that is it that causeth all corrupt and peruerse lyuyng, that is it that bryngeth all thynges out of good order. Hitherto all that I haue sayde, I haue taken and gathered out of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayde sermon of this holy doctour saint Iohn Chrisostome: Nowe yf I shoulde in lyke maner bryng foorth what the selfe same doctour speaketh in other places, and what other doctours and writers say concernyng the same purpose, I myght seeme to you to write another Byble, rather then to make a preface to the Byble. Wherfore in fewe wordes to comprehende the largenesse and vtilitie of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, howe it contayneth fruitfull instruction and erudition for euery man, yf any thyng be necessary to be learned, of the holy scripture we may learne it. If falshood shalbe reproued, therof we may gather wherwithall. If any thyng be to be corrected and amended, yf there neede any exhortation or consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the scripture we may well learne. In the scriptures be the fat pastures of the soule, therin is no venimous meate, no vnholsome thyng, they be the very daintie and pure feedyng. He that is ignoraunt, shall fynde there what he shoulde learne. He that is a peruerse sinner, shall there fynde his dampnation to make hym to tremble for feare. He that laboureth to serue God, shall fynde there his glorie, and the promissions of eternall lyfe, exhortyng hym more diligently to labour. Herein may princes learne howe to gouerne their subiectes: Subiectes obedience, loue, and dreede to their princes: Husbandes howe they shoulde behaue them vnto their wiues, howe to educate their children and seruauntes: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the wiues, children, and seruauntes, may knowe their duetie to their husbandes, parentes, and maisters. Here may all maner of persons, men, women, young, olde, learned, vnlearned, riche, poore, priestes, lay men, lordes, ladyes, officers, tenauntes, and meane men, virgins, wiues, widdowes, lawyars, marchauntes, artificers, husbandmen, and all maner of persons of what estate or condition soeuer they be, may in this booke learne all thinges what they ought to beleue, what they ought to do, &amp; what they should not do, aswell concernyng almightie God, as also concernyng them selues and all other. Briefly,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> to the readyng of the scripture none can be enemie, but that either be so sicke that they loue not to heare of any medicine, or els that be so ignoraunt that they knowe not scripture to be the most healthfull medicine. Therfore as touchyng this former part, I wyll heare conclude, and take it as a conclusion: sufficiently determined &amp; appointed that it is conuenient and good the scriptures to be redde of al sortes and kyndes of people, and in the vulgar tongue without further allegations or probations for the same, which shall not neede, since that this one place of Iohn Chrisostome is inough and sufficient to perswade all them that be not frowardly &amp; peruersly set in their owne wylfull opinion,<note place="margin">The kynges highnesse hath alowed the scripture as necessarie for vs.</note> specially nowe that the kinges highnesse being supreme head next vnder Christe of this Churche of Englande, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued with his royal assent the setting foorth hereof, which only to all true &amp; obedient subiectes ought to be a sufficient reason for the alowaunce of the same, without further delay, reclamation, or resistaūce, although there were no preface nor other reason herein expressed. Therfore nowe to come to the seconde and latter part of my purpose: here is nothyng so good in this worlde, but it may be abused, and turned from vnhurtfull &amp; wholsome, to hurtfull and noysome. What is there aboue better then the sunne, the moone, and the starres? Yet was there that toke occasion by the great beautie and vertue of them,<note place="margin">There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng but it may be abused</note> to dishonour God, and to defile them selues with idolatrie, geuyng the honour of the lyuyng God and creatour of all thynges, to such thynges as he had created. What is there here beneath better then fire, water, meates, drynkes, metals of golde, siluer, iron, and steele? Yet we see dayly great harme and much mischiefe done by euery one of these, aswell for lacke of wisdome &amp; prouidence of them that suffer euyll, as by the malice of them that worke the euyll. Thus to them that be euyll of them selues, euery thyng setteth forwarde and increaseth their euyll, be it of his owne nature a thyng neuer so good: lyke as contraryly, to them that studie and endeuoure them selues to goodnesse, euery thyng preuayleth them, and profiteth vnto good, be it of his owne nature a thyng neuer so bad, as S. Paul sayd,<note place="margin">Rom. viii.</note>
      <hi>Hiis qui diligunt deum, omnia cooperantur in bonum,</hi> All thinges do bryng good successe, to such as do loue God, euen as out of most venimous wormes is made triacle, the most soueraigne medicine for the preseruatiō of mans health in time of daunger. Wherfore I would aduise you al that come to the reading or hearing of this booke, which is the worde of God, the most precious iewell and most holy relique that remayneth vpon earth: that ye bryng with you the feare of God, and that ye do it with all due reuerence, &amp; vse your knowledge therof, not to vayne glorie of friuolous disputation: but to the honour of God, encrease of vertue, and edification both of your selues and other. And to the intent that my wordes may be the
<pb facs="25"/>
more regarded, I wyll vse in this part the aucthoritie of saint Gregorie <hi>Nazianzene,</hi> like as in the other I dyd of saint Iohn Chrisostome. It appeareth that in his tyme there were some (as I feare me there be also nowe at these dayes a great number) which were idle bablers, and talkers of the scripture out of season and all good order, and without any increase of vertue, or example of good lyuyng: to them he writeth all his first booke, <hi>de theologia.</hi> Wherfore I shall briefly gather the whole effect, and recite it here vnto you. There be some (saith he) whose not only eares and tongues, but also their fistes be whetted and redy bent all to contention and vnprofitable disputation, whom I woulde wishe as they be vehement and earnest to reason the matter with tongue, so they were all redy and practiue to do good deedes. But forasmuch as they subuertyng the order of all godlinesse, haue respect only to this thyng, howe they may bynde and loose subtile questions, so that nowe euery market place, euery ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house and tauerne, euery feast house, briefly euery company of men, euery assembly of women, is fylled with such talke: Since the matter is so (saith he) and that our fayth and holy religion of Christe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynneth to waxe nothyng els but as it were a sophistrie or a talkyng craft, I can no lesse do but say some thyng thervnto. It is not fyt (saith he) for euery man to dispute the hygh questions of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, neither is it to be done at all tymes, neither in euery audience must we discusse euery doubt: but we must knowe when, to whom, and howe farre we ought to enter into such matters. First it is not for euery man, but it is for such as be of exact and exquisite iudgementes, and such as haue spent their tyme before in studie and contemplation, and such as before haue clensed them selues aswell in soule as body, or at the least endeuoured them selues to be made cleane. For it is daungerous (saith he) for the vncleane to touche that thyng that is most cleane, lyke as the sore eye taketh harme by lokyng vpon the sunne. Secondarily, not at all tymes, but when we be reposed, and at rest from all outwarde dregges and trouble, and when that our heades be not encumbred with other worldy and wandryng imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: as yf a man shoulde mingle balme and dirt together. For he that shall iudge and determine such matters and doubtes of scriptures, must take his tyme when he may apply his wittes thervnto, that he may therby the better see and discerne what is trueth. Thirdly, where, and in what audience. There and among those that haue ben studious to learne: And not among such as haue pleasure to trifle with such matters, as with other thynges of pastime, which repute for their chiefe delicates, the disputation of hygh questions, to shewe their wittes, learnyng, and eloquencie in reasonyng of hygh matters. Fourthly, it is to be considered howe farre to wade in such matters of difficultie. No further (saith he) but as euery mans owne capacitie wyll serue hym, and agayne no further then the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or intelligence of the other audience may beare. For lyke as to great noyse hurteth the eare, to much meate hurteth the mans body, heauy burthens hurt the bearers of them, to much rayne doth more hurt then good to the grounde, briefly in all thynges, to much is noyous: euen so, weake wittes and weake consciences may soone be oppressed with ouer harde questions. I say not this to diswade men from the knowledge of God, and readyng or studiyng of the scripture: For I say that it is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for the lyfe of mans soule, as for the body to breathe. And yf it were possible so to liue, I woulde thinke it good for a man to spende all his life in that, and to do none other thyng. I commende the lawe which biddeth to meditate and studie the scriptures alwayes both nyght and day, and sermons &amp; prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynges to be made both mornyng, noone, and euentyde, and God to be lauded and blessed in all tymes, to bed warde, from bed, in our iourneys, and all our other workes. I forbyd not to reade, but I forbyd to reason. Neither forbyd I to reason so farre as is good and godly: but I alowe not that is done out of season, and out of measure and good order. A man may eate to much of hony be it neuer so sweete, and there is tyme for euery thyng, and that thyng that is good, is not good yf it be vngodly done. Euen as a flowre in wynter is out of season, and as a womans apparell becommeth not a man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contraryly, the mans the woman, neither is weepyng conuenient at a bridale, neither laughyng at a buriall. Nowe yf we can obserue and kepe that is comely and tymely in all other thynges: shall not we then the rather do the same in the holy scriptures? Let vs not runne foorth as it were wilde horses, that can suffer neither bridle in their mouthes, nor sitter on their backes. Let vs kepe vs in our boūdes, and neither let vs go to farre on the one side lest we returne into Egypt, neither to farre ouer the other, lest we be caryed away to Babylon. Let vs not syng the song of our Lorde in a straunge lande, that is to say, let vs not dispute the worde of God at all aduentures, aswell where it is not to be reasoned, as where it is, and aswell in the eares of them that be not fyt therfore, as of them that be. If we can in no wyse forbeare but that we must needes dispute, let vs forbeare thus much at the least, to do it out of tyme and place conuenient: And let vs entreate of those thynges which be holy, holyly: and vpon those thynges that be misticall, mistically: and not to vtter the deuine misteries in the eares vnworthy to heare them, but let vs knowe what is comely, aswell in our scilence and talkyng, as in our garmentes wearyng, in our feedyng, in our gesture, in our goynges, in all our other behauyng. This contention and debates about scriptures and doubtes therof (specially when such as do pretende to be the fauourers and studentes therof can not agree within them selues) doth most hurt to our selues, and to the furtheryng of the cause and quarrels that we woulde haue fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered aboue all other thinges. And we in this (saith he) be not vnlike to them that being mad, set their owne houses on fire, and that slay their owne children, or beate their owne parentes. I maruayle much (saith he) to recount wherof commeth all this desire of vayne glorie, wherof commeth all this tongue itche, that we haue so much delyght to talke and clatter? And wherin is our communication? Not in the commendation of vertuous and good deedes, of hospitalitie, of loue betwene christian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and brother, of loue betwene man and wyfe, of virginitie and chastitie, and of almes towarde the poore: Not in psalmes and godly songes, not in lamentyng for our sinnes, not in repressyng the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the body, not in prayers to God. We talke of scripture, but in the meane tyme we subdue
<pb facs="25"/>
not our fleshe by fastyng, watchyng, and weepyng, we make not this lyfe a meditation of death, we do not striue to be lordes ouer our appetites and affections, we go not about to pull downe our proude and hygh myndes, to abate our fumishe and rancorous stomackes, to restrayne our lustes and bodyly delectations, our vndiscrete sorowes, our lasciuious mirth, our inordinate lokyng, our insatiable hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of vanities, our speakyng without measure, our inconuenient thoughtes, and briefly, to refourme our lyfe and maners: but all our holinesse consisteth in talkyng. And we pardon eche other from all good lyuyng, so that we may sticke fast together in argumentation, as though there were no mo wayes to heauen but this alone, the way of speculation and knowledge (as they take it) but in very deede it is rather the way of superfluous contention and sophistication. Hitherto haue I recited the mynde of Gregorie <hi>Nazianzene</hi> in that booke whiche I spake of before. The same aucthour sayth also in an other place, that the learnyng of a christian man ought to begyn of the feare of God, to ende in matters of hye speculation: and not contraryly to begyn with speculation, and to ende in feare. For speculation (saith he) either hye cunnyng or knowledge, yf it be not stayed with the bridle of feare to offende God, is daungerous, and inough to tumble a man headlong downe the hyll. Therfore saith he, the feare of God must be the first begynnyng, and as it were an A.B.C. or an introduction to all them that shall enter into the very true and most fruitful knowledge of holy scriptures. Where as is the feare of God, there is (saith he) the kepyng of the commaundementes: and where as is the kepyng of the commaundementes, there is the clensyng of the fleshe: which fleshe is a cloude before the soules eye, and suffereth it not purely to see the beame of the heauenly lyght. Where as is the clensyng of the fleshe, there is the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the holy ghost, the ende of all our desires, and the very lyght wherby the veritie of scriptures is seene and perceaued. This is the mynde and almost the wordes of Gregorie <hi>Nazianzene</hi> doctour of the Greeke Churche, of whom saint Ierome saith: that vnto his tyme the latine Churche had no writer able to be compared and to make an euen matche with hym. Therfore to conclude this latter part, euery man that commeth to the readyng of this holy booke, ought to bryng with hym first and formost this feare of almightie God, and then next, a firme and stable purpose to refourme his owne selfe accordyng thervnto, and so to continue, proceede, and prosper from tyme to tyme, shewyng hym selfe to be a sober &amp; fruitfull hearer and learner: which yf he do, he shall proue at the length well able to teache, though not with his mouth, yet with his lyuyng and good example, which is sure the most liuely and effectuous fourme and maner of teachyng. He that otherwise intermedleth with this booke, let hym be assured that once he shall make a count therfore, when he shall haue sayde to hym as it is written in the prophete Dauid, <hi>Peccatòri dicit deus. &amp;c.</hi> Vnto the vngodly sayde God: Why doest thou preache my lawes, and takest my testament in thy mouth? Wheras thou hatest to be refourmed, and hast ben partaker with adulterers. Thou hast let thy mouth speake wickednesse, and with thy tongue thou hast set foorth deceipt. Thou sattest and spakest agaynst thy brother, and hast slaundered thyne owne mothers sonne.<note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note> These thynges hast thou done, and I helde my tongue, and thou thoughtest wickedly that I am euen such a one as thy selfe: But I wyll reproue thee, and set before thee the thynges that thou hast done. O consider this ye that forget God, lest I plucke you away, and there be none to deliuer you. Who so offereth me thankes and prayse, he honoureth me: and to hym that ordereth his conuersation ryght, wyll I shewe the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of God.</p>
