   <l>WHilst brothers liue, as brothers they must loue,</l>
   <l>As thē one wōb, so they one mind must beare.</l>
   <l>This Vaughan shewes in this his Goldē-groue,</l>
   <l>In this his learned worke without compare.</l>
   <l>Two Brothers like two feete so well they goe,</l>
   <l>Or like two mariners together row.</l>
   <l>The soyle which hath these louing brothers bred,</l>
   <l>Was euer held a soyle of great account,</l>
   <l>Here Brute of yore his golden time had led,</l>
   <l>Whose bruit and fame vnto the skies did mount:</l>
   <l>Whose noble seede amongst his issue sowne,</l>
   <l>Hath made the Britaines through y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> world wel</l>
   <l>Known for great soldiers, &amp; resolued mē (known</l>
   <l>Known for their loue to learning and the Arts;</l>
   <l>As these two brothers on the worldes Scene,</l>
   <l>Approu'd of late by their true acted parts:</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="211"/>
The other by his pen deseru'd the same.</l>
   <l>His pen was siluer, but his head of gold,</l>
   <l>That could so much in so few lines containe;</l>
   <l>That in three bookes could all things so vnfold:</l>
   <l>(If all bee three, as learned writers sayne)</l>
   <l>Of metals, gold the purest is esteemd;</l>
   <l>Of our late writers, thou as best art deemd.</l>
   <l>The Muses hire is not well ratified:</l>
   <l>(Such is their fare in these accursed daies)</l>
   <l>But of thy Brother be thou gratified,</l>
   <l>Heele pay thee loue, as thou dost pay him praise.</l>
   <l>For both your meeds let goldē groues abide,</l>
   <l>And after death you golden wreathes betide.</l>
