   <head>To the Reader.</head>
   <p>DIuers wryters of Hystories write dyuersly. Some penne their hystories plentifully at large. Some contrary wyse, briefly and shortly doo but (as it were) touche by the way, the remembraunce and accidents of those tymes, of which they write. Some do with a large com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>passe discouer as wel the affaires done in foreyn partes, as those that hapned in that countrey, of whiche especially they wryte. And some content to let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone other matters, put in memory on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such thyngs, as they thē selues haue had experiēce of, in their own coūtreis. Amongs whom, good Reader, I craue to haue place, and desyre roome in the lower part of this table. For I vse thee in this my booke as some symple fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that beynge not able of his owne coste to feast his guestes sufficientely, is fayne to bee frended of his neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures,
<pb facs="12"/>
and to sette before them suche dishes as he hath gotten of others. For I acknowledge, that many of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, that thou shalte reade here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged, are taken, partely out of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Fabian, sometyme Alderman of London, Edwarde Halle gentylman of Greyes Inne, Iohn Hardynge, a great trauailer bothe in foreyne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis, and also in all writynges of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, and other, who reaped great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of knowlege, and filled their bookes full therwith, to the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and pleasure of all posteritie, and to their own great fame and glory. So that of their great plenty, I might wel take somewhat to hyde my pouertie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>. Howbe it, I haue not so doone it, as, if they should clayme theyr own, I shuld forthwith be left naked. For somwhat I haue noted, which I my selfe, partly by paynfull searche, and partly by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent experiēce, haue found out. Wher fore, hoth the smalnesse of the volume,
<pb facs="12"/>
which cōprehēdeth gret matters in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, &amp; lso the noueltie of som matters vttred therin, ought to cause y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it shold not be altogither vnwelcome to thee. For, though it be written homely, yet it is not (as I trust) writē vntruly. And in hystories the chiefe thyng that is to be desyred is truthe. Wherfore, if thou fynde that in it, I beseche thee, wynke at small faultes, or at the least, let the consyderation of my well meanynge, drowne them. So shalt thou both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me to farther diligence, and also vtter thyne owne frendlynesse, in that thou doest rather further, then con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demne a weake wryter.</p>
   <q>
      <l>Of smoothe and flatterynge speache, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to take hede:</l>
      <l>For Trouthe in playn wordes may be tolde, of craft a lye hath nede.</l>
