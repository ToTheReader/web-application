                 <title>A fruitfull commentarie vpon the twelue small prophets : briefe, plaine, and easie, going ouer the same verse by verse, and shewing every where the method, points of doctrine, and figures of rhetoricke, to the no small profit of all godly and well disposed readers, with very necessarie fore-notes for the vnderstanding both of these, and also all other the prophets. The text of these prophets together with that of the quotations omitted by the author, faithfully supplied by the translatour, and purged of faults in the Latine coppie almost innumerable, with a table of all the chiefe matters herein handled, and marginall notes very plentifull and profitable; so that it may in manner be counted a new booke in regard of these additions. VVritten in Latin by Lambertus Danæus, and newly turned into English by Iohn Stockwood minister and preacher at Tunbridge</title>

   <head>To the courteous and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight courteous and Christian Reader, I haue be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gun, and through God his grace and assistance finished this briefe, but most learned and easie Commentarie vpon the <hi>small Prophets,</hi> not in profit, but in volume, for thy good and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in the midst of many most grieuous and almost impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table troubles and incredile molestations, as they well knowe, who are best acquainted with my poore distressed estate, and vnderstand the true and vneuitable occasions of the same; as well to shew my selfe willing vpon all occasions according to my small measure to doe good vnto the congregation of the faithfull, and well disposed Christians, as to stay, or at leastwise to discredit the slaunderous reports of many viperous &amp; poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened tongues, who among many other vniust accusations and false charges bruited euery where against me, haue not ceased to giue out that I spend all my time in vaine and idle exercises, profitable vnto none, but greatly chargeable vnto my selfe, and much offensiue vnto others. For that I my selfe say nothing, nor seeke the true report and testimonie of others, who are well affected in religion, and most priuy vnto the cariage of my selfe in mine outward conuersation and behauiour; partly this worke now published, partly some others alreadie committed to the presse, and partly some other readie for the same both in Greeke and Latin, will easily cry shame vnto this so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and open infamie, and cause the rest of like suite and substance, among all the godly to be esteemed and iudged of accordingly. And as after this manner exercising and occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my selfe at by-times and spare houres for the profit of the Church and Common-wealth, I haue not onely founde some release and quiet vnto my selfe in driuing many other combersome cares out of my pensiue and heauie heart, but also
<pb facs="4"/>haue had most comfortable experience of God his fatherly and prouident care, to raise vp for me some faithful friends vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, the which mooued with Christian pitie and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, haue profered me kindnesse and courtesie, so likewise my good hope and assured confidence is, that when in more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral maner my lamētable case shal come vnto the further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the greater number of the godly, not weighing nor beleeuing the sinister practises of the lewd &amp; wicked, they will in the bowels of brotherly remorse and charitable <hi>sympathi</hi> and fellow-feeling of the pinching miseries in the poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the same bodie, shew forth their willing and readie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes to minister some reliefe and comfort in so harde and great extremities. But whither am I caried at vnwares with the violent streame of my afflicted estate, and the opprobrious cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of virulent and venemous tongues misdeeming, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough misdeeming, mis-iudging, and most mis-reporting and mis-speaking of the same? It is high time that recalling my selfe, and humbly grauing thy courteous pardon (most gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who soeuer thou art) I should surcease this wādring course not pertinent to the present matter, how soeuer very needefull in respect of my selfe, and speake some thing touching that which in the translation of this very profitable exposition, I haue presumed to adde and set downe of my self, aboue that which is to be found in the originall coppie of the godlie and learned Author.</p>
   <p n="1">1 Vnderstand therefore first of all thus much, that whereas the Latine treatise hath not so much as one marginall note, I haue filled the same with diuers, in one short and easie viewe laying open vnto thy consideration the summe and principall contents of that which is said vpon euery verse, as also pointing vnto euery especiall matter to be noted &amp; marked in the same.</p>
   <p n="2">2 Secondly whereas <hi>Danaeus</hi> him selfe for shortnes sake, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe no text in the expounding of all these Prophets verse by verse, but onely by quotation referreth thee vnto the same, I haue laid downe the english text according vnto such
<pb facs="4"/>translations extant among vs, as in the iudgem̄et of the learned are supposed to goe neerest vnto the same (sauing that in some few places I haue bin bold in some one word or twaine to put downe mine owne) for that I deemed that the bare quotation without the text it selfe, would seeme very raw and little profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto the greater number, vnlesse it were vnto some fewe (if happily any such be to be found) that haue the whole text of every prophet verse by verse without booke, and by roote of heart, as commonly we vse to terme it.</p>
   <p n="3">3 Thirdly, where soeuer the author him self seemeth to stand vpon the interpretation of some hebrue word dissonant from the exposition of others, although he neuer in a maner doe vse to specifie or name the same word; I, notwithstanding doe vse in the margin to expresse the same in latin letters, as well for the vnderstanding of the most simple and ignorant, as also for that the Hebrew characters or letters are not very rise with euery Printer, nor their Compositors &amp; workmen alwaies very skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the right and true compounding and ordering of the same, albeit notwithstanding they be orderly &amp; truly set down in writing vnto their hand before.</p>
   <p n="4">4 Fourthly, all such places of scripture, the which <hi>Danaeus</hi> by quotation sendeth vs vnto (the which in this booke are almost infinite) not citing the text of the places themselues, the same so neerely as I could find them, and vpon due examination iudge to make fitly for the purpose, whereunto they were quoted, I haue truly set downe in the text it selfe, and so farre as my small skill and little learning would serue me, haue laboured and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to applie and frame them vnto that which I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be likeliest to be the sense and meaning of the Author. But howe great cumber and trouble the same oftentimes did bring vpon me, as for that not onely the verse, but sometimes the chapter, yea &amp; otherwhiles also the whole booke was mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, I referre vnto all those that shall assay to make proofe and triall hereof in the Latine coppie it selfe of the Author.</p>
   <p n="5">5 Fiftly, whereas this writer beeing a great Schooleman and
<pb facs="5"/>cunning Artist, doth often lay forth the figures of Rhetoricke vsed by the Prophets in their seuerall writings and sermons, when soeuer occasion serueth that he doth name any such fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, I doe briefly in the margin make a short description of the same, and make it easie for the vnderstanding of the Reader euen of the meanast capacitie and conceit by some one or two familiar examples, and so often as after he maketh recitall of the same figure againe in any part of this worke, I doe by quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on referre the Reader whither he shall repaire to vnderstande and know what the said figure is.</p>
   <p n="6">6 Last of al, the errours and faults which in the Latin coppy partly through the negligence of the workemen, and partly through ouersight of the Author himselfe, doe amount vnto many hundreths, are in this english translation all of them (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be of any moment or weight) faithfully amended and corrected, so that all things are made most plaine and easie for the drawing on of the courteous Reader to be delighted with the reading of this booke, the which as by me it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hand, and not without great painetaking as wel in rising earely, sitting long at it, and going late to bed, that thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test increase daily more and more in all Christian and heauenly knowledge, so if it shal be gently taken, and friendly receiued at thy courteous hands, I shall thinke my trauaile well bestowed, and daily pray vnto God for the increase of all needefull giftes and graces of his holy spirit for thee according to thy place and calling to his glory, and benefit of his Church and people for Christ his sake our onely Mediatour and redeemer.</p>
