   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ycause our most noble and also moste godlye Senatours dyde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue / that the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syons and manyfolde euyls / which haue ben hytherto by the reason of pyctures &amp; ymages / ar nat suffyciently taken away by the only exhortacyons of prechers. And agayne dyd consydre / that it was nat possyble for any man to decree or cōmaunde any thing con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cernynge them more wysely / than god had prescrybed &amp; cōmaunded in his lawe and prophetes: They decreed and ordeined &amp; gaue forth a cōmaundemēt / that whatsoeuer pycture or ymages hath ben wont
<pb facs="2"/> to be worshypped in holye places / shulde both they and their aulters be clene taken away / and avoyded out of syght. Bycause .iiii. yeres ago / they had abrogated priuate masses / and a tweluemoneth a go foure cōmune and open masses. For fyrst cōsultatyon and delybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratyon of more pure ceremonyes to be brought into their places. Secondarily they lokinge for cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne counsels and assembles / of whiche it was hoped / that some what shulde be decreed cōcerning the generall reformation of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che. And thyrdly the wekenesse of certayne parsones / whiche coulde nat yet se / how gret impyetie and abusyon is in masses / hadde saued the resydewe of masses. And they hadde suspended theym vpon this condityon / that if any man coulde proue by the scryptures / that they
<pb facs="2"/> were nat contrary to Christ / they shuld be restored againe euerione.</p>
   <p>Moreouer / seyng there ar many men / whiche do nat yet perceyue nor knowe / how moche these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges do hyndre fayth &amp; trew godly lyuynge: we do easely coniecture / that there are nat a fewe / whiche shall accompte this dede of oure cōmune wele / to be a folysshe and a wycked presumption. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore / for as moch as it is the dutye of all christen men / as moch as in them lyeth to gyue dilygence &amp; to prouyde / that the thynge whiche they haue godly done &amp; wrought / maye be accompted &amp; knowen of other men / to be none other wyse than godly done. And also to take good hede / that no man may haue occasyon worthely to speke euyl of their goodnesse (as Paule sayth) Herefore we haue iudged it to be
<pb facs="3"/> our parte and dutye which taught that the thynge ought to be done / which nowe our senate hath done in very dede / &amp; brought to passe ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry dilygently to shewe the cause of all this whole dede: but with as moche brefenesse as maye be / that if it wolde be / we might happely pacify &amp; apease the myndes / at the lest wyse of some persones / whom this busines hath troubled &amp; gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discontēted / &amp; doubtelesse if we may optayn this one thyng (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is denyed to no man / be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so gret a malefactour) that we maye haue the one eare open to here what we shall saye: We feare nat / but that whosoeuer can fynde in their hertes / and abyde to know these fewe thinges / which we shall allege fyrst out of holy scriptures. Secondarily of the writynges of the fathers. And thyrdly of the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crees
<pb facs="3"/> of emperours agaynst pyctu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res and ymages. If it be shewed also of whom / &amp; for what cause &amp; consyderation both they were first brought vp in the churches of chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sten men / and also beynge defēded haue contynued in the same. We doute nat (I saye) but that all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che persones: if it be so / that it be graunted vnto them to knowe the truthe / wyll also desyre with vs / that this thynge whiche is done here with vs / all other churches of christen men / dyd folowe &amp; execute in lyke maner. Therfore we praye and beseche all those / whosoeuer cā nat yet lyke nor alowe this our exāple (which thinge it is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyle thoughe it happen to many men / if a man consydre what thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges haue euerywhere goten stren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gthe amonge Christen men) that they wyll vouchesafe to rede this
<pb facs="4"/> shorte lytell treatyse to the ende / which fyrst was made in our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall tongue / and nowe by oure most welbeloued brother / Iames Bedrote / is translated into laten. But let them fyrste before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynne to rede / call for the spyrite of Christ / which only ledeth into all verytie and truth / &amp; that done let them than gyue sentence of vs. Christ the sauyour of mankynde graunt to all those which bere his name / grace to reiecte all suche thi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges which do call away the mynd from him: that they maye lyfte vp their myndes vnto him syttynge in heuen / and worshippe the father by him / in spiryte and truth. Amen.</p>
