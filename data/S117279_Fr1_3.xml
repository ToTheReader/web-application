      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Word of God is given us as a most pretious treasure, and that not for our selves onely, but for our children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us, and therefore is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jsraels Jnheritance, Deut. 33.4. Moses com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us a Law, even the Inheritance of the Congregation of Iacob.</hi> All the wealth in the world is but as dirt and trash in comparison of the Word to the people of God. <hi>(Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever; for they are the rejoycing of mine heart,</hi> saith <hi>David, Psal. 119.111.)</hi> And therefore as they rejoyce in their owne enjoying of it, so they doe what they may to assure it to their children when they are dead, that it may be entailed upon them and their posterity after them, Yea so they doe also with the knowledge of divine truths which they have found in the Word, (which is not indeed found out by men all at one time, but by degrees, as Gold is found in Mines▪ as men come to search farther and farther and to dig deeper and deeper for it) It was not (they know) imparted to them for their owne use onely, but for
<pb facs="5"/>
the benefit of others, <hi>the manifestation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is given to profit withall, 1 Cor. 12.7.</hi> and therefore as it comes to them from Heaven they hand it to others,<note place="margin">
         <hi>1 Tim. 3.15.</hi>
      </note> that so it may be continued in the Church, <hi>the ground and pillar of truth,</hi> for the good of those that shall live in future times.</p>
   <p>This was, I hope, the chiefe aime of those that have published these Sermons of that worthy Light of our Church, <hi>D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Sibs.</hi> And surely we have great cause in this regard thankfully to acknowledge their care and paines, who both tooke them so exactly from his mouth as he delivered them, and then kept them so charity as <gap reason="foreign">

      <hi>a precious thing committed to their trust,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>2 Tim. 1.14</hi>
      </note> and have now published them for the common good of all that will make use of them. For by this meanes what was delivered to a few may now build up many to farther degrees of knowledge and grace even all the Land over, and they that never saw his face may be made sharers in those his labours which only a few were so happy as to heare.</p>
   <p>Being my selfe one amongst others that have found the advantage hereof, I was not so hardly wonne as otherwise I should have beene, to commend these <hi>Beames of divine Light</hi> to the respect of others. Diverse truths of greatest consequence are exactly handled in the severall Sermons here presented to you, as concerning the misery of our naturall estate and the bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

   <p>The study of the Scriptures made the Author <hi>a man of God, perfect, thorowly furnished unto all good workes,</hi> and as became <hi>a faithfull Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of the manifold grace of God, he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to teach the whole counsell of God,</hi> and to store men with the knowledge of Gods will, <hi>in all wisedome and spirituall understanding.</hi> I desire that both thou and I and all Gods people may so reade these his labours that it may farther our growing in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ, to whose grace I commend thee, being</p>
