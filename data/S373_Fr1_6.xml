                 <title>The mathematical ievvel : shewing the making, and most excellent vse of a singuler instrument so called: in that it performeth with wonderfull dexteritie, whatsoeuer is to be done, either by quadrant, ship, circle, cylinder, ring, dyall, horoscope, astrolabe, sphere, globe, or any such like heretofore deuised: ... The vse of which iewel, is so aboundant and ample, that it leadeth any man practising thereon, the direct pathway ... through the whole artes of astronomy, cosmography, ... and briefely of whatsoeuer concerneth the globe or sphere: ... The most part newly founde out by the author, compiled and published ... by Iohn Blagraue of Reading gentleman and well willer to the mathematickes, who hath cut all the prints or pictures of the whole worke with his owne hands. 1585</title>

   <head>The Authour in his owne defence.</head>
   <l>IF poore man with his paine, May pick vp many a pounde,</l>
   <l>If streames with often rayne, May quell the greedie grounde,</l>
   <l>If rusticke soyle may yeelde, Both hearbes and flowres faire,</l>
   <l>If tylth the hungrie field, May maintaine and repaire:</l>
   <l>Then why shoulde <hi>Momus</hi> howte, Or cauill at my quill,</l>
   <l>To see hym now send out, That he hath haachte at will?</l>
   <l>Or why shoulde painfull penne, that long hath toyld in hope,</l>
   <l>By meanes of spitefull men Be turned all aslope.</l>
   <l>As though the <hi>Muses</hi> all were niggardes now of late,</l>
   <l>And would not let the small To enter at their gate:</l>
   <l>Or stoupt to none but states, Or lou'd to lodge in Towers,</l>
   <l>Disdaining countrie cates Or course contriued bowres.</l>
   <l>No no, you neuer knew, That ere they were so strange,</l>
   <l>And I dare vouche for true They neuer will so chaunge.</l>
   <l>VVhy? did not they attende <hi>Diogenes</hi> his tubbe?</l>
   <l>And meekly to him bend Yea vnder many a shrubbe?</l>
   <l>And were they not at hand VVith <hi>Arion</hi> on the Seas?</l>
   <l>VVith <hi>Orpheus</hi> on the lande Amid the wildernesse?</l>
   <l>Let no man nowe then doubt But haply I may show</l>
   <l>Such stuffe as late came out, And did in <hi>Pernasse</hi> grow.</l>
   <l>Though that my name be not Among the learned rolde.</l>
   <l>Let not that bee a blot Ere that my tale be told.</l>
   <l>Yet <hi>Zoylus</hi> seemes to say, VVhy? what? and whence is he?</l>
   <l>A childe but yesterday, And now to scale the skie?</l>
   <l>VVhere gathered he his skill? VVhat tutor tolde him in?</l>
   <l>The Vniuersities denill That ere he dwelt therein,</l>
   <l>And London laughes to thinke She scarce doth knowe hys face,</l>
   <l>How commes he then to linke VVith <hi>Vranes</hi> worthy grace.</l>
   <l>My aunsweare shall bee short, My paine this peece hath pend,</l>
   <l>God lent it to my lot, And hee shall mee defende.</l>
   <l>The Psalmes say sucklinges young His glory shall disclose</l>
   <l>VVhich warrants me among My wrangling wrabbish foes.</l>
