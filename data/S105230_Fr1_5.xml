   <p>Fyrst, they had read y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sacrament of cir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cūsitiō, was called, <hi>Pactū siue foedus domini</hi>
      <pb facs="11"/> in the couenaunt of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lord. Which thing notw<seg rend="sup">t</seg>standing was not y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> very couenant in dede: but a signe, tokē, sacrament &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morial of the couenaunt y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> was betwene god and Abraham. Again, how y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Iacob did cal the altare that he had builded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lord, <hi>Deum Bethel,</hi> the God of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel, and the place where he wrastled w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      <note place="margin">Genes. xxviii. Chapi. &amp; xxxii. Chapiter.</note> the aungel. <hi>Phuiel seu Phaniel,</hi> the face of god. Now (as I suppose) noo man wyll iudge or thinke, except he were without al humain vnderstanding, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same heap of stones which Iacob had gathered to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether, was y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> God of Bethel, or y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> place where he wrastled w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the angel, was the face of god in verye dede. But whye are they so called thē? Verelye y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the name it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self might put men in remembraune of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> thing y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> by thē was signified &amp; betokened Euen as afterwardes, when y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> childrē of Israel wer deliuered out of Egipt, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> pas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cal lambe (which was a sacrament most reuerently kept alwaies emong y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Iues) was called <hi>Pesac, id est transitus domini,</hi> y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lordes passeouer, that they hearinge this <note place="margin">Exod. xi. Cha</note> word, passeouer might immediatly cal in to their remembraunce, the innumerable benefites of their mighty &amp; omnipotent
<pb facs="11"/> sauiour. Which passing by throughe the land of their enemies, did slaye al y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> firste born of Egipt, &amp; so with a mighty &amp; stret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched furth arme, did bring them safe tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> red sea, from al misery, wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; thraldom, into a land that floweth with milke &amp; hony, And verelye when y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lambe was once selected, chosen &amp; taken out of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> flocke, and applied to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy vse that god, by hys seruaunte Moises, had before theyr deliueraunce out of Egipte instituted and ordeined, it was noo more called a lambe, but y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> passeouer of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lorde Which phrase &amp; maner of speaking, all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> auncyente fathers and prophetes of the old Testament, did vse alwayes in theyr sermons and writynges. And our Lorde Iesus Christ, the euerlastinge wisedome of god the father, did confirme the same, when he did institute and ordaine the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of his death and passyon vntoo vs, callynge the sacramente of his bodye &amp; bloud, by the very name of those most holy and sacred thinges, which by it are signified. That when in the celebratyon of the holy misteries, we doo heare these wordes. <hi>This is my bodye, and this is my bloud,</hi> Marke well good reader the ana<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>logie
<pb facs="12"/> of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> old &amp; new sacraments, for he y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> saith of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lamb, <hi>This is the passeouer of the lord,</hi> which this night shal passe by, doth say also of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bread, <hi>This is my body,</hi> which shal be deliuered for you, we by &amp; by put before our eies that most precious body, which so pitiously on y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> crosse, was brokē for vs, &amp; also his most holy &amp; sacred blud which w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the handes of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> vngodlye, was<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shed for our sinnes, wherfore (as I haue said before of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lambe) when the bread &amp; wine, is by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> true and faithful ministers preaching &amp; anunciatyng y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lordes death and passion vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> christen people, appli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed vnto y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thing which our sauioure hath ordeyned, it is no lenger called bread and wine (though in some places of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scriptu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res we fynd that both Luke &amp; Paule do cal it bread, &amp; the cup) but the bodye and bloud of our lord: and for this cause doth S. Paul say: he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> eateth of thys bread, &amp; drinketh of this cup vnworthely, shal be gylty of the body &amp; bloud of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lord. As if he should say: he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> regardeth not the pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> which, Christ did institute this sacramente, which commeth not vnto it with a spiritual hunger, to eate throughe faith his very body, and with a spirituall
<pb facs="12"/> thirst, to drinke through faith, hys verye bloud which by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> breade &amp; wyne, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> doth not put away al ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lice, rancor, &amp; vncharitablenes from hys hert, &amp; study to vnitie, loue, and concorde which by this mistical breade is betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vs, he that doth not come vnto this feast &amp; banket with a mery hert, ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing god herty thankes, for our delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce out of synne, he which dothe not much more eat y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> death of the lord in his hert, then y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> bread w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his mouth, is giltye of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> body and bloud of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lorde and so he doth eate and drinke his owne dampna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, because he maketh no difference of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lordes body, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is to say, putteth no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwene this eatinge &amp; other ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which serueth onelye for the bealy, where as this eating was instituted &amp; or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dained to serue the soule &amp; inward man. And therfore he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> abuseth it to y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> flesh, ea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth &amp; drinketh his owne dampnatyon, and commeth vnworthely to the banket where the sacramente of Christes bodye, is eaten, yea, where y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> body of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lord is ea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten, not carnally with the rethe and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but spiritually with hearte, faith, and spirite. These phrases, I saye, and maner
<pb facs="13"/> of speaking do the holye fathers vse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, when they do intreat vpō this sacrament, which at the first sight, maye seme to avow the bodely and carnal pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sence of Christ, in the sacrament &amp; holye supper, but if they be wel pondered, mē shal sone perceiue &amp; vnderstand howthei ought to be taken. For it is the custome &amp; vse of the auncient doctors, when they speake of the sacrament &amp; outwarde ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to apply vnto the sacrament &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eating, the frutes, profites, &amp; condi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions of the spiritual &amp; inward eatinge, &amp; also of the thing it self, which by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is signified. Because y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in a faithful man, thei are so ioyntly ioined, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the one is neuer without y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> other: As by example we say y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> god died &amp; suffered for vs, &amp; yet the godhead of Christ, by the which part onely he is called god, dyd neuer suffer. But because y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the godhead is so anexed w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the manhod, that they both make but one person, it is said y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> god suffered for vs Which thing, if it be wel loked vpon, cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sidered &amp; weied, shal be fonde to be an ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>used &amp; an vnpropre speache, &amp; yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles, it may wel be vsed, if men vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what is meant therby. A very like
<pb facs="13"/> example haue we in the thirde of Ihon. Where Christ saith, no man ascendeth in to heauen, but he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> descendeth frō heauē the son of man which is in heauē. Mark &amp; vnderstand: this scripture doth say &amp; te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stifye, that the sonne of manne was then in heauen, when he spake these wordes, vnto Nicodemus, here vpon earth, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thing al wisemen do graunt y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it was spoken. <hi>propter vnitatem personae,</hi> y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is too say, for the vnitie of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> persō. For though his godhead were in euery place at that time, yet was not his manhod, by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che he is called y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sonne of man, in heauē at y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> time: And yet Christ said y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it was in heauē for his vnitie of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> persō. For hys godhead was in heauen, &amp; because y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the godhead &amp; manhode do make one persō therfore y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> was adscrybed vnto the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode, which was verified vpō y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> godhed But now by the sacrament of baptisme we wil make this our matter more mani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fest &amp; plain. In this sacrament (I meane baptisme) the inward working of the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly gost, is euer in the faithful persons, an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nexed vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> outward ceremonies: Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore sometime the fruicte of the inwarde baptisme is adscribed vnto the outward
<pb facs="14"/> worke, &amp; so y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scripture vseth to speake of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> outward baptisme, as though it wer y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> inward, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is to say, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy gost. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore S. Paul doth saye, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we are buryed w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Christ, through baptisme, &amp; yet y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward baptisme did but signify this bury<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>al. And again Paul doth say, as mani as are baptised, haue put Christ vpon them And yet in dede our outward baptisme, doth but signify y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we haue put Christ vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on vs: But by y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> inward baptisme, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is the water of life, &amp; the spirit of god we haue in dede put hym on, we liue in him, &amp; he in vs. Which thyng truely can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not be verified of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> outward baptisme in thē, which do not receiue it w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> faith. For vnto them it is but a bare sygne, wherof they get no profit, but damnatiō. And ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rely so it is of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sacrament &amp; holy supper of our lord. For in it y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> scripture &amp; all the auncient doctors do adscribe vnto y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worke &amp; ceremony, which is onely true in y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> inward veritie. For they onely eat y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> flesh of the lord, &amp; drinke his bloud not carnally w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> teth &amp; mouth: but spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> faith. which dwel in Christ, and in whō Christ dwelleth: The veritie it selfe saying: he y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> eateth my flesshe, &amp; drinketh
<pb facs="14"/> my bloud, dwelleth in mee, &amp; I in hym. Thus ye may se, how y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy fathers of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> auncient &amp; old church ought to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standed in this matter of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sacramente &amp; supper of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> lord. Which thei do cal <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ristiam,</hi> a thankes geuing, because y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> by it the faithful &amp; godly, are moued too geue high &amp; immortal thankes vnto god, their heauenly father, for y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> death of his onely begotten son, Iesu Christ. Sometime <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naxin,</hi> y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is to say, a charitable cōming to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> faithful, vnto thys holy maū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy &amp; feast of euerlastinge life. And other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles a sacrifice, because y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> as Chrisostō saith, it is a memorial of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> omnisufficient sacrifice, ones for euer offered in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> altare of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> crosse. Yea y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> very missaries (y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> truth compelling thē to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same) do cal it y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stery of faith, &amp; the sacrifice of laude and praise. These thinges therfore, good chry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sten reader, y<seg rend="sup">u</seg> shalte depely prynte in thy mind &amp; memory, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thou maieste herafter w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>stand y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> enemies of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> truth, which eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry where do bost &amp; crake, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the holy doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do stand &amp; make for thē, where as yf they be wel vnderstanded, they do all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste them. For that whiche they doo brynge out of Cipryan and Ambrose, all godly learned men do agre, that they
<pb facs="15"/> they were not Cipryans nor Ambroses workes, but workes falsly adscribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, by such false antichristes as intē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded to bryng in this erromus, doctryne into the churche of Christe. Therfore let no such sayinges moue the, but sticking to the spirit which quickeneth, studye w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> al thy endeuour, to be made one body w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> our head, Iesu Christ, which in his glori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied body, sitteth on y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> right hand of god the father, tyl his enemyes be made hys fote stole. As for my parte, I wil daily &amp; hourely beseche that almighty lorde, the father of al mercy and comfort, whyche did send his onely begotten sonne, Iesu Christ into this world, with al plenitude of heauenly doctrine, bidding vs to hear him, as his welbeloued son, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he vouche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe with his spirit, to kindle▪ rauishe and inflame our heartes, to the feruente loue of his doctrine onely, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> so with one faith and one consent, reiecting the dreames &amp; doctrines of men, we maye fede oure soules with the heauenly fode of the Scriptures and worde of god. To whō be prayse glory and honour for euer. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
