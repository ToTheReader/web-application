      <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y good Lord: it may seem in the conceits of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious, that in some sort it fareth at this instant with mee, as it did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time with the old Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Phormio:</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst the most sumptuous entertainmentes at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which <hi>K. Antiochus</hi> made vnto <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the time of his banishment from <hi>Carthage,</hi> for a further delight and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was willed to dilate vpon some theame: and accordingly he tooke in hand to discourse of the duetie of a Captaine, and to teach what
<pb facs="3"/>
was appertaining to the discipline of warre: which when he had finished, <hi>Hannibal</hi> beeing desired by the standers by, to deliuer his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, answered, that he had before seene manie olde men doate, but neuer none more then <hi>Phormio.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Like blame then I may incurre, in beeing thought too busie in dealing with matters of Philosophie, a matter as contrarie to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession as the other was to the Philosophers, and in me to be turned to the rashnes of youth, what in him was to the dotage of olde age.</p>
   <p>But howsoeuer these my endeuours may lye in the consideration of the enuious or ouercuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, with which two humors this age most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth, yet if by your Lo: they may be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med worthie of your honorable protection, I shall not onely thinke it my greatest happines to haue employed my time herein, but also with the like oportunitie and leasure shalbe incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to wade into some argument of greater paines and moment: hauing at the first entred hereinto through the persuasion of a friend of

D.</hi> to giue my consent to the publishing thereof, as a matter necessarie, as he thought for the time, and especially for such as vnderstoode not the French tongue.</p>
