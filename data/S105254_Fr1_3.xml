      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O come to the presse is more dangerous, then to bee prest to death, for the payne of those Tortures, last but a few minutes, but he that lyes vpon the rack in print, hath his flesh torne off by the teeth of <hi>Enuy, and Calumny,</hi> euen when he meanes no body any hurt in his graue. I think therefore twere better to make ten challenges at all manner of weapons, then to play a Schollers Prize, vpon a book-sellers stall, for the one draws but bloud: by the other a man is drawne &amp; quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, take heed of <hi>Criticks.</hi> they bite (like fish) at any thing, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at bookes. But the Diuell being <hi>Let loose</hi> amongst them, I hope they will not exercise their Coniurations vpon him: Yf they doe, they are damb'd. In despight of <hi>Brontes</hi> and <hi>Steropes,</hi> that forge Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of Ignorance and contempt, to shoote at Learning, I haue ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merd out this <hi>Engine,</hi> that has beaten open the <hi>Infernall Gates,</hi> and discouerd that great <hi>Tobaconist</hi> the Prince of Smoake &amp; darknes, <hi>Don Pluto.</hi> A supplicatiō was sent to him long since by a poore fellow one <hi>Pierce Pennylesse.</hi> But the Diuel being ful of busines, could neuer til now haue leasure to answere it: Mary now (since Christmas) he has drawne out some spare howres, &amp; shot 2. Arrowes at one mark, in 2. seuerall Bowes: and of two contrary flights: Wherein hee proues himselfe, a damb'd lying <hi>Cretan,</hi> because hee's found in two Tales, about one matter. But it may be, the first Answere, that hee sent by the Post was in the Morning, (fot he striues to speake soberly, grauely, and like a Puritane) The other (sure) in the afternoone, for hee talkes more madly: But so farre from <hi>Those fantasticall Taxations &amp;c.</hi> Which the Gentleman that drew that forenoones piece, (whom I know not) seemes aloofe off (like a Spy) to discouer, that euen in the most triuiall and merriest Applications, there are <hi>Seria locis,</hi> how soeuer it bee, sithence wee both haue had to doe with the Deuill, and that hee's now [by our meanes) brought to the Barre, let him plead for himselfe: Yshis Answers be good, tis strange, because no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes can come from him, Yfbad, and like thee not, thou hast the amends in thyne owne hands: neuer rayle at him: for the Diuell (like a drunkard) cares for no body.</p>
   <p>Farewell.</p>
