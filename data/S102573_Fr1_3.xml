   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE LORD, THE LORD WENTWORTH.</head>
   <l>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen meannes speakes, and honors balance weighes him:</l>
   <l>Had need speake well, for feare his tongue betrayes him</l>
   <l>Lest vndiscerning, there discouered lies</l>
   <l>Some marke of folly to iudicious eies.</l>
   <l>Euen so, great Lord, my timerous quill proceeds</l>
   <l>Much like a scholler, that his lesson reades</l>
   <l>Before his awfull master, trembling still</l>
   <l>Whether vnkind he said it well or ill.</l>
   <l>So like that pupill I the lists doe enter,</l>
   <l>More bold then wise to giue the perilous venter:</l>
   <l>And cannot tell what dangers may ensue,</l>
   <l>Did not I hope much honor lay in you.</l>
   <l>Not like that <hi>Fortunes</hi> brood, whose ayrie spirits</l>
   <l>Doe mount them <hi>Icarus</hi>-like aboue their merits,</l>
   <l>Where when their flight's at highest rise of all,</l>
   <l>The Sunne doth melt their wings, and then they fall:</l>
   <l>Or like <hi>Narcissus,</hi> who did fondly looke</l>
   <l>On his owne shadow in a crystall brooke,</l>
   <l>And doting on't, stept neerer to haue kist it,</l>
   <l>Where he fell in, and drown'd himselfe, yet mist it.</l>
   <l>Euen so this world which these faire streames behold,</l>
   <l>Build their attempts vpon such hopes too bold,</l>
   <l>Making the drossie substance of this earth,</l>
   <l>The greatest cause of honor and of birth:</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>Some louing honors so, buy them, to make them:</l>
   <l>Better contented they, that can forsake them,</l>
   <l>Yet our best natures faile in this and vse them,</l>
   <l>Hee's a rare man that proffer'd, can refuse them.</l>
   <l>But you great Lord descended of a race,</l>
   <l>Which vertue merit, and desart doth grace,</l>
   <l>Made great by birth and honor, not by chance,</l>
   <l>As <hi>Fortune's</hi> wont her followers to aduance,</l>
   <l>Can better tell these things then I can name them,</l>
   <l>And learne, such vaine affections, how to tame them:</l>
   <l>Whereby your Predecessors got more grace,</l>
   <l>And more renowne, then time can ere deface:</l>
   <l>Combining to your noble house that fame</l>
   <l>Which liues in you vnblemisht, farre from blame.</l>
   <l>And though that I, great Lord, doe write of that,</l>
   <l>Which Fame, the world, and time haue wondered at,</l>
   <l>And by aduenturing, wrong my shallow wit,</l>
   <l>In ayming at the marke I cannot hit.</l>
   <l>Yet let some gratious censure from your honor</l>
   <l>Fall on my pen, which tooke too much vpon her,</l>
   <l>Since from that streame and fountaine you doe spring,</l>
   <l>As this most noble lady did, I sing:</l>
   <l>Her worth impeach't, yours must eclypsed bee,</l>
   <l>Which in all things with hers doth co-agree.</l>
   <l>Though my plaine dutie, all too meane, prefers,</l>
   <l>Yet reade great Lord not for my sake, but hers,</l>
   <l>Which was a light to those, that farre succeeds</l>
   <l>For vertuous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> and honorable deeds:</l>
   <l>Who drawes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> such; how much more then</l>
   <l>Need they, of vertue store to equall them,</l>
   <l>When springing honor in such tender yeares</l>
   <l>Vnto the world, so fresh and greene appeares.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="5"/>What shall we thinke of after comming time,</l>
   <l>But that your glory more and more will shine;</l>
   <l>Where that bright starre, within your brest begunne,</l>
   <l>May quickly rise to be a glorious Sunne:</l>
   <l>And in the highest Spheare of golden fame,</l>
   <l>Rides heauens large circuite with your noble name,</l>
   <l>So thriue still, honor flourish euer faire,</l>
   <l>Let no clouds rise, such glory to impaire,</l>
   <l>Nor your proceedings any whit dismay,</l>
   <l>T'eclypse the beautie of so faire a day;</l>
   <l>But that your glasse at eu'nings watch match may run</l>
   <l>As faire and cleare, as when it first begun.</l>
   <l>Then noble Lord my humble duety spare,</l>
   <l>What wants in me, your Honor may repaire,</l>
   <l>And mend those ruinous breaches, which my quill</l>
   <l>Hath fall'n into, for want of better skill:</l>
   <l>And I as bound to this, shall tune my song,</l>
   <l>Pray heauens true honor may continue long.</l>
   <l>Thus not presuming, what may be amisse,</l>
   <l>I pardon craue, and make an end with this.</l>
