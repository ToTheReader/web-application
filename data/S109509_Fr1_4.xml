   <p>AFter it was proclaimed abroad, that <hi>(vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Bel-man of London,)</hi> new forces were (once more, to bee leauied against certaine Wilde and Barbarous Rebells, that were vp in open armes against the Tranquilitie of the <hi>Weale publique:</hi> It cannot bee tolde, what numbers of voluntaries offred themselues dayly to fight against so common, so bolde, so strange, and so dangerous an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. <hi>Light Horse-men</hi> came in hourely, with discouerie where these <hi>Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ineeres</hi> lay intrenched: deliuering (in briefe notes of intelligence) who were their Leaders, how they went <hi>Armed,</hi> and that they serued both on Horse &amp; Foot: only their <hi>Strengthes</hi> could not hee discryed, because their <hi>Numbers</hi> were held infinite. Yet instructions were written and sent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie minute by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se that were Fauourers of Goodnesse shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Militarie Disciplines the foe vsed in his <hi>Battailes,</hi> and what <hi>Forts</hi> (if hee were put at any time to flight) he wold retire to; vvhat stratagems hee would practize, and where he did determine to lye in <hi>Ambuscado.</hi> They that could not serue in person in <hi>This Noble quarrell,</hi> sent their <hi>Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Forces, well armed with Counsell. So that the <hi>Bel-man</hi> (contrarie to his owne hopes,) seeing himselfe so strongly and strangely seconded by friends doth now brauely aduance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in maine battalion. The day of encounter is appointed to be in this <hi>Michaelmas Tearme.</hi> The place, <hi>Paules-Churh-yard, Fleetestreet,</hi> and other parts of the Ciitie. But before they ioyne, let me giue you note of one thing, and that is this.</p>
   <p>There is an <hi>Vsurper,</hi> that of lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> hath taken vppon him the name of the <hi>Bel-man,</hi> but being not able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="5"/>
that Title, hee doth now call himselfe the <hi>Bel-mans</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his ambition is (rather out of vaine glorie then the true courage of an Experienced Soldier) to haue the leading of the <hi>Van,</hi> but it shall be honor good enough for him (if not too good) to tome vp with the <hi>Rere.</hi> You shall know him by his Habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for (by the furniture he weares) hee will bee taken for a Beadle of <hi>Bridewell.</hi> It is thought he is rather a Newter than a friend to the cause: and therefore the <hi>Bel-man</hi> dooth heere openly protest that he comes into the field as no fellowe in armes with Him.</p>
   <p>Howsoeuer it be strucke, or whosoeuer giues the first blow, the victorie depends vpon the vallor of you that are the Winges to the <hi>Bels-mans army,</hi> for which conquest he is in hope you will valiantly fight sithence the quarrel is against the head of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous abus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>, and the blowes which you must giue are in defence of <hi>Law, Iustice, Order, Ceremony, Religion, Peace,</hi> and that honorable title of Goodnesse.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Saint</hi> George! <hi>I see the two</hi> Armies <hi>mooue forward: and beholde, the</hi> Bel-man <hi>himselfe first chargeth vppon the face of the Enemy. Thus:</hi>
