   <p>BY the iudgement of the best and learnedst Philosophers, as also by some apparant proofe in our owne selues, wee finde, that our affection or desire after any thing, is a quality pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per &amp; peculier to the soule: for from it onely are our affections deriued, and thereby are we led to the prosecution of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we can most couet. Now, all our longings and desirous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, are not euermore for the best, albeit in our fraile iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it may carry a wel seeming likelyhoode: but too often we
<pb facs="7"/>
finde it by wofull experience▪ that we haue no greater enemies then our owne affections, nor fall into heauier daungers, then those we are led to by our owne wilfull follies.</p>
   <p>To runne into particularities of our seuerall appetencies, as some after honour, others after riches, others after temporarie glory or applause, and others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vaine &amp; friuolous pleasures: would require a larger discourse then this whereto I am limitted, and I should but follow the olde track of custome, which almost is handled in euery tractate. Yet we find the nice natures of some to be so scrupulous, that when the liuer-veine of theyr corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted opinions is but toucht a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb facs="7"/>
not launced or let blood for the better safety of their health: they fall into such extraordinarie fits, or rather frenzies, that no men are more condemned, then they that can soonest cure them, nor worse entreated, then such as best loue them.</p>
   <p>And what is the maine impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in those teachie humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists, but only a mighty assurance and ouer-weening of their own knowledge, and skilfull reach in all thinges whatsouer? whereas if theyr capacity of knowledge were brought to the true touch indeede, it would euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that they know nothing at all, at least not what they ought to know, and would best of all become them to haue knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="8"/>
of. The ambitious man pretends to know what honour &amp; height of dignity is; yet findes his knowledge to be meere ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, vvhen the miserable downfall from his expectation, teacheth him (too late) that a meane estate had beene much better.</p>
   <p>The greedy scraping money-monger perswades himselfe, that his knowledge in managing of worldly commodities, and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering for best aduantage by bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayning, is as much as is needfull and necessarie for him to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withall, and that, that is the onely reall substance of knowledge indeede: but when he finds by som crosse &amp; change of the world, as either losse at Sea
<pb facs="8"/>
abroade, rapine of theeues at home, or some other casualtie (vvhereof there vvanteth no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance) that this vvorldlie knowledge is indeede but wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse folly, then hee can cry out with the Philosopher, that hee had much witte, but no knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
   <p>The like might be said of the proude, enuious, wanton, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, &amp;c. all of them coueting no other kinde of knowledge, but what best fitteth &amp; agreeth with their sensuall appetites; to whom I aunswer with that learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saint Ambrose; <hi>That it had beene much better for them not to haue knowne at all, except they had attayned to true knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>
      <hi>Seneca</hi> tells vs, that the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Glasse was first made &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, for a man to come to the easier knovvledge of himselfe thereby. Nowe albeit we may gather somwhat concerning our selues, when we view our faces, proportion and the bodies linia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therein: yet <hi>Socrates</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to a greater matter, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied this beholding of our selues in a Glasse, to an euident enstruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life and good behauiour. For, he would very often aduise his Schollers and follovvers, to make a continuall vse of looking themselues in a glasse, to the end, that he who perceaued his shape to be comly and well beautified, might thereby learne to shunne all turpitude in manners, which
<pb facs="9"/>
would much deforme and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish so goodly an appearance. Moreouer, hee gaue them this further admonition, that vvhen any one did discern by the glasse, some want eyther of apt forme or comlines in himselfe, or any other impediment vvhich hee thought to be defectiue: that his labour and care should be the more industriously applyed, to recompence the lack of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wants and imperfections, with the mindes inward vertues &amp; more splendant graces. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, if the outward shape appeared Angell-like &amp; goodly: to make the inward part thereto as beautifull in resemblance, by auoyding all occasions that may deforme it.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="10"/>Vpon consideration (gentle Reader) of that which hath been before alleaged, happening so vvell on this excellent Treatise, vvritten in French by <hi>Monsieur du Plessis,</hi> an honorable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Kings Counsell, and gouernour of his Crovvne and Kingdome of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>The true knowledge of a mans owne selfe,</hi> and therfore may the more aptly be compared to a Glasse, that guides a man to the knowledge of himself: I was the more desirous to bestow transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on it, that it might passe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade to generall benefit.</p>
   <p>And so much the rather was I thereto induced, because this Glasse hath a vvonderous diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the other, which but
<pb facs="10"/>
deliuer our outward shape and semblance onely; For this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers the inward parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, from the very houre of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, to the latest minute of life, vvith the manner of nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, encreasing and grovving to perfection, and how the body naturally liueth by his power &amp; organes, with euery sence, nerue and faculty thereto belonging; likewise how the soule hath her being in the body, approouing the dignitie and immortalitie thereof.</p>
   <p>My humble sute to thee, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall of my labour, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable benefitte thou mayst gaine heereby: is, that thou wouldst reade it with reuerence and discretion, as a woorke not
<pb facs="11"/>
meete for euery immodest iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let thy reuerence be to God, who hath so miraculously wrought for thee, and bestowed so many blessings on thee in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Let thy discretion guide thee step by step, to a true and perfect knovvledge of thy selfe, by shunning those corruptions and vices that blemish &amp; vvrong Nature, and embracing those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent prescriptions heerein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, to preserue thee in a most tranquile &amp; happy condition.</p>
   <p>Last of all, for him that first in French vvrote it, and my selfe that haue made it apt for thee in English: we will refer our selues together to thine ovvne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, beeing loath to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue so vnkindlie of thee, as for
<pb facs="11"/>
a good turne to looke for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then kindnes at the least, which if thou canst affoord vs, it is all we desire, and in trueth no lesse then wee haue well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
