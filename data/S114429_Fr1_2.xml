   <p>GOd which hath put the <hi>Globe</hi> of this <hi>little</hi> world into the hands of your rule, doth in the bottomlesse <hi>graces</hi> wherewith he hath imbrodered your <hi>Scepter,</hi> merite your thankefulest <hi>recognition</hi> of his diuine goodnesse, in whose bosome their <hi>Spring</hi> ariseth, and oblige the Christian Nations of your <hi>Kingdomes</hi> in straightest bonds of <hi>loyaltie</hi> vnto your <hi>Sacred Person,</hi> the next and immediate <hi>Conduit</hi> by which all happinesse is deriued vnto them.</p>
   <p>Your <hi>Highnesse</hi> religious affections to the seruice of God, experienced in those effects of your royall desires with best offices to glorifie his eminent and eternall being,
<pb facs="3"/> hath a most sure promise of blessings from the immortall rewarder of holy workes. And for so much as your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie</hi> in your admirable wisdome studying by all meanes to continuate the tranquill peace of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> hath seene it necessarie to propose, and by intimation of your <hi>gratious</hi> pleasure inioyned one <hi>vniforme</hi> order of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship due to Gods diuine excellencie. The Subiects of your <hi>Dominions</hi> whose toungs are the true witnesses of their hearts, to acknowledge that <hi>supreame Power</hi> which is in existent in your princely rule, will not faile by their cheerefull obedience the <hi>true workemaister</hi> of happy <hi>State,</hi> to manifest their religion to God, and submission to your iust <hi>commaund!</hi>
   </p>
   <p>If any through a wanton <hi>Superfluitie</hi> of fancie, shall disaccustome their deuotiue actions from the traine wherevnto your Lawes would range them: <hi>God</hi> shall in time reueale better things vnto their apprehension, and by their industrie, whom your Maiestie hath deputed for the administration of <hi>gouerment,</hi> frame them to that <hi>method</hi> of deuotion which in the <hi>Prerogatiue</hi> of your wisdome is prescribed vnto all.</p>
   <p>In meane time, I know he which shall oppose himselfe against this euill, now growne headdie by custome and suffrance of time, lyes open for the racket of mallice to band him into the hazard of vndoing, the thoughts whereof se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with the knowledge of my owne disabilitie, to write in a matter of so great <hi>consequence,</hi> had kept me resolute in my resolued silence, but that my priuate cons<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, and sorrowe to see this vnnaturall distraction, wherein the body doth refuse to follow the will of the head, counterpoized the <hi>validitie</hi> of all other opposite
<pb facs="3"/> respects, and gaue confidence in your Maiestie for my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, who hauing nothing better then my selfe to bestow vpon your Maiestie, do with best <hi>alacrity</hi> of spirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uote and giue my all, to be disponed at your <hi>Princely</hi> pleasure.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>God</hi> which ballanceth the times, prolong the time of your most glorious Regiment, and so strengthen your <hi>sacred power</hi> in the continuance of that vnmatchable goodnesse, wherewith he hath honoured all your liues time, that when the time of times shall come, wherein time shall be without time, you may be receiued into his timelesse eternitie.</p>
