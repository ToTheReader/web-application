      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE cause of all Quarrell is Iniurie and reproach, but the matter of content, is Iustice and Honor. For loue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we shun no care of minde, losse of wealth, nor aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of life. Hereof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth all disputation in Schooles, pleading in lawe, warre, and all worldlie wrangling. For who so is either in deede or opinion, perswaded to haue truth and reason on his side, doth not onlie constantlie beleeue that so it is, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof denied, holdeth himselfe iniured, and consequently burthened. True it is, that the Christian lawe willeth men to be of so perfect patience, as not onlie to indure iniurious words, but also quietlie to suffer euerie force and violence. Notwithstanding, forsomuch as none (or verie fewe men) haue attained such perfection, the lawes of all Nations, for auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding further inconueniences, and the manifestation of truth, haue (among many other trials) permitted, that such questions as could not bee ciuilie prooued by confession, witnesse, or other circumstances, should receiue iudgement by fight and Combat, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that GOD (who onelie knoweth the secret
<pb facs="5"/>
thoughts of all men) would giue victorie to him that iustlie aduentured his life, for truth, Honor, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
   <p>Seeing then that al humaine lawes haue permitted the triall of Armes, and that euerie iniurious action not repulsed, is by common consent of all Martiall mindes holden a thing dishonorable, infamous, and reproachfull; it cannot be, but at some times and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions such questions and quarrels shall arise, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarilie must receiue triall by the Sword. And <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, that hee who repulseth not an iniurie, being able, offendeth no lesse, than if he had abandoned his friends, parents and countrie. By these reasons appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the triall by Armes is not onlie naturall, but also necessarie and allowable. Notwithstanding, for that the vulgar sort (and many right noble also) be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what are the true causes requiring triall of Armes, and what words or deedes are of such quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as ought bee repulsed or reuenged; I haue at the earnest requests and often desires of verie honorable friends (by way of abreuiation) reduced into this small volume, all causes of Quarrell or Combat, the nature of Iniuries and repulses, the equalitie and dise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie of men, who may bee challenged, and for what respects Challenges ought bee refused: with many other things in matter of Honor and Armes worthie to be knowne and considered.</p>
   <p>And albeit I am not ignorant that publique Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats are in this age either rarelie or neuer graunted; yet for that (as is before said) no prouidence can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the questions and quarrels that daylie happen among Gentlemen and others professing Armes, it
<pb facs="5"/>
shall not be amisse, but rather behouefull that all men should be fullie informed what iniurie is, and how to repulse it, when to fight, when to rest satisfied, what is Honor and good reputation, how it is gained, and by what meanes the same is kept &amp; preserued; which was the respect that the Earle <hi>Balthazar Castilio</hi> in his booke of the Courtier, doth among other qualities requireable in a gentleman, specially aduise he should bee skilfull in the knowing of Honor, and causes of quarrell. This booke doth not incite men to vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised fight, or needles reuenge (as some simple wit may surmize) but enformeth the true meanes how to shunne all offences: or being offended, sheweth the order of reuenge and repulse, according vnto Christian knowledge and due respect of Honor.</p>
   <p>And for that the dignitie of Knighthood apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth chieflie to Martiall merite, I haue thought fit brieflie to touch the original thereof: declaring how many Orders or degrees of Knights were in times past, and of them, how many yet extant.</p>
   <p>We haue not in this worke medled with Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or blazing of Badges; but chieflie touched mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters offenciue to reputation and Honor, whereof Combat or particular triall of Armes ought to ensue. If ought els is looked for, it may bee taken from the learned. <hi>Tractant Fabrilia fabri.</hi>
