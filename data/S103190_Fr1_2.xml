      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome that have conceiv'd better of this then I can at the hearing (though it received little advantage by my delivery) thought it worthy to be published, to which when I was perswaded, I did not much study to whom I should dedicate it. For to whom should I present my service in this kind, but to her, who of all others hath given so many notable examples of religion, and so
<pb facs="3"/>much cherisht the professors of it, and my selfe amongst the rest. Religion and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in these latter dayes never found a greater Patronesse. You have beene the good Angell that when the waters were troubled have helpt the distressed into the poole.
<note place="margin">Iohn 5.2.</note> The grapes in Babell sent upon a time to the Vine leaves in Iudaea desiring their shadow, least they were parcht with the heate:
<note place="margin">Talmud Cholm. 62.1</note> Our succorlesse clusters need not send so farre for protection, did your branches spread (under which the beasts of the field,
<note place="margin">Dan. 4.12.</note> and the foules of heaven had their habitations) as heeretofore when the great Duke (my gratious Master for a moment) your illustrious brother lived.
<note place="margin">During the intended expedition to Rochell.</note> were your power as great as then, or as your disposition is good, my hopes would live though his excellency and my noble Lord of Anglesey, (whom I shall ever name with honour and sorrow) are dead. And I make no question but that J should only finde an exchange, not a losse, and at last
<pb facs="3"/>a happy successe of those many gratious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, from his sacred Majestie (whom God preserve) for which I shall ever thinke my selfe bound to thanke your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and your noble kinseman Master <hi>Porter.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>How can I conceive otherwise since your Honour lately without request free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and voluntarily offered me preferment of your owne, untill you could procure mee better. I presume you desire not to have this publisht,
