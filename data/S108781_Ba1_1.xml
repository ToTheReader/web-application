   <head>The Aucthour to his booke.</head>
   <l>SIth Virgill loftie vaine in verse, sith learned Homers Quill,</l>
   <l>Sith Plutarch and Pithagoras, did practice oft their skill:</l>
   <l>To write of fightyng frogges, in fild of wandering bees and flice,</l>
   <l>To extoll the reedes and rushes long, with solemne muse aduice.</l>
   <l>Though skilfull thei with learned muse, in thinges so small to flowe,</l>
   <l>Yet willing I my faithfull hart to natiue zoill to showe:</l>
   <l>For who in Athens idle were, by Dracos lawe should die,</l>
   <l>As in Hetruria idle heads, by lawe were forcde to flie.</l>
   <l>VVhose ground in Rome was baren found, was put in prison faste,</l>
   <l>And kyng of Aegypt toke accompt, of daily labour past:</l>
   <l>The Spartan youth that waxed grosse by lawe should fast it out,</l>
   <l>And loitring Indians went vndinde, from place to place about.</l>
   <l>Ech labour well deserueth hire, that Idlenes doth flee,</l>
   <l>Ech vertue must haue due reward, ech vice must punished be:</l>
   <l>For rather had I venture fame, Chirilus stripes to haue,</l>
   <l>Then still with Vatia idle be, ech filthy lust to laue.</l>
   <l>Saill then by raging Scillas rockes, passe by Ciclops denne,</l>
   <l>On through Lotophagos tent full bould, feare not Auernus fene,</l>
   <l>Trudge fast from flattryng Cirens face, make haste from Cirses sight,</l>
   <l>Pearce Limbo through, possesse the place where iustice iudgeth right.</l>
   <l>Mauger of Maegera head, in spit of furies go,</l>
   <l>Through Stigia streame and flaming fluds to frēd thy self to show</l>
   <l>VVaie not Momus nor his mates, exteme not Zoilus talke,</l>
   <l>Voide fond Suffenus busie brain, with wise Minerua walke.</l>
   <l>The Scithian rude had rather here, a horse to ney or kike,</l>
   <l>Then solem sound of Orpheus Harpe, with skilfull stroke to strike</l>
   <l>The Arcadian blind with Midas will, preferre the pipe of Pan,</l>
   <l>Before Appollo sacred God, who iudge of musike can.</l>
   <l>Hadst thou Briareus hundred hands, or hundred Argos eies,</l>
   <l>Suppose thy sences slack to serue, ech reader to suffice:</l>
   <l>And as Vlixes mates were changde, to shiftyng shapes of hoggs,</l>
   <l>So like Actaeon thou shalt be, deuoured of some doggs.</l>
   <l>Some will finde in vearse thy fault, some will defame thy sence,</l>
   <l>Some thy stile and some thy state, will finde in thee offence:</l>
   <l>The learned loth I am to lose, of right their frendship craue,</l>
   <l>Sith thou and thei wer taught in place, true frendship seke to haue.</l>
   <l>
      <pb facs="227"/>A Crowe sometime in Rome was taught, to speake to Caesar so,</l>
   <l>Aue Caesar loude with voice, as Caesar by did go:</l>
   <l>An Aegle was in Seston toune, eche daie would neuer ceasse,</l>
   <l>But mount to skey in flight to slee, some foules his frend to please.</l>
   <l>The Pecock proude the swellyng Swan, the Feasaunt gaie the Cocke,</l>
   <l>Do brag and bost themselues so braue, and other birds do mocke:</l>
   <l>Though these like Gorgons grim with eies, thy trēbling face behold</l>
   <l>Yet tell that others see in theim, whiche they of thee haue toulde.</l>
   <l>No force saie thou if that may chaunce, Antimachus lot maie craue,</l>
   <l>In steede of sondrie diuers heads, one Plato frend to haue.</l>
