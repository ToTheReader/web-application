   <head>The Preface to the seconde Booke.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N value more, and in degrée of Nature higher: In Nobilitie aboue Stones and Mettals, are Plants, if thei had their iust repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiō &amp; were valued as they should be. But herein is corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued iudgement (I might call it abuse, but that this worde is not so fit and agreable in all poynts as that other:) and therfore it is true that the Poet Gualter saith: Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest that we being fastned and set vpon pleasures, do stray from the right rule of Reason, to satisfie oure mindes &amp; to nourish corrupt iudgement, we set most by that that is lesse worth: we most esteeme where lesse estimation should be, and haue a preposterous maner in iudging, and an awke wit in many things, their preferment. But this he spake (as it semeth) most of all moued with the Uulgar and cōmon sort. For the other kinde of men (whome Tullie calleth polished and wel addighted in all things) which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and stay themselues by wise &amp; prudent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he sawe (vnlesse they were I can not tell, howe by some euill meanes bewitched) to reckon and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme of all things as they were: And therefore he may seeme with al intent of mind fully bent to check and vpbraide the Multitude, and their basenesse in iudgement, whome the aforesaide Tullie trippeth eftsones, but especially in his Oratiō had for Cnei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Plancie, wheras he reckneth vp a heape of imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilities and wayes of halting in all office and duties, and first after this sort. In the cōmon sort (saith he) is no perfect knowledge or skill, to select or choose
<pb facs="35"/>
forth amongst many things what is heade and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall: there is no sound reason, there is no desart of hauing well, there is no industrie or diligence. And in his Oratiō for Quintus Roscius after this sort. Thus standeth it with the Cōmons. They esteeme many things by figure &amp; fantacie, but few veritably and vprightly. Further, the selfe same Author in his Offices holdeth him not Heroicall or Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, which leaneth or hangeth vpon them. Wherfore let vs go on, and giue them their naturall, pristmate, and iust place and order in degree: forasmuch as in the other abouesaide, in Mettals &amp; Stones, all is in their hid &amp; secret vertue, there making abode &amp; stay hereat: vnlesse peraduenture thou be moued wyth the goodly shew. Which with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Sunnes reflexions and light, moreouer the shimmering aire &amp; the Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall his purifying more or lesse, meeting all togither, one helpeth, coloureth &amp; setteth out another: &amp; thou being in loue with so goodly a shew, and brought to it by euill accustoming, giuest consent and so wonne dost becken at it, and wilt say that it is onely proper to the Mettall it selfe: but from y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> haue I brought thee, &amp; set thee in another beliefe: whereas I spake particularly of Golde, Siluer, and such like, if thou wilt but onely waye of what stock or houshold they be of. But to returne to our purpose. In Plantes there is not onelye occult and hid vertue: further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, fresh &amp; flourishing colours, wherewith I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thou wouldst be delighted: but there is in them that nature that cōmeth somwhat more neare (than those other doe) to the principall Creature man. For in them is the life vegetatiue or that life which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth, augmenteth &amp; bringeth forth his like, more apparant also, and in sight more than those other be, which lie shut vp in the earth as dead bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life, and haue their maner of encrease or decrease therein, as all other things incensible haue, and are said to quicken or die but vnproperly: In the Plant
<pb n="26" facs="35"/>
it is spoken on that wise properly &amp; after such sort, as mankind first next after his conception is saide to quicken and continue withall in reaching by meane of naturall order to his last kinde, vnperfect at the first, by this meane of vnperfection, in the which he lyeth and stayeth in after, his conception. 70. dayes, and so long is he plantlike: then the rest of time hath he in part and parcell like, so disposed and ordred of Nature to lay holde on, and to apprehende the other life aboue this, called sensitiue, in the which time so bespent▪ he seemeth of no greater accoumpt or force than other bruite beastes be, whose propertie is (as brute beastes is also the like) to feele griefe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to moue, to haue sense, and that newly, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne by Orgaine or Instrument diuersly framed. And then euen then it becommeth to haue an appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to that which it holdeth good and pleasant, and a recesse or lothsomnesse to y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which maketh against it. All this at that time, (euen as bruite beasts haue) hath man in that not yet finished, &amp; vnperfect shape or forme. But the other greater and that which is his owne, being once perfect, as to perceyue &amp; iudge by sense both inward and outward, to stande in fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie, and to marke and obserue all ill deserts (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at also brute beastes stay at:) but to leaue these, and to proceede further, to be mindfull of, &amp; to haue in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance or recorde things past, to conferre and applie them with the present time, or adiudge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by what is in the time cōming: to vnderstand, to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the thought in way easie to be vnderstoode: this diuine power (that I may so say) hath man onely, &amp; that man principally &amp; aboue others that is a man in deede, and not by appellatiō or name, withal those other powers that be in the other two kinds aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide: but so proportionably wrought; &amp; in such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner sorted and placed, as the thirde number is ouer the first &amp; second, holding and contayning them both in his number and accoumpt, but of neyther of them
<pb facs="36"/>
reckeneth againe in making their accoumpt. The Plant therefore is of the Philosophers reckned in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> number of those na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ures, that hath life: for in them as Aristotle sayth, is a portion of life, euen as in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage and brute beastes, sauing that in these last their maner of life by way of mouing from place to place, by gredie desire to feede and repast themselues, it is more manifest: in those other by reason of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode and continuance all in one place (as setled hard to the earth, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>oote and moysture) and by their more hid receit of necessaries such as maintain them being also close and occult, haue giuen great causes of doubting. Anaxagoras being moued (I know not wherewith) affirmed that there was not onely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in them to tarie and continue in their state, but also that they had and felt both sorrow and pleasure: and his reason he gathered of the distillation of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in the Plant his Leaues, and of the Leaues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. Plato saith that they be moued and led by appetite for the necessitie of their prouision in nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing. But both of these Aristotle in his first booke de Plantis, refelleth and reproueth by argument: wherevpon we entende not to stande. Yet may it be doubted for asmuch as with Theophrast and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, rather yea, than nay is aunswered. And they bid vs looke in eche their appearance. Doth not the Cucumber hate the Oliue, and where the one is, the other through a certaine malice prospereth not? Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariewise, doth not the Uine loue and embrace the Elme, &amp; prospereth the better, the nigher one is set by another? And as of these question is had, so may there also doubtes be made of the other. But let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man iudge of these as they list. I had rather be still then haue a doe herein. Nowe to their partes and maner of diuision.</p>
   <p>Plants be sorted and deuided into three parts: the first is the Herbe: the seconde the Shrub: the third the Tres: there are which haue added hither
<pb n="27" facs="36"/>
a fourth kind which they cal Suffutrex a mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the Herbe and the shrub: but it may better ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the one or of the other of these two be called as they are called being greater or lesse, thā to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der so farre for so small aduantage in them by way of amplifying diuision.</p>
   <p>The Herbe is that sayth Theophrast in his first boke De Plantis and fift Chapter which springeth out of his roote well leaued without any body, and beareth seede vpon his stalke or stemme as al herbs do, which are vsed to the Pot. The Shrub is that saieth he, which out of the roote commeth vp in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold stocke or bodie and shouteth out armes in his meane kinde of growth, as the Brome and Brier. The tree is that saieth he, that from out of the roote ariseth in one onely stock or bodie, and groweth vp in manie kinds to great height: beside this it is full of boughes, it is full of knots: besides this it is full of slips and shootes as the Oliue, the Figge tree, the Uine. That other which they call Suffutrex and make it the fourth parte hath a certaine thinne and small stock: but such a one as excedeth not the thinne and small stalk of the herbe: as the Rose and such like. Therevpon we may easily perceiue that all these kindes aboue saide in that, that they liue through the life Uegetatiue and haue their place of growth in the earth, and in that, that they all liue by heate and humor whereof the first (as that which is not much spoken of) seemeth of some to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in them: further in their leafe and braunches: and other outward dispositions herein they all agree and are alike. But herein they are saide to differ (as all things of sundrie sortes do) in these foure points: Whereof the chiefe and principall is their strength or vertue. The second their smell, which to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned teacheth their contemperature: for the odor and smell of ech thing doth much bewraie the thing. The thirde difference is fetched from their tast or sauor:
<pb facs="37"/>
as the one sweete, the other sower, the one plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt, the other of sharpe tast &amp; vnpleasaunt. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer as they haue those qualities which be proper and peculiar to the tast or want them. The fourth is (and that which is most infinite) of their figure and forme in leafe, of their owne figure, of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, of their flower, of their fruite, of their stock, which is as it were the prop or staie of the Plant: of the bark, which is the defence (and as I mought so say) their house to lodge in: and to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from storme and tempest: further in the roote, difference is found, and to haue one worde for all, in all their whole composition and mixture. It is to be maruelled how Dame Nature hath vpon the face of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> earth (as it were in hir Garden or Orchard of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light) for varietie sake so manifoldly varied &amp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> kindes of colours either simply died, &amp; stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: or else chaūgably almost in euery plant or thing growing. But the greatest meruaile that outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth (and that which y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> most cunning work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Painter may follow, but not attaine to) is in the excellent shew and infinite their kinde of flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers. Whereof some be Milke white, as the Lilie: some purple coloured as the Uiolet and Saffron flower: Some Scarlet red as the Aramanth: some Oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ie or yellow as the Mariegold: some grassie grene as the Primrose: some be speckled as y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiō, some cole black but those (as Authors affirme verie rare) in so much that the sadde blew coloured flower, as is Calcedome, hath bene taken of some for black, onely for their most like kinde of apparai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ing. So that a man maye see howe Nature worketh in many, as in these and sixe hundred more like, after simple sort without any intermedling: In as many and rather mo as chaungablie. Wherein if I trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and did so largely run at roia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> or lauished in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out their especialties, as Nature moste libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and abundantly hath bestowed hir labour and
<pb n="28" facs="37"/>
wrought in them: I had neede of long time &amp; grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter studie herein to followe such exact discourse, but that I meane not, neither doe I purpose it.</p>
   <p>Plants may moreouer (to stay and continue yet a little in their deuision) so be deuided, that some shal be saide to be of the Garden: some of the Field: some that like well by the Sea and flouds: some by the Sea bancks: other some there be that onely growe in Fennes: some vpon rockes and stonie walles: some in the sands, and there are which are seene to grow in Wels as Liuerwort. Againe some be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, other some barren: some bearing braunches and leaues: some w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>out al these: some of great growth: other of as small: some thicke and grosly set, as the Cyprusse: some as rarely and thinly disposed as the Beach: some full of knots as it were ioynted or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided as the Reede: some without any such partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but all ouer plaine: as Hemp. Some which spring vp and increase by seede sowing: othersome which arise vp of their own accord not known how: some most holesome: othersome most hurtfull. And to twine vp this threde of deuision vpon some bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome (for it were to long to vndoe the whole skaine) some seeme to haue both sexes and kindes: as the Oke, the Lawrell and such others: some without any such apperaunce but onely one in kinde, as the Palme and the like.</p>
   <p>The Plant therefore (for of that name we shall haue great vse) maye by Etimologie of worde so deriued, be so called, for that it is planted &amp; graft in the earth, fostered vp by his roote and by that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment that the roote taketh and feedeth on mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred and put to it by his Nourse the earth, and of such daily foode getteth euerie day greater increase. Plants haue such nourishment through the earth and their roote naturally within, and be in euerie their chiefe part and all about a like Organick that being engraft whilst they be greene and not to farre
<pb facs="38"/>
gone through drought in any stocke (onlesse it hath another maner of difference or almost a contrarieti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> in his qualitie then that others, and thereby not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailable) are able by secret force of Nature to take and resume againe like life and power, and do as wel in the last stocke as it did being a member or parte of the first &amp; naturall bodie. And here vpon it is that whereas through any imbecillitie or let espied and gathered either inwardly or outwardly in the tree, so that it is thereby hindred of his liking and doing well, men in time of yere vse to cut them off, such as are thought to prosper better in another place, and graffe them into a new stock: and being so cut off, are of a greater continuance (but by resemblaunce to shewe thee howe alike) than those small and siely Wormes be, who haue imperfection in their Nature as Waspes, Bees, Emites and such like, which by Latin worde are called Insecta that is, in part and member distinct and seuered, hauing for all this life proportionably and equally besprent throughout the whole bodie. In so much that these for a time after that they be cut or plucked into pieces in euerie their parte so seuered, shewe both life, sense and mouing: but in this point cōming behind them, for that being once so discerped can neuer after neither in applying their owne parts togither, neither yet in fastning or binding them to any body of any their like reuiue and quicken againe. But now let vs leaue this our straying abroad (which maner who so vseth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conuersation &amp; familiar talke is coumpted and reputed light and a talker: in stile and in endighting any thing a wanderer from the purpose) and come to our taske: y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> to which we before setled our selues to: herein requiring the Reader not to accuse vs lightly, and on a sodaine to check and reprehend vs as those which haue entered into y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> businesse which requireth long and exact discourse, and haue made a preface after that sort as though we would go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="29" facs="38"/>
to extricate and weede out what might be said at auenture of all things, not onely intending an Aegemonie which we onely promised and is but the chiefest part, but an vniuersal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ie which is y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whole. Unto whom I would that our sentence or meaning were well knowne: that therby they might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand (perceiuing also what a preface is) that I had not greatly squared, if I had pursued many moe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions, for what is there so farre of (so that it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the thing wherof we intend to speake) that may not be added the thing it selfe being once had in hand. But nowe as hastily as we can and as briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we can, we minde to bring in other Authors thereby keeping our selues free from blame in this Aegemonie or Sufferaigntie of things growing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> earth: not absolutly or throughly (which thing I woulde to God it were in our skill and wit (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I meane to giue the cause why: which was inough for Theophrast (as we reade written) who hath laboured all his life time, and that sore labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and hath not yet giuen and founde an absolute &amp; perfect end of such his knowledge, who although for his time he hath done well &amp; brought great light and vndid or made naked many things in that his kinde of studie and trauaile, yet hath he gone and passed by manie things without either eiesight set vpon them or meane of acquaintance had: partly for that the mother of all such greene things as grewe vpon the earth multiplieth euerie ech day with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and diuersitie of many kinds and playeth the prodigall his parte: and partly that although man mought by art and inquiraunce after these attaine or come vnto knowledge herein, yet the race of this life was so sodaine and short so often perilled and euery eche momēt at death his nod and beck, which things all summined and accoumpted, &amp; euery day the more he watched in these the more offer the had of them to be of his acquaintance, euen when as he was olde

and lay vpon his deathes bed, now readie to make a farewell of the bodie and soule, began to accuse Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Iniurie doing and offence, and fault in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialtie for that she had so dealt with the Harte and Hinde, the Crow &amp; night Rauen, in prolonging and giuing them so long life (which good gift on neyther ther partes was little or nothing considered) but to Mankind she had dealt so straightly, and no poynt according to equitie or right reason, in that that shee had giuen him such short terme of yeares, and not so short as vncertaine, and sodaine: wherein if she had dealt more equally and had bene mans friend (as she mought haue bene) it had come to passe that our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life had ben more profitable: science, or y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Arts liberall, (whereas nowe they be rawe) should haue bene much more absolute: perseuerance of euery thing his cause (now small) should then haue bene more amplified.
