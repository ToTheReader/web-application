      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
      </hi> Make no other Apologie for my selfe in respect of the Publication, and Dedication of the ensuing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, then that which <hi>Dauid</hi> made to his brother <hi>Eliab</hi> (who rashly iudged his forwardnesse in comming to the battle to proceed from the pride and naughtinesse of his heart) <hi>Is there not a cause?</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.29.</note> Might it haue dyed the common death of other Sermons, it had beene dead and buried out of sight, but loath I was that it should suffer a violent, and an ignominious death through the false ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, and ignorant censures of some ill affected spirits,
<pb facs="3"/>
and therefore I haue sought life for it, that it may liue to the world, and speake for it selfe.</p>
   <p>I present it to your Worship; <hi>Protection</hi> I desire not, if it be truth deliuered, it is Gods, and able to defend it selfe; if error, it were an insufferable wrong to abase so worthie a <hi>Patronage</hi> for the Defence of it; <hi>Acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> I craue; and this your wonted and natiue courtesie, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the great respect you beare to the meanest of our Tribe, assures me of.</p>
   <p>In which confident expectation I binde my selfe,</p>
