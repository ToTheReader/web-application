      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all manuall Arts vsed in this Land, none is more famous for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, or more beneficiall to the Common-wealth than is the most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Art of Clothing. And therefore as the benefite thereof is great, so are the professors of the same to be both loued and maintained. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wise men therefore, hauing deepely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the same, most bountifully haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed their gifts for vpholding of so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a commoditie, which hath been, and yet is, the nourishing of many thousands of poor people. Wherefore to you, most worthy Clothiers, do I dedicate this my rude worke, which hath raised out of the dust of Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
<pb facs="3"/>
a most famous and worthie man, whose name was <hi>Iohn Winchcombe,</hi> alias <hi>Iacke</hi> of <hi>Newberie,</hi> of whose life and loue I haue briefly written, and in a plaine and humble manner, that it may be the better vnderstood of those for whose sake I took pains to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile it, that is, for the well minded Clothiers; that heerein they may behold the great wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and credit which men of this trade haue in former time come vnto. If therefore it bee of you kindly accepted, I haue the end of my desire, and thinke my paines well recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: and finding your gentlenesse answering my hope, it shall moue mee shortly to set to your sight the long hidden History of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Redding, George</hi> of <hi>Glocester, Richard</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> with diuers others; who were all most notable members in the Common-wealth of this Land, and men of great fame and dignity. In the meane space, I commend you all to the most high God; who euer increase, in all perfection and prosperous estate, the long ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured trade of English-Clothiers.</p>
