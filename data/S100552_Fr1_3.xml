      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Courtier, and gentle Reader, hauing heere in a plaine manner, and direct method described certaine rules and precepts of a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Politicall life; I must craue thy friendly censure and courteous connivence, in that I haue not in this Treatise ouer curiously or nicely tied my selfe to the obseruation of logicall rules and prescriptions. Let him who slights mee, learne this one docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from mee, That it is the condition of truely generous and indici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>us men, not captiously to carpe and catch at the shaddow of words, but wisely to fasten on the substantiall matter it selfe. Now as touching the matter I doubt not, but that I haue so composed and compiled the same, as to
<pb facs="5"/> giue, if not plenary satisfaction, yet at least, sufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the expectation of euery indifferent Courtier, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the vnexperienced and newly initiatd thereinto. I purpose not heere to discourse of the infelicities or (as I may so tearme them) the <hi>Gay-greivances of a Courtiers life;</hi> Neither yet to write of the immunities and commodities of the contrarie to this, <hi>a priuate life:</hi> This I suppose hath beene done by others, as cunningly and skilfully as their wit could stretch vnto: who indeed seeme to haue made this the full scope and end of their studies: namely, contumeliously to disparage the renowme of Princes; and ignominiously to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh against and calumniate the liues of Courtiers. To which Fellowes (doubtlesse) if we should giue credit. Courtiers would a great deale rather follow the Cart than Court, and more desire to liue in base and ignoble Shepheards cottages, than in or about their Princes noble Palaces. But sie vpon the ridiculous speeches of such idle Idiots; Avant, such fond opinions of men so ignorant and meerely besotted: Whose iudgement if it were not most corrupt and vniustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we might quickly for all ciuill gouer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ment wholy dimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and the Courts of Kings disgracefully relinquished. This then we must both hold and know for a truth; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is especially advertised and intimated in this litle worke, that there is no estate or condition of life whatsoeuer, but hath in it, the thornes of many miseries and shackles of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carcerating encombrances. And if the credit of the most wise Philosopher may gaine any credit with vs, <hi>Nihil aliud in humanis rebus magnum, nisi animus magna despiciens.</hi> This his noble Sentence will declare vnto vs that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the whole world, that may iustly be termed Great, except the minde lightly regarding Great-things. Whither then thou be a Courtier, or a Country-man, 'tis neither this
<pb facs="5"/> nor that condition of life, which can make thee happy: but the minde well formed and informed by nature, and as it were watered with the diuine dew and grace of <hi>GODS</hi> gracious Spirit.</p>
   <p>In briefe (kinde Courtier and friendly Reader) <hi>Quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque Spartam fuerimus nacti &amp;c.</hi> Whatsoeuer estate or office we haue obtained, from the great Steward, or rather the suprcame Prince of heauen, let vs so carry our selues therein, that to the vtmost of our power, we may adorne and beautifie the same. But if we will needes be carping and biting at, those things which appertaine not to vs; let vs on Gods name hate mens vices but not their persons: Let vs not kicke against that politicall regiment and ordination, whose originall is from God himselfe. For, hereunto we are invited by the precepts and counsells of the grauest and most wise, especially of that Poet:</p>
   <q>Parcere Personis, dicere de vicijs;</q>
   <lg>
      <head>That is,</head>
      <l>'Tis wisedome, wisely, in these sinfull times</l>
      <l>Mens Persons not to harme, but charme their crimes.</l>
   </lg>
   <p>But to conclude in a word, for I desire to be briefe; I grant (indeed) that some Courtiers are too immoderately and ambitiously prone, to hunt after honour, preferment, rule and riches, and (which doe as it were naturally grow out of them) to pleasure and voluptuousnesse; and that they do more highly estimate these externall vnconstant and slippery things, than is consonant, or convenient either to time, place or persons: Yet notwithstanding it is no consequence that for some particular ill addicted and vicious Courtiers, the Court and Courtiers in generall who officiate good and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<pb facs="6"/> services to their Prince, should be vtterly condemned, or that such infamous aspersions should be so generally cast vpon them all.</p>
   <p>The opinion therefore, of <hi>Lucan</hi> we vtterly dislike and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
      <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈…〉</desc>
      </gap>e as must absurd:</p>
   <lg>
      <head>Exeat Aulâ</head>
      <l>Qui volet esse pius; virtus &amp; summa potestas</l>
      <l>Non coëunt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
      </l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Depart from Court, if thou wilt pious be</l>
      <l>Goodnesse and Greatnesse will not, there, agree.</l>
   </lg>
   <p>It is a flash, a gow-gaw, a meere fervolous trifle; vnlesse we haue respect onely to those Monsters of men, <hi>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Iulian</hi> the Apostata, <hi>Phocas,</hi> and such like fire-brands of fury, and Patrons of impietie; Never casting our eies vpon, nor rightly recogitating the most noble and renowned actions of those truely pious and prudent Courtiers, the most profitable and comfortable organs and instruments both of Church and Common-wealth; in the number of whom I may first ranke, the most pious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who at Court became the Prince and prime of all his Brethren, the Establisher of his people, yea the very Basis, and (vnder God) the <hi>Atlas</hi> of his Nation; to whom I adde <hi>Moses, Abdias, Dauid, Daniel</hi> and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docai,</hi> who with great prudence and providence hauing, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through and vanquished the various stormes and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardous casualties, of the turbulent sea (as I may so say) of the Court; haue euen therein most gloriously atcheiued the eminent and euer-permanent renowme and excellencie of vertue; wit, dignitie and perfect piety, yea and haue showne
<pb facs="6"/> themselues the maine props and pillers of the Church of God, and their Weale-publike. And doubtlesse (indicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) vnlesse we wholy delight in ancient, forraine, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetcht examples, and doe vilipend or reiect new and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke patterns hereof. May we not most apparantly behold and perspicuously perceiue a liuely, reall and royall patterne of maiestie, grace, wisedome, learning, mercy, iustice, pittie, and piety, in that most renowned Courtier, our most sacred Soveraigne King <hi>IAMES?</hi> Yes doubtlesse. And none, I dare confidently a vouch, except he be a periur'd enemie to all truth and equitie, will, or can if he would, deny this truth. Let <hi>Lucan</hi> then, in this respect, with all his lunaticke Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions go shake their eares; who so vniustly iudge, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely doe teach, those things to be so reluctuously repugnant, which here we see are so harmoniously consonant. But be it as twill be, heer's my determinate resolution and firme conclusion:</p>
   <lg>
      <l>Ire, redire, sequi Regum sublimia tecta▪</l>
      <l>Eximius status est—</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The noblest state of life vnder the sunne</l>
      <l>Is, for my King, to liue, to ride, to runne.</l>
   </lg>
   <p>And this, to thee alone (ingenuous Courtier) doe I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire: Vntill thou shalt be translated from this transitory and momentany Court, into that celestiall Palace eternally blessed and blissefull, without all sighes and sorrowes, toile and turmoile, euen the mansions of the heauenly <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And this Christ Iesus grant, who sits at the eternall ternall sterne of his heauenly kingdome; vnder whose banner all Christians whether Kings or Subiects, Courtiers or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, do all fight, are all Conquerors, are all crowned.</p>
