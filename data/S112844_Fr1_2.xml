      <salute>MOST GRACIOUS AND DREAD SOVERAIGNE,</salute>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y a Missive, from a <hi>Papist</hi> I am sure, and J suppose from a <hi>Priest,</hi> I was not long since forced upon the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of these times, betweene the <hi>Protestant</hi> and <hi>Romish</hi> Confessionists. And because it hath bin ever truly counted
<pb facs="3"/>
a readier way for the advancement of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, rather to lessen and abate, than to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the number of many needless contentions in the Church: therefore when I first under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke to answer that very worthless Author, <hi>The GAGGER of all Protestants mouthes for ever,</hi> I did it with a firmed purpose to leave all Private Opinions, and Particular Positions or Oppositions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, unto their owne Authors or Abbet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, eyther to stand or fall of themselves; and not to suffer the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to be charged with the maintenance of any Doctrine which was none of Her own, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickely and universally resolved on. For we are at a great disadvantage with our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, to have those <hi>Tenents</hi> put and pressed evermore upon us, for the Generall Doctrine established in our <hi>Church,</hi> which are but eyther the Problematic all Opinions
<pb facs="3"/>
of <hi>Private Doctors,</hi> to be held or not held eyther way; or else the Fancies many of them of <hi>Factious men,</hi> disclaimed and censured by the <hi>Church,</hi> not to be held any way, Such disadvantages hath <hi>This Church</hi> too long endured: and out of just indignation against this <hi>Gagger</hi> and his Fellowes, I could not but so much the more labour to vindicate Her Freedom <hi>ex pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesso,</hi> and to assert Her (as far as I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) unto Her owne proper, true, and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Tenents,</hi> such as be without any doubt or question, legitimate and genuine, such as Shee will both acknowledge and maintain for her owne. My direct dealing herein, <hi>MOST DREAD SOVERAIGNE,</hi> so reasonable, so necessary (as I supposed) hath very much and highly discontented some <hi>Private Divines,</hi> who desire to have those Opinions, which are controverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb facs="4"/>
ourselves, to be taken and defended for the common and publicke Doctrine of the <hi>Church:</hi> but more especially hath it incensed those <hi>Classicall Puritans,</hi> who were wont to passe all their Strange Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, Sabbatarian Paradoxes, and Apocalypticall Frensies, under the Name and Covert of <hi>The True Professors of Protestant Doctrine;</hi> supposing, as it should seeme, that in this case we were all lyable to the <hi>Statute,</hi> that is, bound to keepe and foster their Conceits as our owne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, because they have cast them upon Us and upon <hi>Our Church,</hi> like Bastards upon the Parish where they were borne, or Vagabonds on the Towne where they last dwelt, or were suffered to passe without due correction. Such Irchins it was necessary to disband, and send them away to shift for themselves, that our Mother the <hi>Church</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
might no more be troubled with them. And yet for this cause have some <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> Articled against me, and traduced me to the World for a <hi>Papist</hi> and an <hi>Arminian;</hi> though the world and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves know, I flatly defied and opposed the One; and <hi>GOD</hi> in Heaven knoweth that I never so much as yet read word in the other. It was my happiness, <hi>MOST GRATIOUS SOVERAIGNE,</hi> that so meane a Vassall as my poore selfe was sufficiently knowne to be nor So nor So, unto <hi>Him,</hi> who, if ever any of the Royall ranke, was indeed <hi>sicut Angelus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> to discerne, my late <hi>MOST SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRED LORD</hi> and <hi>MASTER</hi> of ever Blessed memory, unto whom that Information should have beene represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; by whom, in his most able and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall judgement, I had my <hi>Quietus est,</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/>
and Discharge. But in regard their Clamours were so impetuous, and Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations so divulged, it pleased <hi>HIS MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IESTY,</hi> out of that Goodnesse which was ever eminent in his most blessed dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, not only to grant me leave humbly to <hi>Appeale</hi> from my <hi>Defamers</hi> unto <hi>His most sacred Cognisance</hi> in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, and to represent my just Defence against their Slanders and false Surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses unto the world; but also to give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse order unto <hi>Doct. VVHITE</hi> the Reverend Deane of <hi>Carlile,</hi> for the authorising and publishing thereof, after it had beene duly read over and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by him, to containe nothing in it, but what was agreeable to the Doctrine and Discipline established in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whereof <hi>HIS MAIESTY</hi> was most tender. It was read, approved,
<pb facs="5"/>
and sent to the Presse accordingly. Since which time, it hath pleased the <hi>King of Kings</hi> to call Him unto Himselfe, and to Crowne Him with Glory and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in Heaven, before I could returne the Booke into His Royall hands. But blessed for ever be the <hi>LORD GOD</hi> of Heaven, that hath preserved <hi>YOUR MAIESTY,</hi> and set <hi>YOU</hi> upon His Throne as King in stead of <hi>HIM,</hi> to goe in and out before his People in his Place, and to execute Judgement in <hi>YOUR FATHER</hi>'s room. What was then intended unto <hi>HIM,</hi> according to his Owne most Gracious and Royall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect appointment, I humbly crave leave upon my bended knees, to present unto <hi>YOUR MOST EXCELLENT</hi> and <hi>SACRED SELF;</hi> And in all lowly wise I cast both It and my Selfe, and the
<pb facs="6"/>
best Service I shall be able to do in <hi>GODS Church,</hi> at <hi>YOUR MAIESTIES</hi> feet, desiring no longer to live than I shall be and continue a most conformable and true member of this <hi>Church,</hi> and</p>
