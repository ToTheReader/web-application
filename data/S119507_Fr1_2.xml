Besydes this the ceremonies are here iudged and sette forthe: and the hurte y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> is in them, is pyked oute / and what good is in thē, here it is shewed. Briefly religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and this our christen lyf are
<pb facs="6"/> here so tried that thou mayst per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue the deceyte clokede vnder them. Here I do wittingly passe ouer many thynges, lest I shuld make suche a prologue, where by some might fynde y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> defaulte, that hit were lenger then is the hole worke, for as moche as in this worke the hole narration is meruelous compendious, beyng deryued oute of the veray owne propre fountaynes, deducynge all thȳges by a very godly ordre of hystoryes, so freely, wysely, &amp; so plainly that the Author him selfe of this worke (who euer he be) may be accompted &amp; taken as another Brute, which did reskue &amp; delyuer the chrystyan lybertye beynge beseged roūde aboute by tyrannous lawes &amp; brought out of the ryght shape in to a certayn Iudaycal su{per}sticion &amp; bondage.
<pb facs="6"/> In the secōde parte of this boke (for all y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> afore rehersed thynges are in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> fyrste parte) the Author dothe shewe, what god is, &amp; his worde: that men myght come to the knowlege of thē bothe, what faythe is, &amp; what hope &amp; charyte are, whense we sholde seche &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre our helth &amp; saluacion, and in the mean season he putteth forth and sheweth merueilous goodly coūsayles, by whiche the chrystē relygeon maye be suckered and holpen, whiche is sore sycke and accombred with superstycyons. He vttreth &amp; setteth forth before vs y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> trouth, as it is, most sȳple &amp; playne / and therfore I thought it best, to vse in this my transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon semblable maner of oration and speche, &amp; not ony such which sholde set forth it selfe gayly to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> sale, with craft &amp; colours depely
