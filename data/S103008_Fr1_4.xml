   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRISTIAN</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I haue bin
persuaded to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
to your view
and charitable interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this handfull of flowers,
picked, sorted, and tyed vp
into a bundle, according to
my slender abilitie, both of
iudgement and inuention. I
haue presumed also to entitle
them <hi>SVPPLICATIONS of
Saints,</hi> induced thereunto
by three reasons. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are squared to the
practise of the two holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and the blessed Apostle,
<pb facs="6"/>
and Saint, <hi>Saint Paul.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
three of these praiers,
(which are indeed <hi>praestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiores,</hi>
far more eminent and
excellent then al the rest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from humane conceit)
were vsed and penned by the
late noble Queene of famous
memorie <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> and
may iustly challenge the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination,</hi>
as the remaines
of her Deuotion, who liuing
a Religious and Peerelesse
<hi>PRINCE,</hi> was truely <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted</hi>
(as the <hi>Wise-man</hi>
speaketh) <hi>among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Wisd. 5. 5.</note>
      <hi>and</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken from vs, <hi>hath her
portion among the Saints.</hi>
The third reason is, because
<pb facs="6"/>
I hope they may be the dayly
exercise of your selues, who
being called to the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Iesus Christ, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Gospell of God, and
hauing receiued the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life, haue also your
part in the Communion of
Saints.</p>
   <p>I haue not helde such a
course as happily other Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors
of the like Deuotions
haue done, and yet I hope you
will not condemne mee but
vpon good deliberation. I
confesse, they are not ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with discourse, for<note n="a" place="margin">Commone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri aut doce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri nostra lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutione non quaerit. August. de Mag. lib. 1.</note>
      <hi>God
desireth not to take admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or information from
our reports:</hi> neither are
<pb facs="7"/>
they interlaced with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
for the places of
Scripture which I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
before euery one, will
minister matter of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion:
neither haue I made
any of them very long<note n="b" place="margin">In mille versus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendunt Orationem suam, quasi apud Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum, multitudo sermonum opus sit. Chrisost. hom. demu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note>
      <hi>to
draw them into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
periods</hi> (as Chrysostom
saith) <hi>as if it were a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worke to multiply much
speech before GOD:</hi> But
I haue made them somewhat
briefe, ayming at that Rule
which our Lord and Sauiour
prescribed, saying: <hi>After
this maner pray ye.</hi> That is
(saith <hi>Chrysostome</hi> againe)
<note n="c" place="margin">Collecte voluit dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipulos O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sost. Orat. dom.</note>
      <hi>Hee appointed the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
to gather the Petitions
<pb facs="7"/>
of their prayers, into a short
summe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Wherefore if ye find them
worthy the name of prayers,
vse them: if otherwise, yet
take them as meane grounds
of Prayer and meditation, to
set your deuout thoughts a
worke: with this liberty, that
where I haue been defectiue,
I referre it to the iudicious
to supply: and where I haue
offered any thing vaine or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue,
I am content to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a godly Corrector. But
how euer it be, yet let me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
you <hi>not to waxe faint
or slacke in Prayer:</hi> for such
as haue learned of the Lord
Iesus (saith <hi>Saint Augustine)</hi>
      <pb facs="8"/>
true humilitie and meeknesse
of heart,<note n="d" place="margin">Plus cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tando &amp; orando pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fierunt, quam in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendo &amp; audiendo. Aug. Ep, 122.</note>
      <hi>receiue more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
by meditation and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
then in reading and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:</hi>
whereby ye may be sure,
the religious Father meant
not to traduce either the
preaching of the word, or the
reading of any thing that may
make a man wise vnto salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but enforced the more
reuerend respect, and more
frequent vse of this Ghostly
exercise, that as men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be <hi>Doers of the
Word,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 22.</note> so they should be <hi>see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of Grace</hi> to doe it by, &amp;
not <hi>Hearers onely,</hi> for so
saith the Apostle, they should
deceiue themselues. For when
<pb facs="8"/>
      <hi>Paul</hi> hath planted, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos</hi>
watered: when one
hath read a learned treatise,
and another hath heard a
fruitfull Sermon, they must
refer the rest to him that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the increase: and vnto
whom will he giue it? to him
that seeketh, vnto him that
knocketh, to him that asketh
humbly and deuoutly in his
prayer. Follow then his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
which sayeth,<note n="e" place="margin">Oratio as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendat, vt Gratia des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendat.</note>
      <hi>Put vp
your Prayers to him, that
hee may send downe his
grace to you.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Againe beloued, all is not
peace, if yee consider of what
Church we are, while we be
in this world. <hi>S. Paul</hi> tels
<pb facs="9"/>
vs that we are in a <hi>Warfare,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 4.</note>
&amp; that <hi>Prayer,</hi> is a principall
peece of our <hi>Armour:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 12.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his counsell is,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6. 28.</note>
      <hi>Pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
&amp; watch thereunto.</hi>
For wee cannot (as <hi>Abishai</hi>
said to <hi>Dauid,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 8.</note> concerning
his blow) make so sure worke
at one time, that we shall not
need to come againe: But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so many are our sinnes,
as the haires of our heads;
so many our enemies, as the
stars in the skye, and so fierce
and strong the Tempter, as a
roaring Lyon; that as the
Man of God was angry with
the King of Israel (because
when he bad him smite the
earth with his dart,<note place="margin">2 King. 13. 19.</note> he smote
onely thrice) who should haue
<pb facs="9"/>
smiten fiue or sixe times, that
he might haue beene assured
of the ouerthrow of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
So GOD that bids vs
<hi>continue in Prayer,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Coloss. 4. 2.</note> will be
angry with vs, if wee pray
not againe, and againe, as the
importunate widdow in the
Gospel prosecuted her suite:<note place="margin">Luke 18. 3</note>
yea (to speake of Deuotion as
he doth of compassion) if we
pray not <hi>seuen times,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 22.</note>
      <hi>yea,
seuentie times seuen times,</hi>
that wee may obtaine a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
I speake to them that
haue vnderstanding, iudge
you what I say, and I shall
pray vnto the Holy One of
Israel in heauen, that your
inspirations may be heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="10"/>
your desires holy, &amp; your
Prayers here feruent and
frequent, &amp; there acceptable
before the throne of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
to the reliefe of your
necessities, and to the setting
forth of his glory in <hi>IESVS</hi>
Christ, Amen.</p>
