   <head>The Argument.</head>
   <p>WHen <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, after all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests (shining through the glory of innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble victories) was returned backe to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the Ambassadours of the whole worlde did attend his comming, as one that was desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to domineere ouer all: there being admired by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> adored by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and as it were drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the delights of an extraordinary prosperitie, hee suffered himself to be transported with an inundation of pleasure; till sitting at one of his feasts by the meanes of the sonnes of <hi>Antipater</hi> his cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, in the best, both of his age and fortune, he was suddenly poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned.</p>
   <p>Incontinent after his death, those that were in great estimation with himselfe during his life, and then with the armie, assembled themselues together, neglecting for a long time his funeralls, whilst busied about the disposing of his Empire: at last (after diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions) it was concluded, that if <hi>Roxane,</hi> the widdow of their deceased soueraigne (who was then at the point to bee deliuered of her birth) happened to beare a sonne, hee should succeed in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers place, and till he were come to some maturitie of age, <hi>Perdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, Leonatus, Craterus,</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> were appointed to bee his Tutors: But the foote-men in a disdaine, that their aduice was not required, proclaimed <hi>Arideus, Alexanders</hi> baslard brother
<pb facs="91"/>king, and gaue him a guard, of which <hi>Meleager</hi> procured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be made Captaine. At this sodaine alteration, the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being troubled, they following <hi>Perdiccas</hi> pitched their campe without the citie; yet in the end, this tumult being by the eloquence of <hi>Perdiccas</hi> appeased, all the captaines re-assembled themselues, and hauing diuided the prouinces, made an agreement, which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted not long: For such was the vehement ambition of those great men, that with all manner of hostilitie, they studied how to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine one another, and first of all, <hi>Meleager</hi> after a pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, (though hauing fled to a Temple for refuge) was slaine by the appointment of <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> who after aspiring to a superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer the rest, whilst he went to warre against <hi>Ptolomie</hi> in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> by a sudden mutinie of his owne souldiers was miserably murdered. Then the onely captaine of his faction that remained aliue, was <hi>Eumenes,</hi> a man singularly valorous, who encountering with <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> by the death of themselues defeated their armie, whereby being highly aduanced, he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enuied▪ and (<hi>Leonatus</hi> hauing lately before dyed in a conflict betwixt him and the <hi>Athenians,</hi>) <hi>Antigonus</hi> in the name of the rest was sent against him with a great armie, betwixt whom there hauing passed diuers skirmishes with a variable successe, and some priuate conference without agreement: In the end, he was betrayed by his owne souldiers, and deliuered bound to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who shortly after caused him to be put to death.</p>
   <p>Then <hi>Antigonus</hi> (his riuals in the authoritie being remoued out of his way) did aspire to that himselfe, from which he was sent to seclude others, and hauing murdered diuers of the gouernors, hee disposed of their Prouinces as hee pleased: whereof <hi>Cassander, Ptolomie,</hi> and <hi>Lisimachus,</hi> aduertised by <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who fled for feare of incrring the like danger; they entred all together in a league against <hi>Antigonus.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now at this time <hi>Olimpias</hi> plagued all the faction of <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
      <pb facs="91"/>in <hi>Macedonie,</hi> hauing caused <hi>Arideus</hi> and his Queene <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridice</hi> to be put to death; by which, and other cruelties (hauing lost the fauour of the people) shee was constrained, when <hi>Cassander</hi> came against her, to retire herselfe within a Towne; which (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the scarcitie of victuals) not being able to defend, shee ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, together with her selfe to <hi>Cassander,</hi> by whom (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of his promise to the contrary) she was publikely put to death, and so hauing proceeded so farre in wickednes, he thought it no time to retire till he had extinguished all his masters race; hee caused <hi>Roxane</hi> and her sonne to bee murdered; and soone after, <hi>Hercules, Alexanders</hi> bastard sonne, which multitude of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, gaue to him the crowne of <hi>Macedone;</hi> and to me, the Subiect of this Politragicke Tragedie.</p>
