      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the Saints
were not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the flesh,
so <hi>the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
of their warfare
are not carnall, but
mighty through God,
to bring downe all the
<pb facs="3"/>
strong holds and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
imaginations of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels</hi>
and men, plotted
cunningly against the
Israelites of God; yea,
all the forces of the
flesh and the world
must faint, and fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the use of these
Armes. Of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate
glorious Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Prayer is a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
part; yea, it is the
very evergetical ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestatiō
of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
all the rest. Jt put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
on all the other
parts, it keepeth the
<pb facs="3"/>
whole armature close
to a man, it sanctifieth
all the rest to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
uses it guardeth
all the rest of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
furniture from
theeves and robbers,
it daunteth the Divell
and the Divels limbs,
it carrieth the armed
Souldier through out
all forces and furies,
as a victorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.
And hence
is that saying of the
Ancients, <hi>Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Teares are the
Armes of the Saints.</hi> As
<pb facs="4"/>
the power and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of this spirituall
peece is unexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by tongues of men
or Angels; so am I the
least of all to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
of so high &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
a faculty; but
since it hath pleased
him that hath mercy
on mee to teach mee
the use of it, (though
in much weaknesse,)
and to guide mee as a
weake pensill in his
draught of the truth
of it, to whom should
J then commend it
<pb facs="4"/>
both for the Touch &amp;
Tuition, but to the
Military Forces of the
new Hierusalem, who
are experimētally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with this
peece of proofe? To
you then my deare &amp;
thrice noble Fellow-Souldiers,
the Trained
Band of heaven, the
Artillery men of the
most High, I dedicate
my selfe and this litle
Treatise; accompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it my only happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
if I be but a door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
<pb facs="5"/>
bear with the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse
of my hands
in the unsheathing of
this Sword: man you
it with a holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
courage, and
it will maintain you.
Times call you all to
the breach, stand
close one to another;
hold fast what yee
have, and let no man
take your Crowne:
Lay about you with
this fiery shaking
blade upon all within
you &amp; without you,
that oppose Christ &amp;
<pb facs="5"/>
his Kingdome: Walk
worthy of so high a
gift; make not this
good commodity to
be ill spoken of; part
not with your Armes
and you shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
If these my
poor pains may adde
any thing to your skil,
the greatest recōpence
I crave is to have a
share in your cūning</p>
