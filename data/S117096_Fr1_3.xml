      <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eloued: The wisest Preacher (of a mortall man, and of immortall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,) that euer was or shall bee, inspired with the spirit of God; saith, <hi>There is a time to weepe as well as to laugh, a time to mourne as well as to dance:</hi> And certes, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery man and woman vnder their owne Vines and Fig-trees haue a long time satia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselues with <hi>laughing</hi> and <hi>dauncing,</hi> or making merry with their friends; doubtlesse now is the time that God calls for <hi>weeping</hi> and <hi>mourning</hi> at the least: For, hath he not shot diuers of his Arrowes? and haue not some Bullets fallen from his warning Pieces? which Arrowes and Bullets, both poysoned with the Pestilence, haue hit and slaine some people not onely in and about this populous Citie, but elsewhere in the spatious Country also: And who perceiueth not that the destroying Angel hath vnsheathed his sword and brandished it ouer vs of this Citie, vs of this whole Land? Yea, the black Horse of the Pestilence with pale Death on his backe, hath beene and is, est-soones, prauncing and trampling in the streets of our Citie at midnight: And the Angell hauing wings hath flowne also into the Country, and there done as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Now, though the sinfull sonnes and daughters of
<pb facs="4"/> men lie, neuerthelesse, still sleeping in their sensualites, yet the vigilant Watchmen of our English Israel haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scouered both the one and the other: That is, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers of the Gospell obseruing this Gods begun iudgement and further threat'ned punishment of the Pestilence; they, I say, haue not spared both in Citie and Country, publickly, and priuately, with feruencie to pray for vs, for the preuenting and diuerting of Gods further furious Hand vpon vs, and in their preachings with their siluer Trumpets to lift vp their voyces to sound aloud; and cry downe the high-crying sinnes of this Citie, of this Land: Yea, diuers of these worthy Ministers haue beene and are so zealous in praying and preaching for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Perseuerance, that their throats are growne hoarse, their bodies weak, and their healths impaired: In so much that vulgar Profanists and Carnallists of the time (like as <hi>Festus</hi> once said of <hi>Paul</hi>) are ready to say, <hi>much zeale hath made them mad:</hi> But howeuer, for this their assiduitie and indefatigable <hi>labour of loue</hi> their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is with the Lord; and though <hi>the zeale of Gods House doe eat them vp;</hi> yet <hi>they shall</hi> once <hi>shine as Starres in the Firmament of Heauen.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Among those reuerend Diuines, one hath compiled this comfortable Treatise, or to vse its proper Title-phrase, hath reedified and prepared this <hi>Pest-house,</hi> or <hi>Tower-Royall,</hi> first built by King <hi>Salomon</hi> so many hundred yeeres agone, &amp; before he turned from a Prince to a Preacher.</p>
   <p>If any list to be curiously, inquisitiue and aske, who or what is the Authour, this <hi>I.D?</hi> or to question his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of reuerend, learned, godly, Giue me the publisher his friend leaue to answer; First, that happ'ly his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
<pb facs="4"/> is such and for some reasons in his Christian wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he desires not to haue the Phylacterie of his Name expressed: and it being so, he is not the first of Gods people that hath desired his name to be obscured in a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vsefull worke: Secondly, for his attributes, let me also answer; for the first, they that know him, doe know him so to be; for the two latter, let his labour it selfe answer and witnesse for him.</p>
   <p>To conclude; Whosoeuer the Author is or whatsoeuer I the publisher am, Know this, courteous Reader, that it was written and is published for mine owne and thy Christian solace and comfort, now in a requisite time of a begun Sicknesse and Mortalitie: the meditation wherof in our best healths; will doe vs, doubtlesse, no hurt: And who knoweth? Yes, the Lord knoweth whether it may be his <hi>Swan-like Song,</hi> this writing <hi>mine.</hi> For who can number vnto himselfe any more dayes or houers? <hi>Lord teach me so to number my dayes, that I may apply my heart to wisedome;</hi> in labouring to make my peace with God. And for my paines in publishing hereof, let me craue your Prayers. And so I betake you to God and the good Word of his Grace, which is able (in sicknesse &amp; in health; in life &amp; in death, in Citie or Countrie,) to build you vp further, and to giue you an Inheritance (in <hi>Salomons</hi> strong <hi>Towre-Royall</hi>) among them that are sanctified.</p>
