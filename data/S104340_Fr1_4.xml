   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Otwithstanding that my weeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and dailie vrgent occasions scarcelie aford mee any laisure to write much, specially in this kind, yet because of a former promise made, as also somewhat (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) was left vnanswered, I haue renewed these paines for thy sake (good Reader) whom I intreat, if thou bee not partiall and vnlearned, to become an indifferent iudge of the answere once heretofore and now againe farder tendred. Would thou didst knowe how painefull, and chargeable a worke it hath beene vnto mee, surely then might I hope it will proue thank worthie. Howsoeuer, thus farre I presume of thy charitable Christian affection, whereunto thou art dailie called vpon, by the operation of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the ministrie of his worde, that I shall haue thy praiers to him for mee. Other recompence I looke not for, and lesse thy loue cannot yeeld mee. Through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole argument handled in this, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer booke, I haue dealt with men of some learning and grauitie, to whome peraduenture in manie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects thou maiest thinke me far inferior, and J think the same. But to the glorie of God be it spoken, &amp; the truth of the cause I vndertake, herein I well know, I am nothing inferior. Yea did I spare my appeale to the truth, for anie thing I see, they are compassed with
<pb facs="6"/>like infirmities, as my selfe and others. So little cause haue they or others for them, to boast of their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, zeale, integrity and painefulnesse, which is made their crest in the worlds blason of their commendable well doing. Such popular applause I alway suspected holding <hi>S.</hi> Austin his choise best, if anie must needes haue such applause,<note place="margin">Toleramus illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed tremimus inter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

But to leaue this to the effects better or worse, which may follow vpon it, I am to remember thee of one thing had like to haue escaped my memory, and so peraduenture thy knowledge: namely, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the former part of our answer. I set downe the <hi>Reasons for refusal of subscription</hi> al together, and afterwardes in the handling did refer thee with this watchworde <hi>See their reasons &amp;c.</hi> J haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen (as I thinke) a better course to set them, and their answer ioyntly together, that in seeing one thou mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est see both, holding it lesse comber some to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and euery way more conuenient for thy selfe. Some other things there are, which I would giue thee notice of, but considering thou hast much to read, if thou read all (and I pray that thou so doe) it shall not bee amisse to abridge this preface. And therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing thee to turne ouer a new leafe, see the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and their contents in the Page following.</p>
