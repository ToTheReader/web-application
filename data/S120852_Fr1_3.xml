   <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian and Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reader, many are the discouragemēts that the children of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue at the hands of wicked men, in this iron and declining age of the world, from the sincere embracing of the Gospell, or shewing forth the fruits of sanctification, in this croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and sinfull generation, but much more from publishing any holy Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, tending to this purpose: to omit the bookes that are written, not of vertue and verity, but of vilenes and vanity, which many offer now a daies, as so many Sacrifices to the diuell (by the which as with so many cups of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sō, he infecteth the hearts of milliōs of
<pb facs="5"/> people) what great delight the enemy of mankind taketh herein, he that can see any thing, may easily discerne by the cursed instruments which he raiseth vp from time to time; as his children the Papists, whom wee had thought (long agen) had beene dead in their nests, yet now like serpents hauing cast their coates, begin to lift vp their heads out of their holes wīth fresh and new coloured heresie, and with their poysoned pennes (as a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man of God saith) haue defiled not inke and paper, but heauen and earth with their detestable and satanicall wickednesse. But to let them sinke in their sin, til they come to the bottome of hell, which is of old for thē prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; who sees not the whole world is rocked asleep in the cradle of securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wallowing in their sins like fishes in the sea? so that we may take vp that complaint which the Lord proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from heauen in the daies of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sea,</hi>
      <pb facs="5"/> saying, <hi>The Lord hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie with the world,</hi> because there is no truth, mercy, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, but by swearing, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and stealing, and whoring they breake out, and bloud toucheth bloud: and being thus frozen in their dregs, hauing made a league with death, &amp; a couenant with hell it selfe, they are of the same minde with these people of whom we spake, saying, Yet let no man rebuke or reproue another: for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are as they that rebuke the Priest; not onely despising instruction, and refusing admonition, but they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aron,</hi> and are ready to stone <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> the two Captaines of the Lords host, and we are become their enemies for telling them the truth. Howbeit, whē the eies of mercifull men are set vpon thē, &amp; labouring to saue their soules from being condemned with the world, beseeching them to breake vp
<pb facs="6"/> the fallow ground of their hearts that the Lord might raine righteousnes vpon them, they are ready to giue them <hi>Steuens</hi> reward for his sweet Apology,<note place="margin">Acts 7.</note> and though they haue not the authority of the Magistrate, yet with the vnruly euill of the tongue, they assemble themselues (as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> speaketh) saying; <hi>Come, let vs smite them:</hi> but how, with swords or staues? no surely, but with the cursed weapō of the tongue, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the custome of al wicked men frō time to time, with reprochings &amp; reuilings, &amp; with their venemous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, as much as in them lies, to shut and pierce thorow the hearts of the Saints of God, with that odious and damnable name of Hypocrite and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembler, so that we may say with the Prophet <hi>Ieremy: We are in derisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dayly, euery one mocketh vs:</hi> and as he saith else where; <hi>Woe is me that my mother hath borne
<pb facs="6"/> me a contentious man, whomall the world hateth.</hi> Yea surely so far may we be from stirring one another vp in this kinde, that wee may weep and sigh in secret, as diuers of the Saints of God haue done, &amp; wish with this Prophet, <hi>Oh that my head were full of water, and mine eies a fountaine of teares,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ier. 9.1.2.</note>
      <hi>that I might weep day and night for the slaine of the daughters of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! Oh that I had in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse a cottage of waifaring men!</hi> Yea surely if the wil of the Lord were, we could wish with the Prophet, that we had the wings of a Doue, that wee might flie to the vttermost parts of the earth, that we might be out of the reach &amp; rage of the wicked men; but such is the zeale of the glory of God, wherwith his children are inflamed, &amp; such is the nature of faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with their hearts are touched, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the large promises where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb facs="7"/> they are allured, that in despight of diuels or men, they haue alwaies made conscience of this duty. Hence it is, that in the scriptures wee haue so many examples of this kinde. It was <hi>Peters</hi> commission that when he was conuerted, hee must strengthen his brethren. The woman of Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, when Christ came to her consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence she hideth it not vnder a bushell, but runneth into the city with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen proclamation, saying to her neighbours: Come, see a man that told mee all that euer I did. Yea wee finde that this hath alwaies beene so precisely obserued that the children of God haue neuer neglected it in the time of greatest affliction that euer they did vndergoe; onely two shall suffice in stead of many: whereof the first is in the Lamentations, where the Church speaketh after this manner: <hi>Haue you no regard all you that passe by this way,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Lament. 1 12.</note>
      <hi>to behold and
<pb facs="7"/> see where there is any sorrow like vnto my sorrow, which is done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted mee in the day of his fierce wrath?</hi> Wherein wee see the perpetuity of the loue of the children of God towards their Brethren, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen when they were at deaths doore they called vpon their neighbours to make vse of the iudgements of GOD. Answerable to this, is that famous example of the Theefe on the Crosse, who notwithstanding the dolour and paine wherein he languished, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the desperate and fearefull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of his fellow that hee was in, sharply reproueth him, and vseth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers arguments and reasons to moue him to lay hold of the Sauiour of the world as he had done before he died. These examples no doubt together with the reasons aboue specified, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this new conuert (being also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned by diuers of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
<pb facs="8"/> to publish this litle Treatise, as a fruit of his thankfulnesse, like <hi>Dauid</hi> that would not offer a sacrifice of that which cost him nothing; and yet hath (as it seemeth to me) some blush or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance, with that zeale where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the holy Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, when hauing receiued special benefits from the Lord, he hath these words:<note place="margin">Psalm. 66.</note>
      <hi>Oh come hither all you that feare God, and I will tell you what the Lord hath done for my soule:</hi> making open proclamation as it were vpon the Theater of the world, or as he speaketh, when hauing felt that sweetnesse, of the which this author had a tast, he laboureth presēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to impart it to others, saying, <hi>taste and see how gracious the Lord is,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psalm. 34.</note>
      <hi>blessed is the man that trusteth in him;</hi> euer vsing a borrowed speech fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to our senses, taken from the fashion of Merchants, who hauing brought some rare and costly commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb facs="8"/> from beyond the seas, are wont to permit a taste, and giue a sight, to the end the buyer may be the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to accept of the same. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is the practise of this new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted Prentise, who hauing lien a long time sleeping in security, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming highly of the things of this vaine world, till it pleased the Lord in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to looke vpon him the scales falling from his eies,<note place="margin">Cant. 2.8.</note> so that hee perceiued the Lord comming vnto him, skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ouer hilles, and leaping ouer mountaines (meaning his sinnes, as may appeare by that we read in Rom <hi>8.</hi> as one awaked out of a dreame, he maruailed and reioiced greatly at his wonderful deliuerance, and being desirous to make many partakers of his happinesse, he taketh his penne and writeth this little Treatise and Labor of loue, consisting in (foure) speciall heads, as appeareth in the first leafe of this booke, concerning the manner of
<pb facs="9"/> it you are not to expect much painted eloquence, filed phrases, figures, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which haue little vse more then to tickle the eares; but euen with all humility and meeknes, out of his own experience, wisheth comfort by the comfort wherwith he was comforted, of God. Heere I remember part of a story in <hi>Samuel,</hi> where it is thus written:<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.8</note>
      <hi>And</hi> Eliab <hi>his eldest bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heard when he spake vnto thē and was very angry with</hi> Dauid, <hi>and said, why commest thou down hither, &amp; with whō hast thou left the sheep? I know thy pride &amp; the malice of thine heart.,</hi> &amp;c. Euen so I feare mee, there be many Eliabs se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior to the yong seruant of God <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> that will not onely impute this worke to pride of heart, but wil aske, With whom hast thou left thy sheep? that is, how hee hath discharged his duty to his master, iudging it a matter vnlawfull for him to meddle
<pb facs="9"/> withall, because hee shall offer iniury to his master in the practise hereof. For answere whereunto, we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue a difference according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and quality of the place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; Some seruice perhaps will warrant that, which others do vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny them: for art thou an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer and of an occupation? thou hast not this liberty without extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary allowance of thy master. On the contrary, is hee a trades man, and vsing trafficke? then the most and chiefest of his businesse is in receiuing and deliuering of commodities, in the which much vacant time is idly spent: and happy are you, and blest of God, that haue such a seruāt; you may be sure to be wel &amp; faithfully dealt withal in the charge commited vnto him, when others are wickedly abused. But if this suffice not, know you that hee had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary allowance of his kind and fauourable master. Moreouer, I am
<pb facs="10"/> of that priuity and acquaintance with him, that I may protest in the sight of God, and before men, that this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Prentise, and sanctified yong man, hath vsed of his owne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous disposition, to rise two or three houres in the morning, before he was imploied in his masters affaires, which as it was a thing commendable, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a good inclination: so surely now is it much more praise worthy, being found in the way of righteousnesse, because the teachers therof are highly to be commended, so that we are not alwaies to reproue and contemne seruants in this kinde, lest in so doing we giue a hard censure of <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe, (of whom we spake euen now.) But happily you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and say, that <hi>Dauid</hi> came in zeale of Gods glory, to take the shame from Israel, which was much dishonored by the vncircumcised Philistine, a fearefull, great and huge monster. In
<pb facs="10"/> nature I answere that, <hi>Goliah</hi> neuer blasphemed the Lord of hosts more then wee, nor euer had more fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and toes of deformity, I meane Papists and Atheists, which are in indeed the weapons &amp; naturall liues of our spirituall <hi>Goliah,</hi> so that the cause then of both being not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, the answere that followeth shall not vnfitly be applied, though not in the same measure of grace, wisedome and modesty, yet in the same nature of zeale, truth and sincerity: answer with him in the <hi>29.</hi> verse: Graue Fathers, masters and superiors, what haue I done, is there not cause? But if this Apology seeme vnsufficient, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue with me breefly the benefit that commeth hereby, and the fault consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered will easily be wiped away. In the first place then it bringeth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the Church of God, when they shall see the prophesies fulfilled, and those promises performed which long
<pb facs="11"/> since was declared to fall out in the latter age of the world,<note place="margin">Esay. 11.9.</note> that the earth shall bee filled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord,<note place="margin">Ioel. 8.</note> as the sea is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with with waters. Againe, <hi>Your daughters shall prophesie, your old mē shal dreame dreames &amp; your yong men shal see visiōs.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psalm. 8.</note>
      <hi>And also vpon the seruants will I powre out my spirit.</hi> Againe, <hi>Out of the mouth of Babes hast thou or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained strength, because of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</hi> Notwithstanding these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies, I grant, chiefly fulfilled at the comming of Christ, yet in respect of the perpetuity of it, it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vntill the number of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect be accomplished; yea, and wee that are now liuing haue seene the extraordinary power and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of it, if wee consider since the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> how the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell flying from the middest of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">Reuel. 14.6</note> hauing an euerlasting Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb facs="11"/> in his mouth to preach to the nations that dwell vpon the earth, saying with a loud voice: <hi>Feare GOD, giue glory to him:</hi> an vnspeakeable and peculiar fauour of GOD, as our Sauiour Christ sayeth; <hi>Blessed are the eies that see those things which you see, and the eares that heare those things which you heare;</hi> being the onely meanes to bring vs into the fauour of God and men, that it may bee sayed of vs,<note place="margin">Cant. 6.9.</note> as it was of his owne spouse: <hi>Who is this that loeketh forth as the morning, faire as the Moone, pure as the Sunne, terrible as an armie with banners?</hi> Yea then we shall bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to the Lord, who so toucheth vs, toucheth the apple of his eie, and hee will say to our enemies:<note place="margin">Cant. 3.5</note>
      <hi>I charge you O you daughters of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, by the Roe, &amp; by the Hindes of the field, that you stirre not vp
<pb facs="12"/> nor waken my beloued vntill shee please.</hi> Yea then shall wee be set as a seale vpon his heart, and as a signet vpon his arme: for loue is stronger then death: Ielosie is cruell as the graue, the coales thereof are fiery coles, and a vehement flame: much water cannot quen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>r loue, neither can the flouds drowne it. If a man would giue al the substāce of his house for loue the world would greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it.<note place="margin">Cant. 8.1</note> Secondly, it much aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, declareth, and setteth forth the power of the Gospell; when men are made of Lions, Lambs, their natures being changed, that they come wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly in the day of assembly, the loue of God constraining them and the blessing of God vpon them, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their sonnes to bee as the plants growing vp in their youthes, &amp; their daughters as the corner stones gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen aft r the manner of <hi>Apelles,</hi> &amp;c. So that other nations being
<pb facs="12"/> our Iudges are forced to say of vs:<note place="margin">Psal. 144.7</note>
      <hi>Happy are the people that are in such a case, yea blessed are the people whose God is the Lord</hi> Iehoua. Thirdly, it is exceeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; and no lesse honorable to the graue fathers, and faithfull lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned preachers of our age, when they shall see the blessing of God vpon their labours, &amp; their children which they haue begotten into the faith by the word of truth:<note place="margin">Psalm. 127</note> like arrowes in the hand of the strong man, and are not ashamed to speake before their enemies in the gate. So that they haue no neede of the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, or letters of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions their Epistles being written not with inke &amp; paper, but in the hearts of their children, and shineth in the world to the praise and glory of God.</p>
   <p>Lastly a notable motiue &amp; prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to incite and stir vp the minds of
<pb facs="13"/> those that are too slacke and negligent in this kinde, and may also be vsed as a whetstone to sharpen and set an edge vpon finer wits, that so all the members of Christ both learned and vnlearned, may meet and ioine foot to foot, and shoulder to shoulder, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselues against their great &amp; common aduersary, and being dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by one spirit, may vtter their voices both by praier &amp; by preaching, that we may cause the kingdome of Antichrist to fall downe like the walles of Iericho; that so, if it be the Lords will, we that are now liuing may see that with the eies of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saw so long since with the eies of his spirit, and so with holy reioycing and gladnesse of heart, we may say with blessed Saint <hi>Iohn; It is fallen, it is fallen, great Babylon, and is become a cage of vncleane birds.</hi> Now if any shall aske of me, who are you, and what is
<pb facs="13"/> your name, whose iudgement the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der should so much reuerence? In this behalfe, I answere: If I were one of learning and estimation, perhaps I might cary thee away not vsing any great reason or demonstration. On the contrary, if of no note and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thou wouldest hardly be brought to embrace it, though I bring strong and forceable arguments and reasons. I refer thee therefore to the booke it selfe, which is able to commend it selfe, to the conscience of any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reader, whose eares being sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied trieth words, as the mouth tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth meat. Onely this I will say with the Aapostle <hi>Iames;</hi>
      <note place="margin">Iob. 34.3.</note>
      <hi>Haue not the faith in respect of persons:</hi> and then I dare assure my selfe the Lord shall haue glory, and his chīldren com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. The which vpon the knees of my soule, I craue of his goodnes, and that he will increase in the hearts of his Saints sauing faith, and with faith
<pb facs="14"/> vertue, and with vertue, knowledge, and with knowledge temperance, and with temperance patience, and with patience godlinesse, and with godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse brotherlie kindnesse, and with brotherlie kindnesse loue, that you may make your calling and election sure, so that you may neuer fall.</p>
   <p>By him that praieth daily for the peace of Sion, and longeth to see Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem in her pefect beautie.</p>
