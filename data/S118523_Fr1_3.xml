                 <title>An apologie for svndrie proceedings by iurisdiction ecclesiasticall, of late times by some chalenged, and also diuersly by them impugned : By which apologie (in their seuerall due places) all the reasons and allegations set downe as well in a treatise, as in certaine notes (that goe from hand to hand) both against proceeding ex officio, and against oaths ministred to parties in causes criminall; are also examined and answered: vpon that occasion lately reuiewed, and much enlarged aboue the first priuate proiect, and now published, being diuided into three partes: th first part whereof chieflie sheweth what matters be incident to ecclesiasticall conisance; and so allowed by statutes and common law: the second treateth (for the most part) of the two wayes of proceeding in causes criminal ... the third concerneth oaths in generall ... Whereunto ... I haue presumed to adioine that right excellent and sound determination (concerning oaths) which was made by M. Lancelot Androvves</title>

   <head>An Epistle to the Reader, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the occasion of the publication of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> with a generall delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two Treatises written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the scope of some part of the same.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon occasion touched in the</hi> Preface <hi>going before (gentle Reader) I was about a yere &amp; three quarters since, drawen to set downe this simple</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologeticall discourse <hi>ensuing, albeit in very many places thereof nowe enlarged. Which Treatise (by him to whom it was addressed) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then imparted vnto certaine others of honour and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, it is saide, that they were also desirous to haue copies thereof, for some considerations to themselues best knowen.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>The booke was somewhat long, and had many quotations, so that it coulde not conueniently in any short time be written out truely and faire, for so many as seemed earnestly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest it. Hereupon it was then (in priuate sort) committed to the presse, and fourtie copies, or there abouts were printed, without any purpose of further publishing.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>It appeareth nowe, that neere about the same time, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> Doctours <hi>of the</hi> Ciuill <hi>lawe (required thereunto by some in authoritie) did agree vpon a briefe schedule, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning some groundes of ministring an oath</hi> of office <hi>in crimes punishable by</hi> Ordinaries, <hi>and Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction: a matter referred but to priuate consideration, and desired for like satisfaction onely.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>This small schedule was after deliuered foorth (by some to
<pb facs="7"/>
whose handes it came; as the report went) to be confuted by certaine</hi> Diuines <hi>and</hi> Ciuilians <hi>of either</hi> Vniuersitie, <hi>and by certaine professing the</hi> Common <hi>lawe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Sure it is, that within foure moneths after, a</hi> Treatise <hi>(said to be penned against the purport and drift of that sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule) by sundry (holden wise, &amp; not vnlearned, to whose sight the written copies thereof were credited) was most highly commended, and extolled.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>It seemed so precious, that copies thereof (though desired) were made very rare: and not vouchsafed to the vulgar and meaner sort, but kept</hi> tanquam Cereris mysteria. <hi>So that almost a yeere (after knowledge of it had,) did passe; ere it happened to come to my poore handes: and that was by the meanes of a right</hi> noble Counsellour, <hi>who had also much adoc, to procure a copie thereof for himselfe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>That which came to my handes doeth carry this title, viz.</hi> A briefe Treatise of Oathes, exacted by Ordinaries and Ecclesiasticall Iudges, to answere generally to all such Articles or interrogatories, as pleaseth them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound: and of their forced and constreyned oathes <hi>ex officio:</hi> wherein is prooued, that the same are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>I was glad of this opportunitie offered; for I hoped to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in some important point, that I had not afore consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of: and either to be aright perswaded (whereof I am most desirous) if I had mistaken; or else be confirmed in my former opinion. For there was reason I should so be, if in a booke drawne with so great aduise, by men of such rare skill and dexteritie, and so well digested, I should not finde</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue <hi>arguments, euen to presse mine assent against the course (as I tooke it) of the lawes both</hi> Ciuill <hi>and</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall; <hi>against the practice of all the other states of</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome; <hi>and against apparent approbation thereof by</hi>
      <pb facs="7"/>
Gods <hi>booke it selfe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But when I had first cursorily runne that</hi> Treatise <hi>ouer; I must confesse, I was partly drawne into cogitation, that I had not hitte vpon the right booke: because such is either my dulnesse or preiudice (for I doe assure you, I will not be opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatiue against that which I may discerne to be well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reason, or sounde authoritie) that I stand yet as reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perswaded as afore, this piece of worke notwithstāding.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>And albeit I wanted both fitte occasion, and iudged it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (for the reasons hereafter touched) not worthe the while to say any thing to the vnconcludency and imperfections, which I conceiued to bee in that</hi> Treatise; <hi>yet was I neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse (not long since) moued, by those who may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde me, to take some time to answere it. Being sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified withall from them vnto me, that it was otherwise fully meant, to put mine aforesaide rawe discourse of these matters (euen as it was) vnto print againe, to bee made publike.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Whereupon, knowing this resolution, and that</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>
      <hi>might perhappes be</hi>
      <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>; <hi>I condescended to assaye, whether I coulde as it were licke ouer my</hi> discourse <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, into any more tolerable fashion: not omitting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to answere the whole matter of the aforesaid</hi> Treatise <hi>seeming to me any way pertinent; yet not in the same order as it is there set downe, but in seuerall places of my booke, as it falleth in most aptly, after the method, into which I had first plotted it.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Of which whole</hi> Treatise, <hi>I trust I may (without offense) giue you a generall taste, by this</hi> Epistle. <hi>Truely I neither doe knowe, nor haue heard, who were any of the Authors, or who was the</hi> Enditer <hi>of it. If therefore it should happen that I did vse some measure (though farre scanted) of that libertie of speeche, which is vppe-mette, pressed downe,
<pb facs="8"/>
and running ouer in the</hi> Treatisour, <hi>against many in place, (I doubt not) his betters, and of as great woorth and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie as himselfe euery way; I hope that I shall not (iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) be noted, to be caried with sharpnesse of humour against any particular person; but to haue beene prouoked vnto a moderate, necessary, and generall defence. Albeit I purpose rather to waye, what is fitte for vs to speake, then for him to heare.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Vnto the whole</hi> matter <hi>of the</hi> Treatise, <hi>these three seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pointes might haue sufficed for a generall answere. The first is, that the state of the controuersie, or issue, is by him mistaken: the second concerneth his arguments; for he assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that as graunted, which is not; which in the schooles is called, a fallacie</hi> petitionis principij: <hi>the last and third, is his</hi> sophisticall <hi>answering, euen to such obiections as him selfe frameth. For the first therefore; yee are to vnderstand, that in the</hi> Treatise <hi>it selfe, this seemeth to be the generall issue by him tendered, against which he would argue: viz.</hi> the forcing of oathes by Ordinaries and Iudges Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, generally to answere to all such questions or interrogatories, as they shall demaund or minister, touching either the thoughts, words, or deedes of him, that is to depose. <hi>Vnto which in the title is also added ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther challenge, for that they are</hi> ministred of office, <hi>by the Iudges. So that he conceiueth erroniously all proceeding</hi> of office <hi>to be onely in causes</hi> Criminall; <hi>and in this respect alone worthie to bee chalenged, because it is done by the</hi> Iudge, <hi>without prosecution of a partie.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Nowe if hee doe reason (as hee pretendeth) against some matter practiced by</hi> Iudges <hi>and lawes</hi> Ecclesiasticall <hi>in this</hi> Realme; <hi>then by charging them with exacting of oathes,</hi> for men generally to answere vnto all their thoughtes, wordes, and deedes, that they shall be
<pb facs="8"/>
enquired of, <hi>that I speake but mildely; it is a very vntrue, and slanderous imputation, both to the men, and to the Lawe it selfe. If it were mistaken by him through ignorance, yet was it ouer great rashnesse, thus to</hi> speake euill of such as be in <note n="1" place="margin">Iudae ep. V. 8. &amp; 9.</note> authoritie, <hi>especially for matters hee perfectly</hi> knoweth not. <hi>But if it were wilfully done, then must I needs say, that he peruerted and wrested the matter in controuersie of set purpose, to make the men and whole calling odious; and thereby to giue the better tang (in some mens tastes) vnto those Cart-loads of contumelies, and spitefull</hi>
      <note n="2" place="margin">The Latines call this <hi>calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> the Grecians, <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
      <hi>reproches, wherewith throughout the whole</hi> Treatise, <hi>it pleaseth him to charge both them, and their proceedings; as (in part) shall by and by appeare.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>For the seconde point of the three: hee first defineth an oathe: then hee sayeth it is a part of Gods worship: hee telleth the ende and institution of oathes by Gods Lawe: and that they are either priuate or publicke: hee sheweth the necessitie of it in some priuate suites: and what things are to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him that taketh it, and what by the Magistrate, that giueth it: likewise hee setteth downe (yet but in part) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cases, how an oathe is vsed in some</hi> Temporall <hi>Courts; and how it ought to be vsed (as he saith) by the</hi> Canon <hi>Law. All which, I will not greatly now trauerse with him. But hereupon hee inferreth, that the oathes</hi> ex Officio <hi>vsed in</hi> Ecclesiastical <hi>Courts, are against</hi> Gods <hi>Lawe,</hi> Common <hi>Lawe, and the</hi> Canon <hi>Lawe it selfe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>So that if he minde to reason out of those premisses, it must needes be gathered for him to this effect,</hi> viz.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>In the Law of</hi> God, <hi>in the</hi> Common <hi>and</hi> Canon <hi>Lawes, we finde oathes thus and thus prescribed, and vsed:</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But the oathes ministred in Courtes</hi> Ecclesiasticall <hi>tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching matters</hi> Criminal, <hi>are cōtrary to this prescription and vse:</hi> Ergo. <hi>They are contrary to those three Lawes.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="9"/>
      <hi>I will omit that this reason concludeth not necessarily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ex meris particularibus: <hi>because it might bee, that though sundry othes by those three Lawes were in deede of such forme; neuerthelesse other there may be also farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and yet both sorts allowable.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But for answere I say, that the</hi> Assumption, <hi>or second proposition (which must be vnderstoode) is by the</hi> Treatiser <hi>not once mentioned, much lesse vndertaken to be proued, but is taken vp by him as graunted, which in trueth is flatly by vs denied. For it shall bee prooued (God willing) that there is no such</hi> contrarietie <hi>as is by him surmised, no nor great diuersitie betwixt the othes there ministred, and those, which</hi> Scripture <hi>mentioneth, or</hi> Common <hi>Lawe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiseth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Now touching the last point of the three: Hee maketh it as a sufficient answere vnto obiections that may be made, for assertion of such othes as hee impugneth: if hee can but note any difference betwixt the things resembled together: though such diuersitie bee not in the point, for which the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is made: no, nor in any other point, that is materiall. As for example. If a man affirme, that</hi> Christes <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming may bee compared to the comming of a thiefe in the night, meaning for the secresie thereof, and want of expectation; should hee well confute this comparison, that woulde thus say: No Sir, that is vntrue, for there is a great diuersitie betwixt their commings: because</hi> Christ <hi>commeth to deale iustly, but a thiefe to doe vniustly? But to come neerer home: If I did argue thus,</hi> viz. <hi>The receiued vse of the</hi> Starre-Chamber <hi>to deny men counsell, when they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to</hi> Interrogatories, <hi>is not against the Rules of</hi> Iustice; <hi>therefore no cause is there, why the like approoued vse in the</hi> Chauncerie, <hi>should be counted against</hi> Iustice: <hi>I pray ye,
<pb facs="9"/>
should he reason soundly against it, that would answere it in this sort: Oh Sir, there is a great diuersitie betwixt those two</hi> Courtes: <hi>for the one proceedeth</hi> Criminallie, <hi>to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict penalties for the</hi> Queene, <hi>the other but</hi> Ciuillie <hi>for priuate amendes in equitie, vnto the</hi> partie? <hi>Or if hee shoulde answere thus: The</hi> Lordes <hi>of the</hi> Counsell <hi>bee</hi> Iudges <hi>in the one, but not so in the other? Considering, that in all things (being not the same) there is diuersitie; and yet a reason of comparison is concludent; if there be no difference in the point, for which it is brought.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>If then the whole substance of that</hi> Treatise <hi>shall bee founde vpon discussing, to labour of some of those three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; so that (as himselfe affirmeth in the winding vp of all) he might truely say hee hath vsed but</hi> fewe proofes: <hi>I could therefore haue wished, that hee had not shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as</hi> Suffenus sibiipsi, <hi>by setting the Garland vpon his owne head, before the victorie; where hee telleth vs, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit his</hi> proofes by him brought be fewe, yet <hi>(saith he)</hi> they are effectuall. <hi>And thus much for the matter of that</hi> Treatise.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Now let vs here also consider the maner of penning, and the briefe of the rest of his vnnecessarie wordes, which are wholly besides the matter. For the</hi> enditing, <hi>surely I doe esteeme it (for my part) to be a very commendable, easie, and flowing (if not ouerflowing) stile. Yet if I may be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to speake freely, that which I thinke, truely it runneth altogether vpon an haughtie, comptrolling, contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, disdainefull, and salte minerall veyne, as may appeare by a taste of some particulars, not vnfitte to bee opened; which for order sake, I will contriue into these fiue seuerall heades: viz. 1. Of his discourteous and opprobrious termes vsed against sundrye particular persons and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: 2. His couert reproching and wounding of all</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
<pb facs="10"/>
Iudges <hi>through the sides of</hi> Papists, <hi>for their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging against Subiects, and treacherie to their</hi> Soueraignes, <hi>in former times: 3. His reuiling the proceedings</hi> Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, <hi>which he there impugneth: 4. His vntrue imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and slander of these proceedings: And lastly, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended impieties supposed thereby to be committed, with the dangers and penalties, that hee chargeth all such to haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, which haue bene dealers in such practise of</hi> Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Iurisdiction.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>For the first of these: as where hee termeth all that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise that part of</hi> Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction <hi>(whether</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries <hi>or</hi> Commissioners) <hi>by the names of</hi> Inquisitors, rough and rigorous exactors, and offensiue butchers: <hi>Chargeth them</hi> to cloake and shadowe foule matters vnder glorious and painted glosses, beautifull shewes, and fained pretenses: <hi>that of their</hi> Iudiciall Courtes and Consistories, <hi>this saying of the</hi> Poet <hi>is verified, viz.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Victa iacet pietas, &amp; tergo caede madentes</p>
   <p>Vltima coelestûm terras Astraea reliquit: <hi>As if they had there murdered or vnlawfully put some to death.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Where hee also saith, that</hi> Ordinaries challenge or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to themselues the goodly name and title of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall men: <hi>that they are men</hi> to whome the sauour of gaine is sweete, <hi>and therefore sayeth of them,</hi> Auro lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quente tacendum est.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Those</hi> Doctors <hi>also which by commandement do (as afore) seeke to iustifie the course that he oppugneth, he calleth (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe contempt)</hi> English Doctours: <hi>a terme vsually sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened but vpon such, as beare the name of learned, and yet besides</hi> English <hi>(their mother tongue) perhappes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand none other language at all: yet the meanest of such</hi> Doctors <hi>can tell, that a</hi> Publican <hi>differeth from a</hi> Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, <hi>and that</hi> regula Iuris <hi>signifieth not an</hi> example
<pb facs="10"/>
      <hi>or</hi> precedent, <hi>at both which he stumbleth. He pleasantly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (like a</hi> Sennor Soldado) <hi>sorteth nine of them by rankes,</hi> into more then two quaternions, <hi>as the souldiers which kept</hi> S. Peter <hi>were sorted: as if through their basenesse, a</hi> quaternion <hi>of them were not woorthie to be laid in ballance</hi> with a messe of such as himselfe is; <hi>or as though in a braue resolution of his owne single valour, he valued them by doz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens together, and durst encounter them all at once, like as the single</hi> Spaniard <hi>doth, with so many naked and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> Barbarians.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>He termeth them also (in scorne)</hi> Learned Canonists: <hi>as if he would insinuate, that the litle skill they haue, were in the</hi> Canon <hi>lawe onely, which he nameth the</hi> Popes Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>and as if their degrees of schooles were taken in that profession. Whereas it is well knowen, that their profession and degree, is in the</hi> Ciuill <hi>lawes: a lawe being (for the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and wisedome thereof) by the space of sundrie</hi> quaterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of hundreths <hi>of yeeres, the common lawe of all the</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill <hi>nations of the world saue one. What he esteemeth of it, greatly skilleth not, but</hi> Tullie, <hi>a man more wise then he, doeth giue it exceeding great commendations. And all the</hi> Christian <hi>worlde (sauing ourselues) are not destitute of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for well esteeming and practising of it. For the course of those</hi> Doctours <hi>education, it hath beene in the liberall sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in the languages called learned, and perhaps in such of the vulgar also, as be of any commendable note, and in other sortes of good learning. Wherein if they haue accordingly profited, their employment (happely) may bee many wayes (thereby) as behoofefull to the seruice of their Countrey, as that which some call</hi> learning, <hi>is beneficiall and gainefull to themselues.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Likewise the poore</hi> Apparitors <hi>that serue in</hi> Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall <hi>Courtes, he calleth them,</hi> their hunting Spaniels,
<pb facs="11"/>
malepert Apparitours, Messengers and Pursuiuants: <hi>men though in meane place, and but ministeriall qualitie, yet as necessary to be had in those Courtes, as</hi> Errand-bailifs <hi>be for</hi> Temporall.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>To come to the second; may it be denied, that the matters wherewith he reprocheth the</hi> Popish prelates, <hi>of former times, are bent</hi> per obliquum, <hi>through their sides to wound all the</hi> Reuerend fathers, <hi>and others nowe liuing? who (for proceeding</hi> of Office <hi>against some of his darlings) are fallen as deepely into his indignation. For haue these sharpe biting termes bene bestowed vpon any of their late</hi> Predecessours, <hi>or vpon them, till of late yeeres, that certaine disordered persons ioyning (though in other respectes) with the</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, <hi>to oppugne this Church, haue bene dealt with in the same course, that</hi> Papists <hi>are, and were from the beginning of</hi> her Maiesties <hi>reigne, before these other sprung vp? If this were not his meaning, for what ende is almost halfe his</hi> Treatise <hi>spent by way of Inuectiue against the</hi> Popish <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates? So that (no doubt) hee meant to lay vpon the present</hi> Iudges Ecclesiasticall <hi>the reproches of them, whose steppes hee chargeth them to followe, in that</hi> this course of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was <hi>(if wee may trust him vpon his bare worde)</hi> brought in by the practice of the Popish Cleargie: <hi>And therefore hee sayeth, that</hi> Bishops nowe practice Antichristian decrees, and Popish Canons, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heades of that Hellish <hi>Cerberus</hi> of Rome, and the synewes of his tyrannicall authoritie: <hi>For else this were but running of riot, and vaine barking against the Moone.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Of this sort are those his other speeches also,</hi> viz. <hi>that</hi> the Papisticall Cleargie most irreligiously practised the same: <hi>that</hi> they finding it a fitte instrument to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine their Romish Hierarchie, and to tyrannize ouer
<pb facs="11"/>
the consciences of good men, most impiously viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the lawes both of God &amp; man, imposed this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of corrupt oath vpon the people: <hi>that</hi> they were far more cruell then <hi>Claudius</hi> or <hi>Caligula:</hi> mad men, gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die &amp; deuouring Wolues: <hi>that</hi> they fed (with delight) their fierce and cruell mindes: <hi>that</hi> they tyrannized in cruell maner: <hi>that</hi> they forced men with rough and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous termes of disgrace &amp; reproch: <hi>that</hi> they were mercilesse magistrates vsing sudden and raging com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance: <hi>that</hi> they promised in <hi>verbo sacerdotali,</hi> if that be ought worth: <hi>and he calleth them</hi> vnbridled Clergie men, Pharisaicall Clergie men, vniust &amp; lawlesse men, with their bad practices and fond intentions: merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Ordinaries, with their extraordinarie and lawlesse power: <hi>their actions</hi> cruell and accursed dealings of Barbarous bloudy bishops, murtherous mindes and intollerable iniquitie of bishops, vsing a Barbarous course of inquisition. <hi>He inueigheth also at large, against their</hi> hypocrisie &amp; feined holinesse: <hi>against their</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall possessions, as the nurses of pride, presumption, and vaine pompe of the world. <hi>Truly if this kinde of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likers, had that litle of temporalties which is still left, how hūble they would be may iustly be doubted: but I durst vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for them, that they will vse no great</hi> pompe <hi>in hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, nor in any thing els, sauing in words. Likewise against their</hi> ambition: <hi>for he affirmeth, that</hi> three Archb. infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced aboue the kings of the land: <hi>against</hi> vsurping &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croching vpon the kinges iurisdiction by Popish pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, to bring causes to their costly and lingering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistories: <hi>against</hi> bringing in (by them) of forrein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, corrupt canons, and ceremonies of the accursed See of Rome: <hi>against their</hi> claiming of exemption from taxes imposed by any other whomsoeuer, then by the
<pb facs="12"/>
Popes authority: <hi>and against</hi> certeine clergie men, <hi>that (in former times)</hi> opposed themselues (with great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie) against the paiment of a subsidie: <hi>as if lay men had not done (rebelliously) as much, as these did obstinately: Against</hi> haughtie <hi>Hugh</hi> bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> who <hi>(hee saith)</hi> as a lusty champion of that irregular confederacy drew out his woodden dagger of excommunication, against the kinges Iudges: <hi>against</hi> a bishop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> who was outlawed for a wilfull murther, and a while refused the iudgement of the kings law: <hi>against the</hi> Popes collectour who conuented the vicar of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tash</hi> afore himselfe, for breach of an othe giuen for strength of a bond: <hi>against the</hi> Hospitallers and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers, who drew the kings subiects into suite, before the conseruatour of their priuileges: <hi>And against</hi> the proud prelate cardinall <hi>Woolseys</hi> court legatine; and both his and <hi>Nixe</hi> the blinde bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into <hi>praemunire,</hi> for encroching vpon the kings iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction: <hi>Adding also a slie surmise of some other things (in the times of</hi> Poperie) <hi>to haue bene vsed, which he doth but vainely imagine, to be now practised by</hi> Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Ecclesiasticall. <hi>So that by this tricke of cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance, he would induce and draw on his affectionate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to beleeue, the same to be now in all</hi> bishops <hi>present, which was blame woorthie in any of their</hi> predecessours. <hi>For his fauourers may not iudge that such a man as he, would wander so farre wide (as he doth) from his purpose: belike if these now do but any one action (though neuer so iustifiable) which the</hi> Papists <hi>haue done in times past, they shall carry all the cōtumelies, which they (in any other respects) haue either worthely, or vnworthely deserued. Whether this be a direct</hi> Christian <hi>course, euery one that is in any place of iustice shall most sincerely discerne; which will but consider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb facs="12"/>
how vnequall he would iudge it to bee, to haue his owne honestie, discretion, loialtie, and religion measured and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of, according to the actions of the worst men that euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore occupied the same place that he now doeth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Vnto the third point (which is reuiling of proceedings</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall <hi>(in this behalfe) all such speeches of his, as these following doe appertaine: of the whole</hi> Canon <hi>lawe indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctlie and generally he speaketh thus: that</hi> they be lawes and ordinances contumelious against God, iniurious to Magistrates, and especially established to maintaine Antichristian tyrannie: <hi>Of an</hi> Oath <hi>of</hi> purgation, <hi>or an oath ministred to answere (in some cases) vnto</hi> Articles <hi>and</hi> interrogatories criminall, <hi>he saieth,</hi> It is against law and reason; an intollerable error and disorder: a fowle and great abuse: hard and vniust dealing: vndiscreete, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust, and vnlawfull forcing: offensiue proceeding: v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped officious power, and licentious pleasure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to all due course of Iustice: a violent course of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious inquisition, examination, and of wrested oaths: a lawlesse proceeding which the Iustice of the land de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testeth: that they be vniust oaths, and full of iniquitie: strange oaths &amp; strong purgations, not healthfull but hurtful: poisoning purgations, giuen for preseruatiues: Catholique oaths: a vicious and lawlesse inquisition: and lastly, a prophane, and more then heathenish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>The fourth point concerneth his vntrue and slanderous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations of their proceedings, who be</hi> Iudges Ecclesiastical: <hi>as where he saieth,</hi> that such generall oaths <hi>(viz. as afore hath bene touched, when I spake of the issue mistaken)</hi> are exacted, none accusation, suite, lawfull information, presentment or inditement iudiciallie preceding: <hi>that the Ecclesiasticall Commissioners,</hi> terme themselues high
<pb facs="13"/>
and supreme Commissioners: <hi>that it is</hi> exacted by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ecclesiasticall Iudge to satisfie his iealous suspicion of any crime, to appose by othe, and compell men to their purgation, or vpon euery bare surmise and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rumour: <hi>that</hi> by the like reason <hi>(vnto the practise of this othe)</hi> there should bee erected a court of Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more then Spanish, to sift and ransacke (by othe) most secret thoughts: <hi>That the Interrogatories vsed by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Iudges are not certaine, but</hi> doe foolishly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the doubtfull will of a slie and subtill apposer: <hi>that</hi> hauing snared the sillie subiect, they doe either (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst lawe) enforce him to accuse himselfe of his most secrete thoughts; or contrarie to Christian charitie, yea humanitie, constraine him to answere against his naturall parents, &amp;c. <hi>And that in defence of these abuses,</hi> diuers euen of the learned sorte, doe great violence to the Statute, 1. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. wresting the same to a wrong sense: <hi>all which are verie calumnious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>The fifth and last point of his lauish and loose speeches; concerneth the impieties, dangers and penalties, wherewith he chargeth all that haue delt in any such Ecclesiastical cause. As first, that it is</hi> a great and prophane abuse of the holie name and maiestie of God: that Gods sacred instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is thereby greatlie peruerted: that it is hurtful to the Church and common weale: <hi>that it is</hi> a great indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the Crowne: <hi>that</hi> they vsurpe conisance of pleas: <hi>that</hi> they doe no lesse-then <hi>Thorpe</hi> sometime chiefe Iustice did, who (as much as in him lay) broke the oath which the king is bound to keepe towardes the people: <hi>that</hi> they are violaters of the king, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious dealers against his Regalitie, Crowne and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: nay rather laie violent handes on him, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
<pb facs="13"/>
his royall throne and scepter contrarie to the policie, Iustice, lawes, customes, and freedomes of this kingdome; yea contrarie to the lawe of God it selfe: <hi>that hereby</hi> they impugne the royall preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues vnited to the Crowne, with the breach of their owne oaths; especiallie if they haue taken the oath for the maintenance of the supremacie royall, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee maketh some doubt (as it seemeth) and</hi> aduiseth <hi>them of this danger,</hi> as a <note n="1" place="margin">Scilicet.</note> welwiller: <hi>that it is</hi> playne extortion and wrong vnto the partie. <hi>And lastlie, that</hi> they are all offenders, and doe incurre the forfaiture of the penall lawes of Premunire.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Seeing then his wordes of this matter bee so bigge, his termes so biting, his speeches so confident and peremptorie, and his accusations so grieuous: Is there not (in defence of Iustice and of so many good and great learned men in seuerall professions) great occasion offered to haue it examined; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the force and weight of his reasons will beare out this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious haruest, and hote raging feuer of wordes, or whether these wordes were but vsed because matter wanted? What weight and moment his reasons are of, is not of this place par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie to discusse, but shall bee reserued to the seuerall partes of the</hi> Discourse <hi>following. And I will not striue by bare wordes to returne these of-scowrings of a fowle mouth and a defiled penne vpon him agayne; further then must needes cleaue fast to himselfe, the Authour of them: when they shall (by reason) bee wiped off from the persons charged, and so are to rebound backe, vpon their first owner.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>And to giue you an inckling (in the meane time) that it is not otherwise like, then to fall out so: It shall not bee amisse, a little to consider how gingerlie sometimes hee treadeth in this matter: and how here and there himselfe
<pb facs="14"/>
minceth and qualifieth the state of the controuersie, as it were waiuing his first issue; notwithstanding all those his former high lookes and braue termes. For first he granteth, that</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers euen of the learned sort, doe hold, and that verie confidently, <hi>(meaning hereby as I take it, sundrie professors of the</hi> Common <hi>lawe) that these proceedings which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth, are warranted by the Statute,</hi> 1. Eliz. cap. 1. <hi>and can he (whosoeuer he be for a man) shewing no more, yet see more herein then so many of the</hi> learned sort <hi>can, that be of an other iudgement?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>And though he exclaime (as yee haue heard) mightilie, that this kind of oath is</hi> contrarie, and a stranger to the lawes, Iustice, and policie of this Realme; <hi>yet in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie closing vp of his</hi> treatise, <hi>hauing sayd, that</hi> it was neuer put in vre or vse by any Ciuill magistrate of this land: <hi>by the strength of trueth is forced to adde thereunto this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: viz.</hi> but as it is corruptly crept in amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuses, by the sinister practises and pretenses of the Romish prelates: <hi>thereby imploying, that yet it hath bene vsed of long time</hi> by the Ciuill policie and magistrates of this Realme: <hi>noting them withall, I know not with what</hi> other abuses, <hi>as being ouerrought, which belike they also shall heare of, as his leisure will permit him, if they please him not in the meane time the better.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Likewise, going about to answere the obiection that may be made, for iustifying of this othe by the like approoued course in the</hi> Starre-chamber: <hi>he vseth these wordes as a reason of his allowance of such proceeding there: viz.</hi> The Starre-chamber requireth an answere to matter in fact, done either to the iniurie of a priuate person, or hurt to the publike State. <hi>Then (by like reason) if</hi> Iudges <hi>and</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners Ecclesiasticall, shall but require this oath to answere matter in facte <hi>(as in very trueth they doe none
<pb facs="14"/>
otherwise)</hi> done to the hurt of the publike State, <hi>then is the cause in controuersie thus farre yeelded vp by him. But can he (in deed) thinke it reasonable and iust, to exact such oath for punishment of an iniurie done but to a priuate person in his temporall goods, or such like: and shall it bee in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vniust and vnreasonable to be exacted for discouerie and restraint of such enormities, which cannot be denied to be preiudiciall both to the state of the Church &amp; Common weale, wherein Iudges Ecclesiasticall most vsually doe practise it?</hi> Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trà non desidero; habemus quasi confitentem reum.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>In another place of the</hi> Treatise, <hi>he sharpely inueieth, for that the</hi> Commissioners Ecclesiasticall, <hi>minister the oath before the partie be permitted to haue the Articles. Now in his shewing of differences betwixt the proceedings by</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners ecclesiasticall <hi>and the</hi> Starre-chamber, <hi>one of them is this; that the defendant there, hath the copie of the</hi> bill of Information <hi>to answere by his counsell, ere hee take his othe for the trueth of it: yet hee restraineth it thus, viz.</hi> So the Information in the Starre-chamber bee not made <hi>Oretenus: so that it must hereupon needes be yeelded that at sometime, and vpon some occasion it may bee: and therefore it is not</hi> simplie vniust, <hi>to giue the oath before the defendant haue a copie: nor for him to be debarred from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, when he answereth but</hi> interrogatories <hi>of his owne fact or knowledge. For (in deed) the defendant in the</hi> Starre-chamber <hi>is not allowed counsel, whē he answereth to</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories, <hi>sorted into</hi> Articles, <hi>but only is allowed counsel for the maner of framing of his answere to the</hi> Bill <hi>into due forme of law: the Counseller not aduising him in the matters of fact, least happily he draw the defendant into periurie. For it were very vnreasonable, that counsell should direct him in the matter, and as it were to say vnto him:</hi> answere not this thus, though it be true; for then you are like to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie
<pb facs="15"/>
punished. <hi>Nay rather, as a writer in the</hi> Ciuill <hi>law aduiseth: the counsell (euen to the</hi> bill of Information) <hi>ought to tell the defendant to this effect:</hi> Si hoc modo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondeas, perdes quidem causam: sed si aliter quàm ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas se habet, perdes animam.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Furthermore, in one place where he reprehendeth</hi> forced and constrained oaths; <hi>hee limiteth his meaning by these words, viz.</hi> in that generall maner: <hi>which is, as afore he had surmised: viz.</hi> to sift generally all a mans thoughts, words and deeds, and that without any accusation, or complaint precedent: <hi>so that it is not simply the vrging of them to take oath in a</hi> criminall <hi>cause which grieues him, or is to be condemned: but to doe it</hi> in that generall maner, <hi>for all thoughts, wordes and deeds. If then no such matter be (in very trueth) euer practised, the man (it seemeth) will easilie bee reconciled againe vnto them, whom hee so eagerlie afore snatched at, and tooke vp.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Lastly, in one part of the</hi> Treatise <hi>hee speaketh in deed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> oaths in criminall causes: <hi>but it is with this taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue restraint:</hi> especiallie <hi>(saieth he)</hi> in causes of life and death, contrarie to the lawes of this realme: <hi>so that if it be not ministred in any</hi> cause of life and death, <hi>no, nor yet in any cause of mutilation of limme (as in very trueth it is not now by any court</hi> ecclesiastical, <hi>a thing most notorious) then there is no cause of offense giuen, either to the lawes of the realme, or vnto himself. And therfore for this time the</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiser, <hi>and those which exercise</hi> Iurisdiction ecclesiasticall, <hi>may seeme (in some broken maner) to bee growen againe to a pretie kind of</hi> pacification; <hi>hold as wel, &amp; as long as it shall.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But there is another partie also, that perhaps will venture to rip vp agayne the seames of this greene peace, if hee may not (in some sort) bee satisfied. For there came vnto mine handes a good while after the former Treatise, certaine briefe</hi>
      <pb facs="15"/>
Notes <hi>(without discourse) that are deliuered abroad into many hands by writing; being commended to be gathered by a man of great reading, and iudgement in</hi> Diuinitie, I awe, <hi>and in what not? It beareth this title,</hi> Notes to prooue the proceeding <hi>ex Officio,</hi> and the oath and subscription which are now required, to be against the word of God, the ancient Fathers, and Canons of the Church, and the lawes, liberties, and customes of the realme of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: the proceeding of Office, and the oath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>though hee telleth not how he conceiues it to bee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, (as the</hi> Treatiser <hi>did) doe both fall into this disputation, which we haue in hand. As for the</hi> subscription; <hi>(vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion) that may hereafter elsewhere be debated. The seuerall points which (in respect of the two former) hee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, are by himselfe distributed and sorted into these seuerall heads: viz.</hi> First, testimonies out of ancient Fathers, that do mislike the proceeding <hi>ex Officio,</hi> and oath now vsed: <hi>Secondly,</hi> English Martyrs that haue refused and misliked the oath now vsed: Thirdly, the proceeding against heretikes in Englād, without exacting an oath &amp;c: Fourthlie, the Canon lawe teaching Inquisition and proceeding <hi>ex officio</hi> by oath. Fiftly, another order of proceeding, but yet in <hi>causa fidei,</hi> and not otherwise. Sixtlie, the bishops proceedings contrarie. Seuenthly, the lawes of England. Eightlie, the maner of the reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the proceeding <hi>ex officio</hi> in king <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. time. Ninthly, the maner of debating of that cause in those dayes. 10. Sir <hi>Thomas Mores</hi> reasons for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of proceeding <hi>ex Officio</hi> &amp; the oath, with sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie answeres to them. 11. And lastly, Inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which come by the vse <hi>ex Officio,</hi> contrary to the common lawe. <hi>For proofe of some of which (especially the first) he is so plentifull in quotation onely of places, (without
<pb facs="16"/>
rehearsing their sayings) out of the ancient</hi> Fathers, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, &amp;c. <hi>that for mine owne part, I must confesse that vpon the first view of their names in his</hi> moster booke, <hi>I was greatly astonished, least I had too resolutelie defended a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against such an armie of ancient</hi> Fathers, <hi>and as it were against the generall consent of the olde</hi> Primitiue Church; <hi>from which I meane not (God willing) casilic or rashlie to swarue. But when I had approched neerer, I well discerned this my feare to be all in vayne, in that they had neither ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner displaied, nor weapons bent against this cause, but rather against the faces of the aduersaries thereof: as may plainelie appeare in the seuerall &amp; opportune places of this simple</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <hi>ensuing.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>I may well resemble this dealing of the</hi> Note-gatherer <hi>vnto yong setters vp in</hi> London, <hi>as</hi> Apothecaries <hi>and such like, that be not at first well stored with stuffe: who to furnish vp their shoppes vnto the best shewe, are woont oftentimes to embellish them with good numbers of painted gallie pots, boxes and glasses, intituled on the outside (euen with golden letters sometimes) of such precious Waters, Oyles, Simples, and other drugges of medicine, which they neuer smelt of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such neuer came within them. And perhaps I should saue him from suspicion of a greater fault, (that is eyther want of iudgement, or of wilfull peruerting of the</hi> ancient Fathers) <hi>if I should freelie deliuer my conceite in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: which is, that his leisure serued him not, to looke what was indeede contained in those places, which there hee quoteth: but that hee did set them downe (vpon trust) out of the</hi> Pies <hi>or</hi> Indices <hi>of the sayd seuerall bookes, wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the bare wordes of</hi> Inquisition, <hi>of</hi> Accusing, <hi>of</hi> Oath, <hi>or of</hi> Swearing <hi>was found. For I dare auowe, that hee which shal read thē in the</hi> Authors <hi>themselues, will iudge, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were gathered together in condemnatiō of taking
<pb facs="16"/>
any oath at all, (an errour holden by the</hi> Anabaptists) <hi>albeit being truely vnderstood according to the circumstances, the places serue neither the one turne nor the other) rather then that by any colour, they may be wrested to speake either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> oathes <hi>ministred in causes</hi> criminall, <hi>or against pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding by</hi> Iudges of Office.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Let thus much therefore (if it be not too much) suffice, to haue deliuered in some generalitie, touching the said</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <hi>and</hi> Notes. <hi>both which are vndertaken, for the whole substance of them, to be here and there answered, in this sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple discourse ensuing.</hi>
