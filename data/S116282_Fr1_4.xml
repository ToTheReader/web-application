      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ardent affection wherewith the best &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limest Spirits have ever embraced the <hi>Sonnes</hi> of the <hi>Muses,</hi> is not in any example so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as in that matchlesse pattern of true <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Magnificence, ALEXANDER</hi> the Great; who having finisht the Conquest of <hi>Persia,</hi> and hearing every day of more Victories, did thus expresse his sorrow and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented affection; <hi>Think you to please me with any news, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse ye can tell me that HOMER is alive again?</hi> Such was his ambitious love to <hi>Poetrie.</hi> Under protection of this invincible example, I boldly make my <hi>Approaches.</hi> My <hi>Lines</hi> are alreadie drawn and perfected, whereby I am resolved to attempt your Lordships Favour; and I hope I shall winne the same without any danger or repulse. Yet do I not think to carrie it by any advantageous sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, or forcible irruption; but onely by a free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie yeelding, which you may easily perform, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any derogation to your <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Valour.</hi> And seeing now my speech is to a <hi>Souldier,</hi> give me leave in that little that I have to speak, to keep the same dialect. Forasmuch as I am now to expose my self to a World
<pb facs="3"/>
of Enemies, I thought it fit to marshall these my lines after a warlike order. I have prefixed the approbations of my judicious in the front of this Book, to be as it were a <hi>Vantguard.</hi> Then followes in the middle my own Poem, which I account as the <hi>Main;</hi> and upon this I do most of all relie. Then I have reserved in the last place some few <hi>Elegiack</hi> Verses; which because they have alreadie past the <hi>Pikes</hi> of sharpest censures, and come off cleare in the judgement of the world, I make them my last refuge, and have placed them (as you may see) in the <hi>Rear.</hi> In this order I stand readie to receive the assaults of envious <hi>Carpers,</hi> and curious <hi>Criticks.</hi> I do not stand in any fear of your Honourable acceptation, and gracious interpretation of these my labours. The name and subject of my Book, which is <hi>GƲSTAVƲS</hi> Battels, is enough to assure me from all doubts &amp; suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions. Seeing you have not thought much to spend your best bloud in defence of his cause, I cannot think you will be backward to patronize the memorie of his Name.</p>
