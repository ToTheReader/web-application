greate manye with plausible allowance ioyfully
receyued, to whome for the greater encreasing

vnto the men of Rhodes, who wondered marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
at the oration of that famous Orator De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes,
beeing but sayde and recited by him
vnto them: <hi>Quid inquit Aeschines <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">

sayde Aeschines, at this my rehearsall of
Demosthenes oration? what if you had hearde
him selfe sounding and pronouncing hys own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>
words? Meaning therby, that in Demosthenes
great part of Demosthenes was wanting, when
that those things which he spake were recited of
an other. I doubt not, but vnto all, this my little
trauell wil be acceptable: to them that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
bicause they shall agayne be put in mynde of
that whiche they before heard, and so maye more
deepely consider the same: to those that were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,

they heard not, &amp; so be made better learned vnto
saluation. And thus desiring thee good Reader▪
to be thankfull vnto God for this and other
good fruites of the laborers in his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yardes,
I bid thee farewell, from
Westminster the .vj. of April.
