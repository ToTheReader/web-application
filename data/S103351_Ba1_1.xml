   <head>THE POSTSCRIPT</head>
   <head type="sub">to the Reader.</head>
   <p>WHereas from page the 57. to page the 63. we delivered that according to the common opinion of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, things commanded might in case of scandall be for a while omitted or forborne, <hi>Vasquez</hi> and <hi>Becanus</hi> dissent from us and them in this particular, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and confirmation of their opinion I will briefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, and then leave to thy censure.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Becanus,</hi> to make way for his opinion premiseth that there is a difference betweene naturall precepts, for some saith he bind simply and alwayes whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver circumstances intervene, and their obligation never ceaseth, such like are those that forbid lying, perjury, hatred of God, Idolatrie, &amp;c: for these facts are so intrinsecally sinfull, as that
<pb n="148" facs="77"/>they cannot by any circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces bee made lawfull: others now bind not simply, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but with certaine cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and therefore they bind as long as those circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances remaine, they cease to binde when those circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are changed: Such is the precept forbidding to kill, for that bindes with these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that we kill not by our private authoritie, except in case of necessary defence. Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way these circumstances, and it binds not, for it is lawfull to kill upon the command of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or in our necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: such also is the precept of eschewing scandall; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be dictated by the law of nature, yet it obligeth not <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely &amp; quomodocunque:</hi> but with certaine circumstances, and one circumstance necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to make it binde us, is that there occurre not any other precept, either naturall or posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
<pb n="149" facs="77"/>The reason is, because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is bound to have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care of his own than others salvation; and consequently, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to avoid sinne in himselfe, than to prevent it in his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And therefore that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept which is given us for the prevention of sinne in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is but of a secondary obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Now the precept of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing scandall is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, onely for the hindring of sinne in others, and therefore doth not tye us when there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth any other precept, which is given for the avoiding of sinne in our selves. But it may be objected, that the precept of shunning scandall is of the law of nature, and therefore is more obligatory than those precepts that are but positive. Unto this <hi>Becanus</hi> answereth, that a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall precept is more obligatory than that which is positive, <hi>cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris paribus,</hi> that is, if each pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept both that which is naturall,
<pb n="150" facs="78"/>and that which is positive, bee primarily referr'd unto the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of our owne salvation, unto the preventing of sinne in our selves: but now if on the other side the primary scope of the naturall precept bee to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sinne in others, as it is in the precept of scandall, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall end of the positive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept bee to shunne sinne in our selves, than that precept which is positive doth more deeply binde us than that which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.</p>
   <p>Againe secondly, it may bee objected, that if the obligation of the naturall precept of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing scandall, ceaseth upon occurrence of but a positive precept; why then it seemes this positive precept detracts or derogates from the naturall precept of avoiding scandall, as being of greater force and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity.</p>
   <p>In no wise, onely it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a circumstance requisite to
<pb n="151" facs="78"/>make the precept of avoiding scandall obligatory, <hi>quale cum dicimus</hi> (saith <hi>Vasquez</hi>) <hi>non esse omittendum praceptum positivū propter vitandum scandalum proximi, non dicimus praeceptum naturale derogare praecepto posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivo tanquam fortiori, sed dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus occursu praecepti positivi cessare quan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>am circumstantiam necessariam, ut obliget praeceptum de vitando scandalo etiamsi na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turale sit.</hi>
