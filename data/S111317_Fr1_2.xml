audacia, impudentia. Malice is at her chariot or caroch,</hi>
for shee is a loftie minded dame. <hi>This chariot is drawne along
on foure wheeles: crueltie, impatiencie, boldnesse, and
impudencie. Cruell</hi> shee is, shee will spare no mans name,
no not his life. <hi>Impatient</hi> shee is, shee will beare no mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie,
no not an error, though to erre be most humane. <hi>Bold</hi>
shee is, shee blurteth out all whatsoeuer shee knoweth. And
<hi>Impudent</hi> she is, no checke nor rebuke will snibbe her, to make
her hang the head. To stand therefore to such <hi>Iudges,</hi> were
halfe before-hand to condemne my selfe. But to learned men,
to temperate men, to studious men, to curteous men, to your
<hi>Lordship,</hi> and to your like, is this poore labour in all deuotion
most reuerently submitted.</p>
   <p>Now some things there are, in which I humbly craue fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
interpretation.</p>
   <p>1. As first that I doe not put vpon this <hi>Treatise</hi> in the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that <hi>vigor</hi> and <hi>viuacitie</hi> which it carried in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For there is euen in nature a great difference between the
tongue, and the quill, betweene speaking and writing. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sound and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ne of the voice is melodie to the eare: it beeing
the proper <hi>Obiect</hi> of that <hi>Sense.</hi> And thereof it is, that the


<pb facs="5"/>
speciall part of<note n="x" place="margin">Cie de or at 3.</note>
      <hi>Oratorie,</hi> is said to be <hi>Pronuntiation.</hi> And
besides that,<note n="y" place="margin">Plutarch. de Socratis Genio. Et de placitis Philosop. l. 4. cap. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</note>
      <hi>Vox est ictus animi:</hi> passing through the eare,
and braine, and blood, it smiteth (as it were) and giueth a
stroake vpon the verie soule, and so with a kind of violence doth
deepely affect it. Therefore it is called <hi>Viua vox,</hi> as that which
hath in it a speciall kind of liuelinesse. <hi>Hierome</hi> beeing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
turneth ouer <hi>Macclinus</hi> to <hi>Austen</hi> that was present:

      <hi>qui viua (vt aiunt) voce docere te poterit: who</hi> (saith
<hi>S. Hierome) may teach thee thereby the liuely voice, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then I can by an Epistle.</hi> But yet further, besides all the
worke of <hi>Nature,</hi> there is in <hi>Preaching</hi> a speciall gift of <hi>grace:</hi>
which enableth a man to speak with such euidence of the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
&amp; with such power to the <hi>Conscience,</hi> as no pen of man by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
can expresse: whereof <hi>Preaching</hi> is the most liuely and
effectuall instrument of <hi>saluation,</hi> and so to be respected.</p>
   <p>2. Secondly, I must craue pardon, that all things are not
here exactly set downe, in that order and forme in which they
were deliuered. Writing nothing at large, nor carrying with me
any helpe of my notes into the pulpit; some things might easily be
forgotten, which I premeditated, some things might be added,
which I premeditated not: some things might misse their due
place, and some things their due poize: some things might bee
enlarged,<note place="margin">Plat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>

      </note> some things might be contracted more then I purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:

      <hi>Orabam meditata loquens, tres tractus in horas.</hi>
To doe it without set forme of words, and to misse nothing either
of matter or manner, must be the act of a man of greater gifts
then my selfe. But new when I returned home, and after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
requests, had resolued to commit that which I had said to
writing; I had no safer rule to walke by, then the <hi>method</hi> by
which I had in short notes digested my meditations. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in that forme, they come forth into the world.</p>
   <p>3. Thirdly, if any take offence at the multitude and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie


<pb facs="6"/>
of mine allegations: I would haue them to knowe, that
as it is not mine vsuall manner of preaching in the countrie; so
here are many more <hi>Ouotations</hi> added, and some a great deale
more enlarged, then as they were at that time deliuered. <hi>Tullie</hi>
said of youth,<note n="c" place="margin">Pro. M. Caelio.</note>
      <hi>Dandum est aliquid aetati:</hi> So say I in this case:
something must be giuen to this learned age, something to the
solemnitie of that place, and something to the expectation of the
hearers. Sure I am, that much was to be giuen to this <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
where the <hi>Position</hi> was to be ouerswaied by <hi>Antiquity,</hi>
for that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> is on all sides challenged of Noueltie. It
is hard I confesse, to hold <hi>The golden meane.</hi> But there is a
worse extremitie growne vp in preaching, which for reuerence
of mine owne coate, I will thus taxe from S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in an
allegorie:<note n="d" place="margin">De serm. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min in monte. lib. 1.</note>

esse posse iactantiam: &amp; eò periculofiorem, quo sub specie

   </p>
   <p>I haue said, <hi>if not all that I would, yet all that I could,
the time so straightening me in the penning hereof, as I
haue scarse found leisure to read it ouer.</hi> My prayer is
now to <hi>Almightie God,</hi> that he would be pleased in mercie to
accept of these my poore endeauours, and to blesse them to the
good of his <hi>Church,</hi> for which they haue been vndertaken. And
for your <hi>Lordship,</hi> my supplicatiō shall euer be, that God would
vouchsafe to continue in you, that <hi>liuely, iustifying▪</hi> and <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
faith,</hi> treated vpon in this Sermon, which may keepe you
from <hi>trembling</hi> here, and in the day of iudgement. So I take
my leaue. From <hi>Combes</hi> in Suffolke. Maij. 29. 1613.</p>
