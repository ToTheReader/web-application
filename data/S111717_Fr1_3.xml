   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath alwaies been my chiefest studie and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, to serue your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie and my Countrey: the intent of my best la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors that way, I haue put into the following Discouery, and, vpon good approbation thereof by diuers of your Maiesties most Honourable Priuy Councell, haue beene incouraged to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp the same worke vnto your Maiestie. I confesse my weakenesse such, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put so fit a Garment vpon it, either
<pb facs="3"/>
of stile or method, as I conceiue the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it selfe deserueth. The substance of the worke, I submit to your Maiesties wisdome and iudgement; the errors and things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, to your Highnesse pardon. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose thereof, is, with your Gracious allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to beget a disposition in all your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Subiects, for a Plantation in the <hi>New-found-land,</hi> grounded vpon reason of indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, both generally and particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Vndertakers and Posterities, as well in matters of wealth, as also the meanes for increase of Defence and Power; which will the better goe forward, when your Maiesties Subiects are made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with what facility it may be vndertaken; and so to worke the more effectuall impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in them, when they shall vnderstand, that it is an Iland, neere as spacious as <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and lieth so far distant from the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of <hi>America,</hi> as <hi>England</hi> is from the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest part of <hi>France,</hi> and neere halfe the way between <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the most part of it aboue three degrees neerer the South, than <hi>England,</hi> and hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb facs="3"/>
well approued by such of your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Subiects as haue liued there aboue ten yeeres, that the Countrey is very healthfull and pleasant in the Winter. How commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and beneficially that Land may be peop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with small charge, and proue profitable to the Vndertakers, and not hurtfull to any of your Maiesties Subiects, the following Discourse will make it plainely appeare, the which was presented vnto your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie at <hi>Huntingdon</hi> in October last; since which time, it hath pleased such of the Lords of your Maiesties most Honourable Priuy Councell, at <hi>VVhitehall,</hi> the 24. of Iuly last then present, to giue mee incouragement with their good approbation thereunto; and ordered, that the booke should be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with this further addition of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours fauour, to be recommended to the Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the rest of the Lords Bishops, to be distributed to the seuerall Parishes of your Maiesties Kingdome, for the better incouragement of such as shall be willing to assist that Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, either in their persons or otherwise.
<pb facs="4"/>
And if your Maiesties Subiects put it in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to vndertake; I trust, God will giue a blessing to the successe, whereof I haue only made a true and plaine Relation of the truth: if I should write other then the truth, there are many in your Maiesties King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes that haue often traded to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whom I suppose will be ready to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue me.</p>
   <p>Thus being loth to be too tedious, I most humbly recommend to God, and to your Maiestie, my indeuours, the successe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and my poore selfe.</p>
