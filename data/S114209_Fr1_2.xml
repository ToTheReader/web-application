Out of both these (the one made to supply that the oother wāted) hath thear been compounded a perfit Calender according to the title of the book: whearin is syrst set the name, then the toong whear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is: then the name expounded into Latin by the one or the oother, as best serues: and after put into our English for oour Cuntrey, which was the cheef cause of the trauayl taken: Lastly is thear added to the woord a note, both of the person or thyng what it was, and also of the book and chapter whear the same is mentioned. So the commoditie of this Calender consydering with my self, how pleasaunt for varietee, and profitable for knowledge it mought be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all: and thearwith how aptly it mought square with the trauayle I haue in hand in the reprintyng of oour En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Byble: I could not stay me, but to vse the diligens and cunning I could, to get the copy soon into my hand. Which as with good curtesy it was deliuered me, so thought I it my part agayn, redyly fyrst in this small vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume to impart it vnto you.
