   <head>The Preface of the Authour vnto the Reader, of the causes of the pestilence.</head>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Alex. Tral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. li. pri. cap. <hi>1</hi>
      </note>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a receiued opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Phisitions, that the first part of all healing &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, must bee called backe vnto the knowledge of the causes, and iudgementes. Whereas therfore the learned do often dispute of the cause of this so horrible a sicknesse, the which we cal the Pestilence, and the publike cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wherof we are to set down: it seemed vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to me to be worthie the trauaile, in few words to declare this matter, <hi>y<seg rend="sup">t</seg>
      </hi> so much the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily and diligently euery man might doe his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in taming or assawging this dragon, as Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len rightly tearmeth him. For not without good cause it seemeth vnto some a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be marueiled at, that so many oftētimes doe die in one house, into which this infection once getteth:<note place="margin">Euery plague commeth not immediatly from God.</note> and that such as betimes flie thēce many times remaine vnhurt. Which thing they which suppose to come to passe by vnauoidable destinie, or affliction immediately sent frō god, speake in my iudgement, indistinctly and vnor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly.
<pb facs="11"/>
For such a plague is wont to happen not by common tokens, yea and very seldome, and that myraculously. And I nothing doubt that God doth winke at many things, and doth not at all times defend vs, which thing notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hee is able for to doe: or to speake more properly, that he doth oftentimes vse the Diuel, yea, men also, and which more is, our selues, to trye our selues withall: so farre of is it that I woulde by any meanes denie it. Moreouer this likewise is a rare thing, &amp; such as many old men haue not seen in all their life, that a plague should growe of the infection of the common ayre. For in this case it must needes bee that many &amp; manifest signes goe before. Wherefore wee see the Astrologers many times to be fouly deceiued for want of due consideration of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. For how can they alwayes without errour obserue and marke so hidden natures of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, and so diuers coniunctions and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions of all the starrs? Therefore forasmuch as it is not lawfull, neyther altogether to shut out God, nor rashly to make him the Authour of our errour and ouersight, according vnto the iudgement of the most learned and graue men, both Philosophers and Phisitions, and also Diuines: this may well bee affirmed, that euerie pestilence in deede, like as other disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb facs="12"/>
euen in the iudgement of <hi>Hypocrates</hi>) and all aduersities are of God, but yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding haue not all one nature: for there is one kinde of plague which may be said to come on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God:<note place="margin">
         <hi>3.</hi> sortes of plagues. <hi>1.</hi> From god.</note> and another naturall: the thirde, receiued by infection. The plague from God, when as it riseth either immediatly from God, or by the ordinance of God (as <hi>Alexand. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> termeth it) and by no ouersight of nature, by no placing of the stars, or through the threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening of no Ecclipse, nor through the defaulte and rash headdines of men, that is, when as it is sent by the meere pleasure and wrath of God, being angrie with men for their sinnes. And this is a most heauie case, and growing sodenly, rageth verie hotly against those (for we do not affirme the chastizing of the Lorde to bee like a bickering in the dark) who are not marked: the which we cannot auoid either by flying or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, or ought to seeke to auoid, but the way is only by supplication, prayer, and purgings. It is also oftentimes to be perceiued by plaine and feareful tokens from God, or by the voyce of God himselfe, or his Prophete.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">2. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall plague.</note>The naturall pestilence is that, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of causes by meanes, and such as consist in nature. This by some is thought to bee of three sortes, either by meanes of the ayre, or of the
<pb facs="12"/>
water, or of the earth▪ of others twofold (which commeth in a maner all vnto one point) namely common and priuate: of the which the one is not properly called a common disease,<note place="margin">D. Hierom. ca. 9. in Mat. Luke <hi>4.</hi>
      </note> albeit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times it bee the cause of a common dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, that is of a common plague. Nowe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that plague which happeneth by reason of the ayre, or of the water, or of the earth, they say that it hath not God either the next, or the proper cause, although it haue him as her Lord, to whom it is forced to obey, &amp; at whose becke it is ruled. Yet this plague many times doth so furiously rage, that it wasteth away most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous cities, most mightie prouinces and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries (from whence it seemeth to haue the name <hi>Epidemia,</hi> that is such a sicknes as haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a whole countrie or people) destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whole kingdomes, vtterlye taketh awaye the former plight and countenance of a place, blinde for the most part (I speake after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men) vncertaine, vnconstant, rouing all aboutes, vntreateable, raging without any law, taking away whomsoeuer it meeteth: without any regarde eyther of nobilitie or common sort, infecting all things sometimes far &amp; wyde frō the East vnto the West, yea rāging vnto beasts, vnto trees, vnto the fruits of trees, &amp; of <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      </hi> earth
<pb facs="13"/>
(from whence commeth that starring whiche the Greekes call <hi>Astrobolismos,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Hiero▪ Card. de rer. varie. <hi>15.</hi> cap. <hi>18.</hi>
      </note> or starre bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting) and finally vnto fishes▪ the elements being infected by <hi>y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
      </hi> noysom meeting (as it is thoght) of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in the house of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, or of the Twinnes, through the Ecclipse of the Moone, or of the Sunne, &amp; such other like added circumstances. This miserable sicknesse, commeth many times vpon mē so sodenly, that many within the space of 10. or 20▪ houres without any ague, amongest their doinges at home or abroad, or their publike busines, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any certaine signe either of vrine or pulse, in the Church, in the high way, in publike offices, yea sometimes in feastes (O lamentable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans nature!) are taken away in a short time vpon the sodaine,<note place="margin">Cor. Cel. lib. 1. cap. 10.</note> being mery, iocond, and fearing nothing. Wherefore in this kinde of pestilence they thinke this singuler remedie (flie quickly, far off, come slowly again) to be a most safe preseruatiue.</p>

      <note place="margin">

Bayr. de med. morb. distinc. 21. trac. 2. cap. 3</note> as fire amōgst stuble and dayly taketh strength through the careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of such, as are vnwarie, and despise good counsail, and liueth by mouing it selfe, and wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth strong by spreading abrod: so that of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate hurt there groweth a publike, of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar an vniuersal in the end, like as of a smal spark, a great fire, and according to that saying of the Poet,
<q>One naughtie man oft times dooth make a Citie whole be punished.</q>
   </p>
   <p>This kinde of common sicknesse was not knowen either vnto the Greekes or Arabians, as <hi>Cardanus</hi> witnesseth, with whome I easilie agree. For when as they liued more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,<note place="margin">De variet. rer. <hi>8.</hi> ca. 46.</note> and in time sought the helpe of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and receiued the same, and kepte compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie warilye with such as were sicke, they did the more easily let the spreading abroad of this sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
   <p>Which things standing so, it may easily bee vnderstood, after what sort the scripture repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the plague to bee sent vpon men by God, and by what meanes he deliuereth such as obey his commandements from the same. For I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly graunt, that no haire falleth from our head without his will, that there is no euill
<pb facs="14"/>
in the Citie, which the Lord hath not done▪ But againe my iudgement is, that these things come not alwaies immediately from God, in such sort as he may be said to be the next cause of them: naye they are to be saide more rightlie &amp; more properlie to grow from their owne,<note place="margin">Ch. Pezel. 3 part. arg. Philip. de necess. &amp; fat. arg. <hi>7.</hi> W. Musc. Loc. com. de afflict.</note> and from such nature of next causes, rather then in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte of the prouidence of God. Because that euerye thing is to haue his name from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde or next groundes, that is from his owne nature, and not from outward causes. For what if a dronken man should fall into the fire, or into the water: or through hauing his stomack ouerquatted with meate and drinke, seeking to procure vomit, shoulde breake a veine of the breaste, and so come into a phthisicke, will you rather laye this vnto GOD, then vnto the intemperancy of this drunken sotte? If a man liuing in idlenesse, and dailie surfetting, glutting him selfe vnseasonably and vnorderlie with too much and moiste meate, wallowing in riotousnesse, giuen wholy to whordome, daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinges, bathes, sleepe, vsing one while the colde, an other while the hot aire, gathering great store of rawnes and fleam especially in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in a cold countrie, in a rainie wether, by nature moyst, grosse, in age verie old or young: if such a one (Isaie) fal into a <hi>quotidian</hi> ague,
<pb facs="14"/>
will you not rather impute it vnto the nature and negligence of the man, then vnto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God? But if besides the simple rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennesse, these humours gathered together, and through the continuaunce of time by little and little waxing worse,<note place="margin">Ioh. Farn. de feb. <hi>4.</hi> cap. <hi>17</hi>
      </note> and partaking with some poison, shal haue hurtfulnesse from else where: and that happilye there be added hereunto the infections of the aire by infected fennes, lakes, deunes, caues, the carkases or dounge of men and beastes, or of some other more stronge sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, and that the proceede of the inordinate excesses of times and seasons, and do pearse into the bodie of man alreadie apt to receiue them, or with meate, or with the aire, or with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes else: If, I say, these things thus fall out, and bring forth the pestilent and euil agues of their nature, who will not rather lay the fault vpon the nature both of the aire and rottennes, and also vpon the rashnes and heedelesnesse of men, then vpon the peculiar and meere punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God? So that the Gods in Homer doe iustly in this sort complaine:</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Alas how mortal men on Gods do euery foote complain: affirming that their miseries from vs proceede, when as their own desertes &amp; wickednes beyonde their fate doe cause their punishments!</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="15"/>For some are wrapped in the like error in a maner, in the which some of the interpreters of Hippocrates are intangled.<note place="margin">
         <hi>1.</hi> Epid. 1. Gal. in prog. Hip. cōmen. <hi>1</hi>
      </note> For when as he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Phisitions to marke whether there were any thing from God in the disease, they (saieth he) drew this hereunto, as if men were stroken with sickenes, through the anger of the Gods. Which <hi>Galen</hi> in his Commentaries according to the meaning of the same <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> doth vtterly deny. For albeit both of them iudged not distinctly and plainely enough of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as being voide of the true knowledge of God: yet what things soeuer haue causes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen to some bodie, or farre contrary vnto the opinion of the common people, are not by and by notwithstanding to be said, to be simply diuine or from God, although peraduenture a man may tearme them wonderful.</p>
   <p>What is the cause then, wil some man aske, why so commonly and constantly men do iudg this sicknes of the plague aboue al others, to be a punishment sent from God? It is because, that for the most part they finde it to be a grieuous and cruell euill? For the olde Writers as well Greekes as Latines vse to call that holye or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, which is vnusuall, vehement and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Be it so, yet this is euidēt by the testimonies of learned and godly men, that, as hath bin saide
<pb facs="15"/>
in the beginning, it is not alwaies a punishment immediately sent from God, as they either of ignoraunce, or too much scrupulositie and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cednes of conscience haue perswaded thēselues. <hi>S. Hierom</hi> saieth,<note place="margin">Hieron. in Mat. 9.</note> that many infirmities of the bodie (which indeede is to be graunted vnto him) doe come because of sinnes: ergo by the selfe same saying hee seemeth to shew, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie doe happen for other causes, that is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or through the vnaduisednesse and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of men, whiche thing Luther confesseth willinglye of the plague of Witeberge in the yeere 27. And <hi>Basilius</hi> the great, both in deed and name, affyrmeth that all sicknesses are not of nature, or of carelesse diet, or other origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles, which Phisicke maye helpe, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be God his whippes for sinnes, sente of God for our conuersion, accordinge to that saying: <hi>Whom the Lord loueth, he chastizeth: yea he chastizeth euery sonne, whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Doubtlesse, where he saith not all, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, he by the selfe same confesseth, that some scourges are of nature also, and many times not to come immediately from God. I could prooue the same by many and most manifest testimonies of most excellent and chiefe men, but I thinke there is no man, vnlesse hee bee all to gether
<pb facs="16"/>
void of eies and mind, or wedded to his own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, haue his wits on wol gathering (as they say) which wil denie the same. Wherefore sith that which we say, is agreeable vnto truth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with their vnskilful standing in their owne opinion, who being perswaded, that all plague commeth immediately from God, would haue no endeuour, no trauel vsed by men to the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge awaye of the same, but that only with the Heretikes called Euchites or Prayarres,<note place="margin">There are too many, euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of this fond opinion.</note> wee ought to flie vnto praier &amp; supplications: prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that al the labours and charges of men are in vaine and vnprofitable: the which opinion there be some that haue of al other diseases. For we haue to think far otherwise, who when as we do godly confesse that all things are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto God, and gouerned by his appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet do hold that many thinges come to passe through our own defaulte and course of nature, the which after God, both may &amp; ought to be remedied, auoided, yea and also chaunged by the helpe and trauaile of man.</p>
