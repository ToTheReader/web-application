   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR at my late beeing at the Court (which as I remember was about .xij. monethes now past, at what time I came out of Irelande) and nowe agayne at my present beeing heere, I haue bene requested by sundry honest Gentlemen, some my good freends and olde acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce: some other, who knowing more my name then my selfe, haue repayred vnto me with like request, to instruct thē, in the curing of a foundered Horse. Whose fauours dyd moue me to offer and promise vnto them, to put the same in print. Partly for their friendshippes sakes: and partly to make a present thereof vnto all my Countreymen that eyther be or intend to be trauailers on horsbacke. Reputyng it also conuenient to publishe the same in common, the rather, for that I iudge the poorest sort shall receiue most benefyt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. And bycause it is not meete that this excellent cure should want thē reputation it deserueth, neyther to be accounted a vaine thing not worthy the hauing, as many be that being printed haue smal credit notwithstanding they cary, <hi>probatum est,</hi> I do dedicate the same vnto you, both for the friendly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I ovve you, and for that you can giue good testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of this cure, by an experience made vppon an Horse of your own. I haue caused the same to be printed, as wel to ease my selfe of the trauayle I should haue to answere euery mans request: as to satisfie my friends, to whom I haue made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and all others that are desirous to vnderstand the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof. Which I pray you may be vnder your protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and presented to as many as you shall please, and of the rest let the Printer make his profite. So God keepe you.</p>
