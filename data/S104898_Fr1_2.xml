Reader, Iohn Hoper

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He more of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce
&amp; weyghte
the mater is, a mā takethe
in hande:
with the more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectyon
and
aduised counsel he shoulde begyn
the same: lest the thyng lyghtly &amp;
vnaduisedly begon, myght eyther
constrayne the autour with shame
to leaue, and forsake vtterlye hys
facte, eyther with anxite and tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of mynde to perseuer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynewe
in the same. Therfore it
was wyselye counceled by wyse
men when they sayed: before thou
begynne any thyng aske counsell,
and then put the thyng councelled
<pb facs="3"/>
vpō in fact. With this maketh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that elegant &amp; wyse prouerbe,
Dimidium facti qui bene cepit, habet.</p>
   <p>That is to say, he hat halfe ēded
his purpose, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> begīneth wel. But
in the lyfe of manne what is more
waightie, graue, excellent, or wā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
more circumspection, good
counsel, ernest praier vnto god thē
Matrimonye? What and thou
shouldest begyn it vnwyslye, and
vngodly: how many inconueniēce
and troubles should there folow?
I leaue y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> nombre of testymonies,
and examples, and commende the
vnto experyence. We see daylye
moste petifull and lamentable ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enations,
and separacions not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
of the mynde but lykewyse of
the bodye, by meanes as well of
frowardnes and morosyte of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions
as of filthy adulterye, and
vnlawful diuorcementes. To suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and helpe so great euelles in
<pb facs="3"/>
the begynnyng of matrymonye
required counsel, and not suche as
perswadeth &amp; cōpelleth the moost
part of persons to marye for fond,
flesshely, or auaricious affection:
but holye, iuste, prudent and well
aproued counsell that teacheth at
the begynnyng to beholde wysely
the condicions of hym or her that
is wyshed for in Mariage: and so
in tyme wyth wysedome take, or
leaue, him or her accordīgly, with
tyme aduised vpon: And then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynte
hym selfe (yf anye thynge
shulde happen after the Mariage
contrarie to hys expectacyon and
hope that he or she had of others
helthe, maners, or condicions, that
breaketh not afterward matrimo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie)
with patience, and tolleraunce
to beare them, vntill, death separat
the one from the other, or God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
and amende the faultes and
maners to be redressed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
<pb facs="4"/>
But before man or womā marie,
this is requisite to be done
that euery one and of euerye sexe
and kinde examine him selfe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he can with a good conscience
lyue sole and vnmaryed or not. Yf
he can, it is the mynde of the holy
ghost and of sayncte Paule that
he so remayne in purite, &amp; cleanes
of life in body and soule to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> glory
of God .i. Cor. vii and the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyties
of this trewe and vnfained
chastite be infinite and wōderful,
but not geuē to all men. And great
hede muste be taken here, lest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the pretext, and name of chaste
and sole lyfe lye hyd most damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hordome and adulteri. In case
thou be gyltie and fyndest in thy
selfe the daunger of adustion, and
burnynge of concupysence it is the
cōmaundement of God thou mary
i. Cor. vii. Wyth this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
no man can dyspence, nor no
<pb facs="4"/>
vowe or what esti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>acie, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>,
or estimaciō so euer it be: for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
vnto the commaundement
is better then al the vowes, or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the lawe.</p>
   <p>And when thou hast thus adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
apoynted thy selfe to mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
see thou first chose thy make
or companiō, before thou lone, lest
thou happen to be deceaued with
blinde loue which sodenly entred,
and sodenly perisheth agayne.</p>
   <p>Measure not thy chose, from ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
bewtie, age, parentaige, or
from suche like: but from vertwe,
godlynesse, wit, discreacion, &amp; trac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tablenesse
of condicions. The first
condycyons be not to be refused in
case they be well placed in a man
or woman that hath them with y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
feare of God, where that lacketh:
they be better refused, then taken.
And because we may be deceaued
vnder the shewe of vertue and hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pen
<pb facs="5"/>
vpon a woman of frowarde
cōdicions and troublous, whē we
thynke our selues best bestowed:
and also the woman many tymes
hoping to haue matcht with an ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nest
man, where as she afterward
findeth her selfe vtterly deceaued:
farther bothe manne and woman
manye tymes are charged and in
daunger to loue the rich, the faire,
and so prefer them before y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> good
and vertuous. The fyrst election &amp;
begynning of Matrymony ought
to be frome prayer, in the whiche
suche as woulde marie shuld aske
of God, a godly companyon from
whom onely it is gyuen Prouer.
After diligente prayer shoulde be
like inquisition of what fayth the
partye is that is desyred in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymonye:
for as dyuersytye of
religyon betwene one man and
hys wyfe is daungerous, so is it
forbydden by God Deut. vii. Ios.
<pb facs="5"/>
xxiii. Therfore Abrahā the father
of the faythfulles bounde his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte
by an othe that he shoulde
not take any of the doughters of
Canaan for hys sonne Isaac. And
Isaac commaundeth Iacob hys
sonne to beware of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> same Gene.
xxviii. The contempte and violaci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
of thys cōmaundemēt brought
the children of Israel into greate
daunger Iudic. iii. And Salomō
the kynge into Idolatrye .iii. Reg.
xi. Therfore saynct Paule saythe
i. Cor. vii. That it is lawful to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
whom we wyll, so it be in the
Lord, as it neuer can be where as
the persone to be Maryed abhor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rithe
(as saynt Ambrose sayth) the
autoure of Matrimonye. It is
not ynoughe for the man or y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that wyl mary, to chose such
a one as beareth y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> name of Christ,
but he or she must diligently serch
what the practyse and obedyence
<pb facs="6"/>
of hys cōuersation is to the name
of Christianite. And when suche a
one is founde, then chose and loue
honestlye, seke wyth the counsel of
thy wise frendes, and neglecte not
the suffragies, nor consente of the
parentes and frendes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone
thou sekest: and commende
then, all the successe to God, and
desyre hys wyll to be done. Thys
is the onely way to begynne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
if it shal euer prosper wel
But out alas howe farre be men
nowe adayes from thys maner of
waye towardes mariage. This is
now accompted folyshnes and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persticion.
And in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> place of these
vertues is entred many vnlawful
and vngodlye meanes, some bye &amp;
and sell theyr children: yea from y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
cradell and maketh mariages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
those, that hath not the vse
of reason to iudge what maryage
is. Another sort seketh howe with
<pb facs="6"/>
flattery, collusion, defraude, &amp; gile:
yea by the meanes of bandes and
vnhonest persones alure the sonne
and daughter to a contracte wyth
oute the knowledge, aduyse, and
consent of the parentes, and thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it good ynough so they agre
wythin them selues. Another sort
wher as they se, the mairage they
couet to be aboue theyr reach they
solicitate theyr frendes letters
and boroweth, many an honest cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēdacion
in their maysters or frē<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
letters whiche they neuer pay
after, to the person that honest cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendacions
pertayneth. I do not
condemne nor disalowe y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> reporte
and lawde of an honest mā or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
nor thynke it not against the
worde to make mencion trewly of
the persones vertue and faculties
that is wished for in matrymony,
as Abrahams seruaunte dyd, so it
be done trewly &amp; without fraude.
<pb facs="7"/>
But in case the commendacions &amp;
good will of the suter can not pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uayle,
I would not that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente
of anye frende that
s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>weth for an other, shoulde forse
or compell the free parson agaynst
his or her will. Nether where as
this meanes can auayle, with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toure
or compulsion of perswatiō
to constrayne or induse the vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and euel fēced minde, of him,
or her that of it selfe for vertue
coulde no way admitte suche a cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
and matrimonie. If it be
wel begon the lorde wil prosper it
in grace and goodnes. If the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye,
he wil sure at lengthe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe
it, as it is to be seene how the
whole worlde for violating of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie
was drouned, Sodome
burnte. Amonge other faultes and
crymes that brought the children
of Israel into Captiuite the leste
was not the breakynge of Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
<pb facs="7"/>
But it is not ynoungne to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynne
Matrimony iustlye, it must
so contynewe, and ende, if it be of
God. This shall be donne, incase
boothe, feare the Lorde, and eche
knowe his duetie to the other. And
to thende it may the better and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
be put in experience, it shal not
be a lost laboure al together for the
christiane reader to see the godlye
writynges of this olde and graue
writer Tertulliane that here liued
for. 1340. sithens. This seconde
booke to his wife, before foure ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
past, I translated at the desyre
of a godlye frende of myne, beyng
bothe then, in a straunge countrie.
And when I had done in the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,
I commended vnto hym
the iudgment therof: so that with
his labours and myne he sende it
into London to a godlye, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
widowe his mother by the
lawe, who thankefullye toke it for
<pb facs="8"/>
the tyme of her lyfe. And sithens
her departure the godly man hath
geuen the same godlye councell to
others that be vnmaried. And
now wishyng good to al, through
this realme that he cannot
speake withal, thought
it good to commit the
same (for a farther
vse therof) to
the prynte.</p>
   <p>Prayinge god, that it maye do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
good to all vnmaried,
&amp; maried persones, as bothe
he, and I most hartely
praye for, in the
Lorde. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
