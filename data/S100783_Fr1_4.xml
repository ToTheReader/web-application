      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Philosopher having invited his friends to dinner, and seeing them sit at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, looking about as though they lacked something, forbearing to eate the meat that was set before them; and perceiving at last they looked for bread, which hee had forgotten to provide; Yee may see, quoth he, how little the study of Philosophie serveth to the making of a feast. Even so when I had taken occasion to write of the Felicitie of man, and layd before me the goodly reasons and perswasions of the Philosophers, I seemed to bee invited to their opinion, as to a plentifull feast, that wanted nothing to satisfie mine appetite. But when I had more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately perused their reasons and arguments, whereby they would prove it to bee in the power of a wise man to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to Felicitie, I perceived there wanted, as it were bread to a Feast; the chiefe thing that should make their dainty meat or plausible reasons savorie to their guests: which is she grace of God, from whom all good things commeth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which all that can bee produced and said in this matter hath no taste. So that it is easily to be seenc how little the stn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Philosophie serveth to the finding out or attaining of the Felicitie of man. For though a man bee fortified with

much w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>t at. And to let thee know (that I may not be mistaken) the cause which moved mce to take this matter in hand: after the experience of many years, in which I have lived and runne a great part of my race at random with the multitude feeking for I know not what, nor where to finde that I sought; estimating things rather by a common custome, than an upright judgement, I beganne at length with more vigilancie to observes he states of life and condition of men. And musing within my selfe to what end and purpose, and whereof it should come to passe, that men were so earnestly occupied in such varictic of labours and exdle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> travels, to seeke after that they could never finde, and the more they had gotten of that they saught, the lesse they found of that they desired to have: I compared learned mens opinions and precepts with worldly mens lives and manners; whereby I perceived that an erroneous opinion, and wrong estimation of things, was the chiefe cause that bindered their attnining to the end of their desires. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man desireth an happy estate, but because they doe not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>t mistake some other thing for that they seeks after, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver finde that they would have. The consideration whereof, joyned with the calamities and troubles with which men are arrested so soone as they enter into this world, and the perils
<pb facs="4"/>
and alterations to which they are subject, and with griefe suffer in this life, both in bodie and minde, in goods and possessions, some by their owne fault, others by Gods crosse, (whereof I have not onely beene in others <hi>oculatus testis,</hi> but also in my selfe in some part a sensible witnesse) brought forth such as it is, this Discourse of mans Felicitie For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desirous to remove out of my head the cogitations that distempered my minde, I could finde no better meanes, than after <hi>Seneca</hi> his counsell to his friend <hi>Lucilius,</hi> to write of something for my exercise, <hi>simplicistilo,</hi> that my head might be possessed with better matter. And as I was consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering with my selfe what to write, the occasion that moved me to take my penin hand, min stred also matter whereof to write. For medisating with my selfe upon the variable and uncertaine state and condition of men, calling to minde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things written thereof by divers Authors, and being wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap> wherewith my head was overladen, I could not find a more apt subject for my purpose, than to discourse <hi>cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siori Minerva</hi> upon the Felicitie of man. Which kinde of exercise I perceived might be profitable to me, as well by the comfort I should receive by perusing the sayings and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of wise and learned men, as also by renewing the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of divers things which I had long sinceread, &amp; almost forgotten, and of a multitude of matter, to draw out so much as I thought necessarie, and the same for my recreation: and to make it more favoric to my taste, sometimes to interlarde with mine owne opinion and conceit: And joyning to the things I have read, the observation of mens maners, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience I have had of worldly matters, I might see <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>nderance to the happinesse they seeke after; their minds many times being tormented with a suspended hope of that which when they have obtained, utterly overthroweth them. Some desire to passe their life in Epicures pleasures, others would have <hi>Croesus</hi> riches, the rest <hi>Caesars</hi> fortune, all <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> years, which varietie of motions in mens minds, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undertaken to discourse upon this subject, occasioned mee to use the helpe of learned Authours in searching out wherein the felicitie and <hi>Summum bonum</hi> of man doth consist. And as I was seeking for this felicitie and the way to it, I fell into the company of certaine Philosophers, who dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted me to the branch that riseth on the right side out of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> letter; which said they, would conduct me to the path that leadeth to the thing I sought. But some of them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advised, taught that the Felicitie of man, his soveraigne good and beatitude, is to bee joyned with God in the life to come, &amp; cannot be enjoyed in this life, &amp; the meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is the purgation and perfection of life, by entring into our consciences, and searching our sins, and confessing them to God: Which caused me not a little to wonder, how men by reason only and by instinct of nature, could bee capable of so divine knowledge. But when I saw them there to stay, and could proceede no further, and except I left their companie and followed a better guide, they would leave me in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the way (for of the confession of our sinnes followeth damnation, except God bee pacified and made mercifull to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>) I tooke my leave of the Philosophers, and followed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther path, unknown to them, which leadeth directly to feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and beatitude, by the grace of God through his Sonne our Saviour Christ Iesus. I have therefore rejected the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers opinions (of whom neverthelesse I think reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) as not sufficiently conformable to Christianity, though I
<pb facs="5"/>
have applid many of their sayings to my purpose. And I have laboured to discover the error of them by many examples, that in the course of their life seeme to set their felicity in those things that bring men to infelicity. And I have enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the narration of some histories more than the due me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of writing requireth, which I might with lesse labour have abridged: it may serve neverthelesse to that common end of the Poets, either to profit or delight:

      </gap>th to diceplayers, that gaine more by the bye than by the maine. It may bee profitable also to see the errours and passions of them discovered, by the disordered course of their life, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary kinde of death that have set their felicity in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, riches, honour &amp; glory, and such like worldly vanities, which to all, except they be well used, are hinderance to feli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      </gap>
      <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and have brought many to extreme misery. I have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the names of many authors, whose a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>thority and sayings I do vouch and alledge, not with meaning to decke my selfe with stolen feathers, but because many of them are fallen out of my memory, and to avoid a confusion of superfluous words by the multitude of names: and yet divers were noted by me in the margent, that are left out by the writer, I wish they were all knowne to you, that their authority might give the more credit to the matter. I desire rather to be taken for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator of other mens sayings and opinions, than to arrogate such sufficiency as to be Author of any thing my selfe. Many things written by divers Authors, dispersed into sundry vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, serving to divers ends, I have simply collected and applyed to my purpose, without any affected stile. For as <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> saith, Nothing is spoken that hath not been spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; So men use to alter the forme and order, and set forth
<pb facs="6"/>
the matter with other words and diversity of application; which maketh their writings seeme to bee a new invention, wherc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>
      </gap>: ndeed hardly can any thing bee written that hath not beene, though in another sort and application, written before. For how is it possible among such an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of bookes, which daily increase beyond measure, that any thing can be alledged, though it come to him from his owne invention, but the same by some man hath been written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though in another forme &amp; order, and to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose? But a collection of things that lye dispersed in many authors with an apt application to one speciall purpose, may be both profitable and delightfull to the Reader. The Cooke, the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">
         <desc>•…</desc>

      </gap>, the third to dresse up the house, all making the same thing serve to severall purposes: So have I walked in the Muses garden, and perusing divers sorts of things, applyed by the Authors to divers uses, I have gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together some of those which I thought most fit to serve my purpose: and although they were good as they lay scattered, yet being gathered together and applyed to some speciall use, they are made more profitable than as they lay dispersed. For this is not the least fruit that may bee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of learning, to select the sayings and opinions of learned men, with examples of life out of histories that lye dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed, and apply them to some speciall use and purpose. Hee bath a great advantage to the providence and foresight of things to come, that joyneth the knowledge of things past with his experience of the time present. Nothing is more ava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

If any man take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of offence, because they finde the abuses and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of themselves, their estate or profession discovered, by which they are subject to reprehension: let them consider that my intent and scope is to search for the felicity of man; and to see whether it hath any part in this life. In doing whereof I was driven to examine the principall estates of life, not in any particular Countrey or Common wealth but generally through the world, and to discover the evill I found in them; and yet not all that I have found written in other Authors, nor that may truly be spoken, but so much as I thought sufficient to make for my purpose. For whon I note the abuses of some estates of life and manners of men, as not sufficiently furnished with the things that should lead men to felicity, my meaning is, the abuses of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, reported by credible Authors, and not of mine owne, saving when I name our Nation, (where neverthelesse I wish that all things were so well as there were no cause to finde any fault.) And yet nothing is so generally spoken, but it doth admit some exception. But he that shall walke in so large and spacious a field, as to treate of this subject where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he must be enforced to looke into the condition and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of men, and to unfold, for the truths sake, the abuses

and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

The consideration whereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

   <p>The truth (as it is commonly sayd) purchaseth displeasure, and soothing or flattery winneth good will. <hi>Caius Lucili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> a learned man is reported to say, that he wished the things which hee had written, might neither be read of them that bee altogether unlearned, nor of them that were very well learned because the one sort understand nothing, the other know per adventer more than hee.

Some like nothing but new matter that commeth from the Authors owne invention: others delight to have it intermingled with examples of antiquity, and the opinions and sayings of learned men: which agreeth so aptly with my disposition, that it occasioned mee to collect many histories and examples, with grave sayings and sentences out of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Authors, as it were of old stuffe to help erect a new buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, not naming alwaies the Authors, because they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap> morall vertue, or in the action of vertue, after the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickes and Peripateticks, nor in Philosophicall contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation: In the fift, I have declared mine owne opinion of the felicity and happinesse of this life: In the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, I have shewed wherein consisteth the true felicity and <hi>Summum bonum</hi> of man, and the way to attaine to it. In which Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course if I have missed the marke I shot at, as it may well be, the same per adventure being out of my reach, let him that followeth take a better levell, &amp; beware he shoot not as much too wide on the other side. That I goe before and stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the prick, will helpe his aime that shall follow and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> at the same marke. I may seeme presumptuous, if my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> bee taken as they lye in some places, though meant for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      <pb facs="8"/>
only and order of writing, in taking upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> to shew the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap> to felicity; so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> a matter as hath moved much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie betweene the ancient Wisemen and Philosophers, and the best learned of all ages, and as it were to make my way through them by violence, allowing and rejecting of theirs at my pleasure, as though I were;
<q>
         <l>Nullius astrictus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </q>
   </p>
   <p>For to offer only the pen to the book among so many grave and learned men, in a matter also of such importance, may bee attributed to rashnesse; and to touch the monuments of so many and profound Authors, whose opinions have beene so many ages allowed, may be taken for a kind of sacriledge. But the reverence and love of antiquity ought to be no barre to posterity to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 words">
         <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
      </gap> opinion and conceit in searching for the truth. And because I tooke the matter in hand for mine owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> onely without any meaning to publish it, I was the more bold to give my selfe a warrant freely to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my conceit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> any prejudice to the authority of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. But for that I have not followed the path which they and others have trodden before me, but rather in a sort have broken the yee in a new place, to make my way through after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> owne fancy, and refused to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap> by another mans compasse; me thinkes I heare the sound of <hi>Virgil</hi> his verse in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 words">

   <p>That I have written, though I may seeme to have given my selfe a liberty to think as I list, and not to hang mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon any mans sleeve, I protest to have done it with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, without arrogancie, or meaning to detract from any man his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap>, having drawn mine opinion in a great part from them, whom in all things I have not thought good to follow: Neither is mine intent to take upon me to teach any man, having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">

      </gap> my selfe (as the proverbe is) with

mine owne foot, by which I know my insufficiency; but to discourse onely, leaving to every one his free censure. If any thing hath escaped me by want of diligence or lack of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or by committing overmuch trust to memory, it shall agree with your modesty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> to excuse my ignorance, than to blame my negligence, seeing the matter was taken in hand for my exercise only.</p>
