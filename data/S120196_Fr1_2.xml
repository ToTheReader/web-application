   <head>TO THE RIGHT Honorable GEORGE Lord GOURDON, sonne and heire to the Lord Marquis of <hi>Huntley,</hi> one of his Majesties most Honorable Privy Councell in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and chiefe Captaine of the Company of men at armes, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there by the most Christian King.</head>
   <opener>
      <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
   </opener>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I love not those rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique pens which are alwayes scribling on the Presse (for in the
<pb facs="3"/> multitude of words there must bee much folly) no more do l approve those adust complexions, from whom no intreaty can wrest any drop of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment to the fleece of <hi>Gedion:</hi> for if the one shall bee beaten for the unnecessarie wasting of his masters goods, the other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly shall bee whipt with many stripes for that hee hath hid his masters talent in the earth, and not retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="3"/> his owne unto him with advantage. The consideratiō here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath made mee (the least amongst the thousands of <hi>Levi</hi>) to adventure this small peece to the publique view and censure of the present time: a hazard (I confesse) much greater then I can well sustaine: for <hi>Ioseph</hi> cannot goe to <hi>Dothan,</hi> but hee must bee stript and sold to a <hi>Medianite: Sampson</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not project a wedlock
<pb facs="4"/> at <hi>Timnagh,</hi> but hee must bee flouted by a <hi>Philistine: David</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not congratulate <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> but his legates must bee dismissed with beards halfe sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and garments cut to their buttockes: yea the very Sonne of God shall not cast out an uncleane spirit, but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny</hi> shall say it was by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of devils. What wonder then if these few drops of inke leaping straight from my penne to the
<pb facs="4"/> publique Theater of the world, bee both greedily viewed, and roundly censured? for amids the beames of so pregnant a light, and in the throng of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned writings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spred abroad on this subject, to see a silly <hi>David</hi> acoast the Philistine of <hi>Gath,</hi> may justly seeme to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the rebuke of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah (I know thy hautines, &amp; the pride of thy heart.)</hi> But to this supposed reproch let me answer
<pb facs="5"/> with <hi>David, What have I done? is there not a cause?</hi> or rather let mee say with Iesus Christ, the true Sonne and heire of <hi>David, If I have said evill, beare witnesse of it, but if I have spoken truth why do yee smite mee?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The God whom I serve in the Ministery of his Gospell doth well know, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science also beareth me witnesse, that as in teaching these few ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, I did not affect
<pb facs="5"/> popularity nor praise of men, but his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour who hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured mee with his service, and the good of that people over whom hee put mee in charge, so now when they shall be published to the eyes of all, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, but to the eares of a few: I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ambitious of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar applause (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Camelion to feed on such an aire) nor do I much regard
<pb facs="6"/> the frivolous checks of all that goe by, for
<q>
         <l>
            <hi>Falsus honor juvat, &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dax infamia terret,</hi>
         </l>
         <l>
            <hi>Quem? nisi mendosum, &amp; mendacem.</hi>
         </l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>Therefore whilst I desire to do some ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Church of God, and to contribute my mite to his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or my goates skin to the furniture of his Tabernacle: I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to present it to your honour my good Lord; not onely to begge Patronage from
<pb facs="6"/> your greatnes, but also that by it I may in some measure render due honour unto you for your goodnesse, as one not of their number, who (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf" extent="1 span">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>) are ready to prate of every thing, but able to speake right of nothing; No my Lord I know, and do ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge that as there are none more truly learned, so there is none more sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected to the truth of God, and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb facs="7"/> thereof. Let venemous detracting tongues wound as they list, wisedome shall be justified of all her children: for you have made it apparent to the world by your losse sustained at home and abroad, for the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the truth, that you have accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the reproach of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ to bee grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter riches then all the perishing treasures of Egypt. And if there were no more, yet the
<pb facs="7"/> honourable project &amp; happy successe of that late expedition impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by your Prince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship against the locusts of Rome, raging in our Northerne quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; It hath clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced to the world, that whilst some of deeper profession, (like <hi>Meroz</hi>) durst not come to the helpe of the Lord against the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the earth: you like another <hi>Iael</hi> did
<pb facs="8"/> put your left hand to the naile, and your right hand to the workmans hammer: you have smitten <hi>Sise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> you have smitten him once, and he hath not risen againe. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept then, my good Lord, this poore hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of water, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy I confesse of such a <hi>Persian</hi> Potentate: yet accept in it, not what plenty should offer, but what my penury can afford. The theam is holy, and may serve
<pb facs="8"/> for vesture to a Prince, if it had been wrought in <hi>Bezaleels</hi> loome, yet take it howsoever as an evidence of the love and respect I owe you: pardon but the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the worke is rewarded, and my earnest desire &amp; praier to God shall bee for your Lordship, that your projects may continue holy, your actions honourable, your house and estate prosperous, your death comfortable, and your
<pb facs="9"/> salvation sure in him who hath loved us, and given himselfe for us, a sacrifice without spot or blemish, our Lord Iesus Christ; in whom I am, and shall alwayes endeavour to remaine</p>
