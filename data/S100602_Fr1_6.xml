   <head>To the Reader. T. R. GENTLEMAN.</head>
   <l>THe worthy wittes of elder yeares haue traueld sea and land,</l>
   <l>To seeke and search the wondrous works of naturs skilful hand:</l>
   <l>And mens delight hath euer bin most vgly things to vewe,</l>
   <l>To looke on creatures out of kinde, as monsters olde and newe.</l>
   <l>If therefore thou as other men my friend affected bee,</l>
   <l>And dost desire vgly things, and monsters strange to see:</l>
   <l>Then take the payne to seeke and searche within this little booke,</l>
   <l>And here thou shalt vpon so strang a mongrell monster looke:</l>
   <l>As neuer nature bread on earth, whose shape is in this wyse,</l>
   <l>As I shall partly portrature the same before thine eyes.</l>
   <l>It is a little beast that hath ten hornes, seuen heads, &amp; crownets seuē,</l>
   <l>Who w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> his taile frō clouds to clouds swepes down y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> stars of heauē.</l>
   <l>Upon whose backe in princely pompe, and glistring gold araye,</l>
   <l>And proudly pranckt in precious pearles, and clad in purple gaye,</l>
   <l>The stately strompet sittes, that is the whore of Babilon,</l>
   <l>And in her hand a golden cuppe of fornication.</l>
   <l>Wherwith the world she poysond hath which dronken with her wine,</l>
   <l>Hath falne downe flat vnto the beast, as to a god deuine:</l>
   <l>Which forced kings to leaue their crownes, &amp; Keiser stoupe for awe,</l>
   <l>Whyle on his royall necke the beast hath sayd his filthy pawe.</l>
   <l>Who hath the mighty monarkes made to holde his stirrope lowe,</l>
   <l>And caused them on humble knees to come to kisse his toe:</l>
   <l>Who forced great estates to stand barefooted in the streate,</l>
   <l>And proudly put the crowne on head of princes with his feete.</l>
   <l>And made the sonne and subiect both against their king and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>yre,</l>
   <l>Oft to rebell whose burning breath set all the world on fyre:</l>
   <l>Who hath blasphemd our glorious God, w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> thousand mischiefs more</l>
   <l>Loe to be briefe, such is the beast of whom I spake before.</l>
   <l>Which earst discouered was by <hi>Bale</hi> among the rockes of Rome,</l>
   <l>And by the painfull penne of S. is into England come.</l>
   <l>That euery man may know the same, and learne to shone the beast,</l>
   <l>Who while she lorked close did spye mankinde by East and Weast.</l>
   <l>Accept therfore my friendes good will, that thus his trauell spent,</l>
   <l>Prayse God for it, and him for payne that this vnto thee sent.</l>
