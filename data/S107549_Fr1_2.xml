   <p>IT is now full three yeares, foure times tolde, since; it first pleased God, <hi>by Your hands,</hi> to transplant mee from a more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren soyle, into that no lesse fruitfull than pleasant Place, (<note n="a" place="margin">Queenes Colledge in Cambridge.</note>) like unto the golden Orchard of <hi>Hesperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> if I may not rather liken. It, unto the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> (<note n="b" place="margin">Genes: ch: 13. vers: 10.</note>): as in the midst whereof also there stood A Tree of Knowledge (<note n="c" place="margin">D. Davenant then Master of Q: C: now Bishop of Salisbury.</note>), I tasted of (through Your Favour) <hi>without offence:</hi> yea was ingrafted into It, by <hi>Your Grace.</hi> Which if, after so many yeares, It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect some fruits, I wonder not; but am rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened to present You with these <hi>First.</hi> Which howsoever they belong unto You, as Gods High-Priest (<note n="d" place="margin">Numb: ch: 18. vers: 17.</note>); yet, if worthy any respect, are they Yours, in many respects more; for that indeed my selfe also am: even as punctually obliged unto Your Grace, as ever was <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> (<note n="e" place="margin">2 Sam: ch: 9. vers: 1. &amp;c.</note>), unto that <hi>Man after Gods owne heart</hi> (<note n="f" place="margin">1 Sam: ch: 13. vers: 14.</note>). Blessed bee his name, whose glory it is chiefly; <hi>to bee found of such as seeke him not: and made manifest unto them that looked not after him.</hi> (<note n="g" place="margin">Rom: ch: 10. vers: 20.</note>) What Your sincerity will not that I publish, may it please Him to reward according to his Promise. (<note n="h" place="margin">Matth: ch: 6. vers: 4.</note>) But, me thinkes, I heare a sententious <hi>Seneca:</hi> (<note n="i" place="margin">Quo modo Beneficium non semper recipiendum, sic non uti{que} reddendum. Quare subsidere apud te munus meum non vis? Quare obligatus, molestè fers? quare, quasi cum acerbo Faeneratore, signare rationem parem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras. Senec. de Benefic. lib. 6. cap. 40.</note>) <hi>Quid in me Deos immittis? quo modo exigeres, qui sic reddis?</hi> there is, as a time to receive; so a time to render. Good deeds (as good dayes) would not be sent back, but set

      <pb facs="4"/> downe. He that is urgent to be loosed, shewes he is a weary to be bound. Neither in truth ought wee, to reckon with all men as exactly; as if none gave, but in hope to gaine. Our Saviour is peremptory; <hi>doe good and lend,</hi> (saith hee) <hi>hoping for nothing againe: then shall your reward be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest:</hi> for, He is kind unto the <hi>unthankfull</hi> and to the <hi>Evill.</hi> (<note n="k" place="margin">Luk. ch. 6. vers: 35. Illud certum est, juvandus est proximus; etiam nullae recipiendae sortis habitâ ratione. Bez. annot. in Loc. Beneficiae qui dat, Deos imitatur; qui repetit, Faeneratores. Seneca de Benef. lib. 3. cap. 15.</note>) and if the <hi>Spirit,</hi> of such thus jointly; will not Your Clemency pardon me: since, if I have beene more troublesome, yet hath it been, but that I might not be; <hi>lesse good.</hi> Otherwise (not unworthily) might my hopes also melt away, <hi>as the winters hoare frost; and and as the hope of the unthankefull</hi> (so paraphraseth it Our Living-Library) (<note n="l" place="margin">Iohan. Sarisbur. Episcop. Comment: in Coloss. cap. 4. vers. 2.</note>) <hi>runne away as unprofitable wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> (<note n="m" place="margin">Wisdom. ch. 16. vers. 29.</note>) Yet am I not over-sollicitous, how to render, that were to repent (as it were) that ever I received, (<note n="n" place="margin">Paenitet accepti Beneficij, quam nondum redditi piget. Quare qui tibi dignus visus est a quo acciperes, indignus videatur cui debeas? Senec. de Benefic. lib. 6. cap. 42.</note>) or ashamed to owe, where I foresee a necessitie (if I will live wel) to borrow. To the praise of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, long may his Church enjoy Your Grace: even <hi>until</hi> (for Zions sake) <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> that (againe) (<note n="o" place="margin">Haec enim primo ac proprie de Iudaeorum à Babylonijs gloriosâ Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratione.

      <hi>goe forth as brightnesse, and the Salvation thereof as a Lampe that burneth: untill Jerusalem also that be, as a crowne of glory in the hands of the Lord; as a rich diademe in the hands of thy God.</hi> (<note n="p" place="margin">Isay ch. 62. vers: 1. &amp;c.</note>) So prayeth unto Christ</p>
