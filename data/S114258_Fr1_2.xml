   <head>To the right Worshipfull, Sir THOMAS PVCKERING, Knight and Baronet, and to his vertuous and religious Lady, increase of all saving graces here, and everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting peace and rest in heaven.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Sermon preached at the funerall of your dearest childe, (who was a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saint on earth, and is now a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one in heaven) I doe humbly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to you both; it being yours by all manner of right, and the best Present J am able to present your Worships with. My poore paines taken herein, J heartily acknowledge to deserve neither yours, nor the acceptation of any that are judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but the speeches which proceeded from the heavenly mouth of your blessed Daughter, which are here related, deserve in the judgement of wise and good men, to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in letters of Gold, and to be known and read of all men, being full of life and power to quicken the dullest soule to a love and liking of the wayes of godlinesse.</p>
   <p>The desire to heare this Sermon preached, was great, and generall, as appeared by the great confluence of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of Towne and Country; neither is it doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that some good was then wrought upon many souls</p>
   <p>And the desire to have it published, is greater and more generall, there being hope conceived that much glory may be brought to God, and much edification to men, by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the worke of God upon so tender yeares.</p>
   <pb facs="3"/>
   <p>Your Worships have much honoured God and your selves, by bearing so great a triall with such admirable patience and comfort. What remaineth, but that you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes set before your eyes this matchlesse patterne which proceeded from your owne bowels, for your imitation; that as you were instruments to give her a temporall life, so she (though dead, yet speaking) may be an happy instrument, though not to give, yet to increase and maintaine the life of grace and consolation in your soules.</p>
   <p>You have begunne to cleave to Christ with firme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ull purpose of heart; and the world observeth, that you are already rich gainers by this great losse. Goe on I beseech you, and grow daily in the exemplary practise of a really religious life, being fully assured, that he whose glory you seeke, and whose yoke you beare, will in due time make up this breach, and recompence this losse, if not in the same kinde, (which I pray and hope) yet in some other, which shall be most for his glory, and your comfort in the end.</p>
   <p>Neither is there cause that you should overmuch lament the losse of this one childe, seeing God hath blessed you with many children, though but one living, (upon whom, God Almighty double his blessings) For (to omit many, whose parents in effect you are) may I not call those sixe poore children in <hi>Warwicke</hi> for whom you have provided honest and profitable trades and callings, every seven yeares successively to the worlds end. (of whose death there is no feare while the common wealth and lawes continue in life) your children?</p>
   <p>But fearing, lest J should exceed the bounds of an Epistle desiring your favourable acceptance of this poore expression of my thankefull minde for your many favours, J humbly take my leave, and rest</p>
