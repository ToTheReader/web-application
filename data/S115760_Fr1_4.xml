   <head>The Preface of the Author.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>THe holy Scripture doth admonish vs, to seeke God diligently. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God is not farre from euery one of vs,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Act. 17</note> For in him we liue, and mooue, and be, <hi>As the Apostle saith: yet wee are farre from God, so that vnlesse we daily dispose our heartes to ascend, and make for our selues a</hi> Ladder <hi>vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and with great labour seeke God, we shall with the</hi> Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Sonne,
<note place="margin">Luke 15</note> feede Swine in a country, far off from our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and home.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>And that we may briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how these things may stand together, to wit, that God is not
<pb facs="8"/>farre from vs: And yet we are farre from him; we say, that God is not farre from vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he alwaies seeth vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whose eyes all things are present: He alwaies thinketh of vs,
<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5</note> because</hi> He hath care of vs; <hi>He alwaies toucheth vs,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1</note> because</hi> Hee carrieth all thinges by the word of his power; <hi>But we are farre from God, because we see not God, neither can we see him,</hi>
      <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6</note> For he inhabiteth light not accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: neither are we sufficient to thinke any thing of God of our selues,
<note place="margin">
         <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. Cor. 3</note> as of our selues. <hi>Much lesse are we able to touch him, and cleaue to him with pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affection, vnlesse his right hand receiue and drawe vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And therefore</hi> Dauid
<pb facs="8"/>
      <hi>when he had said:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 62</note> My soule hath cleaued after thee, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently added,</hi> Thy right hand hath receiued me. <hi>Neither are we onely farre from God because wee cannot see him, nor easily thinke of him, nor with affection cleaue vnto him: but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause being busied about tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall goods, with the which we are incompassed and ouerwhelmed; we very easily forget God, and with a drie hart we scarcely with our tongue sound his name in Psalmes and sacred prayers.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>This therefore is the cause, why the holy Ghost doth in the holy Scripture (as we said euen now) so often admonish vs to seeke God:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 61</note> Seeke God and your Soule shall liue. <hi>And</hi> Seeke his face alwaies.
<note place="margin">Psal. 104</note>
      <hi>And</hi>
      <pb facs="9"/>Our Lord is good to them that hope in him,
<note place="margin">Lamen. 3</note> to the soule that seeketh him.
<note place="margin">Isay 49</note>
      <hi>And</hi> seeke our Lord whilst he may be found.
<note place="margin">Wisd. 1 Deut 4</note>
      <hi>And,</hi> In simplicitie of hart seeke him. <hi>And,</hi> when thou shalt seeke God, thou shalt finde him: yet so, if thou seeke him with all thy hart.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>But although this diligence in seeking God, belong vnto all the faithfull: yet it most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly appertaineth vnto the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Church, as St.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, <hi>St.</hi> Gregorie, <hi>St.</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard <hi>and other holy Fathers doe witnesse. For they plainely write, that a Prelate cannot proffit both himselfe and others, vnlesse he diligently applie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto the Meditation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine matters, &amp; the reparation
<pb facs="9"/>of his owne minde St.</hi> Augustine <hi>in his bookes of the Cittie of God saith:</hi>
      <note place="margin">19 Ciu. 19</note> Ocium Sanctum quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit charitas veritatis, &amp;c. The loue of truth seeketh holy rest: the necessitie of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vndertaketh iust busines; but neither is the delight of truth to be altogether forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, least the sweetnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being withdrawne, the necessitie of busines oppresse. <hi>And the same St.</hi> Augustine <hi>speaking in his Confessions of himselfe, and of his frequent Meditation of God by creatures saith:</hi> Sepe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>stud facio, &amp;c.
<note place="margin">10. Conf. c. 40.</note> I often doe this: It delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, and when I can be spared from my necessarie busines, I haue recourse vnto this pleasure. <hi>St. Gregorie in
<pb facs="10"/>his booke of pastorall Charge saith:</hi>
      <note place="margin">2. par. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor. 5</note> Sit Rector &amp;c. Let a Prelate be equall vnto any in compassion, and before all in contemplation, that through the bowels of pietie be may transferr the infirmities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnto himselfe, and by the height of Contemplation in seeking after things inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he may exceed himselfe. <hi>And St.</hi> Gregorie <hi>in the same place, bringeth the example of</hi> Moyses <hi>and</hi> Christ. <hi>For</hi> Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <hi>often went into the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and came out; He went in, that he might contemplate Gods Secrets; he came out, that hee might beare with the infirmities of his neighbours. And Christ himselfe in the day time, by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and working miracles,
<pb facs="10"/>sought the saluation of his neighbours, but the night hee passed ouer without sleepe in prayer and contemplation. For</hi> he passed <hi>(saith St. Luke)</hi> the whole night in the prayer of God.
<note place="margin">Luke 6</note>
      <hi>Many thinges also like vnto these may be read in the last chapter of the same booke.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Moreouer St.</hi> Bernard <hi>to admonish seriously Pope</hi> Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius <hi>who was sometime his scholler, not to giue himselfe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to action, but sometime euery day to recollect himselfe, and to enioy holy rest and heauenly foode, writ fiue bookes of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration; <hi>in the which he doth not onely exhort him vnto the daily Meditation of diuine thinges; but also doth plainely teach him the manner &amp; method
<pb facs="11"/>how to meditate, and by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to ascend, and by ascenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to vnite himselfe vnto God in vnderstanding and affection. Neither doth he admitt that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse which he might haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and which many now a dayes pretend; to wit, that the ouer-many businesses wherewith the office of a Bishop is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied, would not afford him ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure enough to apply himsele vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mediation of diuine things For none truely ought to giue himselfe so wholy to outward businesses, but that he may take sometime to strengthen his body with meate drinke and sleepe. And if the body doe duely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this refection and rest, with how much more reason doth the soule require her meate and rest?
<pb facs="11"/>neither can she without this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, truely execute her office by any means, amidst the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of so many great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. But the meate of the soule is prayer, and her rest is contemplation, by the which</hi> Ascentions <hi>are framed in the hart,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 83</note> That the God of Gods may be seene in Syon; <hi>as much as in this vaile of teares he maybe seene.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>But wee mortall men (as it seemeth) can finde no other</hi> Ladder <hi>whereby to ascend vnto God, but by the workes of God: For those who by the singular gift of God, haue (by an other way) beene admitted into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to heare Gods</hi> Secrets, which it is not lawfull for a man to speake; <hi>are not said to
<pb facs="12"/>haue Ascended, but to haue bene wrapt. Which</hi> St. Paul <hi>doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confesse of himselfe, when he saith,</hi>
      <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12</note> I was wrapt into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: and I heard secret wordes, which it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a man to speake.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>And that a man may by the workes of God, that is, by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ascend vnto the knowledge and loue of the Creator, the book of Wisdome doth teach,
<note place="margin">Wisd. 13 Rom. 1</note> and the Apostle to the</hi> Romans, <hi>and reason it selfe doth sufficiently confirme, since the efficient cause may be knowne by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and the example by the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: neither can there be any doubt, but that all creatures are the workes of God, and that men and Angels, are not onely his workes but also his Images, as
<pb facs="12"/>the holy Scripture teacheth vs.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>I therefore being mooued by these reasons, hauing obtained some small vacancie from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique affaires, and admonished by the example of</hi> St. Bonauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>who in the like vacancie writ a booke intituled</hi> The Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage of the minde vnto God; <hi>haue essayed from the contemplation of creatures, to make a</hi> Ladder <hi>by the which we may in some sort ascend vnto God. And I haue deuided it into fifteene</hi> Stepps, <hi>in resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the fifteene stepps by the which they went vp into the Temple of</hi> Salomon, <hi>and of the fifteene Psalmes which are called Gradualles.</hi>
