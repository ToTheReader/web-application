   <lg>
      <l>I Which in bloudy warres haue sleep'd my pen,</l>
      <l>Whose Muse the passing bell of peace did wring,</l>
      <l>And how the world did loose a world of men,</l>
      <l>Now chuse to touch a more concordant string,</l>
      <l>My Prince his prayse, whose prayse Ile euer sing.</l>
      <l>Tis no mechanicke hope of hired gaine</l>
      <l>That mou'd my minde these labours to sustaine.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>No, that ignoble basenesse I abiure,</l>
      <l>It was the loue I euer bare the place</l>
      <l>Where first I breathed life did me allure,</l>
      <l>In pleasant paines for to consume a space,</l>
      <l>And her to prayse, though with mine owne disgrace:</l>
      <l>With my disgrace, why? though my verse be ill,</l>
      <l>I do not doubt to please the good with will.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>To thee Iudicious Reader do I send</l>
      <l>These fruites of youth, tis thee I hope to please:</l>
      <l>If that my muse the ignorant offend,</l>
      <l>No lines of mine their fury shall appease,</l>
      <l>I set iust warre before an vniust peace,</l>
      <l>I rayle not I, though I with <hi>Plato</hi> say,</l>
      <l>To please the wise, must bee the wisest way.</l>

      <l>THe lotted seruant to rhy Infant age,</l>
      <l>Thrice glorious issue of a gracious King,</l>
      <l>Least that her twelue-monthes fearefull tapynage,</l>
      <l>Ingratitude suspect to thee should bring,</l>
      <l>Me, though vnworthy, chose thy prayse to sing</l>
      <l>Her mourning garments she hath cast aside,</l>
      <l>And hopes ere long to entertaine her Bride.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The Cleargie with the Barons borrowed light,</l>
      <l>Is now obscured by thy transplendant shine:</l>
      <l>The Rochet nor the Border hath no right</l>
      <l>To rule, but that which doth from thee decline,</l>
      <l>She ioyes and glories to be onely thine:</l>
      <l>Shee deemes it honour, count it no dispraise</l>
      <l>For thee with her to spend thy yonger dayes.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>No matchles <hi>Machauil,</hi> nor <hi>Arietine,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Doth her plaine meaning breast with enuy breede,</l>
      <l>Her wits do moderne seeme, and not diuine,</l>
      <l>Loyall her loue though lowly is her weede,</l>
      <l>A sympathie there is of word and deede:</l>
      <l>Such as these are, in <hi>Wales</hi> thine eyes shall see,</l>
      <l>Thousands that will both liue and dye with thee.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>O was she euer false, vntrue, vnkinde?</l>
      <l>Since her obedience did augment thy stile?</l>
      <l>Or since the parted Roses were combinde,</l>
      <l>Did euer rebels blood her brest defile?</l>
      <l>Or did she euer Englands hopes beguile?</l>
      <l>Witnesse the world, and those that liue therein,</l>
      <l>Her spotlesse soule did neuer taste that sin.</l>
   </lg>

      <pb facs="34"/>
      <l>Search Truthes Records, not times illuding lines,</l>
      <l>Then shall thy Princely thoughts and eyes be fed</l>
      <l>With the strange wonders of those warlike times,</l>
      <l>When thy great Grandsyres made our channels red</l>
      <l>With blood of those that on our shoares laie dead.</l>
      <l>Teaching great <hi>Caesar</hi> how to runne away,</l>
      <l>That neuer knew to slye before that day.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Ten yeares did <hi>Rome</hi> and all the world admire,</l>
      <l>For all the world and <hi>Rome</hi> ten yeares did feare</l>
      <l>The lusture of thy Bekons set on fire,</l>
      <l>Great <hi>Odonisis</hi> King, <hi>Character,</hi>
      </l>
      <l>Whose endlesse worth my worthlesse Muse shall reare</l>
      <l>To that bright Spheare where honor doth remaine,</l>
      <l>She loues thee dead, thy life her loue did gaine.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>VVhat honor or what glory didst thou win</l>
      <l>VVith the earthes strength to conquer but an Ile,</l>
      <l>Maister of the worlds mistres, mightie King?</l>
      <l>Only this grac'd the greatnes of thy stile,</l>
      <l>
         <hi>Claudius</hi> with blood did not his hands defile.</l>
      <l>This triumph <hi>Rome</hi> did thee as highly grace,</l>
      <l>As when by <hi>Scipio Affrique</hi> conquered was.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>How many Legions <hi>Caesar</hi> didst thou send?</l>
      <l>How many Consuls did returne of thine,</l>
      <l>VVhich sought what others marr'd, by warres to mend?</l>
      <l>How many Emperours <hi>Britaine</hi> did repine,</l>
      <l>To see thy honor rise, their praise decline.</l>
      <l>Let <hi>Tacitus</hi> vnto the world declare,</l>
      <l>No land saue <hi>Rome</hi> might with this land compare.</l>

      <l>I know yong Prince, and am agreeu'd to see</l>
      <l>The leeuy'd lookes of squint-cyde <hi>Theonyn:</hi>

      <l>No enuious <hi>Momist</hi> tis no fault of mine:</l>
      <l>That seme are so, I must confesse tis true,</l>
      <l>All are not bad of vs, nor good of you.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>The mellow fields haue tares as well as corne,</l>
      <l>And thistles grow amidst the greenest grasse:</l>
      <l>An <hi>Anacharse</hi> in <hi>Tartary</hi> was borne,</l>
      <l>Vertue and vice do meete in euery place,</l>
      <l>

      <l>Both good and bad in euery land we see,</l>
      <l>And so are you, if of a land ye bee.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Curbe the malignant pride of enuies rage,</l>
      <l>And checke the stubborne stomackes of disdaine,</l>

   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>I speake not this vnto the learned wise,</l>
      <l>For them I loue, because the truth they loue:</l>
      <l>Tis the bleard iudgement of seditious eyes,</l>
      <l>That doth my muse and my affection moue,</l>
      <l>A most vnwilling Satirist to proue:</l>
      <l>Nature hath made me milde, but these hard men</l>

      <l>Play not the Satyr peace affecting muse,</l>
      <l>I doubt not but their conscience will prouoke</l>
      <l>These Lucilists their follies to refuse,</l>
      <l>And make them soft, though they were hard as oke,</l>
      <l>Conscience makes bad men good, so wise men spoke</l>
      <l>I leaue them to their spurres, my muse shall flye</l>
      <l>Vnto that Sphere where enuy dares not prye.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Vnto that Sphere whose circuit doth containe</l>
      <l>The neuer spotted essence of his soule,</l>
      <l>Whose sacred intellect no worldly staine</l>
      <l>Could with desires rebelling aide controule:</l>
      <l>This guilded Sphere is like a golden boule,</l>
      <l>Which many lesser mazers doth containe,</l>
      <l>So many vertues in this one do raigne.</l>
   </lg>
   <lg>
      <l>Why parriall nature stepdame to my birth,</l>

      <l>O were my wit but equall to my will,</l>
