   <head>¶A LETTER OF SIR Humfrey Gilbert, Knight, sent to his Brother, Sir IOHN GILBERT, of Compton, in the Countie of Deuon Knight, concerning the discourse of this Discouerie.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, YOV</hi> might iustly haue charged mee with an vnsetled head if I had at any time taken in hand, to discouer <hi>Vtopia,</hi> or any countrey fained by imagination: But <hi>Cataia</hi> is none such, it is a countrey, well knowen to be described and set foorth by all moderne <hi>Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> whose authoritie in this art (contrarie to all other) bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="12"/>
most credit, and the passage thereunto, by the <hi>Northwest</hi> from vs, through a sea which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the <hi>Northside</hi> of <hi>Labra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> mencioned &amp; prooued, by no smal number of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, and best learned amongst them. By whose authoritie, if I (amongest others) haue beene moued, to hope of that passage, who can iustly blame me? sith euerie man is best to be credited and beleeued,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Cuique in sua arte cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum est.</hi>
      </note> in his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed art and science, wherin he doth most excell.</p>
   <p>And if I would not giue that credit, to those authours which they deserue, but were so wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto my owne ignorance,
<pb facs="12"/>
that neither the authoritie of learned <hi>Geographers,</hi> the reasons of wise <hi>Philosophers,</hi> nor the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of painfull <hi>Trauellers,</hi> might persuade me to belieue a trueth: Then might I iustly be accompted selfe willed (which a learner ought chiefly to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewe) holding for a <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> that, <hi>Discentem oportet crede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> And knowing you to be one that may easily be induced to hearken, and yeelde to reason, I will briefly opē vnto you, some fewe of the grounds of mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, to the ende you may the better vnderstād, that my hope of this discouerie and passage, was not so rashe, or foolishe, as
<pb facs="13"/>
you heretofore haue deemed: but contrariwise, grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a very sure foundation, and that not vnaduisedly, but after long consideration &amp; great con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferēce, had with such as I knew to be both wise, learned, and of great experience, as well tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this passage, as the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull welth and commodities, which might, and would ensue thereby, it being once discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: whose abundance of riches &amp; treasure, no man of learning, and iudgement doubteth, for that the countreys themselues, and their commodities, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly knowen by sundrie mens experience.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="13"/>But as it is one thing to speak, and an other by reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, so I wil briefly do my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to proue the same. And haue herewithall sent you, for your better vnderstandinge, a rough draught, of a vniuersall Map in the end of the boke, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiēt to explane the matter, with those names only in effect which are mencioned in this discourse: to the ende that by resorting to this general Mappe, &amp;c. finding without difficultie, euerie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place mencioned herein, you may the better gather my meaning, and conceiue my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, alledged for the proofe of this passage, nowe in question:
<pb facs="14"/>
which I wil proue three wayes.</p>
   <p>Al which, I haue diuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to seuerall chapters, which may fully deliuer vnto you the whol contents of this worke, by their seuerall titles: as followeth. Fare you well from my lodging the last of Iune, Anno D. 1566.</p>
