   <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER, CONCER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING FOVRE OTHER INFAMOVS Libels lately diuulged and sent into England by <hi>Parsons, Kellison</hi> and <hi>Walpoole.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>BEfore the fornter answer could be finished and published, there came to my hands foure other bookes, all penned by our mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aduersaries, and sent ouer frō <hi>Rome</hi> and other places into <hi>England,</hi> to disturne simple people from the loue of the truth: of which I haue thought good (most Christian Reader) here at the end of this work briefly to aduertise thée. I hope also, that the same aduertisement wil serue for present satisfactiō to those which percase expect a spéedie answer to such hastic calumniations, and most wicked libels.</p>
   <p>The first is set out vnder the name of <hi>T. F. alias Thomas Fitzherbert,</hi> a man euill reported of by his owne conforts; and therefore no maruell if hatefull to all men wel affected to their prince and countrey. Long he hath bene a spie, and pensioner of the king of <hi>Spaine.</hi> But now perceiuing belike that the trade is become odious, &amp; groweth out of request, he is turned Masse priest, and set to sing for the soules of his friends, after thrée farthings a Masse. And least he might forget his old art of spiery, he is now set to spy for his holy father, if by any good aduenture he can sée Christs true body lurking vnder the accidents of the Masse-cake, his bloud by a necessary concomitance, as they say, being not farre off. This fellow as a Masse-priest was thought a fit person to speake for the Masse, and as a spie and renegate Englishmā to speake shame of his country, and to defend traitors. And
<pb n="364" facs="177"/>
yet the poore man is as fit to dispute of the massing religion and popish subtilties, as an asse to play an antheme vpon a paire of organs. The true author of the booke, as his stile declareth, and the dealers in the edition must néeds witnes, is <hi>Robert Parsons,</hi> an old hackster in missifical quarels, and a great dealer in matter of conuersion of <hi>England,</hi> and one that vseth at his pleasure to borrow other mens names, now calling himselfe Captaine <hi>Cowbucke,</hi> now <hi>Dolman,</hi> now <hi>Iohn Houlet,</hi> now <hi>N. D.</hi> or Noddy, now <hi>T. F.</hi> or <hi>Tom Fop,</hi> now <hi>Robert Parsons.</hi> Under the name of <hi>Dolman</hi> he set out his traitorous &amp; seditious booke of succession, in disgrace of the Kings title. Under the name of <hi>Iohn Houlet</hi> he publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed certaine idle <hi>reasons of refusall:</hi> himselfe neuer refusing to attempt any mischiefe against the State. Under the title of <hi>N. D.</hi> he set out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his <hi>VVardword</hi> and <hi>VVarneword,</hi> stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing his manship with the perpetual note of a Noddy, implied by those two letters <hi>N. D.</hi> And this course he tooke in <hi>T. F.</hi> his Apologie.</p>
   <p>The second is entitled <hi>A treatise of three conuersions of England:</hi> and was set out by <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> also vnder the old stampe of <hi>N. D.</hi> whose signification euery child now knoweth to be Noddy. But why he should write of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of his countrey to religion, we can sée no reason, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we haue knowne him alwaies more studious of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, then of the conuersion of <hi>England,</hi> and his consorts the Masse priests do testifie that he is a Machiauelian pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fellow, boyd of religion and honesty. The turnings of the Masse, or turning of iackets, had bene a more fit subiect for him to handle, seeing he furneth &amp; skippeth so oft about the altar, like an ape dauncing about a maypole, and hath turned his coate so often from <hi>English</hi> to <hi>Romish,</hi> from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> to <hi>Spanish,</hi> from all to <hi>French,</hi> that some of his friends feare, vnlesse he turne Cardinall, that he will turne <hi>Turke.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The third is called <hi>A Suruey of the new religion:</hi> and was deuised by a renegued fugitiue Englishman, who hath sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed diuers other countries, and yet neuer found any set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement in his braine or habitation. Like <hi>Caine</hi> he hath bin
<pb n="365" facs="177"/>
long a vagrant fugitiue fellow: <hi>Vagus &amp; profugus in terra:</hi> and séeketh, if not to kill, yet to slander his countrimen and friends, imputing vnto them most horrible opinions and crimes. It resteth then, that we set vpon him a mark as vpō <hi>Caine,</hi> that euery man may know him for a suppost of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: although herein we néed not much to trauell, seeing the first letter of <hi>Kellisons</hi> name, who fathereth this monstrous moonecalfe, is K. and the man is noted among his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a great quareller about his commons. The poore fellow is but a kettle doctor, or rather a Tinker of broken schoole distinctions, and a professor rather then a performer of any diuine learning. The fellow talketh idly of <hi>new reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> but neither doeth he know what is new, nor what is old, nor what belongeth to religion, that taketh popery for religion, and esteemeth the masse and decretaliue doctrine, which this Church of <hi>England</hi> refuseth, to be auncient: and the apostolike faith which we professe, to be new.</p>
   <p>The fourth is termed <hi>A briefe and cleare confutation of a new, vaine, and vanting challenge:</hi> and is directed against a treatise set out some two or thrée yeares agone by mee; wherein is proued, that the Masse-priests and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are neither Catholikes nor good Christians. But so learnedly and wisely hath the author of this braggard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation handled the matter, that his good friends are sory to sée so worthy a worke misnamed. For if he had done me right he should haue called his pamphlet <hi>A confirmation of my challenge,</hi> for so in truth it is, the author answering no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, and rather by silence consenting, then by good answering contradicting our arguments. The most of his discourse standeth vpon bitter railing, vaine talking, and childish trifling about serious matters. If any man doubted whether popery were heresie before, I doubt not but that this weake discourse, that yéeldeth no satisfaction to any indifferent Reader may resolue him. The author of this deuise, as we are credibly informed, is <hi>VValpoole,</hi> the ruler of the kitchin or porredge pot of the colledge of yong English popish traitors in <hi>Rome.</hi> In Italian they call him

traitors and empoysoners.</p>
   <p>The treatise of thrée conuersiōs is deuided into two parts. The summe and scope of the first is comprised in these few words: <hi>England hath bin thrise conuerted to Christian religiō by preachers sent from Rome: ergo England is to submit it selfe to the Pope, and to accept of that religion which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth vnto vs.</hi> This <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> doth suppose to be a good consequence. For else he should but trifle in his whole discourse, and then especially where he talketh <hi>of our obligation to the sea of Rome,</hi> &amp; of <hi>S. Peters</hi> chaire. Neither doeth he doubt but to proue his triple conuersion, and that in honor of the Popes triple crowne. But if we do well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his grounds and allegations, we shall find, that vnder the title of <hi>S. Peters chaire,</hi> and apostolical doctrine, the man doth séek nothing else but to recommend vnto vs the Popes close stoole, with a decoction of his decretaliue doctrine, and most beastly abominations.</p>
   <p>The grounds of the whole discourse are false, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference made out of them, most weake and euil concluding. First, most false it is that <hi>Britannie,</hi> or as <hi>Parsons</hi> sayth <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> was thrise conuerted by preachers sent from <hi>Rome.</hi> Of <hi>Peters</hi> preaching in <hi>Britaine,</hi> whereupon the first suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed conuersion standeth, the obliuious fellow is but lately aduised. For in his <hi>Wardword,</hi> wherein he maketh the best ward for <hi>Rome</hi> that he can, he could not find any more then two conuersions: and those he rather fancieth then proueth. His proofes for <hi>S. Peters</hi> preaching in <hi>England,</hi> stand wholy vpon the testimony of <hi>Simeon Metaphrastes,</hi> a lying pedant full of fabulous narrations, whereto the aduersaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues make conscience to giue credit: of <hi>Surius a Carthusian</hi> Monke, and a great eater of stockfish, and a codshead para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site hired to speak for the Pope: and vpon a forged lying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal set out vnder the name of <hi>Innocent</hi> the first, wherein notwithstanding we reade nothing specially of <hi>Britaines</hi> conuersion.</p>
   <p>Those that were sent from <hi>Eleutherus</hi> bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Christian King <hi>Lucius</hi> of <hi>Britannie,</hi> séeme rather to haue
<pb n="371" facs="178"/>
bin Britans then <hi>Romanes,</hi> as the names of them set downe by <hi>Galfridus,</hi> by <hi>Caius,</hi> and other writers of British histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do report. <hi>Lucius</hi> certes had no reasō to craue baptisme at the hands of <hi>Eleutherus</hi> his mandataries, vnlesse he had bin well instructed in Christian religion before. Beside that the <hi>Romanes</hi> in these times ruling in most part of <hi>Britaine,</hi> it may be a question, how far the kingdome of <hi>Lucius</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it selfe. Suppose then that this historie is authentical, which may well be doubted, the same being onely found in legends and fabulous writers, all the glory of this conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion must néedes stand vpon weake surmises and fabulous legends.</p>
   <p>As for the Monke <hi>Austine,</hi> he could not speake one <hi>Saxon</hi> or <hi>British</hi> word, but was faine to bring interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with him out of <hi>France,</hi> then called <hi>Gallia.</hi> How then could he conuert them, which vnderstood not one word spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him? We do not reade, that he preached to the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or <hi>Britans,</hi> but only that he baptized. And very likely it is that he holp onely to baptize those, whom either the <hi>Britans</hi> alwayes remaining among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and submitting thē selues vnto them, or the interpreters, which <hi>Austin</hi> brought with him from <hi>Gallia,</hi> which then had a tongue common to both <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Britons,</hi> had before conuerted. But suppose that either himselfe speaking <hi>British</hi> or <hi>Saxon,</hi> or by some interpreter, should haue conuerted somc few: yet all that amounteth to nothing, and is scarce worth the speaking of it.</p>
   <p>Secondly, suppose some <hi>Britans</hi> or <hi>Saxons</hi> had bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to Christian Religion by preachers sent from <hi>Rome</hi> in auncient time, when religion was pure and sincere: yet <hi>Parsons</hi> hath no reason to make any great clamor vpon so small aduantage. For first, all those that are conuerted to religion, are not to subiect themselues to those churches frō whence those came that did conuert thē, or else to the bishops that sent them. The church of <hi>Rome</hi> acknowledgeth no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> or to the Bishop thereof. Neither doth <hi>Friseland</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> that was conuerted by
<pb n="372" facs="179"/>
      <hi>Saxons</hi> that came out of <hi>England,</hi> acknowledge our Church or Bishops to be their superiors. But were <hi>Rome</hi> behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from whence her first preachers came; yet da not the <hi>Romanists</hi> now turne <hi>Turkes,</hi> because <hi>Turkes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Suppose then we were beholding to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Romanes;</hi> yet what is that to Antichristian <hi>Romanes,</hi> that haue declined almost into as grosse impieties as <hi>Turks,</hi> and worship idols, or as they call them images, so grossely, that the <hi>Turkes</hi> do condemne them, and may iustly rise up too against them in iudgement. Againe, suppose we had bene beholding to the auncient <hi>Romanes,</hi> yet this maketh nothing for the moderne inhabitants of <hi>Rome,</hi> that either are a race of <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> that were enemies to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> or else a collection and Ramasse of other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nothing like to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> Finally, if we ought to embrace that religion, that was either taught by <hi>S. Peter, Eleutherus, &amp; Austin,</hi> or by other Christian Bishops in their times; then are we to renounce the decretaliue doctrine of Popes, together with the philosophicall mixtures of schoole diuines, both which haue bin brought into the Church long after the ages wherein they liued. Furthermore, the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous worship of the crosse with <hi>latria,</hi> of the saints with <hi>dulia,</hi> of the blessed virgine with <hi>hyperdulia,</hi> the doctrine of Papists concerning the carnall eating of Christs bodie, transsubstantion, halse Communions, priuate Masses, reseruation of the Sacrament, purgatorie for temporall paines after the guilt remitted, popish indulgences and other popish trash might be packing. It would also be time for the Pope with his triple crowne, two swords, guard of Suizzers, Cardinals, Menkes, Masse-priests, and Friers, to trusse vppe his trinkets, and to make himselfe readie for his iourney into some farre countrey beyond all Christianitie. For neuer shall <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> proue, albeit he could conuert him selfe into all shapes, that <hi>Britaine</hi> was conuerted to any such religion as this, or that the Church then had such a forme, as now wée see in <hi>Rome.</hi> Page 103. hée alleageth two proofes,
<pb n="373" facs="179"/>
whereof the first he calleth negatiue, the second affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and thereby hopeth to shew, that the moderne <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi> Religion is all one with the auncient Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But his negatiue ridiculous proofe is denied. His affirmatiue is rather a bare affirmation then a proofe. For first against his negatiue we offer to proue, that not onely the points of Romish doctrine, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> refuseth, are brought in long after the Apostles time, but also that they are contrary to the Apostles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. But suppose we knew no originall of some of the Romish heresies, are they therefore no heresies? Is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try no idolatry, because the first beginning thereof is not knowne? Or are the <hi>Angelikes, Archontikes, Crosse-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Nadipedals, Monothelites,</hi> and diuers other heretikes true Catholikes, because the Papists cannot shew who first broached these heresies? Secondly, albeit the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburginns,</hi> and some other learned men, find fault with some termes used by the fathers, <hi>as of sacrifice, altar, priest, purgatorie, free-will,</hi> and some other: yet that sheweth not, either that all the fathers vsed these termes, or that any of those that vsed them, consented with the Papists, which from new termes are growne to new and strange doctrine. Beside that, <hi>Parsons</hi> disputcth ridiculously, which ascribeth the particular and priuate opinions of some one or few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, to the whole Church. He himselfe, albeit he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme many things desperately, will not yéeld be this point against his owne consorts. So we sée <hi>Parsons</hi> his whole <hi>treatise of three conuersions,</hi> easily subucrted in thrée words, and with the turning of a hand.</p>
   <p>The second part of <hi>Parsons</hi> his treatise, wherein he pretendeth <hi>to make search for the religion professed in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> is wholly without the compasse of his title of thrée conuersiens. So simple was he in his choise, that he could not choose a title to fit his fantasticall worke. Beside that, he seemeth to be blind that could not find our Religion in the auncient Church of Christ for a thousand peares after Christ, and long after. For there is no point or article
<pb n="374" facs="180"/>
of faith taught by the Apostles, &amp; receiued by the consent of the whole Church in any auncient and lawfull Councell, but we receiue it and embrace it. Nor do we professe any thing in the Creed of the Apostles, or of the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther auncient Councels, which the auncient fathers did not also together with vs receiue and professe. While therefore the light-headed frier ranne poasting through all ages, and pretended to enquire for newes of our Church, which ho might sée if he would, in all places: he resembleth much that wise fellow, that could not see wood for trées. Neither is it material that in auncient time he findeth no opposition made against the Popes primacy, or vniuersall power, or to the Masse, or to the doctrine of transsubstantiation, the carnall presence in the Eucharist, the sacrifice of the masse, the 7. sacraments, purgatory, indulgences, &amp; such like. For who seeth not, that it is most ridiculous to make search for opposition against popish doctrine &amp; heresie, before the same was extant in the world? But as soone as any began to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the name of <hi>Oecumenical, or vniuersal Bishop, Gregory</hi> the first challenged him for it, <hi>as the fore-runner of Antichrist.</hi> The worship of images, allowed after a sort in the second Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> though not in such grosse maner as now, was oppugned in the Councell of <hi>Francford</hi> in the time of <hi>Charlemaine.</hi> The carnall presence of Christs body in the sacrament, was not beleeued by <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. as <hi>Beno</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, and was both thē and afterward disliked by many. Transsubstantiatiō was disputed against by the schoolmen. All the Easterne Church spurned against the Popes head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, his purgatory and indulgences. Neither since the time of the first beginning of these corruptions, did the <hi>Albigenses, Valdenses, Wiclephians,</hi> and <hi>Bohemians,</hi> as they are called, together with diuers others, cease to exclaime against these popish abuses. But (saith <hi>Parsons</hi>) these did not in all things agrée with vs. Yet if he speake of matters of faith, he wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them and vs. If of ceremonies, it is not necessary that al churches shold agrée in all points. Furthermore, if the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries had not calmniously layed diuers imputations of
<pb n="375" facs="180"/>
heresies vpon them, which they neuer held; the variation wold not haue séemed so great as they pretend. Wherfore if <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> séeke no better, it is not like that he wil find a Cardinals hat, which, as his friends charge him, he hath long sought.</p>
   <p>This is the summe of that which is materiall in <hi>Robert Parsons</hi> his treatise of thrée conuersions. The rest is nothing else but froth of the mans fury and foolery, and containeth only certaine idle inuectiues against <hi>M. Fox,</hi> that good man, &amp; against <hi>M. Bale,</hi> &amp; other honest Christians, together with certaine fond tales of king <hi>Alphreds</hi> dreames, &amp; <hi>S. Cutberts</hi> apparitions, &amp; such like woodden &amp; popish stuffe drawne out of lying legends. He forgot not also to raile against our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Quéene lately deceased, and to call her <hi>old persecutor,</hi> and to lay an aspersion of slaunder vpon the State, as if the same did persecute Papists for religion: a matter of which the secular Masse-priests are ashamed, and sticke not to cleare those, whem this conuertible <hi>Proteus</hi> most vniustly chargeth. Finally, his fardle of wast pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers containeth diuers corruptions and deprauations of holy Scriptures, miss-allegations of Fathers, weake col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, grosse errors, rebellious positions, notorious lies and calumiations, which in a large treatise herafter are to be discouered.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>K. Kellisons Suruey,</hi> if any man list to suruey and peruse a certaine slaunderous and railing companions libell, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Caluinoturcismus,</hi> and with hatred more then <hi>Turkish</hi> to christian religiō set out by <hi>Gifford</hi> of <hi>Lile,</hi> wil be found to be wholy stolne out frō thence, albeit he yéeldeth no thanks to those from whence he borowed, or rather stole his inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Plagiary therefore néedeth no other answer, then that which is already made to <hi>Giffords</hi> Turky worke called <hi>Caluinoturcismus.</hi> It séemeth the man is at a stand. For albeit <hi>Gifford</hi> hate religion like a <hi>Turk,</hi> yet he answereth no more, then if by vertue of <hi>Parsons</hi> his thrée conuersions, he were turned into a mute <hi>Turbot.</hi> This K. also of his owne hath added a glozing and flattering Epistle to the King,
<pb n="376" facs="181"/>
a certaine preface concerning <hi>inanimate and vnreasonable creatures,</hi> percase like the Arcadian beasts of <hi>Doway,</hi> and certaine fragments &amp; old ends of diuers stale declamations, made (as it seemeth) at the drinking out of a pot of Renish wine. His schollers (I heare) gape and wonder at his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible eloquence. But yet the wisest of thē see, that they haue no affinitie with his purpose, and onely serue to fringe his chapters, like as mustie ends of mockado serue to stitch his iacket of <hi>perpetuana.</hi> All the whole amounteth to nothing, saue to declare the man to be a perpetuall railer, and a most sottish declaimer.</p>
   <p>The idle fellow in all his scuruy collection, which he like a surueyor without commission hath made to litle purpose, doth neither shew wisedome, nor modestie, nor learning. If the fellow had bene wise, he would not haue touched any matter of <hi>noueltie or absurditie.</hi> For therein he giueth his aduersaries iust occasion, not onely to iustifie their religion to be most ancient and consonant to holy scriptures, but also to declare his popish religion refused by vs, to be a packe of nouelties, and a masse of grosse absurdities. For who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that the Romish Church consisting of a triple-crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and crosse-slippard Pope, with his guard of <hi>Suizzers,</hi> a consistory of purple Cardinals, that hath neare affinitie to the purple whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> a rabble of rakehellike masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priests, filthy monkes, friars, and nunnes, with a people worshipping idols, and beléeuing the decretaliue doctrine of Popes, and the decrées of <hi>Trent</hi> is new, and neuer séene before vntill of late. Who doeth not vnderstand, that both the grounds of popery, &amp; the doctrine thereon built is new? For neither can K. shew, that the auncient Church was founded vpon the Pope and his decretals, or vpon traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons allowed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that the Church was tied to such senses of scriptures, as the Romish Church alloweth, or bound to follow the old Latine translation of the Bible. Neither can he proue, either out of fathers or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers, that Christs true body is both in heauen and earth, and in euery pixe at one and the same time, or that
<pb n="377" facs="181"/>
his body is inuisible or impalpable, or that there are iust seuen sacraments, and neither more nor lesse, and that Christians receiue Christs flesh with their téeth and mouth, or that the Pope is the head and spouse of the Church, or that he hath two swords, or that any images are to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with latria, or that diuels torment soules in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or that the Popes indulgences deliuer soules frō those torments, or such like points of popery.</p>
   <p>Now what I pray you is more absurd, then to beléeue that a man can eate himself, as the Massė-priests say Christ did at his last Supper, nay that a dogge or a hogge can eate Christs body, or that a spider can be drowned in his bloud, which saueth all, destroyeth none, that can receiue it? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what is more senselesse then to adore crosses and dumbe images, which neither see, nor heare, nor moue, and whose honor is not séene or knowne of those saints to whō they belong, for ought we know? Thirdly, what is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient then to make a blind Pope, that is ignorant of all matters of religion for the most part, supreme iudge of controuersies of religion? Can blind men iudge of colours, or ignorant atheists of religion? Fourthly, what is more blasphemous then to teach, that the Scriptures to vs are not authenticall, vnlesse the Pope consigne them vnto vs? Shall not truth be truth, vnlesse it please the Pope to say it? Finally, seeing faith ought to be most certaine, and built vpon grounds most certaine; the popish religion must néedes be an absurd faith, and a false religion, that is built vpon traditions as well as Scriptures, of which traditions the papists can yéeld no certaine proofe, but are driuen to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage either lying legends, or old motheaten missals, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain customes. It were an easie thing to alleage infinite such like absurdities, of which this surueying K. hath very foolishly offered vs occasion to discourse at large.</p>
   <p>He doeth also very simply talke of the sacrifice of the Masse, <hi>Suruey li. 4. c. 2.</hi> For if Papists say truly, that Christs body and blood is really offered in the Masse, and that euery externall sacrifice requireth a reall destruction: then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
<pb n="378" facs="182"/>
that these masse-mongers do really destroy <hi>Christs</hi> body and blood. <hi>Bellarmine lib. 1. de missa. c. 2.</hi> (sayth) that an externall sacrifice <hi>doth require a reall destruction. Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit realem destructionem.</hi> Was then this fellow wise trow you, to talke of this braue sacrifice? Further do we thinke him wise, that in a booke offered to the king, doth rayle on the kings religion, saying, <hi>That it leadeth vnto atheisme?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Finally, it is a note of desperate folly to affirme, <hi>That our religion leadeth to Atheisme</hi> for want of a Pope, or <hi>for want of the Popish masse or sacrifice.</hi> The contrary hereof rather is to be gathered against the Popish religion: wherein, as we may collect out of the aduersaries owne confession in <hi>c. si Papa dist. 40.</hi> the Pope may lead with him thousands of soules into hell. The masse also is a masse and sinke of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and idolatry. Neither is any thing more repugnant to Christs only sacrifice, then the priesthood and sacrifice of the masse.</p>
   <p>Modesty he sheweth none, with a face as hard as a lopster, affirming, <hi>That we teach, that God is the author of sin: That we despoyle Christ of his diuinitie. That we wrong him in his office of redemption, and bereaue him of his title of lawgiuer and priest: And doubt not to say, that Christ dispaired.</hi> Now what greater impudency can be imagined, then to ascribe that to vs, which we vtterly deny and disclaime? Nay, we pronounce him accursed, whosoeuer shall hold any of these points. But the Papists in some things rub very néere vpō these rocks, &amp; namely, where they giue to euery man power to satisfie for the temporall paine of his sins, and yéeld, that others beside Christ may be called redéemers, and make the Pope <hi>a law-giuer, able to bind mens consciences,</hi> and giue power to the priest to intercede for Christs body and blood, that God would be pleased to accept it, <hi>as he accepted the sacrifice of Melchisedech.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Impudently also he belieth vs, &amp; raileth vpon vs, saying, <hi>that we make euery priuate mans spirit supreme iudge of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies;</hi> and that we reiect Fathers &amp; auncient Councels, and ouerthrow all religion and worship of God.</p>
   <p>
      <pb n="379" facs="182"/>Neither doth he onely raile vpon vs, but also vpon scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where he sayth, <hi>that founding our selues only on scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we open a gate to all heretikes and heresies.</hi> As if the Fathers and auncient Councels which founded their faith vpon holy scriptures only, opened a gap to all heresies. Or as if this could be spoken without disgrace to holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that he that relieth vpon the word of God deliuered in scriptures, doth open a gate to all heresies.</p>
   <p>Finally, he taketh vpon him the title <hi>of the legate of the great monark of heauen;</hi> being but a base, fugitiue, renegued companion, set on by Antichrist and his supposts, to raile at religion, and the professors thereof, and lying without rule or order.</p>
   <p>His want of learning doeth euery where appeare throughout his whole Suruey. The Scriptures he citeth very rarely. The Fathers he mistaketh and misalleageth. In Ecclesiasticall histories he is but a nouice. Nay, albeit he talketh much of our Religion, yet he vnderstandeth not what we professe, what we reiect. Finally, although the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low be but a poore translator and collector of other mens slanders, yet could he not well relate that which is transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of others. His principal witnesses are <hi>Staphilus, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chleus, Bolser, Nicol Borne, Stapleton, Surius,</hi> and such like railing and base authors. Was it then likely that he should shew learning, that is wholly conuersant in these trifling authors, deuoyd either of learning, or else of all religion and honestie?</p>
   <p>And all this, God willing, shall by many particulars be verified, by those who already haue vndertaken to controle his Suruey, and to examine euery article of this leud li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell. Not that such an asses head deserueth any curious wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, but because such a barking cur dog would be silenced with a sharpe censure.</p>
   <p>It resteth now, that I speak a word or two more of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool</hi> &amp; his cōfutatiō. The man is a special friend of mine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit vpō very sinal acquaintance: a cunning triacle seller al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, a mōtbank, &amp; a master empoisoner, as before is declared.
<pb n="380" facs="183"/>
This onely I forgot to tell you, that his braine is full of quicksiluer, his memory like an old leather budget, his crowne like the posterior parts of an ape, and his head like the knop of the handle of a gittern with two strings. If you méete any such fellow in the kitchin of the Romish colledge of English boyes, commend vs to him, and tell him that we haue at leisure perused his Mirificall confutation, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now he may bestow it vpon the cook to stop his bottels. The stile biteth like pepper, and therfore may do some good seruice there. Onely thus much I must tel him, that his words are too high for such a low subiect as he handleth. Euery where he raileth like a man beside himselfe, and calleth me <hi>mad man, sycophant, franticke fellow, lunatike, satanicall, iugling minister, dolt, foole, noddy, foolman, irreligious atheist, ideot, asse, drowsie heretike,</hi> and such like names, and these are the common flowers of his dogged eloquence. Yet I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him, that I am not offended with his rough stile. For although he giue me very hard words, and raileth like a tal fellow of his tongue; yet I thanke him, he is well content to passe by all my arguments in sober silence, &amp; to confirme as much as I affirme by his cold deniall. Now what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter argument, I pray you, can we bring to proue that <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole</hi> and his consorts are neither Catholikes, nor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the true church, nor hold the ancient religiō of Christ Iesus, but rather are a pack of heretikes, idolaters and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, then that our aduersary, that taketh vpon him their defence, hath nothing to answer in their behalfe? It was not modesty certes that made him silent, but méere imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his cause, and want of iust defence.</p>
   <p>Will it please you to take a tast of his insufficiency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we broach the whole barrell of his foolery. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of his booke, he vanteth <hi>that he hath spent his time in exact studie of Diuinitie, and with particular care read the Scriptures, Councels and Fathers.</hi> O happy youths, that heare so exact a spender of his time in study of Diuinity! O hard aduenture for vs, that are to encounter this giant, that hath deuoured so many Councels and Fathers!
<pb n="381" facs="183"/>
But in the meane while <hi>Parsons</hi> was much too blame, that put him to it thus impudently to praise himselfe. We for our parts do admire his singular folly and arrogance, who praiseth himselfe with such impudency. His great reading to vs is inuisible, his great ignorance in all maner of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and not onely in theology is euery where apparant.</p>
   <p>Fol. 2. he telleth vs how <hi>Heraclitus</hi> affirmed <hi>that the snow was blacke.</hi> But vnlesse he produce his author, his friends with <hi>Heraclitus</hi> may wéepe, to sée his pittifull ignorance. We haue heard such a thing of <hi>Anaxagoras:</hi> but this of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi> is ridiculously forged. In the same place he writeth also, how <hi>Zeno</hi> taught, <hi>That it was impossible for any thing to moue.</hi> A matter very stupendious. But this he findeth, that hath read exactly the fathers. Would he name his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, he will make a Stoicke to laugh.</p>
   <p>Fol. 8. he sayth, that <hi>Christs body hath a being in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like to a soule.</hi> But our Sauiour <hi>(Luke 24.)</hi> sheweth a notorious difference betwixt a body and a spirit. Out of his reading of the fathers, he neuer learned that Christ had a body vnlike to ours.</p>
   <p>Fol. 16. he compareth <hi>Christs</hi> body to God, <hi>that is in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places.</hi> A matter that tendeth to the destruction of the article of Christs incarnatiō, and much repugnant to scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and fathers. Unto these words of <hi>Hilary, lib. 8. de Trin. Of the truth of the flesh and blood of Christ, there is no place of doubting left:</hi> he addeth diuers words, falsifying them in this sort, <hi>Of the true presence of the flesh and bloud of Christ in the blessed sacrament, there is no place of doubting left.</hi> Belike his great and exact study of diuinity, and particular care in reading, will beare him out in it. Yet <hi>Hilary</hi> talketh of <hi>Christs</hi> true incarnatiō, and not of the presence of <hi>Christs</hi> body and bloud in the sacrament.</p>
   <p>Fol. 31. he sayth, <hi>That our bodies are nourished with the body and blood of Christ.</hi> But the holy fathers teach vs, that <hi>Christs body and blood is food for the soule, and not for the body. Cyprian De Coena Domini,</hi> sayth, <hi>We sharpe not our teeth to bite.</hi> And <hi>Augustine tractat. 26. in Ioan.</hi> sayth,
<pb n="382" facs="184"/>
      <hi>We are not to prepare our teeth,</hi> viz. when we receiue this holy sacrament. Here therefore this fellow followed his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> and not the fathers of the Church.</p>
   <p>Fol. 174. he distinguisheth <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> from <hi>Vermilio,</hi> whereas this is <hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> surname. He telleth vs also that <hi>Flauianus</hi> taught, that <hi>God was the author of all sinne.</hi> But if he produce not his author, it will be an easie matter to shew, that he belyeth <hi>Flauianus,</hi> and mistaketh one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother through pitifull ignorance.</p>
   <p>To bely &amp; falsify the fathers with this bastardly Iebusit, is but a <hi>peccadillio.</hi> Fol. 18. he auoucheth boldly, that <hi>Gregory speaketh not of satisfying for the guilt, but for temporal paine.</hi> But the words of <hi>Gregory</hi> do plainly cōuince him of this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood. For in him these termes &amp; subtilties are not to be foūd.</p>
   <p>Fol. 23. he is very bold with <hi>Lactantius,</hi> &amp; maketh him to assigne three notes, <hi>by which heretikes may be discerned from true Christians.</hi> But this is more then euer <hi>Lactantius</hi> spoke or thought. He doth also giue suspition by his corrupt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, as if <hi>Lactantius</hi> had spoken of popish auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and penance theron enioyned, which was neuer the authors meaning.</p>
   <p>Fol. 25. he writeth the <hi>Cyprian demonstrated Peter to be the head &amp; root of the church.</hi> Which if <hi>Walpool</hi> had had a true tong in his head, he wold neuer haue affirmed. Beside that, what a ridiculous toy is it, to trāslate <hi>Peters</hi> prerogatiue to the Pope, that is liker to the <hi>Calipha</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> then to <hi>Peter?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Fol. 27. 31. &amp; 34. he corrupteth <hi>Irenaeus</hi> most grosly, making him in the first place to speak of those traditions of which he neuer thought, &amp; in the 2. to maintaine the vniuersal power of the Pope, which he neuer knew. In the third place where <hi>Irenaeus</hi> hath <hi>imaginibus,</hi> he blotteth out that word, &amp; putteth in the word <hi>magia,</hi> least he might seeme to speak against images.</p>
   <p>Neither doth he onely bely the fathers, but his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries also. Fol. 114. he sayth that <hi>Aurifaber, Snepfius, Heshu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fius, Vergerius, Beza, Musculus, Socinus, and other minifters in this agree, that the auncient fathers are against them, and for the Papists.</hi> A matter neither agreed vppon by all,
<pb n="383" facs="184"/>
nor in these termes confessed by any. As for <hi>Socinus,</hi> he was an Italian heretike, cast out and condemned by our church. Why then is he ranked with honest men? Doth this ranke fellow in this multiforme lie, think it reason to range toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men of such disformitie? In another place he affirmeth boldly, that <hi>Luther, Caluine, Peter Martyr, and Melancthon make God the author of sinne:</hi> not considering, as it séemeth, what a sinfull act it is to calumniate and bely honest men. That they are desperatly belied, their words and writings, where they profefse and declare the contrary of this which <hi>Walpoole</hi> affirmeth, do manifestly demonstrate. But this monster hath filed his tongue to speake vntruth.</p>
   <p>Fol. 157. speaking of popish <hi>purgatorie</hi> and <hi>limbus patrum,</hi> he sayth, <hi>they were taught by all antiquitie.</hi> A lie most notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and which shal make him famous to all posteritie. For neither is this word <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> nor the popish distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the parts of hell, nor the popish doctrine concerning <hi>Limbus patrum</hi> and purgatory, held by any one, much lesse by all the ancient fathers. And thereon I ioyne issue with this disioynted companion, requiring him to answer that which I haue written <hi>De Purgatorio,</hi> and <hi>contra limbum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum papisticum,</hi> to this purpose.</p>
   <p>Of his great skil in Latin, his words fol. 57. b. wil giue te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony. For there he hath <hi>Vnae ecclesiae sole,</hi> for <hi>Vno ecclesiae sole,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> hath, or at least <hi>Vnius ecclesiae sole,</hi> if hee would haue spoken in any congruity. Of his skil in the Gréeke, we find good proofe, fol. 54. b. where in two words he maketh thrée faults. First he denideth this word <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, and maketh it two words. Next he writeth <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>: and thirdly, he putteth an accent of aspiration in the midst of a word. If he had bene put to vse much Greeke, we should haue had good stuffe, that find him so faulty in this only one Gréeke word.</p>
   <p>To conclude with our partie for this time: neither in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting against his aduersary, nor in defending himselfe, his consorts &amp; his cause, doth he acquite himself in any tolerable sort. Unto me he obiecteth, <hi>that I vnderstād not the state of the question.</hi> A matter ridiculous. For he himself cannot deny,
<pb n="384" facs="185"/>
but I report the aduersaries meaning and words truly. He chargeth me also with vntruths. Yet is it no vntruth that I say, <hi>that Stapleton denieth the scriptures to be the foundatiō of religion.</hi> For I cite his words truly. And euery man that readeth his booke, entitled <hi>Principia doctrinalia,</hi> shal find that scriptures are excluded out of the number of <hi>Principia doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia.</hi> With the like facility I shal cleare all the rest of his foolish obiections.</p>
   <p>Wherest bring many arguments, all concluding that papists are no true Catholikes, as maintaining rather par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular then catholike doctrine, this wise confuter, or rather confounder of himself, slieth out like a wild goose into a long discourse of the name of Catholike, and the causes of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude of the Church, matters scarcely questioned betwixt vs. He doth also lode vs with sacks of authorities of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, concerning the vniuersality of the Church, which are not to the purpose. But in all this discourse he doth not once attempt to answer any thing said by vs. Likewise in the Challenge, wherein Papists are declared not to be the true Church, he flieth al encounter, like a foolish combatant figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with his owne shadow. And this we do not dcubt but to declare shortly in a larger answer most fully.</p>
   <p>In the meane while thou maist easily perceiue the vanity, falshood, forgery and insufficient dealing of our aduersaries. <hi>Parsons</hi> in his booke set out vnder the name of <hi>T. F.</hi> doth most grosly and impudently praise himselfe. In his booke of thrée conuersions he citeth <hi>Ado Treuirensis,</hi> for <hi>Ado Viennensis,</hi> and often mistaketh one for another. Both his and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faults I haue before briefly noted. The rest if thou wilt haue patience with vs, God willing thou shalt receiue shortly. Now I could bestow no more time in polling these Arcadian fellowes. The Lord, if it be his holy will, discouer all the impestures of hereticall Papists, and grant that the rayes of his most glorious Gospell may shine in all mens hearts, to the vtter confusion of the seate of Antichrist, and the full establishment of the kingdome of Christ Iesus.</p>
