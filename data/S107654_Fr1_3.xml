   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing now finished this treatise against Astrologie (gentle readers) the paines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing past, and hope of ease appearing, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be perplexed afresh with two new doubtes. First whether I should proceed to the publication of these my labours, or rather follow the counsell of him, that willeth in this case to proceed <hi>ad publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candum,</hi> as good iudges are wont <hi>ad sententiandum,</hi> that is <hi>plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beis pedibus,</hi> and slowly, still keeping our labours by vs, till we haue licked and relicked them into some good tolerable forme, as the beare doth her deformed whelpes at the first. For while they are by vs, and in our hands, we may alter, ad, diminish, put in, and put out at pleasure; but if they be once out, and abroade, we may giue thē our good word, it is too late to repent:
<q>Nam semel emissum volat irreuocabile verbum.</q> Wherefore our words, are very fitly termed of the poet, <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, that is, winged words; because, if they get loose once, they fly amaine. The author of this counsell <hi>Horace,</hi> whether he followed it himselfe or no I cannot tell, but it seemeth some other did, as <hi>Cinna</hi> by name. Who as appeareth by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus. lib. 1. epigram. 21.</hi> after nine yeares study, set out a fine picked poeme, intituled <hi>Smyrna: Catullus</hi> words be these:
<q>
         <l>Smyrna mei votis nonam post denique messem</l>
         <l>Quam coepta est, nonam{que} edita post hyemem.</l>
      </q> Although this of nine yeares suppression rely vpon the precept of a wise man, and example of a good poet, yet at this time
<pb facs="5"/> for some causes, I haue chosen, rather by speedy publication to haue the opinion, and iudgement of others quickely, then to stand plodding my selfe vpon it many yeares alone. For by this meanes the faults being quicklier found, shalbe sooner amended. Now though I may seeme to expose and lay open my selfe too confidently to the censures of men, yet I hope, they wil deale with me <hi>cādidè,</hi> as is seemly for men professing learning, so that I shal haue no cause to reply to any busie cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer <hi>(ne sutor vltra crepidam)</hi> as did <hi>Appelles</hi> to the cranke Cobler, that would needs passe the shoo. For my part, I hope I shal be found so farre from partialitie toward mine owne, that I shalbe ready to thanke them that shall correct me; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me I say, and not controll me. For friends doe correct, but enimies and aduersaries controll. If I should refuse or disdaine a friendly correction, I should shew my selfe too sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but to indure a presumptuous controlling spirit can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any indure. And thus much for the first perplexitie. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing that perplexed me, was whether this slender work should present it selfe to the view of all without my name: for at the first I being desirous to haue the iudgements of others, thought there was no way better, thē by suppressing my name, knowing that by this meanes, men would iudge with lesse affection euery waye, I was not willing in a busines of this kinde to trust my selfe, knowing how through a naturall <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> all men are giuen to flatter and coxe themselues in their owne doings. Neither are wee to thinke that it fareth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with particular men, then it doth with seuerall kinds of creatures, euery one no doubt preferring, and admiring his owne kinde before all others: so that nothing seemeth to an Ape pretier then his fellow Iacke: or to a frog then a todpoll: the horse and lyon thinke no doubt better of their owne shape, then of the forme of a man. Vpon this conceit <hi>Tully lib. 1. de Nat. deo.</hi> said, that he durst not think himselfe a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier creature then the <hi>Bull</hi> that transported <hi>Europa,</hi> for shape he meant, and feature of body. As this self-liking preuaileth in euery kinde toward it selfe, so doth it no lesse, but rather more shew it selfe in euery particular, nature being <hi>optima concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrix,
<pb facs="5"/> et quasilena sui,</hi> the greatliest in loue with her selfe that may be. And therefore we find daylie that most true, <hi>suum cuique pulchrum,</hi> and that of <hi>Tul. Te tua, me delectant mea,</hi> who farther also <hi>lib. 5. Tuscul.</hi> saith that he neuer knew any poet, were he neuer so bad, but he thought himselfe the best that euer was. Such is the folly of riming wits. Euen <hi>Chaerilus</hi> so much disgraced by <hi>Horace,</hi> yet as may appeare by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with <hi>Alexander,</hi> thought himselfe no babe. Of whom <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexāder</hi> was wont to say, that he had rather be <hi>Homers Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,</hi> then the <hi>Achilles</hi> of <hi>Chaerilus.</hi> Although I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that <hi>Eusebius, Clemens,</hi> &amp; some other of the Ancients, make good reckening of him: neither seemeth he to haue bin so bad as he is made by certaine verses of his which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. But (to returne) as <hi>Chaerilus</hi> did, who doth not thinke too well of himselfe? nay who is there almost, that is not so farre gone this way, that he is not in loue with his own faults? which depraued blinde iudgment towards our selues may easilie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertake vs, since we see that some haue bin blinded by reason of a foolish conceited loue, euen in the faults of others. As for example <hi>Alceus,</hi> of whome is that,
<q>Naeuus in articulo pueri delectat Alcaeum.</q> a wenne in his body seemed a grace to <hi>Alceus.</hi> As he for loue to his boy digested his impefection: so we for the like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ourselues can dispence with our greatest faults, as if they were none. <hi>Roscius</hi> was bleare eyed. <hi>Q. Catulus</hi> much more either bleared or blinded, when he took him to exceed<note place="margin">By God in that place of Tully is meant the Sunne.</note> God for beautie: but such is the nature of loue, where it fasteneth, it will find no fault, especially in our selues. In an old Greeke Epigram it is said, that loue is nothing worth, nor to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, when one loueth a faire one, for that euerie bodie doth; to loue a foule droile or blouse, this is loue indeede. Whence we may see how it fareth with vs, who think we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer loue our selues enough, except we loue our faults and all. Least therefore I my selfe should fall into this confessed and detested vice of selfe loue toward my owne faults and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, I thought it my part to take the way, first to know what they were, or before they be knowne, they will hardly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
<pb facs="6"/> and a better or readier way to knowe them, I sawe none, then by publishing my paines without name: for so both others will more freely perhaps, and more vprightly without partialitie iudge, and my selfe shall the sooner heare what scapes shalbe charged vpon me. For this cause, and vpon this reason, I had, as I said, resolued at first to proceede with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie name: but afterward vpon some other iust &amp; vrgent occasions, I was forced to alter this course, &amp; forsake my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer determination, and to hold the accustomed and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie course of publishing by name. By which course, although I faile somwhat of my former, and desired purpose, yet I hope the point will not be greatly materiall, or with much disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.</p>
   <p>For the handling, and deliuerie of the matter, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to bee most simple and plaine, quite voide of that <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, which some perhaps will looke for. I haue not sought after vaine flourishes and rhetorications, nor had anie further care then this, that I may be vnderstood. It fareth with speech as it doth with a woman, the honester she is, the lesse care she hath of her attire: it is the tricke of harlots to paint and besmeare; <hi>Simplex est veritatis sermo. Plato</hi> saith, that to be curious in words and phrases, is <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap>, that is, base and seruile: with whom also iumpeth <hi>Galen,</hi> saying that the care of words, and contempt of matter came in together. Of which opinion also was <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> whose words are thus: He that careth for the truth must not busie and trouble himselfe too much about words, but be content to deliuer things as well as he can, for they that are curious in words, oft misse of the matter. With this agreeth that of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret de Morib. Graec. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>pa.</hi> 10. Matter, saith he, and truth is to be preferred before words and phrases: for want of faire words is no hinderaunce or disgrace to the matter: the rose groweth not on the fairest tree, but on a prickly rude bush. As good broth may come out of a woodden ladle, as out of a siluer spoone. A great admirer and reader of <hi>Ennius</hi> said, that whē he read him, he gathered <hi>aurum ex sterquilinio,</hi> according to that of an other, <hi>Ennius ingenio magnus, at arte rudis.</hi> If words
<pb facs="6"/> will follow the matter they are welcome: but if they must be studied for, fare them well: hee maketh small account of his time that spendeth it about wind and words; and may be well compared to the dogge in <hi>Esop,</hi> who snatching at the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, lost the bone. Gay words without substance of matter, are like a painted sheath with a woodden dagger, which will not cut, nor do anie office of a dagger: which I do not speake in commendation of mine owne dagger, as if it were such a cutter. I am not so far gone and past my selfe; neuerthelesse I could wish, not onely that it would cut, but also cut off this vncouth kind of Figure-flingers, and starre-gazers, who are st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>l tooting on heauen, which belongeth full litle to them. Verie wise men haue bin verie carelesse in this point of words and speech. <hi>Porphyrie</hi> reporteth of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that when hee came to speake or write anie thing, he was verie ridiculous, and that he did stutter like a babe. And <hi>Plato</hi> in his Apologie testifieth the same, that in his speech he was without grace, or choise of words, with a rude vnlearned tongue. Now if <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> did practise, and <hi>Plato</hi> allow, I hope no bodie will exact or expect much of me: if anie do, I must answere only that,
<q>Quod decuit tantos, cur mihi turpe putem?</q> Wherefore that I may conclude with <hi>Socrates</hi> wordes in the same place, of you, gentle Readers, I request only thus much, which mee thinke standeth with reason, that you would not weigh my phrase &amp; stile, though peraduenture it may please, and peraduenture no: for peraduenture it may be better, and peraduenture it may be worse; but that you would weigh and well consider this, whether I speake to the purpose. Another thing wherein I am to craue the Readers pardon is, if that anie vnaduised or hard speeches haue passed me, such as are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to these contentious kind of confutations, and are wont commonly to scape many in their earnestnesse, and heat. How easie a matter it were for anie in an argument of this nature to let slip now and then an hard word, anie may iudge, if he list to consider the grossenesse of the fault, the multitude of the offenders, and the negligence of them that should be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. For my part I cannot denie, but sometime I was moued
<pb facs="7"/> with it: yet so, I hope, as that neither I forgot the counsell of him, <hi>ammum rege, qui nisi paret, imperat:</hi> nor the good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of another, that being moued to wrath, smote himselfe on the breast with a knocke, adding these words,
<q>
         <gap reason="foreign">
            <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
         </gap>.</q> That is, Downe great heart. In rime,
<q>
         <l>Downe heart, haue done, for long ere this,</l>
         <l>Thou hast indurde as bad I wisse.</l>
      </q> Neither would I take it to be anie great fault, to be a litle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued sometime, according to the indignitie of the matter. For all heate is not to bee condemned: nay of some heate that is true, that it is <hi>cos virtutis:</hi> it giueth an edge to vertue &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Neither is that amisse of <hi>Seneca, Quantum est cui{que} irae, tantum est ingenij.</hi> But in respect of me, and my cariage in this Treatise, I hope this Apologie will bee needlesse my speech is all in <hi>Thesi,</hi> and generall. I haue spoken against Astrologers, but not against this or that particular Astrologer. Though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie and heate bee a perturbation and grieuous, yet it hath such a commendome of delight with it, and is so delaied and sawced with pleasure, that a man may quickly be drawne in, if he looke not better to it. But some perhaps will maruell, what pleasure can be in anger, which doth so torment &amp; vexe men, that it maketh them stare like frends, according to that, <hi>Iliad. 1. vers.</hi> 103.</p>

But I thinke best to stay here, least by too solemne and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious an excuse, I might seeme to accuse my selfe, and too much to distrust them, whose censure in this case I am to passe, and, for good reason must stand to. Wherefore commending my selfe, the maner and matter to the fauourable constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the discreet and louing reader, I take my leaue.</p>
