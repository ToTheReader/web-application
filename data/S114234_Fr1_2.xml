this Christian
Almanacke ensuing may
be vnto thee (good
Christian reader,) it will
easily appeare, if thou wilt but vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
the reading thereof, and wilt also
consider with thy selfe, that the daies
and times wherein wee liue, are very
dangerous and sinnefull; for that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 8,</note>
the common enemie of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
goeth about continually like a
roaring Lyon seeking whom hee may
deuour; and how by all manner of
subtilty, by the world, and the flesh;
by the commodities, pleasures and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of them both; by prosperity and
aduersitie,<note place="margin">Bernard.</note> he endeuoureth, leauing no
meanes vnattempted,<note place="margin">Mundus, Diabolus, Caro &amp;c.</note> to the intent that
he may destroy vs both body and
<pb facs="3"/>
soule; it is high time therefore, that
wee looke vnto our selues, and by a
Christian Almanacke recount and
Calculate our dayes, and with that
most holy Arithmetician the prophet
<hi>Dauid,</hi> and with <hi>Moses</hi> the man of
God, pray vnto the Lord to teach vs,
so to number our dayes,<note place="margin">Psal. 90. <hi>et vers▪</hi> 12▪</note> that wee may
apply our harts to wisedome; that we
lay hold on oportunity, and make
the best vse of our time, that we may
profit our selues in holy and religious
excercises, that we may walke as the
children of light, in the light, before
that darknes come vpon vs vnawares,<note place="margin">Iohn 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>. vers. 35 36.</note>
that wee may not harden our harts in
the day of the Lords visitation.<note place="margin">

            <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
         </gap>. 3. ver. 7. 8.</note> Oh let
vs consider that our life is short, and
that the lampe thereof is quickly put
out, before we are aware; that our
time is precious and therefore to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed;
irreuocable, and being once
past, cannot be called backe againe; it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s the rarest Iewell, and the greatest
treasure of all treasures; time and tide
<pb facs="3"/>
will not alwaies last, it will tarry for no
man. The children of this world be
wiser in their generation then wee, who
professe our selues to be Christians.
Who is there of them, that maketh not
great account of his Almanacke, to
obserue both dayes, times and seasons,
to follow his affayres for his best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and vse? The Mariner obserueth
time, winde, and tide, that he may
hoyse vp Saile and be gone: the
Lawier obserueth the Terme time,
that he may dispatch his Clients suites,
for when terme is done, there is no
more time for their businesse, the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailer
hath regard to the weather and
season by his Almanacke, and if he can
learne thereby that he shall haue a faire
day, he riseth early to be gone away
in the morning; euery thri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ty husband
can make vse of his time, obserue his
daies, houres, moneths and weekes, for
his profit; shall not wee then, that
would be Christians, shew our selues
more carefull for the spending of our
<pb facs="4"/>
daies, times and houres, that we may
profit in Christianity, it is alway terme-time
with Christians, euery day, euery
houre requireth a religious imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the good of our soules, yea
this presēt time is our terme-time. The
neglect of time and oportunitie, is a
sinne much condemned in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and especially by our Sauiour
Christ, whenas he rebuketh the Scribes
and Pharisies,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 3.</note> calling them hypocrites,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 56.</note>
because they could not discerne the face of
the Skye, but could not discerne the
signes of the times. And God himselfe
by the prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ier. 8. 7.</note> complaineth,
that the very foule, and birdes of the
ayre obserued their times and seasons,
but his people were ignorant. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
of all follies and Ignorances, this is
the greatest, not to know the times &amp;
seasons after the manner of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sttians,
not to know the day of our visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
when God offereth this mercies
to vs, by the ministry of his word, by
stretching out his hands all the day
<pb facs="4"/>
long;<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 21.</note> he standeth at the dore of our
harts knocking by the sound of his
word outwardly, and by the motion of
his spirit inwardly, by threatnings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
mercies, iudgments, and yet we
listen not, we care not, we are lulled a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>eepe with ease &amp; prosperity, and we
continually make excuses and delayes
through slumbering and sluggishnesse,
like the spouse in the Canticles,<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 2. 3</note> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

      </gap>ight long at her doore vntill his
lockes were hoary with dew. wherefore
we ought to be wary and circumspect,
how wee spend our time, for God will
require an account of vs for the same,
and therefore let vs redeeme it with an
high estimate, let vs looke into our
