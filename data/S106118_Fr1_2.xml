   <head>To all Religious house-holders, their Children and <hi>seruants: the sauing knowledge</hi> of Gods holy Word, most <hi>heartily wished.</hi>
   </head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the first Chapter of the Prouerbs of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> it is written thus in the eight and ninth verses: <hi>My son, heare the instruction of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and forget not the lawe of thy mother: for they shall be an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grace vnto thy head, and chaines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thy necke.</hi> From which words may be drawne a double doctrine: First, that all godly Parents should teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct their children in the Lawe of the LORD: Secondly, that their children
<pb facs="3"/> should learne &amp; obey their wholsome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. For the first, wee haue both practice and precept therof in the sacred Scriptures: the practice in <hi>Dauid;</hi> who <note place="margin">1 The prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parents in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their children.</note> taught <hi>Salomon</hi> his sonne, saying, <hi>And thou, Salomon my sonne, know thou the God of thy father, and serue him with a perfect heart, and with a willing minde,</hi> 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9. <hi>Salomon</hi> also sayth, that his father <hi>Dauid</hi> taught him and sayd vnto him, <hi>Keepe my commandements and liue: Get wisedome, get vnderstanding,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prou.</hi> 4. 4. This was the practice, alwaies, not onely of godly fathers, but also of godly mothers: So did King <hi>Lemuels</hi> mother, she taught her sonne lessons of chastitie, of temperance, of defending the afflicted, of choosing, vsing, and commending a vertuous wife; as appeareth throughout the 31. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Prouerbes: and in this first Chapter thereof, in the eight and ninth verses, <hi>Salomon</hi> presupposeth that al god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mothers will bee helpers to their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, in the religious and godly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction <note place="margin">2 Precepts of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it of Parents.</note> of their children.</p>
   <p>Secondly, wee haue in the Scriptures plentifull store of precepts, requiring
<pb facs="3"/> this duty of all godly Parents: As <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6. 7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 78. 5. 6. <hi>Prou.</hi> 22. 6. In which place last mentioned, <hi>Salomon</hi> sayth: <hi>Teach a child in the way that he should goe, and when hee is old, he will not depart from it.</hi> And <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Fathers, prouoke not your children vnto wrath, but bring them vp in nurture and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Lord.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Thirdly, there are many reasons and <note place="margin">3 Reasons to perswade Parents to performe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd duty.</note> motiues in the sacred Scriptures, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade all godly Parents to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this dutie: which I will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in another place more largely relate; meane time remember (O Christian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents) and looke backe to <hi>Salomons</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue <note place="margin">1 By the practice thereof, they shall make them vertuous and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, adorn them and dignifie them; yea, inrich thē, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance thē.</note> in this text, <hi>Prou.</hi> 1. 8. 9. to wit, that Parents shall (by the blessing of God) vpon their good instruction, make their children religious and vertuous, as God promiseth, <hi>Prou.</hi> 22. 6. Yea, they shall thereby adorne them and dignifie them, inrich them, and make them <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> and <hi>gracious,</hi> both with God and men; vvhich <hi>Salomon</hi> also meaneth, when hee sayth: that <hi>Their instructions shall bee an ornament of grace about their</hi>
      <pb facs="4"/>
      <hi>head, and chaines about their necke.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Contrariwise, dost thou neglect this <note place="margin">2 By neglect of it, they make them most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, poore, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and odious, both to God and men.</note> dutie of instructing them: then dost thou make them most miserable, poore, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, naked and deformed: yea, most lothsome and odious both to God and men<hi>:</hi> as were the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> by their blindnesse, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3. 17. &amp; 18. and <hi>Elye</hi> his sonnes by their profanenesse, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 12. &amp; 17.</p>
   <p>Yea, assuredly, it may bee sayd of thee, that through thy negligence, thou makest thy Children, as <hi>Aaron</hi> did the people; <hi>(Euen naked vnto their shame:) Exod.</hi> 32. 25. yea, and vnto thine owne shame and ruine for euer without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Remember <hi>Elyes</hi> downfall, and his sonnes, though <hi>Ely</hi> were an elect; because hee did not continually admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them, and duely correct them: he admonished them earnestly for a fit, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 23. but not constantly, say some; neither did he correct and chastise them accordingly, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 13. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee haue neerer examples, euen at home; for if wee cast our eyes vpon the World, wee may by dayly experience
<pb facs="4"/> see, that such Children as are left vnto themselues without Discipline, they shame themselues and their Parents, and liue in all outragious euils, in Swearing, Besselling, Whoring, Mocking, Lying, Murmuring, Sabbath-breaking, stealing; &amp;c. till at length they come to fearefull ends: accusing then their Parents neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of discipline; who drew them to destruction, as the Dragon drew downe the Stars with his tayle, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12. 4.</p>
   <p>Remember (O Parents) that your <note place="margin">3 The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and equity of this duty, to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Parents.</note> Children haue receiued corruption from you by naturall birth, and by conception: hauing therefore polluted them, you should be carefull to purge them: they are conceiued, you know, in sinne, and shapen in iniquitie, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 5. They are by naturall birth, as all others are, <hi>The Children of wrath and condemnation, Ephe.</hi> 2. 3. O therefore, let Christian e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and pittie mooue you to vse all good meanes, that they may bee gotten againe by the seede of regeneration, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. To which purpose, prepare them for the spirituall seede, by catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them, and when it is sown in them,
<pb facs="5"/> endeuour by dayly admonition, and good instruction, to harrow it and to roote it into their hearts: in so doing, <note place="margin">4 A farther inlarging of the vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; by specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some particulars of it.</note> whereas they are by naturall birth onely <hi>carnall, Ioh.</hi> 3. 6. and fleshly, hauing not the Spirit, <hi>Iude</hi> 5. 19. and so doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble Sathan, and are his Image, you shall cause them to become spirituall, and so to resemble God himselfe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 24. and to become the <hi>Image of God, Colos.</hi> 3. 8. 9. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 23. 24.</p>
   <p>That seede of <hi>Regeneration</hi> sowne in their soules, wil keepe and preserue them from the dominion and power of sinne, so that they shall not sinne as do others, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 6. and <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2. nor as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and his sonnes doe sinne in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course, nor to condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. because <hi>Gods seede remaineth in them,</hi> and because they <hi>are borne of GOD,</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 8. 9.</p>
   <p>Lastly, by that seede of <hi>Regeneration</hi> once receiued, they are made <hi>Immortall,</hi> as the seede it selfe is; which is therefore called <hi>Immortall</hi> seede, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. 24. 25. because it makes them <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> and to liue for euer which doe
<pb facs="5"/> receiue it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 24.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> speaking some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to such as were to teach his sonne, sayd, that hee himselfe being a <hi>Mortall</hi> man, had made his sonne <hi>Mortall</hi> by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; but yet he hoped that his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers by good instruction, would make him <hi>Immortall.</hi> So may wee say of our sonnes and daughters; that by generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wee haue made them <hi>Mortall,</hi> euen subiect to a double death: yet may wee comfort our selues in this, that by <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian instruction wee may make them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Immortall.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>See then by this, and consider (O <note place="margin">5 A Corola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> Christian Parents,) what speciall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and dignities you may procure for your Children by Christian instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; thereby you may inrich them and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne them with all generall sauing gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and with outward wealth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; in particular, you may make them of carnall, to become spirituall; of being Sathans Image, to become Gods owne Image; and of <hi>Mortall</hi> to become <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,</hi> and to liue for euer.</p>
   <p>But what course must I take (wil some <note place="margin">6 Questions and Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. 1. Question Answere.</note>
      <pb facs="6"/> say) with my Children, when they are well instructed in the principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? I answere, that after they haue beene fed with milke, they must be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished and fed with meate: when they haue attained knowledge and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, then their affections must bee much moued and wrought vpon, by the word of admonition, reprehensions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations, &amp;c. otherwise they will bee hardened by the custome and deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. you should therfore dayly admonish them, as <hi>Iob</hi> did his sons, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 5. without which course taken with them, the word preached will not worke vpon them so effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as otherwise by that meanes it might.</p>
   <p>I know no cause, nor need, say some, <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>1</label> to admonish my children for any grosse sinne. No more, may I say, did <hi>Iob:</hi> yet <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answere. </seg>
      </label> in a godly ielousie did he oft-times ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish his sonnes, thinking, it may bee they haue sinned; (though not in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behauiour, yet in their hearts) by blaspheming GOD in their hearts, <hi>Ib. Iob.</hi> 1. 5. For as <hi>Iob</hi> alwaies feared euen his best works; which who so doth not,
<pb facs="6"/> cannot be be blessed, <hi>Pro.</hi> 28. 14. so he considered that mans heart is a sinke and sea of all iniquitie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 19. and therefore hee saith, that man <hi>Is abominable and filthie, and drinketh iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie like water, Iob</hi> 15. 16.</p>
   <p>You say, you see in them the true <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiect. </seg>2</label> works of regeneration: they are spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, they cannot therfore sinne, incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. True; yet they cannot but sinne by <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answere. </seg>
      </label> infirmitie, and euen haply sometimes presumptuously, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did: yea, if they be not oft-times admonished, they cannot discerne the greatnes and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnes of their grossest sinnes: for as the custome and deceitfulnesse of sin harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, so it also blindfoldeth, as in <hi>Dauids</hi> example you may perceiue, who, till hee was reproued by <hi>Nathan,</hi> did not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually repent, because hee considered not, nor saw not the greatnesse and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerousnes of his sinne, but by meanes of admonition, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. Hence is it, that th' Apostle willeth vs to rebuke the works of darkenesse: so calling them, because they darken our vnderstanding, and compareth the light of reproofe and
<pb facs="7"/> admonition, to the light of a Candle, because it discouereth our sinnes that were hid vnto vs without it, as the light of a Candle doth the things which wee cannot without it espie and see, <hi>Ephesi.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
   <p>They are, you say, Gods image, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with true righteousnes and holinesse: yea they are vndefiled, <hi>Can.</hi> 5. 2. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot, vnblemished, not to be blamed, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 27. I answere, that Christians are perfectly pure, by the puritie of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, by Christs righteousnesse im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; but not by the puritie of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or by righteousnes renued: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the latter puritie, wee are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded continually to purge our selues from all filthinesse of flesh and Spirit, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. They are Gods Image also, by true righteousnesse renued, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 23. <note place="margin">
         <hi>Cap.</hi> 553 Imago De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i, sicut est abolita corruptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, sic est obscurata fumo pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum.</note> 24. Take heede therefore, that Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage be kept vndefiled, and as much as in you lyeth, vnspotted of the world, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 27. <hi>The Image of God in vs, is much defiled by vs:</hi> it is daily obscured by <hi>the fume and smoke of our offences;</hi> (sayth <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Manuel:) Wherefore, you
<pb facs="7"/> should often set before you &amp; yours, the looking-glasse of Gods Law, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by beholding, both inward and outward blemishes, daily receiued by the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of sinne; you and they may bee moued and directed, how to wash them away by repentance. Who would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure his owne, or his friends Image or picture to be polluted, or his owne appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, or his face or hands, to bee stained; and would not often haue them purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and preserued from pollution? And shall wee carelesly suffer the polluting and defiling of so great and worthy a Iewell as <hi>Gods Image is?</hi> See the danger of it, consider it<hi>: If any man defile the same, him shall God destroy, Gen.</hi> 38. 10. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>Num.</hi> 25. 9. But now <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>2</label> to grow to an end: a question heere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine may be moued; namely, whether Masters are as carefully to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct their seruants, as their sons? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Answere. </seg>
      </label> I answere, that they are: for a house-holder <note place="margin">Why ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants should bee catechized as well as sons and children.</note> should haue a fatherly care of his seruants, as if they were his sonnes or Children, and is not to vse them as they vse their beasts, respecting onely their
<pb facs="8"/> labour, and the feeding of their bodies, as many Masters doe: <hi>Abraham,</hi> whose family consisteth as well of seruants as of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sonnes, circumcised his whole Familie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 13. and charged his whole houshold to doe Iustice and Iudgement, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. If such as prouide not for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> their Family bodily foode, as well for seruants as others, bee worse then Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, as th' Apostle saith they are, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. then they must needs be much more worse then Infidels, which prouide not spirituall foode for them. But what, are not thy seruants thy brethren in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Lord? And haue they not Soules to bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> fed and saued, as well as others? did not GOD ordaine the Sabbath, as well for instruction of seruants as sonnes? <hi>Exod.</hi>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 20. 10. If by good instruction and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> thou purge not their spirituall pollutions, thou neglectest Gods Image in them, and they must needs infect thy Familie, and other Families: they will serue thee with eye seruice, vnlesse thou make them, as much as in thee lyeth, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> serue the Lord Christ: Then in seruing Christ truely, they will serue thee faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/>
      <pb facs="8"/> doing, as he saith; <hi>The will of God from the heart, with good will doing seruice vnto thee, as to the Lord, Ephesi.</hi> 6. 6. 7. 8.</p>
   <p>These motiues therefore, let them be <note place="margin">7 A finall conclusion from the end and vse of all the former Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> well meditated and pondered, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may be stirred vp thereby to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize and instruct their Children, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their welfare and their owne: Secondly, let Children bee willing for their owne credit and profit to heare and obey their Parents instructions: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let Masters for the like respect of Gods Commandement, and their owne commoditie, in making them to serue themselues in the LORD; be diligent to catechize, instruct, and admonish them, accordingly.</p>
