   <head>TO THE BRIGHT STARRE OF THE NORTH, HENRY <hi>Prince of Great</hi> BRITAINE.</head>

   </opener>
   <p>my Author (knowing that there are someworks so naturally great of themselues, that they challenge the gratious protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Princes) hath offered this his Historie to the Royall patronage of the most Christian King, two Queenes, and the Dauphin, to the end it might stirre them the more to prosecute the popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the lands heerein described, to bring the Naturals thereof (Sauage and miserable people) to ciuilitie and right knowledge of God, and so to the saluation of their soules. Assuming the like presumption, I haue hoped (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the defects which necessarily attend a stranger, who can neuer attaine the naturall <hi>Idiome</hi> of this eloquent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) that it might not be an iniury to your Highnesse; but an addition of Honor, and safetie of tbis worke, if I should dare to inscribe your Princely name on the forehead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Which bouldnesse, the noble vndertaking of the English Nation hath nourished, who haue so lately begun (by the permission, and vnder the protection of his excellent Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, your most Royall Father) to plant Christianitie in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, being one continent, &amp; next adioining land to these.
<pb facs="3"/>
For who may better support, and manage magnanimous actions, such as be the peopling of lands, planting of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, erecting of ciuill Gouernementes, and propagating of the Gospell of Christ, (which are Royall and Princely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations) then those whom the King of Kings, hath establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed as <hi>Atlasses</hi> of kingdoms &amp; Christian common weales? God hath necessitated in his Prophecie, Kings and Queenes to be nursing Fathers and nursing Mothers of his Church: so that he hath not onely committed the gouernment of a ripe and strong body, able to subsist, but hath imposed the care of the tendernesse and infancie thereof vpon them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander being yet young, would haue runne in the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian games if kings had runne there; now Kings doe run; now Princes doe worke in the Lords haruest, to spread that name which must gather the elect from the vtmost endes of the world, if not in their persons, yet with their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and meanes. I know your Highnesse would not be inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but rather excell in so noble an action: such an emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is pleasing to God; your birth leadeth vnto it; Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charitie inuiteth you to be chiefe worker in the sauing of millions of soules: The necessitie of your Countrie of Great <hi>BRITAINE,</hi> (ouer populous) doth require it: And lastly your poore Virginians doe seeme to implore your Princely aide, to helpe them to shake off the yoke of the diuel, who hath hitherto made them liue worse then beasts, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth they may be brought into the fould of Christ, and (in time) to liue vnder your Christian gouernmēt: So then hauing thus runne, you shall obtaine an euerlasting Crowne of glory, being as well planter, as defender of the Faith.</p>
