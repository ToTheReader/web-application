   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat this Author hath beene so carefully trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into the <hi>Latine, Spanish, French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> languages, is a concluding argument (to me) that no man of those Nations hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto written so well in this Argument: else, what needed they to translate him? Nay, and doubly translated hee hath beene; not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their tongues, but into their bookes; seeing that all the Writers of <hi>Geographie,</hi> since his time, have translated no small part of him into their Writings. Of some of which, what is from hence borrowed, is their very chiefe credit and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How much (I pray) hath that voluminous
<pb facs="3"/>
      <hi>French</hi> Writer (translated into <hi>Latine</hi> by <hi>Godo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredus,</hi> and into <hi>English</hi> by <note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>The States of the world.</hi>
      </note> our <hi>M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Grime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi>) beene beholding unto this Author? How much hath that <note n="*" place="margin">Petrus Bertius.</note> Turncoat Apostatizing Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giarie, that Enemie and Threatner of our <hi>English</hi> Nation, closely lurcht out of this Author? Some of our owne have beene more ingenuous, to name him when they quote him: and thats faire play.</p>
   <p>What the Setters forth of the two former Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in our language, meant in concealing his name, we will not doe them so much wrong as to ghesse at. Our <hi>Title page</hi> acknowledges him to be that famous <hi>Borero,</hi> the <hi>Italian:</hi> a Writer, that still passes amongst his owne people not only for a <hi>Wit,</hi> but for a <hi>Iudgement.</hi> His way of writing is his owne; for tis <hi>New:</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the usefulnesse of it let this be enough, that the nimblest Politico's of these active times could (perchance) have wisht, That the Relations of <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni Botero</hi> had only beene in their owne Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. That in this third Edition we have taken upon us to adde some new Discourses, and to Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment divers of the old; we were emboldned unto by the voyces and judgements of the Buyers,
<pb facs="3"/>
whom we perceived to be better pleased with those inlargements in the second Edition, than with the first. In what we have done, we have bound our selves to the Authors way and method: and how much wee have added, the next <hi>Page</hi> shall tell you.</p>
   <p>We must not in the meane time conceale from you, how that divers of the <hi>Italians</hi> (who are as naturall haters, as they are fearers of the <hi>Spanish</hi> greatnesse) have taken the same exceptions to <hi>Botero,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> of old did to <hi>Proislart:</hi> who for writing so gloriously of the <hi>English</hi> victories, and so truly of the <hi>French</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes; have thought to disgrace his whole sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by calling him a Pensioner of <hi>England,</hi> and a man hired to write by the good <hi>Rose-nobles</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> In like manner hath <hi>Botero</hi> (say some) beene suspected to have had a feeling of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Pistolets, for that hee hath written so magnificently of that Nation. This hath made us so wary and so carefull withall, by the truth of history to examine whatsoever might that way seeme hyperbolicall. Some things in that kinde wee had rather leave to be amended by your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than either too much to wrong that Nation,
<pb facs="4"/>
or to correct our Copie by bringing it under our <hi>Index Expurgatorius.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Our Author deserves rather to bee numbred among the Polititians, than amongst the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians or <hi>Geographers.</hi> Tis to his purpose some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to deliver you the situation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey he discourses upon; so to shew you, first the Greatnesse of each Kingdome: Secondly, how formidable or helpefull each Prince is likely to prove to his next neighbour; out of which two considerations, arise most of those leagues, Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and those other Tyes of State, betwixt Kingdome and Kingdome. Thirdly, wee hence learne, how suddenly either Forces or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes may bee transported from one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to another. And all these helpe him to relate of the Greatnesse and Riches of each King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; which to doe, bee two of his maine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. The <hi>Historie</hi> that hee makes use of, is to shew you the valours of people, the power of taking opportunities, the advantages of the use of severall weapons, &amp;c. and that is also to his purpose. Both <hi>Geographie</hi> and <hi>History</hi> together (which bee the two favourite studies of the times) doe serve finally for the delight
<pb facs="4"/>
of the <hi>Reader</hi>; and doe altogether make up our Author into a complete and a fine compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for Gentlemen, for Souldiers, for Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and for all men to passe the time withall: and for such an one we here commend him to your acquaintance. Fare well; and make him your owne.</p>
