      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, <hi>M. Selden</hi> hath of late published <hi>a Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Tythes,</hi> a Booke much perused for the <hi>rarenesse of the argument,</hi> too much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the <hi>variety of the language,</hi> and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much admired for the diligence of Antique Collections: And to this <hi>History</hi> hee hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a <hi>Reuiew,</hi> both to answer some <hi>priuate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections</hi> against his book, &amp; to offer some <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,</hi> wherby the wise &amp; charitable inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his History might be conceiued. Yet since, to the generall preiudice of the Church, both in profit and learning, by preiudicate Readers they are magnified; as if the <hi>Church</hi> heereby must be faine to leaue Gods interest, and relie on mans bounty; and yet (such is their conceipt) were not able to contradict the opposers: I could not but offer these <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
<pb facs="9"/> Animaduersions,</hi> to thy iudicious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, lest thou bee led <hi>by names</hi> and many <hi>strange quotations</hi> (which thou hast not leasure or care to examine) in the danger of thine owne soule, to vndoe the <hi>mother</hi> of thy faith, <hi>the Church.</hi>

   <p>By which <hi>Animaduersions</hi> when thou shalt obserue, how affection in this cause hath mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the iudgement of this Historian in this <hi>by-Argument</hi> from his profession, so that euen <hi>heerein</hi> (both in the <hi>Grammar sense</hi> of wordes and phrases, wherein as a <hi>Criticke</hi> he is iudged curious; and in the <hi>relation of ancient authorities,</hi> wherein as an <hi>Antiquary,</hi> hee hath beene dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, besides the seuerals of his incoherent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments) he is with purpose to deceiue others, himselfe deceiued; <hi>Thou</hi> wilt not hazard thy conscience, vpō the opinions of <hi>priuate,</hi> though learned men, but, submitting thy vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the iudgement of <hi>Gods Church,</hi> relying vpon Gods word, in obedient deuotion wilt both doe and thinke as it teacheth.

   <p>Yet, lest any thing in the ensuing Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersiōs
<pb facs="10"/> might either seem difficult or procure preiudice, may it please thee to be aduertised,</p>
   <p>Where in the Booke any thing is sayd to bee confessed, or produced by the Author, and some number of a page is added, the number hath reference to his booke, not to mine.</p>
   <p>When thou obseruest Quotations which he citeth out of <hi>Benedictus Leuita,</hi> not answered by that name, but by the name of <hi>Capitulars,</hi> the Fifth, Sixth, or Seuenth Booke, Know, that they are all one, the three last Bookes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him collected, and the first foure by <hi>Ansegisus:</hi> Which I admonish, lest thou, as my selfe, mayest be deceiued in name with what thou knowest in substance.</p>
   <p>As also that,</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Adreualdus de Miraculis Sancti Benedicti</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the History of <hi>Charles Martell,</hi> and</p>

   </p>
   <p>And that many authorities in the <hi>Catalogue</hi>

   </p>
   <p>And, that thou shouldest not lesse esteeme the cause I vndertake; because I am not so farre transported with passion as to answer the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ill beseeming language with the like: since yet in very many places hee imposeth, <hi>Lazie dull Ignorance, peeuish Iealousie, impudent coniecturing, patient idlenesse, base detraction, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, negligence, confidence, ridiculousnes, grosse ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, nothing but Title, beard, Habite,</hi> and infinite other such scornefull attributes, on all that shall oppose him; as if <hi>Solus saperet caeteris volitantibus vmbris:</hi> And therefore is pleased in great opinion of his owne worke, to adde the exceeding <hi>commendations</hi> thereof <hi>by himselfe.</hi> But it is the cause not the man whom I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: yet withall I must tell him, that in no age, could hee haue lesse fitly prouoked the <hi>Clergie</hi> in this cause of God then <hi>now;</hi> neuer more solide Iudgement, exquisite diligence, various disquisition of all hidden learning He must not looke to lurke in the darkenesse of vnknowen <hi>language,</hi> or priuate <hi>Chartularies,</hi> or
<pb facs="11"/> vnusuall <hi>by-named Bookes.</hi> There are, that can trace his footsteps, and adde light to his Errors. That <hi>Ignauia fallax,</hi> against which his <hi>Rubrike Title Page,</hi> is with his Motto of Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance <hi>Sumsimus Arma,</hi> is not so generall as hee would intend: For what am I, amongst the thousands of riper yeeres and abstruser know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and yet vpon confidence of the cause, and weaknesse of his Booke, haue aduentured in too short a time, the Encounter of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary, who for <hi>many yeeres</hi> hath vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately studied, and now <hi>vntimely</hi> produced this errour of his Art? But since by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to that Honourable Court of <hi>High Commission,</hi> hee hath acknowledged his fault, his person need not be opposed; which I rather manifest, because in many, the Doctrinal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences from his Booke haue bred Errour, who haue not vnderstood that the Author of the booke hath beene sorry for the publishing of it: For whose sake as I haue vndertooke the answer, so for Truths sake I desire their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</p>
