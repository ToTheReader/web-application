I do suppose and beleue verely that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holy gost did make no lesse melody in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> breast of this godly doctor in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> writing of thys commentary, and that he was no lesse rauished therwith: thā was the holy Prophet Dauid: what tyine he did wright thys psalme.</p>
   <p>Here maye ye se what is ment by the tabernacle of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Lord, what by the worshipping in the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle wherof we do reade so often in the olde testament. What also is signified by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> holi mount. And what kind of people thei are which shall rest therein. Here shall you read foure notable vices rebuked and reprehended of the Prophet. Hypocrisie. Vngodly and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful swearinge. The damnable de sir and study to gether goodes to gather by vsury. And last of al he speketh of the corrupt iudgement
<pb facs="9"/>and vnryghtuouse iustice of the Iudges.</p>
   <p>The whiche foure vices haue so inuaded all the worlde, that no place almost can be founde cleare thereof, that the moste parte of al mē are either hypocrites, or blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers agaynst the name of the Lorde, either abominable vsurers or elles corrupte and wrongfull Iudges. What needeth me here to speake any thynge agaynst the diuelishnes of hypocrites, cloked with outwarde holines: working thereby theyr owne damnation: &amp; the distruction of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande soules? whiche by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation of those which are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and keepynge company with those whiche are, and alway haue ben mortal enemies to the Lorde are fallen and gone cleane awaye from the true doctrine of Christ,
<pb facs="10"/>to the teachynge of the Diuyll. Whose mouthes (I saye) before their high and forked promotions so thundered the worde of God a brode to the worlde, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the whole rable of the vniuersities were not able to resiste them: beinge after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde so stopped with softe wolle that their throtes are choked vp: that they cā not giue one sounde or voice of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> truth. I wyl not say that they be not ashamed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare openly to the people, that they haue erred before tymes, and so beinge foule deceiued and sedu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced by the Diuyll: haue deceyued other, and haue taught thē moste perniciouse and false doctrine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortyng thē therfore to take hede of suche doctrine, if any man do sowe any suche amonge them.</p>
   <p>Wherein lyke foule Hypocrites they do bely them selues shamful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly:
<pb facs="10"/>they do sclaunder the trueth, and the holy worde of God: they hurt the cōsciences of many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, whiche beleuynge theyr wordes: vnder a zeale &amp; holines spoken, do fall ignorauntly from the trueth. If they had not bene plucked vp to promotiōs and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: they woulde neuer haue sayed tonge thou haste lyed. But here we may se the prouerbe true y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Honores mutant mores. There was a ryghte godly man, whiche on a tyme dyd saye to a bishoppe: whō Sathan had deceyued, being fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the ryghte waye: I am glad that I am no bishop: or if I were once a bishop, I am glad y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> I dyd forsake it, or elles I feare me er thys tyme I shoulde haue bene caryed frō the truth, as well as you. Bicause of this great cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption and poyson whiche com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb facs="11"/>by the company of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: and al for promotion sake, for fauoure and for friendship: to be bishopped, to be personed, to be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>warded wyth greate profite for forsakyng of their maister Christ of whom they haue taken an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest peny to serue faithfully: ther fore oure Doctor Iohn Epinus moueth a certeine question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that a man, whiche doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Christe, which fauoureth his worde: which loueth veritie may keepe company, and maye be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the wicked, maye holde them vp with yea and naye: may be conuersaunt wyth them at all theyr doinges, cōsenting to their abominations, wythout the hurt of his conscience: not hurting the spirituall health of his brother or neighbour: not giuyng therby occasion of sclaūder to the worde
<pb facs="11"/>of God: and finally, hym selfe not to be a whitte the worse thereby: Yea or nay. This question being soluted, that nothyng cā be saied to the contrary: as the Psalme doth minister occasion, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie many, whiche do affirme that in no case a man oughte to swere or to make an othe whether it be commaunded hym of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate or voluntarily, cōtending that it is synne to vse any othe: for asmuche as Christe did forbid vs to swere at all: but that oure communication shoulde be ended wyth yea and naye. Beinge also many of a contrary sorte, whiche thynkyng it no synne at al (swere they neuer so muche) but rather supposinge them selues best men: whiche cā inuent and deuise most diuelishe othes passynge all other (As by familiar exemple) There
<pb facs="12"/>were two transgressors caste in prison, in one of the counters in London for a certeyne robberie committed: whiche, as they were merily disposed (theyr harlottes beinge wyth them to confort thē) the one of the theues sayd to the other. Let vs sit doune at this ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble one agaynste the other, and he that can outswere the other shal paye nothynge for his breakfast, he that is ouercome shall paye for all. Such was theyr swering and starynge, suche was the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge and rentinge of the Lorde, suche was the rehearsall of all the partes of the Lorde his body pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy and aperte, that no godly crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture can abide to here it agayne. Whose ende wythin three dayes after was hangyng, a meete pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishmente for theyr impietie and blasphemy, if there had ben none
<pb facs="12"/>other crime to be punished. I woulde to Christ the magistrates woulde loke some thynge on thys matter. Concerning therfore the makyng of othes, by the waye of a question oure writer discusseth whether it be lawful and stāding wyth the worde of God to swere, either voluntarily or elles by cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion of the magistrates and ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers. Whether they be bounde to keepe &amp; perfourme the oth, which they hane sworne: if it be to theyr hurte and preiudice, whiche do make the othe. Whether an othe made w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>out addyng of the name of god in the makinge thereof do bynde the swerer to the perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunce of the othe. Whether all mē wythout exception are boūde to keepe their othes by thē made. Whether any magistrate can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence wyth an othe lawefully
<pb facs="13"/>made, yea or naye. In thys parte also he discusseth the question of votaries: whether that a man maye make a vowe, and whether that vowes being made do binde the votaries, yea or naye. What vowes do binde and what do not what men are bounde, and what they be whō theyr vowes do not binde to the perfourming of thē. All these demaundes beinge an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, wherein is greate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and learnyng: more then in a. M. brabling sophistical scholes: he procedeth as the texte doeth go: tyll he commeth to the verse, which pronounceth that mā bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and one of the church of God whiche hath not lent his money to vsurie. In thys poynte he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an excellente piece of worke. He sheweth what vsurie is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge to be vnpossible that vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb facs="13"/>can be saued, excepte they do repent, and restore agayne that whiche they haue wrongfully ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken. O merciful Lorde what shal become of a greate nūbre of riche men: whiche knowynge no ende of theyr goodes: dyd neuer come by the hundreth parte of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> which they do possesse, by any other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest meane and lawfull crafte, thē by thys meane whiche is so cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and damnable: that it destroy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth at the last both body &amp; soule. If many which are worth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes, shoulde restore but halfe that, whiche they haue by thys vngodly meane obteined &amp; gotte: of their thousandes howe fewe hundredes should they haue left, nay how many thousādes should they be in dette? There are so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse &amp; many kyndes of vsuries, that almost a man can not reken
<pb facs="14"/>them vp. Yea it is so craftie and subtil a kinde of occupiynge, that when a man shal thynke him selfe lest burdeyned, then shal he finde hym selfe at the laste mooste sore cutte. As by exemple, what man woulde not thynke hym selfe wel at ease, if he myght borowe an hū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drede pounde, to paye weekly for one yere space, but one peny for euerie pounde, whiche amoūting to an hūdrede pence for one weeke maketh by the yeres ende, fiftie &amp; two hundrede pence, whiche are poundes. xxi. and. xiii. shyllinges and four pence. Howe wel at ease is thys man nowe, when he shall perceiue y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he leeseth so muche by suche small driblettes, as by one peny meele, thynkyng before that it was nothynge at all (to speake of) to gyue one peny for the lone of a pounde weekly? Much more
<pb facs="14"/>doth that man leese, whiche doth paye two pence in the pounde for euerie weekes lone. What great gaines therby cōmeth to the vsu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rer, which of his hūdrede pounde shoulde make by the yeres ende one. C. xl. &amp;. iii. li vi. s. viii. d. An other sorte of vsurers there are: whiche do not lende their money weekly, but for the yere, by the hū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>drede, takyng for euerie hūdrede, some xv. li. some. xx li some. xxx. li The whiche is the moste gentle sort of vsurers, of those which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende to be rich by their craft and occupatiō. But there is an other sort beinge no men, but diuils of hel, makinge them selues so holy, that to winne a thousāde pounde they woulde not seme to play the vsurers. At whose hande if an ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nest man beinge in necessitie, and hauynge neede, woulde borowe
<pb facs="15"/>a litle peece of money to serue his purpose: promising to giue to thē some thynge for the lone thereof, they wyll deteste and curse that kynde of gayne, they wil spitte at it: and yet lyke foule hypocrites thei be ten times worse and more abominable in the syghte of God and man, then that other before rehearsed. They wyl sort &amp; point furth such wares for thē whiche are in necessitie for the tyme, that where as a mā is nowe but in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, he shall be broughte to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme calamitie and miserie, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng suche wares at theyr hādes, as haukes cappes, tassels for hau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes, haukes bels, poyntes, broune paper, wyth suche other peltrie ware, that the poore man shal ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer make the fourth peny of his ware agayue, that it had ben lesse harme for hym to haue loste. xx. or
<pb facs="15"/>xx. li. in the hundrede, to receiue the rest in money wherewyth he myghte do his feate and purpose, then to medle wyth suche begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ware, which he must go about by the healpe of brokers to sell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne (peraduenture to the selfe same man at whose hādes he dyd receiue the said ware) for lesse thē three quarters of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> money which he muste paye for it. And by thys meanes, by a colour of bying and sellyng, thys foule vsurer woulde colour his vsurie wyth more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression &amp; vndoing of them which haue to do with him, then the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifest vsurers and open extorcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. There is an other company of them whiche wyll lende theyr money wyth a good wyl, takyng no maner of gayne and profit for the lone thereof: but yet they do meane no lesse Diuelishnesse in
<pb facs="16"/>theyr herte then the other. For if they do lende a man .xx. pounde &amp; take nothinge for the vse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet they wyll paye him home one waye or other that he shall wrynge for it. They wyl sell hym some olde broken wynded horse, some pretie rynge wyth a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited stone, some olde layed &amp; braithed piece of chamlet, or some suche lyke trifel that he shal leese in that whiche was bought, fyue or sixe pounde for the pleasure of the .xx. li. being lent to hym. And thus they do voyed pretelie by thys legerdemayne the name of an vsurer. They hādle their mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters so craftely that God (as they do persuade thē selues) cā not per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue theyr vsurie. What great landes haue these vsurers gottē by forfetynge of bondes, the pore men being so bounde in our lady
<pb facs="16"/>bondes, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they are ready to braste what with statutes marchaunt, and statutes staple, that they are wyped cleane out of al that they haue, neuer to be redemed againe if they do breake but one cōdition of the obligation &amp; bonde. There is amonge them no more redemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion then in hell, that the poore mē may singe w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> the soule priestes
<q>Heu me, quia in inferno nulla eft redemptio.</q> They maye crie out to the Lorde w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> these w<seg rend="sup">t</seg>ordes, plucke me (good Lorde) frō the iawes of hel. There is no hel worse then the tormētes wherewyth they do torment the poore, wherewyth they do begger thē, their wyues, &amp; their children. The thirde &amp; fourth generation do crie for vengeaunce to fall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pō them. The Lorde before hande doeth knowe that these thus op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, wyll call on hym, as on a
<pb facs="17"/>iust Iudge for iustice. Wherfore as he is iuste, so muste he and also wyl iudge iustly. Therfore except they do repent and restore againe before they departe fourth of this lyfe all their vsurarie profites: I say y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> al their chauntrees, al their trentals and scala celi masses, all theyr satisfactorie deedes: al their deuelishe and obominable sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, al theyr offerynge vp (as they saye) of the body and bloud of the Lorde to the high dishonoure of his heauēly maiestie (then the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes market &amp; fayre beinge at the best when the moste diuyl taketh his leaue frō thys lyfe wyth such an euyll &amp; a desperate conscience, that he careth not what he gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for this damnable ware and marchādise, and yet not a whitte the more quieted) I saye once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne all that euerwyth the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
<pb facs="17"/>merchaūtes thei haue thus bargayned for to saue them, shall do as muche good to their soules, as a nedell poynte beinge thruste into the sighte of a mannes eye. What shall I speake of the laye men: are there no priestes (do you thynke) whiche vse thys trade? Thinke you that the priestes wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>let the laye men go to the Deuyll alone? Naye<seg rend="sup">•</seg> verely, they wyll be the laye mennes chaplens to hell whether they wylor nay: it is not meete that suche worshipful men shoulde be wythout theyr chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens. Wel, they wyl go wyth thē or runne before them rather then fayle, and it were but for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sake. There is a certeine priest in London amonge many (which I myght rehearse) sometyme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a monke of the charterhouse (I wyll not saye that he-serueth
<pb facs="18"/>in saynt Nicholas parishe beside Lumbarde strete (though al men there aboute saye so) whiche wyll soner fynde an hundrede pounde or twayne (as the most mē say) to let furth on vsurie, then many a man whiche doeth go in a cote of sylke wyl fynde two grotes in his purse sometyme to pay for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and yet he wyll go in a poore goune of fryse, and his hose hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp to the calfe of the legge wyth lether for sparyng of cloth: that &amp; al goodnes (my tonge trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped) I would say auarice and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet ousnes were loste, it should be (as the prouerbe maketh mentiō) founde in priestes.</p>
   <p>In discussynge of thys matter our Doctor declareth to whō we are boūde to gyue freely for gods sake: to whom we are bounde to lende freely wythout interest: &amp;
<pb facs="18"/>to whom we are not bounde, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to gyue nor to lende: but at our owne pleasure, deuiding mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynde into thre sortes of mē, that is to say into those which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme miserable and poore: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde into those whiche are not dryuen to such pouertie, but that they are able to pay againe if thei do borowe anie thynge: and the thirde into those whiche are riche and substantiall.</p>
   <p>Thys done he procedeth to an other questian, whiche is thys. Whether purchasynge of landes be an vsurarie contracte: yea or naye. Wherin he declareth: that landes bought for twentie yeres purchase: is a lawfull purchase. Alother purchases beinge vnder xx. yeres purchase being plaine v<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>surie on his part which did make the purchase: &amp; if the lande be sold
<pb facs="19"/>aboue. xx. yeres purchase: vsurie is cōmitted on his side which sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the lande. But I do thynke verely that there is a greater nū<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bre of those which are vsurers, of the byers, thē of the sellers: other wyse it shoulde not be seene, that so many men do hoppe wythout their landes as do &amp; haue done of longe tyme, sence that a certeyne kynde of men began to be purcha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sers: and agayne we shoulde not see, that which nowe al Englāde doth both see &amp; feele to the greate ruine and decaye of all the whole realme so manie come to so greate landes: to haue so manie Lorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppes that they maye ryde in theyr owne grounde, some man ten miles, some twentie, some mā xxx. or. xl. and no mā hauyng one fote of grounde wythin them, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng theyr tenauntes vnder thē,
<pb facs="19"/>not lyke bretherne (whiche haue one father wyth them) but lyke bondmen and staues, oppressynge them with reising of rentes, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of fines and incomes: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling them to fetch not so much as bread and drynke, but at their bakehouses, and bruhouses, that the poore tenauntes are not able to haue one peny before an other. They become not onely vnsatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble purchasers: but also they are bakers, bruers, myllers, malt mē, coliers, and woodmen, that there can not be a peny of gaine, which they wyll not fynde out first, and licke it from the poore tenauntes bearde which taketh al the peine. The Turkes and Mores whiche are enemies to the faith of Christ neuer vsed theyr slaues so vumer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cifully, and vncharitably, if they woulde be tractable and not stub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>burne
<pb facs="20"/>to their maister, as these helhoundes do crucifie &amp; tormēt theyr christian and faythfull bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne. To whom are these pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasers profitable and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? For soth neither to theyr lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng and lawfull Kynge, nor yet in his commons. Although that he whiche is louynge to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons can no chose but be also lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to his Prince But these as I haue sayed are neither to the one nor to the other. Frō whence commeth all thys beggerie and great barenes amonge the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons thorowe out al the kynges dominion, but from these cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauntes which do swalowe al to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyther doune into theyr bealies whole. What greater tirannie cā there be in the whole world, then to beholde &amp; see where as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande men had honest lyuynges:
<pb facs="20"/>nowe one Deuyll to haue all, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; selling theyr poore tenaūtes in oppressyng them, and keepyng thē bare: as they would bye oxen and shepe: lest they should growe to ryche and be to welthie. Howe can vitayles be good chepe either in citie or towne, when that these gorre bealies wyl be the sellers of corne both for breade and drynke: &amp; also of fleshe, by their tenaūtes, by theyr slaues, I shoulde saye? whē y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> woodmen &amp; coliars shal be theyr seruauntes? Thus muche good do the greate purchasers to the cōmōs, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in great plēty they make great scarcitie and penury. Doth the kinge his maiestie leese no thynge by them? yes verily, a much greater matters then men can well perceyue. His grace lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth so muche as the poore men in tyme of neede woulde wyth all
<pb facs="21"/>theyr hertes gyue: if they were so wealthy and ryche as they were wont to be whē they were either Lordes of their owne ground: or els hauing so gentle lande lordes that paying their acustomed rent they might nor should not be put besyde their farmes &amp; groundes, neither they them selues nor yet their wiues after thē or childrē, &amp; childernes childrē (the landlordes at that tyme reioysynge mooste whiche had tenauntes of longest continuance) which nowe beinge so bare that they be able to gyue nothynge at all, nor that other whiche hath taken awaye theyr lyuynge, payinge one peny more then they shoulde if they had not, naye paying muche lesse, then if they had not bene purchasers at all, their greate substaunce nowe beinge minished in the byinge of
<pb facs="21"/>lādes. If it be vsurie then to bye lāde for eightene yeres purchase: what name shal we giue to them whiche wyll haue theyr feed men in countreis and townes all the yere longe: to watche &amp; spie who hath neede of money: who is wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge to sell his lande, who be in that case and daunger that they must needes sell theyr laude, that a thynge shall not so sone fal but it is takē vp for ten, nine &amp; eighte yeres purchase, to saye that they wyll giue .xvi. or .xviii. yeres pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chase, except thei do perceiue &amp; see y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they may make as muche more of it, either for the goodnes of the ground or in tariyng a litle time tyll a lease be expired (afterwarde beinge worth thrise the value of that it doth go for at that presēt) they wyl be ware of it: they wyll not drynke so hotte for scaldynge
<pb facs="22"/>of theyr throte. They wyll saye vnto me peraduenture. Who can lette me to bye as good chepe as I maye: the money is myne owne: the lande is his? Wherfore shall not I bye as good chepe as I maye? I wyll not answere thē wyth these wordes, which Christ dyd speake to his children: saying loue you one an other, as I loued you: which gaue my selfe for you: whereby men shall knowe you to be my disciples. I wyn not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere them that they oughte to haue a pitifull eye on their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in neede. I wyl not answer them that they are boūde to considre whether the sellynge of the lande shall be theyr vtter vndoing and impouerishing, yea or naye. I wyll not say that they oughte and are bounde rather to healpe them and lende them also
<pb facs="22"/>(sauing thē selues harmles) then to bye that whiche shoulde be the lyuynge of them and theirs. But thys I wyll saye. If they wyll rūne to the Deuyl who shal stop thē? If they wyl be damned, who can saue them. They wyl say per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture to me: that none wyl saye as I do, but those whiche be vagabondes, knawe, heretikes, &amp; suche as neuer come to the honor to were skarlette gounes: or to be knyghtes and sordes felowes. I answer them agayne that salua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion perteyneth to all men that beleue and wil be saued, and that: not they whiche haue moste, but whiche do lyue moste godly: most quietly wythout dammage and hurt of their neighbour, are most accepted before God. If a man shoulde stande in the declaration of all the euyl which doth springe
<pb facs="23"/>furth of thys dānable synne in al cōmune wealthes, in all cities &amp; tounes: besyde that no man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to atteyne to the summe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but alwaye shal leaue as much vnspokē, as he hath tolde and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared: what godly mānes eares are able to abide to heare y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> greate impietie thereof rehearsed? If it were possible by any mānes brai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to comprehende by writynge or other wyse the houge and mō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous mischiefe, the greate sea of aleuyl, which it doeth cause to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowe the whole worlde.</p>
   <p>Wherefore to conclude in fewe wordes: hangyng is to fayre &amp; to easie a death for them, whiche are so abominable traytours both to God and man, whiche do robbe &amp; kyll not one or twayne by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> high waye syde for neede: but sittynge at home in theyr cheares banket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge
<pb facs="23"/>and feastyng, they do robbe and vndoo al the world both high and lowe. All is fishe wyth them that cometh to the net. I woulde God euerie realme had a strayte lawe for them as certeyne cities and townes haue for the cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt byrde which destroyeth all riuer fishe. Yet would they finde holes to escape and auoyed the daunger of the lawe: yet woulde they be vsurers styll, yet woulde they be damned who so euer sayth naye. For they wyll neuer repent and restore agayne their wronge gottē ryches. They do perceyue: that if they shoulde so do (euerie byrde hauyng his fether home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne) that then they shoulde be lefte as naked as my nayle, they shoulde not haue a sherte to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them wyth, I trust the good and godly wyll be herewyth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
<pb facs="24"/>offended As for the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and those whose cōsciences are burnt w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> an hotte yron. I doubt not but they wyll holde them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues content and speake not one worde leste that men do finde the olde Prouerbe verified in them, whiche is rubbe an horse on the galle and he wyl winche.</p>
   <p>After thys matter our Doctor demaundeth. If a man lendyng his money wyth good wyll wyth out gaynes for certeine tyme: not beinge payed at the tyme pointed but prolonged of to his great hin deraunce: whether that man so lendynge his money, and beinge not payed longe tyme after that it should haue ben: may demaūde of hym, whiche dyd borowe the sayed money, the interest for the dāmage &amp; hurte, whiche he hath susteyned in forberynge his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb facs="24"/>longar tyme: then was his ease for to do, &amp; y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> demaunde whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be vsurie, yea or naye. Whereto he declareth that it is not reason: that for a mans good wyll, he shoulde suffre hurte and that he is bounde to recompence hym for the hurte therby sustey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that the lender may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde the dammage by way of action: no vsurie therin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Howbeit bicause euerie man is readie to take occasion of euyll by euerie light and smal exemple: therfore he counsayleth them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to demaunde anie suche interest, thē for to do it: teachyng them y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it is the stedfaster &amp; more sure way to demaunde his owne and not to meddle wyth interest.</p>
   <p>This done, where as the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist declareth that same mā hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pye, whiche taketh no gyftes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
<pb facs="25"/>the innocent: maister E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus taketh occasion of an other question to be propouned. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lawefull for a Iudge (though he be neuer so good and ryghtuous) to receyue anie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gyftes of either of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whiche are suters before him the playntiffe or defendant: or of both, either before the cause or cō trouersie be ended or after.</p>
   <p>For as muche as a Iudge is a publike &amp; cōmō minister of iustice in a cōmon wealth to see y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> euerie man shall haue his ryght, to see y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> no manne do to his neighboure wronge, to see y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> the poore be not oppressed by the rich, but to deme &amp; iudge all causes vpryghtly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differētly, without respect of any maner of person, to ende al cōtro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersies, debates &amp; strifes which do often tymes ryse &amp; sprynge vp
<pb facs="25"/>amonge men, accordyng to equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and iustice, nothynge in the worlde beinge more enemie, nor greater pestilence to iustice and ryght iudgement, then a Iudge to be a gredy and a couetous mā, a man lokyng after gyftes not cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent wyth his stipende and salary whiche he doeth receyue for the doing of his office of the cōmune wealth. Therfore he warneth thē of theyr deutie that theyr office is to be vpryght, to leane and cleue to neither partie: to loke a wry neither for frēde nor foo, kiffe nor kynne: high or lowe, rich or poore straunger or countrey man: nor yet to receyue any maner of gyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: on whiche syde so euer it be, neither greate nor small as it is written. Deut. xvii. but to wey all causes by the ryghte lyne and balaunce of iustice. He declareth
<pb facs="26"/>to them: that it is theft and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie for a Iudge to take gyftes of anie man which is a sueter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hym, not onely bicause it is a sellynge of iustice, an occasion of wronge iudgement, and a depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng or robbyng of the innocent in his iust cause, but also though he be neuer so muche indifferent, though he mynde to do no maner of iniurie for all that he receyued giftes and rewardes: Yet bicause it is a great coniecture, &amp; an euyl suspection of vnryghtuousnesse, bicause it maketh the sentence to be suspecte: therefore he wylleth Iudges for nothinge to take any maner of rewardes: he declareth to them, that the receyuynge of gyftes is counted in the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of them whiche are cursed by the mouth of the Lorde. He decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth furthermore, that the heade
<pb facs="26"/>rulers of commune wealthes, are boūde to prouid for Iudges such sufficiient &amp; honest lyuynge: that they shoulde not neede to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maner of rewardes and giftes that they maye be able to fynde them selues and theirs therwyth honestly: syth that they do bestow their tyme in the commune af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and busines, sith that they cā not both labour for their owne familie and serue the communes also, in the office wherunto they be called. Thys lesson howe well many Iudges and other persons whiche are sette to be indifferent betwene man and mā, do obserue and keepe (I can accuse no man) but the tedious and long suetes of the poore, the short and quicke dispatch of the riche, maketh men to suspecte that all thynge is not accordingly as it ought for to be.
<pb facs="27"/>It hath bene often tymes sene &amp; perceyued, that the sentence of the poore mannes cause hath ben determined before it hathe bene hearde what the poore mā might say and lay for him selfe. I would wishe and desire that all Iudges shoulde gyue theyr seruauntes great charge that thei do receiue no maner of gyftes or rewardes and that they their selfe shoulde gyue to them suche wages, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they shoulde not neede to take anie thinge of any man. For all that whiche is gyuen to them: is to ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teyne fauoure and friendshyp in theyr causes: to be good vnto thē, to remembre them to theyr mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, whē they be at leasure, whē assueters are gone, when the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte maye boldly speake, then to speake a good worde for them: to healpe to dispatche thē: which
<pb facs="27"/>all together smelleth not of the best. But some Iudges and other officers hauing great and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent liuinges by their offices, haue ben sclaundered (I feare me of the truth) that theyr seruauntes and officers vnder thē haue had none other wages of thē for their seruice, then such vauntages and gaynes as they myghte gette in theyr seruice, of them whiche are sueters, skant hauynge of theyr maisters a good liuerie once in a yere. If thei haue a liueri at their handes, they shall both bye the ly<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyng and also the gardyng ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, of theyr owne purse, or els they shoulde were a single cote almost as good neuer a whitte as neuer the better, &amp; yet theyr seruauntes in verie fewe yeres do growe to so much wealth, that almost they knowe not them selues. If al this
<pb facs="28"/>be true (as I doubte me it is to true) what doth then folowe, but that he whiche myght beste giue, shoulde speede best, Lorde money being the chiefe iudge in his cause whether it be ryght or wronge. I haue hearde also of manie men whiche haue wroughte, yea and boughte them selues into greate mennes seruice: neither for neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, nor for the desire to do them anie honeste seruice, nor yet that they myght thereby be either the more godly or iust: but that they myght beare the greater swynge bicause they belonge to great mē in the countrey where they doe dwell, that they might beare and make suche a bragge in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis, that no man shoulde once route agaynst them or say blacke to theyr eye what so euer extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they do. Suche seruauntes
<pb facs="28"/>thoughe theyr maisters be neuer so vprighte &amp; iust, causeth thē to haue an euil name, to be yl repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of (as far as men dare speake) to theyr greate dishonour, and to the sclaunder of iustice, that a mā woulde be loth to haue his cause come before thē which haue such leude seruauntes, gatherynge of the conditions of the seruauntes the maners and affections of the maisters. I haue knowē in other countreis some Iudges of suche integritie &amp; vpryghte iustice that they woulde not abyde hym, nor heare his cause, which would but profer or make mention of anie gyftes: but yet they coulde be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent that theyr nigh seruauntes (whom the sueters knewe well ynough) should take for them, al that they could catche, and much worse thē that, like vnto the bare
<pb facs="29"/>foted friers of the ordre of Fraun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, whiche wyth theyr bare han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des had rather tutche twentie women, then one peny: but wyth theyr gloues on theyr handes, or els, per alios, as they were wonte to saye, by other: yea &amp; into their sleue if you woulde powre furth of bagges bushels of syluer, they woulde not throwe it awaye.</p>
   <p>O Lorde where is iustice and equitie become, whē such corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in place? Howe cā a iudge both be iuste, and also a receyuer of gyftes? what man wyl receyue a gifte, but to do pleasure againe for it, or elles he were vnkynde? Gyftes and rewardes haue come in so faste to some men in tymes paste, that sodenly frō a lowe and meane estate, as from a low ebbe, they haue rysen and flowen vp to great possessions, to be Lordes fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
<pb facs="29"/>&amp; what els besyde? Thys is to be taken for a proued veritie as wel in Englāde as in al other nations, that the beste Iudges haue ben alwaye the poorest and of smallest substaunce. The olde &amp; auncient Romaines what time they were rulers alone hauynge no rulers or heades ouer them be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge honest and ciuile wyse men, knowing neither God nor his pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mise, toke it for a certeyne argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great extortion, of great briberie and robberie, when they did perceiue a senator or an other Iudge to growe fatte in ryches, to haue and possesse great landes and rentes, on cōtrary wyse that senator whiche was moste poore: him they had in moste honour, in moste reputation, hym woulde they bringe after his death, with all solemnitie, accompanied with
<pb facs="30"/>them al the honourable and wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shypful personnes of the Citie to his graue in token of his ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ousnes and iuste seruice to the cō<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mune wealth, they woulde sette his image of stone or brasse wyth his name on a pillar in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune places of the Citie where all resorte should be: they woulde bestowe his chyldrē to mariages and other promotions on the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune purse and charges of the ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie, that they shoulde not neede neither to pill nor poll, nor to do vniustly, for to leaue their wife &amp; chyldren ryche in great prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and abundaūce of al thynges. Thys good iudge dyd thynke no felicitie to be compared to that, for to be remēbred after his death to haue his image sette vp to be a memoriall to his successoures of his equitie and good conscience:
<pb facs="30"/>of his indifferēt dealing betwene all parties: that he was no pollar of the commune wealth: y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he dyd chuse rather to dye poore with mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nistration of ryghte iustice, then to leaue to his posteritie greate riches wrongfully gotten and ga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thered together wyth the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and hurte of innumerable. In fewe wordesly kewyse as the Lorde is a most rightuous iugde ouer the quicke and deade, iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge all thynge ryghtuously, so must they be here in earth, whose roume and place they do occupie for a time, otherwise they are not worthie to be called iudges, but robbers &amp; theues. For the name of a Iudge is an holy, godly, and a heauenly name, the iuste mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of whose office is the pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seruation of commune wealthes, and otherwyse the vtterly decay,
