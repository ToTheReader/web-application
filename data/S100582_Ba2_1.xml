   <p>HEre hast thou good christian reader, to thy soules consolation, from the eternall Trinitie, y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> Father, the Sonne &amp; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, three distincte persons in one euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting godhead, the vniuersall estate of the church from Christes ascencion to the ende of the world, in wonderfull mysteries discry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, &amp; directed vnto thee of him, by the most holy Apostle and Euangelist Saint Iohn. Wherein it is fully by all due circumstances manifested of the sayde holy Ghost, what the innocent Christian church is, with all hir iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifications &amp; blessings, to the singular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte of the Lords true electes, and what the proude Synagoge of Antichrist is, with hyr filthy superstitions and plagues, to their fore warning also. This is specially done here of the sayde holy ghost, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> no true beleuer should professe him selfe a citizen of this wretched world with Cain, Nemroth, &amp; other repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate vessels, at the execrable doctrine of men, but at the pure voyce of God with Abell and Abraham, to seeke for that heauēly heritage which is purchased for them in Christes bloud. Marke heere the condition of Iohn being in most paynefull exile, for he in miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie through all this booke representeth euery godly beleuer. By this shall ye well knowe in this reuelation the one church from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the one is mayntayned by the onely preaching of Gods pure worde, the other by all kyndes of Iewishe ceremonyes and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
<pb facs="454"/>
superstitions. And by this they also differ, that Christ wold haue all of loue, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist of tyrannous constraint, as euidently appeareth in Mahomete and the Pope. For that only cause are many necessary thynges here written in mysterie, that they should bee hid from the worldly wyse Hypocrites, and that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> iust or Gods meeke spirited seruaūts, should aske them of their Lorde in fayth and prayer. In the which dayly prayer, is that most worthy minister of God, Kyng Henry the eight afore all other to thée remembred, which hath so sore wounded the beast, that he may before his departure, or Prynce Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde after him, throw all his supersticions into the bottomlesse lake agayne (frō whence they haue commen) to y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> comforte of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The grace and peace dyrected from God the Father &amp; his Son Iesus Christ, with the holy Ghost, in y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> beginning of this reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latyon be vnto all them which vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly loue hys veritie. Amen.</p>
