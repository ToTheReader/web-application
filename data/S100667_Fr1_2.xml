   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are many in <hi>England</hi> I perceiue, that are so addicted vnto their own opinions, as concerning the pretended holy Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and such a reformation, as they themselues haue deuised: that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with anie patience endure, to heare either contradiction or argument to the contrarie. <hi>I knowe some of them</hi> (saith a certaine aduertiser touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies of the Church of England) <hi>that would thinke it a tempting of God, to heare or read what might bee saide against them: as if they could be at quod bonum est tenete, without an omnia probate, going before.</hi> Which maner of persons, the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> resembleth vnto the deafe Adder, <note place="margin">Psal. 58.</note>
      <hi>that stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his eare, and will not heare the voyce of the inchaunter, though he be expert in charming.</hi> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> writing vpon these wordes, saith: that the serpent delighting in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wherewithall hee hath inclosed himselfe, clappeth one of his eares very hard to the ground, and with his taile stoppeth the other: least hearing the <hi>Marso,</hi> he should be brought forth to the light. And so do a great number of these Serpentine persons, whereof the aduertiser made mention: they stop one of their eares so hard with earth, that is, with a most insatiable and greedy desire of riches:
<pb facs="3"/>
and the other with their tayles, whereby saith <hi>Aug: posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or a intelliguntur,</hi> that is with a sacrilegious hope, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after vnder pretence of setting vppe theyr discipline, they may come to the massacre and spoyle of the Church: and will fleere and Ieere, much against theyr own consciences, (god knoweth) when any inchaunter or <hi>Marso</hi> assayleth either by wordes or writinge to charme them. With these men or any else, whose hartes are thus possessed, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this earth and hope, or with any other such like poison, for what respects soeuer: I haue nothing here to doe: but onely to pray for them, that god mollifying their preiudiciall and obstinate mindes, they may be content, first to beholde, and then with humility to acknowledge the truth.</p>
   <p>There is an other sorte both of the Clergy and laitye, who notwithstanding they fauour the pretended discip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, euen with singlenesse of hart, and in good earnest (I am perswaded,) as supposing it to be the Lordes owne workemanship, &amp; holy institution: yet forasmuch as they do very well know, that many dishes are washed cleane on the outside, and yet are foule within: that many sepulchers are gorgious to the eies, and yet inwardly haue nothing in them but bones and corruption: that men may be often times deceiued with shewes and probabilities, as allwayes heretofore many haue beene: and that there are no spirits of any prophets in our dayes, which ought not to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the spirites of other prophets: they will be pleased I trust, to yeald themselues vnto the Apostolicall rules of trying of all thinges, and not bee caried away, either with rashnesse or preiudice, to belieue any spirit, vntil they haue tried it throughly whether it be of god.</p>
   <p>In the behalfe of these men, and for their sakes especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
<pb facs="3"/>
I haue presumed to offer vnto their wise and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent consideration, such simple notes and obseruations, as I had formerly gathered, when according to the said rules of the Apostles, by occasion of the great opinion, which beganne to growe of the <hi>Geneua</hi>-forme of ecclesiasticall discipline, I was bold to try and examine it, according to the measure of such small ability and iudgement, as god hath indued me withall. Whereby if either they or any other shall reape anye profit, to the establishing of their mindes in this giddy age, from running vppe and downe after euery young start-vp, hether and thether, to secke new platformes of Church-gouernment in this place or that place: when as we haue one of our owne, which is in my conscience truely Apostolicall, and farre to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, before any other that is receiued this day by any reformed Church in Christendome: I shall thinke my paynes well bestowed: nay, I shall bee right glade in my hart, and allwayes most thankefull vnto allmightie god for it. Otherwise if by reason of such weakenes and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as I do acknowledge to bee in my selfe, &amp; to haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed themselues in euery parte of this Treatise, there shall any offence bee taken, that may blast or hinder the sayde fruite, which I doe indeede most earnestly desire, I cannot choose but bee very sory for it, satisfyinge my selfe in the meane time notwithstanding, that in the whole processe following, (the contents whereof you may see in the next pages) I haue set downe nothing, which I doe not thinke I haue set down truly. <hi>Liberaui animam meam.</hi> I haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in discharged my conscience: and so I committe you to God.</p>
