      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T VVERE TO BE vvished (my deere friend) that euen the vvhole course of this our frayle and mortall life, vvere bestovved vpon the seruice and continual vvorship of God: and that vve coulde commit our vvhole vvill and dealings vnto the vvill and pleasure of God, both for that our ovvne thoughtes doe little preuayle about them, &amp; also for that the general felicity of man doth depend only vpon the obedience vnto Gods vvill and prouidence.</p>
   <p>It vvere also to be vvished that vve vvere not carefull for the chaunces to come, but that vve could submitte our selues vvithout staye to Gods deuine vvill and ordinaunce.</p>
   <p>But (alas) suche and so greeuous vvas the fall of our first father in Paradice, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the fragilitie of our state, and the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of our life, vvhich of all thinges is most vncertaine, <hi>(Nam homo quasi bulla)</hi> there is also by the same his fall infused into oure fleshly hearts, a friuolous care, and as it vvere
<pb facs="3"/>
acurious meditation of temporal and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible thinges: VVhich care as it is vnto the godly a very decrease of zeale, and hinderance to perfection, I meane to perfection vvrought by Gods spirite: so vndoubtedly the same vnto the reprobate, is an vtter extinguishment of pietie and vertue: For no man of vvhat estate soeuer he be, of himselfe hath anye habilitie at all, eyther to contemplate the goodnesse of God or to stande in avve of the terrour of iustice. No vve are not able I say to tast the benefyts of christ his death &amp; passion, except vve haue by the (instinct of grace) mortifyed vvithin vs the corrupt motions and naturall cares of the flesh: vvhich altogither vvitholde vs from the true contemplation of diuine and spirituall things, according as it is vvritten: <hi>Animalis homo non percipit ea quae sunt Dei:</hi> The fleshlye manne hath no feeling of those things vvhich belong vnto God.</p>
   <p>And although there be a certaine care com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs in the holye Scripturs, as the care vvhich Jzaacke had for the barrennesse of his vvife: the care vvhich Jacob had for the losse of Ioseph his sonne: the care vvhich the poore vviddovve of <hi>Sarepta</hi> hadde, fyrst for hir ovvne pouertie, and then for the death of hir onlye sonne: the care also
<pb facs="3"/>
vvhich the Gospel declareth to be in <hi>Martha:</hi> vnto vvhome our sauiour Christ sayde, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, Martha, thou carest and art troubled about many things</hi>: Although (I say) suche kinde of care is set foorth vnto vs in the booke of our saluation: Yet deere friende vvee must not thinke but that there is another, and that a principall kinde of care, vvhich only and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone by the vvorde of God, to all suche as are regenerate, is commaunded and commended: euen a zealous and a feruent care to the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Gods house: besides the vvhich care, al other cares (in vvhat respect so euer they be) are but corrupt and vaine: Yea, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but dregges of the fyrst fylth and corruption that fell vnto man by the sinne of Adam, and of vvhich our sauiour Christ in the Gospell forbiddeth vs, euen so many of vs as by him desire to be righteous, saying: <hi>Take no thought for your lyfe, vvhat you shall eate, neyther for your bodye vvhat you shall put on: The lyfe is more than meate, and the bodye is more than the rayment. Consider that the Rauens neyther sovve nor reape.</hi> And againe: <hi>vvhich of you by taking thought, can adde one cubit to his stature?</hi> And againe in the same Chapter <hi>Therefore, aske not what you shall eate,
<pb facs="4"/>
nor vvhat you shall drinke, neyther lette your mindes vvander about these specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For after all such things, the heathen people of the world seeke: and your father knovveth that you haue neede of these thinges.</hi> The Apostle also willeth vs to bee carefull for nothing but in all prayer and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to make our petitions manifest vnto God with giuing of thankes: To conclude, euen of this care our sauiour Christ in saint Iohns Gospel saith: <hi>Are there not tvvelue houres in the day? If a man walcke in the daye, he stumbleth not, but if hee vvalke in the night, he stumbleth bicause there is no light in him.</hi> Truelye, this care I saye is nothing else but dregges of infydelitie, and the verye frailtye of olde rebellious Adam, vvhich except it be mortified vvithin vs, vvill vndoubtedlye dryue vs from the true feele of saluation.</p>
   <p>Contrarivvise of the true christian care, which as it is sayd is the perfytte badge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation: the kinglye Prophet Dauid spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the Psame vvhen he sayth: <hi>The zeale of Gods house hath deuoured me:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>I had rather be a doore keper in the house of God</hi> This care vvas vvonderfully to be seene in <hi>Moyses</hi> the princelike Propht of Gods people, vvhen he desired rather to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb facs="4"/>
out of the booke of lyfe, than that God should forsake his people the Israelites: Yea, this care doth Christ himselfe commende vnto his seruaunts in this maner: <hi>Sell that you haue, and giue almes, and make you bags that vvaxe not olde, and treasure that can neuer fayle:</hi> and againe in the same chapter, <hi>Let your loynes be gyrt about you, and your lightes burning:</hi> and againe: <hi>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, for they shall be fylled.</hi> To bee short euen this and none other is that same care of the vvhich the Lord sayde to <hi>Martha: Thou carest for manye thinges: but one thing is needefull.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>VVherefore (beloued in the Lorde) seeing that this is the verye true care that vve ought to haue: and contrarivvise, the other care but a fleshly care, a vaine care, yea a care procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of infydelitie, and altogither a lette and stop vnto such as desire truly to be illumined: Alas vvhat and hovve muche haue vve to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in this our vvretched time, so small remaine of that same christiā care, so streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye prescribed and left vnto vs in the sacred Scriptures appeareth amongst vs: euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs that vsurpinglye take vpon vs the name of true christians? that neyther care of
<pb facs="5"/>
Pastors tovvardes their flocke: of maiestrates tovvardes the people, nor of parents tovvards their childrē is almost any vvhere to be found? And that (contrarivvise) all men are careful for themselues, all thirsting after their ovvne priuate commodities, and no man almost ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for gods glorie, no man seeking after the righteousnesse thereof.</p>
   <p>To conclude, hovve much and hovv greatlie this christian care is at this day in all men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie, and in these three estates especially contemned, hovv much it is set at naught and neglected, vvhereas notvvithstanding, it is the very erecting and repayring of Gods house and the propagation of his glorie: I haue in this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle booke briefely declared: being desirous in the onely respect of loue and good vvill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the dedication thereof vnto you: in vvhome I doe knovve (as by perfyt experience) to bee dvvelling a most godlie care vnto pietie and truth: and contrariwise an vtter hatred to falsehoode, and else whatsoeuer is shadowing of truth. Accept it J praye you, and be no lesse pleased with my hartie affection, than J my selfe am displeased with the basenesse of the gift, which notwithstanding, may suffice to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the aboundaunce of my loue.</p>
