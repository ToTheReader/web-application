   <head>To my Christian countrymen, faith
in God, loue to her Maiestie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
in Religion, watchfulnesse &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie,
bee for euer more and

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Aint <hi>Ierome</hi> beeing in <hi>Bethleem,</hi> at the
time when the <hi>Turkes</hi> inuaded and most
cruelly wasted <hi>Asia</hi> the lesse, <hi>Arabia, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
and part of <hi>Syria,</hi> declared that the
sins of the Christians there, were the cause of
all that miserie, and of the feare which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
their hearts, &amp; gaue courage &amp; victorie to the enemie.
And that there was no assurance of the mittigation of that
fierce furie of the one, or restitution of comfort to the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there were in the Christians humiliation, and a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
vnto vertue and righteousnes. Which ancient counsel
of that famous father may be renewed now amongest vs, when
the professed enemie of the true Catholique religion hath stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp an apparant indignation in the pretended King Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique,
against <hi>England,</hi> and many other partes where the
Gospell is sincerely preached, and that surely for the sinnes of
Christians, in the iudgement of God, who looking vppon the
greene leaued figge tree of our profession, desiring to tast of the
fruit which it should beare, findeth it not answerable to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.
And therfore, vnlesse we will returne from our hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
and bring forth with our leaues good fruit, it is to bee
doubted, that our God powerfull and iust, will permit this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
aduersarie to rouze vs out of our secure thoughts, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
winne vs to more sinceritie, or giue vs into the handes of
our aduersarie. And to the end we may all find out our selues
to bee faultie, that seeme now to bee shrouded with securitie, it
<pb facs="4"/>
is fit that we should examine euery one himselfe, and amend
what the word of the liuing God willeth to be amended in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
particular person: so, howsoeuer the causes of this Spanish
<hi>Hoobub</hi> may appeare to be in the man of sinne, in malice, &amp;
in his chiefe agent the pretended king Catholik, in ambition,
we shall preuent thē both of their vaine purposes, being strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shrouded with hope of the performance of the promises of
our God, who will vppon our reconciliation become againe on
our side, howsoeuer yet our sins may deserue to haue the shield
of his protection taken from vs, and to drawe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
to inuade vs. And therefore it is now required, and that
with speed, that we should denie our selues, &amp; acknowledg him,
forsake our selues, and cleaue vnto him, disclaime the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of our owne strength, and depend wholy vppon his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

      </gap>anquishable
power, who shall be to vs all in all, and who shall
strengthen vs, &amp; weaken them: fight for vs, &amp; against them:
And to this end haue I (though most vnworthie) sent vnto
you this simple <hi>Eccho,</hi> to that subtill <hi>Hoobub,</hi> not that it
should sound to mine owne vainglorie, but to incourage vs all
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>o shape a new course in our liues, and such prouidence in our
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>roceedings, that we all may answere our duties to God, loialty
to Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and loue to our countrie. And so may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
man rest truly resolute in a good conscience, to withstand
the practises of this roring beast of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the power of
his professed adherents, the enemies of God and vs,
with an assured hope neuer to bee
ouercome.</p>
