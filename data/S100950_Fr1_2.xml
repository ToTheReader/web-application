      </gap> with much feare and trembling: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as it is well knowne, from the time of this purpose for the Crosse, but three dayes in all, till the Saboth for the Sermon, I was not one day from the Court, still labouring to informe my selfe of euery thing which I doubted, that I might in these calumnious times, keep my selfe, for any thing I would there deliuer; from the
<pb facs="4"/>
controlment either of ill tongues, or mine owne conscience: to which purpose I both framed a short preface personall, before I entered the discourse, which might essuier and rubbe out all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion fore stalled; and abstay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from all bitternesse agaynst the person and action of the late Earle, least thereby I should exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate mindes not resolued; and compared euery speach of his, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by me, both with his confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Lords, whose witnesse therein I humbly request, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereunto; and with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference he had with vs, let my as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates be iudges, which might satisfie any but euen indifferently affected. Notwithstanding all this my care and paines, the malignitie of the meany is such, that, as if I
<pb facs="4"/>
had either with <hi>Ananias</hi> lied vnto the holy Ghost, and had preached mine owne damnation, as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some to blaspheme, it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out that I was stroken, if not with madnesse, yet with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sicknesse; or, as if I had spoken treason, that I was, the next day, committed close prisoner to the Tower; or at least, I had highly offended her maiestie, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a great check from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.

aboue my desertes. Other, with more virulence, though with lesse violence for penall charge, frame matter of hard iudgement out of the discourse it selfe; first generall, that I haue broken the Canon both of religion and law, in reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a penitents confession, which was with remorse, and priuate. The cases wherein a Confessor may publish what he heares, are too many for this short preface, the learned and iudicious knowe them, to the peeueshly affected, it is but lost labour to name them. First, his confession was not auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but in the audience of three or foure. Secondly the crimes he confessed were notorious by his conuiction, and vnder his hand by subscription. Thirdly they were repeated and diuulged not
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>ad scandalum, nec animo damnifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> as the scholemen speake, to scandalize or annoy him, but to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them who desired resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to glorifie God whose spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite had wrought this conuersion; and, as <hi>Doctor Montford</hi> knowes, it was promised by me, in both our names, that we would, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on serued, giue publike and open testimonie of that his penitence and detestation of his offence. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in particular, because in one parte of my preface I said, <hi>I was not a penny the richer, nor a steppe the higher for him, albeit I celebrated his glory at the crosse, for Caliz vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>: therefore hence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that I now spake of the spleane, and preach for rewardes. Malice marres logike and charitie both: this inference hath no cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb facs="6"/>
with my wordes, if eyther the precedentes were obserued, which I made in answere to a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous obloquy, <hi>That I was a time seruer</hi>; or the consequents, <hi>That I neuer moued him to preferre me, nor yet left to loue him, and honour him one iot the lesse for it.</hi> But this makes that speach of <hi>Seneca</hi> true, <hi>Nec dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt qui te,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Senec. de benef.</note>
      <hi>etiam per ornamenta, feri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> there are some so full of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour who will turne a mans glory into his shame, &amp; reproue him for things he should be commended: did I at that time labour for the place? yea rather as <hi>M. Doctor Stanhop</hi> knowes, I vsed all the meanes I could to auoide it, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging both the shortnesse of the time, but three dayes full; my late beeing in that place, scarce two monethes before: my youth and
<pb facs="6"/>
vnexperience in those state mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and such other delayes, till as he knoweth, it was inioyned by a commaundement peremptory: did I, after it, presse the court, soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Earle, affect any aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by him? God knowes that I lye not, he neuer saw me, till, halfe yeere after his returne from <hi>Caliz,</hi> he sent for me, about a matter of difference, in some pointes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Wright.</hi>
      </note> betweene a Popish priest &amp; my selfe, to take knowledge of me: at which time he promised me honourably, and, I thinke, if I had vsed his meanes, his promise had beene payment. Now then my argument holdes thus, if I neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to obserue so great a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, so fauoured, so able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre me, so willing by promise to do it, I was no <hi>time seruer nor prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
<pb facs="7"/>
for rewardes,</hi> And thus agayne it may be enforced, if I was belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; by the auditory applauded for my celebration of that victory, the circumstances and substance whereof I could deliuer but onely vpon report and intelligence: much more in this case am I to be credited and approued, hauing so certaine grounds for my relation. But from what spirit these obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proceede, may soone be ges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedat; which, a disposition, eyther at the crosse or in this epistle, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly eloquent, knowing what I know, would liuely describe to be that of <hi>Babell</hi> in the prophet, <hi>stand apart come not neare me, for I am ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier then thou</hi>:<note place="margin">Esa. 65.5.</note> but as in my sermon, so here I renounce all tart &amp; soure speach: but it makes me remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that excellent sentence of

      </gap>, that the vulgar sorte will growe reproachfully madde agaynst him, who pleaseth not them in their madnesse.</p>
   <p>I little expected, yea not suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the Lord knoweth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny can witnesse, that I should be sent vnto him, but beeing sent, and hearing his confession so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

      </gap>t and voluntary, and withall knowing the ouer-harried passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of some murmurers, it was my dutie in conscience to reueale it and satisfie all, as my selfe was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied; whose affection, that setled perswasion I had of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiaunce, through that his great semblance of religion, had I not hard &amp; scene what I did, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ouerswayed frō inclination to any contrarie suspition of him.
<pb facs="8"/>
An other obiection is, that I, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising to speake nothing vpon reporte,</hi> vrged that conference betweene the Deane of <hi>Norwich</hi> and him: first, the rule in law is, <hi>condentis est interpretari,</hi> a man is fittest to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound himselfe. By that word <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> I ment <hi>nothing</hi> concerning this crime of his, and his confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: secondly, I reade it out of the paper, making it knowne it was but a reporte: thirdly, I vrged no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, but that which agreed with like wordes which he had spoken in my hearing, els where. The other base and grosse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes, that <hi>I rayled vpon the Earle</hi>; &amp; of my selfe, accused mine owne naturall countrimen the citizens, <hi>to be a base people,</hi> as some haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out, I referre for their answere vnto the tenor of my sermon,
<pb facs="8"/>
which here I haue printed, and presented vnto thee, Reader, as neare as I could gesse, and as some of good place which hard it, and since that read it, thinke, euery worde as I spake it; vpon my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite nothing but one is altered to my knowledge, <hi>that concerned him,</hi> which then I vttered, onely one or two things added which then I forgot. If thou haue in thee the affection of a christian, &amp; a good subiect, read and be satisfied, it is that which was intended, and I indeauoured: but if thou haue <hi>Magus</hi> his disease,<note place="margin">Acts. 8.</note> the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse <hi>excrea,</hi> disgorge thy spite, know that I esteeme not thy slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor regarde thy reproaches, and dissemble it neuer so cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I am not the principall thou aymest at, but according to the
<pb facs="9"/>
prouerbe <hi>Faber cadit cum ferias ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonem,</hi> it is the state thou greeuest at, not my sermon. And least I seeme to speake this at random, let that be obserued which is giuen out for a truth, &amp; my denial there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wil scarce be credited: how the late Earle at the time of his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion song eyther the 54. or the 94 Psalme, for vpon the number they cannot agree, there being no such thing mentioned at all: marke the tenor of those Psalmes and then iudge of the reporters spirites, and what they intend I conclude with <hi>Samuell</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul:</hi>
