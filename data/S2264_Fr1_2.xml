   <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vertuous, his singular good Lady, the Lady <hi>Pallauicino. Theophilus Feild,</hi> her deuote seruant, dedicateth these mourning weedes.</head>
   <lg>
      <l>RIght vertuous, and fayre Lady, may it please</l>
      <l>Your faire, now slubbred eyes, with weeping long,</l>
      <l>To take a truce with teares, that whilst you cease</l>
      <l>To mourne, with which you do your beauty wrong,</l>
      <l>There may be time for me, for to expresse</l>
      <l>My losse, which by your losse is comfortlesse,</l>
      <l>Some comfort may from hence to you arise,</l>
      <l>(If it be comfort not to weepe alone)</l>
      <l>Oh giue me leaue to speake, that which mine eyes</l>
      <l>Haue writ in teares, with which my heart doth grone</l>
      <l>To be deliuered. Loe this child of griefe</l>
      <l>Seekes vnto you as Nurse for some reliefe:</l>
      <l>Be a dry Nurse to it, let it not draw</l>
      <l>From nipples of your eyes one pretious teare,</l>
      <l>You need not giue it suck, for it can chaw,</l>
      <l>And what it chawes, his stomacke well will beare:</l>
      <l>Vphold it not with helping it to mone,</l>
      <l>'Tis big enough, and now can goe alone.</l>
      <l>This Infant new borne of my moyster braine,</l>
      <l>I cloath'd in black, exposing it to view</l>
      <l>Of many witnesses, some of their traine</l>
      <l>Not well train'd vp, but of the ruder crew</l>
      <l>
         <pb facs="3"/>Disroab'd it, robd me, without priuiledge</l>
      <l>To touch a holy thing is sacriledge.</l>
      <l>No lesse was this, nay more (o foule disgrace)</l>
      <l>They did not onely touch, but tooke away</l>
      <l>A holy Poeme from a holy place</l>
      <l>Vpon a birth, and on a buriall day</l>
      <l>A mourning, weeping birth day to my vearse,</l>
      <l>A day of buriall to <hi>Horatios</hi> hearse.</l>
      <l>Hence you prophane, what had you there to doo?</l>
      <l>Lady my babe was on your alter plac'd,</l>
      <l>Sacred, deuote, and consecrate to you</l>
      <l>By your eyes gracious aspect to be grac'd,</l>
      <l>They were Church robbers who did dare to spoyle</l>
      <l>The holy labors of an others toyle:</l>
      <l>After long search and much enquiry made,</l>
      <l>The lost child by his mother found againe,</l>
      <l>Who trauailing a new on childbed laide,</l>
      <l>Seekes vnto you as Nurse to ease her paine,</l>
      <l>After your cloudes of griefe be ouer blowne,</l>
      <l>Desires you to adopt him for your owne:</l>
      <l>His father would be yours, (for yours he was)</l>
      <l>Whilst he belongd to your deceased mate</l>
      <l>No patron of his poems now he has,</l>
      <l>And therefore doth them to you dedicate:</l>
      <l>Loue them for his sake, from whose sorrowed death</l>
      <l>Halfe dead for sorrow, they haue borrowed breath.</l>
