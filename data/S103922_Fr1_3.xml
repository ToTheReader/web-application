   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not without great cause pronounced by the wise man,<note place="margin">Eccles. 9.1.</note>
      <hi>that no man knoweth either loue or hatred,</hi> which Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> doth expound to be ment of naturall man, that man by nature doth not know whether he be in the loue or in the hatred of god, but the spiritual mā doth dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerne all things. But saint <hi>Hierom</hi> doth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter interpret it to bee spoken of things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne, which wordes, are vsed by <hi>Solomon</hi> fiue seuerall tymes in the selfe same chapter. By things then vnder the Sunne, that is by the outward accidents of this life, no man can discerne either loue or hatred, because sorrowes, sicknesses, losses and calamities, do befal to the godly as wel as to the wicked, but the triall of our selues
<pb facs="4"/>
doth consist in inward graces, to wit, with what faith in God, and what loue toward God we indure the said afflictions, what good vses we make of them to our selues, and how in the middest of them all we do possesse our soules with patience. Sondry fearefull punishmentes by lightnings haue bin inflicted in many corners of this land, in this cleare light of the preaching of the gospell, partly vpon <hi>Paules</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and partly on other places of this realme. And the like or farre greater haue bin shewed, heretofore in the time of Popery and blind<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse. The french Chronacles do testifie that in the year of our Lord 1534. (at which time <hi>France</hi> was ouerwhelmed with idolatry &amp; superstition) the citie of <hi>Claraualla</hi> being stricken with lightning about noone dayes did so fiercelie burne, that in three howers space their town castles and churches were vtterly consumed. VVe must needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge that our sinnes do deserue a farre dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per punishment then did the offences of our forefathers. They were as seruants sent
<pb facs="4"/>
out in the night time, and therefore if they missed their way, their faults cannot be so heauy as ours who are as seruants sent out of the cleere day light: where God giueth one talent, he expecteth the increase of one, but where he giueth ten talents; he doth iust<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly demand the increase of ten. VVhat vses we are to make of these iudgements of God vnder the Sunne, I haue briefely according to the shortnesse of time set downe in this smal treatise, which here now I do commit to thy view, &amp; both thee and it to the good blessing of the Almighty. From <hi>Bansted</hi> this twentieth of <hi>Nouember An. Dom.</hi> 1606.</p>
