      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian. This Discourse which now stands so close together, was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in fiue seuerall sermons, but all to a most iudicious and intelligent au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie; therfore there is a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of matter, coherence, and stile. I must entreat thee, out of thine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous discretion, to distinguish the places where they were preacht, as thou shalt find the direction of my speech, and some particular applications more naturally and necessarilie with indiuiduall reference appropriated thereunto. The reasons why I spent the most of my meditations, and sticke so long in descrying and desci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phering the state of formall hypocrisie (for therein I haue trod a something vncouth and vnusuall path) are these:</p>
   <p>First, I considered that in this full light of the Gospell, a great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> number of men appl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap>d and content themselues with a superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all glistering of a formall profession, outward conformitie to the Ministrie of the word, and some false flashes of an vnsound per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion that they are in the ready and right way to heauen; when as indeed it hath not inwardly illightned their vnderstandings with sauing knowledge, heated their affections with true zeale, subdued their sinfull thoughts, and noisome lusts with the power of grace, nor softned and sanctifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d their hearts to yeeld a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, sincere, and vniuersall obedience thereunto: And so after a few miserable daies spent in a prosperous securitie, they fall into the iawes of hell before they mistrust any such matter; and the pit of destruction shuts her mouth vpon them, before they
<pb facs="10"/>
know and acknowledge, their broken and bankrout state in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things; I therefore desire and endeauour to awake them out of their golden dreame of imaginarie future happines; that with open eyes they may see their present spirituall pouerty, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preuent <hi>the anger to come.</hi> I hope in the Lord, and wish hartily, that by a dispassionate and thorow perusall of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, they may take some scantling of their owne estate with God; and entring a serious and impartiall search and examination of their consciences, discouer and reueale themselues vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; and so if they belong vnto the euerlasting couenant of grace, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ep forward into the state of grace, the paradise of true Christianitie, and practise of holinesse; that their deare and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious soules may be saued in the day of the Lord Ies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>s.</p>
   <p>
      <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, I did conceiue that there is a threefold cord, three maine and capitall causes, that violently hale downe vpon vs from heauen many both corporall and spirituall plagues, and bind them fast to the bowels, and principall parts of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and doe daily more and more ripen the iust wrath of God, for the powring out of his last vengeance vpon this sinfull nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They are those: 1. The ouerflowing torrent and vnbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dledrage of many crying sinnes, fearefull abominations, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate prophanenes. 2. A sensible declination from their first loue, and decay of zeale, euen in Christians. 3. A luke-warme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and want of thorownes and sinceritie in formall professors.</p>
   <p>As for the first: By our horrible sins and hatefull ingratitude for mercies without measure, and miraculous deliuerances, wee grow so heauie vpon the Lord, that we presse him, and the bowels of his tenderest compassions. <hi>as a ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>t is pressed that is full of sheaues</hi>; so that it is impossible, but that shortly, without great humiliation and generall rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ntance, wee should wrest out of his hands the vials of his last wrath, and force him to come against vs with the beesome of vtter desolation. It is to bee feared (so grieuous and endlesse is the impietie and imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nitencie of this land) that his forbearance in the meane time, is not for any hope he hath of vs (for what good hath a durable and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie plague done vpon vs?) but onely by reason of the cruell and implacable insolencie of our enemies; because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ee is loth to
<pb facs="10"/>
make vs a prey to the Wolues of Rome, and matter of triumph to such a mercilesse and murderous generation. Who knowes but that the <hi>Match</hi> had reached vnto the <hi>Powder,</hi> had not the Lord out of the bottomlesse depth of his vnlimited mercies laid hold vpon his owne argument, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.26.27. <hi>I haue said, I would scatter them abrode, I would make their remembrance to cease from amongst men, saue that I feared the furie of the enemy, lest their aduersaries should waxe proud.</hi> Left his and our aduersaries, those breathing diuels the Gunpowder Papists, should too proudly and barbarously haue insulted in the ruines of his people, and the banishment of his glorious Gospell. The Lord giue vs vnderstanding hearts to consider these things in time, lest he come vpon vs with his wrath, neuer more to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, and teare vs in pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ces when there is none to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>lpe. <hi>May any man driue away an hungry Lion in the wood? or quench the fire in stubble, when it hath once begun to burne? may one turne againe the arrow that is shot of a strong archer?</hi> If the Lord once whet his glittering sword, and his hand take hold on iudgement, with purpose to roote out a sinfull and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious nation; there is no power or policie, no multitude of men, or magnificence of State, no armour of the mightie, or arme of flesh, shall euer bee able to giue any succour, reliefe, or deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
   <p>Concerning the second: Certaine it is, that our blessings of peace, and strength of State, breed by accident much abatement of forwardnesse, and zeale in godlines, secret indeuotion, and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes euen in many true Professours, carelesnes in obseruing their waies, wearinesse and vncheerefulnesse in doing good, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming holy duties, vnpreparednesse in comming to diuine seruices, religious exercises, and the Lords Table, sleightnesse and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitablenesse in prayer, meditation, Christian conference, and dailie examination of their consciences, neglect of opportunitie in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their brethren vnto the feare of God, and of working vpon, and preuailing with their kindred, acquaintance, familiars and families. Thus wickedly and vnthankefully turne we the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God into occasions of sinne, and suffer our temporall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to wast and consume our spirituall blessings. And the more
<pb facs="11"/>
we are secured in our outward state, the more heartlesse we are in the seruice of God, and the affaires of the life to come. But let vs looke vnto it: for as the louder and crying sinnes of this land are the great and strong cartropes; so vndoubtedly, these as lesser cords haue their part and some power in drawing vpon vs heauie iudgements, and in preparing further vengeance, except wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, and returne to our <hi>first loue.</hi> Would to God that we would keepe fresh in our minds but this one consideration: That the same God, which against the expectation both of heauen and earth, of Rome and hell, of diuels and Papists, turned our feares and amazements at the death of that glorious Saint, the late Queene, into safetie, and a sure foundation, by the most happie suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of our gracious Soueraigne, and his roiall seed; can out of his iust iudgements for our vnthankefulnesse and securitie, in the very turning of an hand and closing of an eie, dash all our hopes, and shut vp the whole Body of this flourishing kingdom in the pit of irrecouerable destruction. It had bin done, had <hi>Fauks</hi> fired the powder: and who knowes what those busie and bloody heads are euen now hammering in the same kind? Besides these two now mentioned, there is another capitall cause of Gods heauie displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; which though i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> make no great noise, nor be much taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of vpon earth, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>t is much lothed of God almighty, and cries loud in heauen for vengeance vpon vs: It is a Lukewarmenesse, and vnzealousnesse, a cold and carelesse mediocritie in spirituall matters, and as it were, a neutralitie betwixt notorious sinfulnes and sauing sinceritie. When men perhaps with diligence, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and forwardnesse submit themselues to the hearing of the word; but subordinate the power and practise thereof to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ase, honours and worldly contentments: When they wil needs hold an outward correspondence with the world, and yet inwardly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and nourish hope of saluation in themselues: When they straine their wits, and striue to partake both of the comfortable fauour of God, and corrupt fashions of the times; both of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of their sweet sinne, and the sweetnesse of the true peace of conscience, which are as inconcurrent as two parallel lines, and as incompatible as light and darkenesse. These men, though in the worlds opinion, they be of ciuill honest cariage, of moderate spirits,
<pb facs="11"/>
and of a stated temper in religion; and in their owne conceits, <hi>rich and enriched, and want nothing,</hi> yet indeed they are meere staruelings, and starke beggers in respect of the true riches, and lasting treasures of sauing grace, and in the very case of those (except in the meane time they buy of him <hi>gold, garments and oile</hi>) which shall neuer see Christ Iesus in his Kingdome to their comfort: for <hi>Amen, the faithfull and true witnesse</hi> hath vowed it, that he will spue such out of his mouth; and wishes much rather that they were key-cold, then such formall Christians: His speech imports thus much: I had rather you were Pagans and Infidels, then professors without zeale. Now my chiefe and speciall aime is, with all humble submission to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ter iudgements, and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Prophets, to lay open the state of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se men, because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their fearefull deceiuing their owne soules, and particular certaine damnation if they so continue, they mightily ince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>se the Lords wrath against this la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>d, with an insensible and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledgde prouocation, and mainly hazard the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his glorious Gospell amongst vs. It is commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued indeed, both of themselues, and of the world; that if they bee morally honest, and outwardly conformable to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of the word; so that they bee hurtlesse, and innocent in respect of humane iustice; that they are also, I know not how, harmelesse and guiltlesse before the Tribunall of God. But the Euangelist telles vs,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15.</note>
      <hi>That that which is highlie estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among men, is abomination in the sight of God</hi>: And God himselfe by <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Isai.</hi> 55.8.</note>
      <hi>That his thoughts are not our thoughts, neither are his waies our waies.</hi> For certainely the state of Lukewarmnesse, and formaliti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> in religion, howsoeuer it may be full of worldly applause and happinesse, and beare away the bell vpon earth; yet it is as burdensome and hatefull vnto God, as luke-warme water, or the most lothsome potion to the nicest stomacke: And doth with a more naturall importunitie then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinnes, knock at the gates of diuine iustice, for the remooueall of our candlesticke, and the glory of his Gospell from amongst vs. All kinds of sinnes according to their nature, measure and ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse haue proportionally a part and hand in drawing downe all manner of plagues vpon the sonnes of men: but this hath a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb facs="12"/>
and predominant power, in hastening that particular and greatest of all iudgements, the famine of the word. For God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure without speciall indignation, that his word, which is his power vnto saluation▪ should rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>iue such limitation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription from mens wisdome; that it should worke no further vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, nor beget more change and holinesse, then may consist with the enioyment of their worldly contentments, reputation, and the pleasures of their beloued sinne. He cannot abide, that men discontented with the stra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>tnesse of the gate of grace, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of a strict course of godlinesse, should labor to find out, and follow another way to heauen, then that which is sanctified by his word, and which hath and must be troden by all those that will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer see the Lord. Knowledge and profession of Gods truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sanctification and zeale, are but meanes in the meane time, to put out the glory of Israel, and will hereafter but encrease the number of stripes, and adde waight vnto endlesse torment. In the name of God therefore let all luke-warme and formall Christians be contented to take notice of their state; and before the Sun goe down<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> ouer the Prophets, suffer their hearts to be thorowly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with true zeale; and besides their outward reformation, and generall lightnings of the Spirit, to entertaine that speciall sauing and sanctifying grace, which onely can saue their soules, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for the glory that is to be reuealed: Lest now at length (for he hath borne with vs miraculously) our iust God cause our <hi>Sunne to goe downe at noone,</hi> and <hi>darkenesse</hi> to surprize <hi>vs in the cleare day:</hi> L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>st he roote vs out of this good land, as a fruitlesse and faithles nation, turne vs out of our houses of peace, as the vnworthiest, and vnthankefullest people vnder heauen; <hi>and let out his vineyard to other husbandmen, which will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him the fruites in their seasons.</hi> And the more secure and fearelesse wee bee (as wee were neuer more) the more sudden and ineuitable is like to bee our surprizall and destruction. For as Gods mercies are then most magnified, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the extremest miserie, and shine into the depth of discomfort and darkenesse, when all other helpe is vtterly despaired of: so his iudgements are most glorious, when they strike at the height and top of pride and impenitencie, while they thinke themselues most
<pb facs="12"/>
sure, and with greatest confidence repose vpon the arme of flesh, and policie of man.</p>
   <p>The third reason and motiue why I insist so long in the point of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> formal hypocrisie, was taken from the condition of mine auditors; who being of deepest vnderstanding, are naturally aptest and strōgliest tempted, to mistake &amp; vnderualue the mystery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and to deceiue their owne soules in the high point of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For men of greatest noblenes and pregnancie of spirit, of most rich and vniuersall endowments of mind, without the power of grace and a sanctified humilitie (the fairest branch springing thence, and the true crowne of Christianity) are readiest to make an idoll of their great sufficiencie, with a disdainefull preiudice to passe by the simplicitie of the Saints, &amp; out of a flattering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their owne hearts, to thinke their spirituall state as good as the best, and most blessed from God, when as yet they haue no part in the <hi>first resurrection.</hi> For when they find themselues far aboue others in all other excellencies, and whatsoeuer remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able worth the world takes speciall notice of; they conceiue also that in a proportionable congruitie, (as indeed it should be) they are inferiour to none, in those sacred apprehensions of heauen, and taste of eternall life. Vpon this consideration, I was bold▪ out of a Christian iealousie, to treate on this argument, being persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of their great wisedome and gratious humility to listen to any heauenly message, which might either discouer or preuent spirituall danger.</p>
