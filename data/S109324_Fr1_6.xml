   <head>Thomas Gale maister in Chirurgerie,
unto his welbeloued friende Iohn Halle, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
greting.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or as muche as translation is the mother of
patefaction, and a vertue moste commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of al mē, because it vncouereth ignorāce,
and illustrateth the knowledge of many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
matters vnto the vulgar people: I thought it most
mete and expediēt therfore, with some consolation to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
you welbeloued frend Halle, which peraduēture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
somwhat astonied and afrayde of the cōmon peoples
iudgement, would detract that laudable and moste wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
enterprise, which you haue finished: neither would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
vnto your vocatiō and office publishe your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
conteining in it most profitable frutes, by y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> whiche
the publique welth might be releued, and also your assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
office discharged. I am certeinly assured that you wil
obiect vnto me, how that you shall suffer the reprehensiō
of many, in alleging vnto you, that you are worthy rather
of contumelie and reproche then fame and renowme, for
your exercise and labor: Because that euery lādleper &amp;
vagabonde therby shalbe made an artist. I put the case
that many should inueye these allegations against you,
wil you therfore be discouraged, neither wold you fearing
their rude iudgement, proffit your natiue countrey? Let
me neuer see such causes I beseche you (being of no force)
moue you to faint: for if they alledge any suche thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you (as you suppose) it will at the length (as when
<pb facs="11"/>
it commeth to the eares of the wise) redounde vnto their
owne reproche. They can not for mere shame and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie
saie, that you in the publishing of your booke, will
make euery priuate person an artiste: specially when as
herein thei incurre mendacitie and falsifiyng the truthe,
then the whiche vice nothing can be more detestable and
worthy of ignominie. For the most part of men doe know,
(specially those whiche are wise and discrete) that you
haue not taken vpon you this translation into the vulgar
tongue to the ende euery man therby might be made an
artiste: (whiche thing could not be brought to passe, if
that you ment the desolation of the arte:) but that you do
it only for this ende and purpose, that the tyrons and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
studentes of the noble art, might haue some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to lede them, as it weare by a light, vnto more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Therfore if you mynde the profit of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
lette not suche allegations dismay your enterprise,
but publishe it with spede: For the soner it appeareth,
the soner our brethren whiche are but yet contending to
obtein y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> knowlege of chirurgerie our noble art, shal haue
therof profit &amp; vtilitie. And though one of those ignorāt
Idiotes whiche seke not to profit their countrey, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
suche cauilations as are before mentioned, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
both it and you also, yet will a hundred other for
one of those, both contemne them in their bestiall despite,
and commende you in your good indeuoures, whiche ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
I doubt not to nothing els but the profit of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="11"/>
wealth. Furthermore in publishing of your boke, you
shall purchase the fauor and beneuolence of many men,
and specially of suche as trauell in the knowledge of our
arte: also you shalbe counted herein not only a profitable
member of the publique welth, but also a diligēt imitator
of your predicessors whiche did translate out of other tō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
our famous art into their owne proper languages
that to diligent studentes y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> art might be made manifest.
Of this sort of men many I could resite, but for breuitie I
will name but one or two: as for example, Galen that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
artist translated our art out of many tongues, as
the Scithian, Persian, Aegiptian and other more, into his
own natiue tongue only, to thende that the studēts might
the more easily gette y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> profit of the same. Auicē also that
excellent Arabian prince, hauing a like regarde vnto his
countrey, collected both out of Hippocrates and Galens
workes, the effecte of our art, and translated it into his
mother tongue, that the knowledge of it might remaine
vnto his posteritie. And doubte you not as these men for
their great paines taken of loue to their countrey, in the
furtherance of this our art, haue had and euer shal haue
memoriall renowme, but that you intending none other
shal obteine the same. Aspire therfore and take breth
vnto you, let no vayne and friuolus opinion ouercomme
you, for I see no cause wherfore you shoulde ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>ruciate
your selfe. Euery wyse man wyll accepte your inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
excepte those whiche neyther mynde theyr office,
<pb facs="12"/>
neither the vtilitie of y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> publique wealth: euery good mā
will embrase and with great gladnes reuolue ouer your
boke as sone as it is published, and wil at the first sight
of your good trauell haue you in more estimacion then
euer they had. And why? because you set forth the most
famous and excellent arte of medicine: then the whiche
(as I suppose) there can be none more profitable, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
vnto all men, as well emperours &amp; kinges, as other
menne of lower estats: For thoughe other artes dooe
profit and are moste fit for a common welth? yet for all
that the profit of this all men doe knowe to be more vbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.
For without it pleasures were but painful, riches vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
company annoyance, strengthe febelnes, bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
lothsumnes, senses dispersed, and finally all thinges in
the worlde weare vnpleasant. wherfore lest tediousnes
may take place in this my writing vnto you. I will here
sease to trouble you any further: loking shortly for the
publishing of your workes. Fare you well,</p>
