it commeth so to passe, that eche man either is,
or maye be thought parciall in his owne affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
and that it is a fault very easily commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#tech" extent="1 word">
         <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
      </gap> weene of our selues: to the ende, I
may auoyde the one, and discharge me of the
other as a thing without cause: I wil therfore,
neither seeme to aduise thee, nor determine to
intreate thee, to deeme any better of this my labour, than thy affection
will suffer to giue thee leaue: but as one well perswaded of thine indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie,
will freely allowe thee the libertie of thy consciēce, to like or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke
therof at thy pleasure. For diuers and variable are the hādy workes
of nature, and seuerall the opinions, that are seuerally nourished, in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
deuided: In one shee planteth suche a spirite of temperaunce, that
no indifferent dealing may moue him to offence: in another she frameth
such contrary motions, that eche thing mislikes hym that falles not in
his humor: thus, how one speciall matter may be equally piled to the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of all men, I can gather no reason. Let eche man therfore beare the
burthen of his fortune, and let no man seem offended with that, which he
cannot amende: for this is certaine, that manye among the reste are of
condition so frowarde, that the more they are intreated, the more vntra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
they are founde. VVhose vaine reports touching matters of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as for the moste parte they rather proceede, from the weakenesse of
their owne natures, than from any certaine or iuste occasion, so small is
the care that ought in my iudgement to bee taken of the same: Only this
of all writers ought chiefly to be regarded, to satisfye the good opinion of
those, that either for loue to the Aucthour, or fauour to the matter,
are contented to conster eche thing to the best. Of whyche number, dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
thee to be one, I betake thee my friende to the fauour of thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and me thy welwiller, to the aduenture of thy courtesy</p>
