   <p>IF that may worthelie be iudged true, which is not onely discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by common practise; but also disfigured by holy Scripture, that where a mans treasure doth lie,
<note place="margin">Luke. 12.</note> there his heart doth liue: this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise it selfe will dispose the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to a fauorable censure, and a friendly construction of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shall eyther sound harsh in the eare, or seeme hard in the History: But bycause that some tooched with a superfluous deuotion do seeme to doubt, and other troubled with a spirit of contradiction doe sloutlie denay that in the mariage mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Gospell
<note n="a." place="margin">Iohn. 2</note> the Euangelist himselfe was the bridegroome, I haue made choice of a late writer, but very learned, who is no lesse pregnant in giuing antiquities,
<pb facs="6"/>then curious in recording them, one aduersarie so mightie, as hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the mate, all the rest may rest mute.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>Caesar Baronius</hi> the light of this,
<note place="margin">Lib. 1. pag. 121.</note> and life of former ages, in his Eeclesiasticall Historie is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that in that famous mariage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galile</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangelist was not the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome: which first confirmeth with the authoritie of
<note n="a." place="margin">Epist. ad Philan.</note>
      <hi>S. Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
      <note n="b." place="margin">lib. 1. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Ioui.</note>
      <hi>S. Hierome,</hi>
      <note n="c." place="margin">tract. vlt. in Ioa.</note>
      <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi>
      <note n="d." place="margin">in vita. 5 Ioa.</note>
      <hi>Abdias,</hi> and
<note n="e." place="margin">Heres. 58</note>
      <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius:</hi> Secondly with this reason, that doubtlesse neyther <hi>Iouinian</hi> would haue forgotten that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was maried, nor the <hi>Manichees</hi> conceale that Christ called him frō mariage, who vrged the example of <hi>S. Paul</hi> and <hi>Tecla:</hi> eyther of them hauing by this somewhat to say for themselues, the one against
<pb facs="6"/>Virginitie, the other against the Sacrament of mariage.</p>
   <p>But vnder correction of so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie an Antiquarie, neither doth <hi>S. Ignatius</hi> say otherwise, then that <hi>S. Iohn</hi>
      <note n="a." place="margin">Non de. dit operam nuptiis.</note>
      <hi>did not giue himselfe to mariage</hi> as <hi>S. Peter</hi> did, (which no man affirmeth) nor <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> then that it cannot bee prooued out of the Scriptures, that any of the Apostles were maried but <hi>Peter,</hi> (which no man denyeth) nor saint <hi>August.</hi> then that others thought that saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was neuer mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which he saith cannot be proued out of the Scripture, although it may be somewhat confirmed by this congruence, that by him that life is signified, where shalbe no mariage; but if we shall say,
<note place="margin">Apocalip. 19.21.</note> that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe mention a mariage of the Lambe, and how that euery blessed soule shalbe espoused vnto Christ,
<pb facs="7"/>that life may much better bee perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in <hi>Iohn</hi> beeing maried, and remaining chast, then if hee were not maried. As for <hi>Abdias,</hi> if his authoritie be to be reckoned of, hee saith only that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> woulde haue maried, and Saint <hi>Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> that he did not marrie, for the better vnderstanding of whom, we are to consider a custome which was among the Iewes for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</p>
   <p>VVhen a couple were to be mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a solemne meeting was made of their friendes, before whome the names of the couple were taken, &amp; the maiden afterward caried backe to her Parents house, where she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained vntill the mariage shoulde be perfected: During which time they were accounted as man and wife, in so much as if the woman did offend with any man, shee was
<pb facs="7"/>punished not as a fornicatrix, but as an adultres. Thus writeth
<note n="a." place="margin">Lib. de special. le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis.</note>
      <hi>Philo</hi> the Iew vppon his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: <hi>Thou shalt not commit Adultrie.</hi> In this sort was our B. Ladie married, who is said to haue an husband at the Incarnation of our Sauiour, &amp; as yet was in her Parents house, from <hi>Ioseph</hi> as may appeare in the text of the
<note n="b." place="margin">Mat. 1.</note> Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, vpon which place <hi>Origine</hi> in an Homilie, &amp; S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Commentarie call her <hi>Iosephs wife which shalbe.</hi>
      <note n="c." place="margin">Vxoris futurae.</note> By this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, and example we see that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse men may speak diuersly of the same matter, &amp; no contradiction betweene thē, but in words only, for so doth S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> say that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did not marry in respect that Christ altered his minde from that course of life, before that he &amp; his spouse were ech in others possession.</p>
   <pb facs="8"/>
   <p> So doth <hi>Abdias</hi> say only that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> would haue maried, had not Christ called him from that kinde of life. So dooth saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> say both
<note n="a." place="margin">Prolog. in Apoca.</note> that hee woulde haue maried, and

         </gap>th. 1. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Ioui.</note> that hee was an husband.</p>
   <p>As for <hi>Iouinian,</hi> and the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> they coulde not but see that this example did rather confute, than confirme their opinions, and therfore they had little cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, for here both virginitie was preferred before mariage, and mariage notwithstanding allowed to be good, both by our Sauiour his presence, and by that which hee did at the mariage, howsoeuer the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niches</hi> cauiled at that fact of saint <hi>Paul</hi> with <hi>Thecla.</hi>

      <hi>Nicephorus</hi> might breede a scrouple, when describing Queene <hi>Helens</hi> visitation of the holy land,
<pb facs="8"/>hee saith, that in this mariage S. <hi>Simon</hi> the Apostle was the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, but that vndertaking to certifie vs in
<note n="a." place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 44.</note> an other place, who of the Apostles were maried, he neuer nameth saint <hi>Simon,</hi> but rather leaueth some cause to thinke that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was maried: yet doth
<note n="b." place="margin">pag. 121</note>
      <hi>Caesar Baronius</hi> encline vnto him, against whome (to omit what he alleaged against vs) is his owne opinion, that verie probablie in this mariage some kinsman of Christ was the bridegroome, and no man euer said that S. <hi>Simon</hi> was our Lords kinsman, but such as vppon errour tooke saint <hi>Simon</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to be saint <hi>Simon,</hi> who succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded saint <hi>Iames</hi> at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>How much more plainly &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly doe they write, who say that saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was maried, or woulde haue maried? both which phrases
<pb facs="9"/>may be vsed indifferently of those, whose names were taken at the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne meeting of their friendes, as is shewed before by <hi>Phylo</hi> the Iew, and the example of our blessed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>

   <p>Many coniectures might also be made, why this shuld be thought <hi>Saint Iohns</hi> mariage as first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our blessed Lady was present, and as a coadiutrix: Secondly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ manifesting himselfe here first to the world by miracle, and making his Disciples thereby beleeue in him, no other Euangelist
<pb facs="10"/>would mention a thing so worthie to be recorded: Thirdly because it was most meet that a virgin a wife should be committed to a virgin a husband in keeping:
<note place="margin">Iohn. 2.19</note> Fourthly, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> only making mention as well of this mariage, as also of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to our Lady and hers to him, we are to think that he would giue vs to vnderstand, that some great misterie was begun at the one and finished at the other, as both
